The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of this novel system on growth of weeds in soybean. The system evaluated for the weed controlling ability. Also the effectiveness of WP was investigated for the preservation of irrigation water. WP covers most of the furrow surface and prevents soil from entering sunlight. In this study, WP was laid over the soil surface between rows throughout the furrow length and prevented weed germination and the growth. WP in various diameters (28, 34. 6 and 40 cm), with various covering area, was placed between the rows in which the effect of mulch was tested. The results showed that the fresh and dry weight of weeds decreased as the diameter of WP increased. The lowest fresh (3. 0 g) and dry (1. 1 g) weight of weeds were obtained from the treatment of 40 cm diameter of WP. All treatments of WP were found statistically different from the control treatment in respect to biomass accumulation. Also, the 40 cm diameter of WP contributed 11. 1 % crop yield increment compared to the control treatment. Crop yield obtained from the 34. 6 cm diameter of WP was also higher than the control treatment. However, the 28 cm diameter of WP was not much effective when compared to the control treatment in respect to crop yield. The main benefit of this system not only provides weed control but also reduces irrigation and evaporation.

40|$|Mulching, as a {{cultivation}} technique, {{has been}} adopted since {{the early twentieth century}} in agriculture for improving various aspects of crop production. However, the use of mulching was boosted by the introduction of plastic mulch, which has been reported as a harmful substance to the farm environment. Therefore, the need for an environmentally benign mulch material is obvious. The present study investigated the effects of paper and biodegradable plastic mulches on the cucumber yield, soil temperature and moisture content (at 10 cm depth), and the control of weed growth in an agricultural field located at the University of Helsinki in Southern Finland. The degradability of mulches was also investigated. The null hypothesis was that all the mulches would have a similar effect on the abovementioned aspects. Four paper mulches, i. e., BP, KB, CK, and OB, accompanied by biodegradable mulch (BIO) and a bare soil (BG) treatment were under investigation. Each of these treatments had 4 replicates, and a randomized complete block design (RCBD) was adopted. Sensors were installed at 10 cm depth in each study plot to measure the soil temperature and moisture content. In addition, the experimental plots were watered by drip irrigation. All the attained data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software. The results of the study revealed noteworthy positive effects (P< 0. 05) of mulch application on cucumber yields together with soil temperature, early fruiting, and weed growth regulation compared to the un-mulched bare ground, exclusive of soil moisture content. The daytime soil temperature (DST) was higher than at night (NST), indicating a positive association of the <b>mulch</b> <b>effect</b> with plant growth and crop earliness. However, no suggestive improvement in soil moisture was found through mulch application during the study period. Edge degradation was only found for paper mulches during the study period, suggesting their environment friendliness. The CK and KB papers were the most effective and most environmentally positive mulch materials, and could be a suitable choice for Finnish vegetable growers. The findings of this study could assist paper manufacturers in improving the qualities of mulch papers regarding vegetable production.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of mulching {{and nitrogen}} fertilizer on the soil water content, soil nitrate-N content and vertical distribution in maize root-zone. The experiment was conducted over two consecutive years and used randomly assigned field plots with three replicates. The six treatments consisted of no fertilizer without plastic film (CK), plastic film mulching with no basal fertilizer and no top dressing (MN 0), basal fertilizer with no top dressing and no mulching (BN 1), plastic film mulching and basal fertilizer with no top dressing (MN 1), basal fertilizer and top dressing with no mulching (BN 2) and plastic film mulching with basal fertilizer and top dressing (MN 2). In the top soil layers, the soil water content was a little high in the plastic film mulching than that without mulching. The mean soil water content from 0 to 40 cm without mulching were 3. 35 % lower than those measured in the corresponding mulching treatments in 31 days after sowing in 2012.

The results indicate that high contents of soil nitrate-N were mainly distributed at 0 - 20 -cm at 31 days after sowing in 2012, and the soil nitrate-N concentration in the MN 2 treatment was 1. 58 times higher than that did not receive fertilizer. The MN 2 treatment greatly increased the soil nitrate-N content in the upper layer of soil (0 - 40 -cm), and the mean soil nitrate-N content was increased nearly 50 mg kg- 1 at 105 days after sowing compared with CK treatment in 2012.

The results of this are many: (a) not cultivating reduces soil compaction, leaving old root holes to facilitate internal drainage, averts the pulverization of soil aggregates and formation of pans, reduces draft power for planting and gives shelter, winter food and nesting sites for fauna, (b) crop residues on the surface practically eliminate wind and water erosion, reduce soil moisture loss through the <b>mulch</b> <b>effect,</b> slow spring warm-up (possibly offset by a lower specific heat demand with less water retention in surface soil) and act as a reserve of organically-compounded nutrients (as they decompose to humus), (c) more SOM means higher available water and nutrient retention, higher biological activity year round (enhancing biological controls), higher levels of water-stable aggregates and a positive carbon sink in incremental SOM. The positive impacts for society are: (i) more and cheaper food, (ii) reduced flood and drought-induced famine risks, (iii) a positive carbon sink in SOM and possible reductions in NO 2 emissions, (iv) cleaner water and greater aquifer recharge due to reduced runoff, (v) cleaner air through effective elimination of dust as a product of cultivation (vi) less water pollution and greater aquifer recharge from reduced rainfall runoff, (vii) farm diesel consumption halved, (viii) reduced demand for (tropical) de-forestation, by permitting crop expansion on steeper lands, (ix) increased wildlife populations (skylarks, plovers, partridge and peccaries) and (x) an improved conservation mindset in farmers. It is notable that, in spite of successful practitioners in all European countries, mainstream adoption is still to come: Europe 0 s ZT/CA area is 1. 35 million hectares, while the world area is now some 125 million and growing at a rate of 7 million hectares per year. More scientific measurements of the benefits of this system are required, both to assist adoption and to trigger policy measures. In the EEC, CAP reform (greening) needs to consider making environmental services payments for these social benefits since a reduction in single farm payments is ineluctable and carbon footprint reduction is of the essence, in the face of constantly-rising fuel prices and the need to cut GHG emissions.

5|$|Ash {{accumulation}} {{will also}} affect pasture, plants and trees which {{are part of}} the horticulture and agriculture industries. Thin ash falls (<20 mm) may put livestock off eating, and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth. There may be an increase in pasture production due to a <b>mulching</b> <b>effect</b> and slight fertilizing effect, such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995/96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions. Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation. Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness, ash chemistry, compaction of ash, amount of rainfall, duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall. The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH, which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil’s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive. Ash will also impact upon arable crops, such as fruit, vegetables and grain. Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality, contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading.|$|R

40|$|The use of crop {{residues}} (CR) {{has been widely}} reported {{as a means of}} increasing crop yields across West Africa. However, little has been done to compare the magnitude and mechanisms of CR effects systematically in the different agro-ecological zones of the region. To this end, a series of field trials with millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], and maize (Zea mays L.) was conducted over a 4 -yr period in the Sahelian, Sudanian, and Guinean zones of West Africa. Soils ranged in pH from 4. 1 to 5. 4 along a rainfall gradient from 510 to 1300 mm. Treatments in the factorial experiments were three CR rates (0, 500, and 2000 kg ha^- 1) and several levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. The results showed CR-induced total dry matter (TDM) increases in cereals up to 73 % for the Sahel compared with a maximum of 16 % in the wetter Sudanian and Guinean zones. Residue effects on weakly buffered Sahelian soils were due to improved P availability and to a protection of seedlings against wind erosion. Additional <b>effects</b> of CR <b>mulching</b> on topsoil properties in the Sahel were a decrease in peak temperatures by 4 °C and increased water availability. These <b>mulch</b> <b>effects</b> on soil chemical and physical properties strongly decreased from North to South. Likely explanations for this decrease are the decline of dust deposition and wind erosion hazards, the higher soil clay content, lower air temperature, and a faster decomposition rate of mulch material with increasing rainfall from the Sahel to the Sudanian and Guinean zones...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{combined}} impacts of fire and straw mulching, a widely used post‐fire emergency measure, on the soil nitrogen (N) cycle. Unburnt (US) and severely‐burnt soils without (BS) and with straw mulching (BSM) were preincubated (3 and 6 months) in the laboratory before fire and <b>mulching</b> <b>effects</b> on gross N transformations were investigated with a paired 15 N‐labelling experiment. The ammonium‐to‐nitrate (NH 4 +/NO 3 ‐) ratio of burnt soils decreased with preincubation time from 21 to 1. 3, consistent with a shift of the N cycle towards net nitrification. After 3 months of preincubation, gross mineralisation (MSON) and gross NH 4 + immobilisation (INH 4) in BS more than doubled compared to US, in the latter being MSON 4. 82 mg N kg‐ 1 day‐ 1 and INH 4 3. 01 mg N kg‐ 1 day‐ 1. Mulching partly mitigated this stimulation in the mineralisation‐immobilisation turnover (MIT). After 6 months, MIT differences among treatments disappeared and gross rates approached those in US after 3 months. After three months, autotrophic nitrification (NH 4 + oxidation) in all treatments was 0. 41 ‐ 0. 52 N kg‐ 1 day‐ 1, while after 6 months it remained similar in US but increased 8 ‐fold in burnt soils. Heterotrophic nitrification of organic N only occurred in burnt soils, and its importance was similar to autotrophic nitrification after 3 months, but around 4 ‐fold lower after 6 months. To conclude, burning opened up the N cycle and NO 3 ‐ accumulated, increasing the potential for ecosystem N losses. In the short term, straw mulching slightly mitigates the effects of fire on the N cycle. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{shortage}} is {{the main}} problem in Heilonggang lower-lying plain, while {{a considerable amount of}} underground saline water is available. We wanted to find an effective way to use the brackish water in winter wheat production. Surface <b>mulch</b> has significant <b>effect</b> in reducing evaporation and decreasing soil salinity level. This research was aimed at comparing the <b>effect</b> of different <b>mulch</b> materials on winter wheat production. The experiment was conducted during 2002 ~ 2003 and 2003 ~ 2004. Four treatments were setup: (1) no mulch, (2) mulch with plastic film, (3) mulch with corn straw, (4) mulch with concrete slab between the rows. The result indicated that concrete mulch and straw mulch was effective in conserving soil water compared to plastic film mulch which increased soil temperature. Concrete mulch decreases surface soil salinity better in comparison to other mulches used. Straw mulch conserved more soil water but decreased wheat grain yield probably due to low temperature. Concrete <b>mulch</b> had similar <b>effect</b> with plastic film mulch on promoting winter wheat development and growth...|$|R
40|$|A two-year {{research}} {{was carried out}} in 2004 - 2005 in order to evaluate the effects of biodegradable green mulch on melon (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus Naud.) yield and quality. The loss of quality due to the presence of spot caused by the residues of biodegradable plastics was also investigated. The {{research was}} conducted over two years, in open field, at S. Piero a Grado, Pisa, Italy, (lat. 43. 67498, long. 10. 34737), from the beginning of May to the end of July of each year. The films tested in the first year experiment were two biodegradable ones with different colours (black and green) compared with a low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film, while in 2005 three biodegradable films, (two green and one black) were compared with a traditional LDPE film. The two green biodegradable films had different properties related to the biodegradation rate, faster in film Cv 205, because of a different degree of Mater Bi polymer inside the film. In each year a randomized block design with four replications was followed. Green biodegradable films allowed obtaining a higher yield than LDPE films maybe because of the higher soil temperatures reached, and excellent fruit quality, especially for the soluble solids content and the ripening process. At the same time, the presence of residues on the fruit skin was rather low because of the degradation of films occurred at the ripening time. In the first year, the percentage of spotted fruits was low for every kind of film, while in the second one the green film showed a higher presence of residues on skin compared with the black one. The biodegradable materials covered the soil for the whole crop cycle with a good <b>mulching</b> <b>effect,</b> and the successive degradation allowed to avoid the removal and disposal of plastic film, with a certain economic advantage...|$|R

Measured daily soil temperature amplitudes at 0. 04 m depth were about 2. 5 ºC during an 8 -day period in December 1995. Simulated amplitudes were 12 ºC with the original ENWATBAL model (configured for a bare soil) and 3. 5 ºC with the mulch-enhanced model. The root mean square error between hourly measured and simulated soil temperatures was 4. 1 ºC using the original ENWATBAL model and 1. 1 ºC using the mulch-enhanced model. Measured soil temperatures lagged behind those simulated, indicating that conduction may be an important process of heat transfer through the mulch. Two solution methods were tested: an iterative solution for mulch and soil surface temperatures implicit in the energy balance equations, and a linearized explicit solution of the energy balances. The latter method was 50 times faster than the iterative method without compromising accuracy; the largest linearization error was only 0. 01 ºC.

40|$|Plastic film (FM) {{and gravel}} {{mulching}} (GM) {{have been used}} extensively to increase dryland agricultural productivity. Understanding <b>mulching</b> <b>effects</b> on nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen dynamics is important for optimizing N management strategies. A 3 -year field experiment {{was performed on the}} Loess Plateau of China to investigate the GM and FM effects on plant N accumulation, N translocation, N harvest index (NHI), NUE and soil NO 3 (-) -N dynamics in dryland maize fields. Compared with the control (CK, non-mulching), the mulching treatments markedly promoted plant N accumulation and especially maintained higher N uptake rates during the post-silking stage. At harvest, the total N accumulation was 12. 8 - 41. 2 and 33. 2 - 55. 8 % higher in the GM and FM treatments, respectively, than in the CK treatment. The NHIs of the mulching treatments were significantly higher by 9. 6 - 32. 4 % than the CK treatment, primarily due to greater N translocation and N accumulation post-silking. Overall, compared with the CK treatment, the GM and FM NUEs increased significantly by 17. 1 and 28. 3 % in 2010, 70. 3 and 87. 6 % in 2011, and 16. 7 and 38. 2 % in 2012, respectively. In the wet years of 2010 and 2011, the increased amount of soil NO 3 (-) -N in the 100 - 200 cm layer after harvest was 27. 1 - 57. 1 and 47. 9 - 85. 7 % lower in the GM and FM treatments, respectively, than in the CK treatment, indicating a lower NO 3 (-) -N leaching loss. These results suggest that mulching (especially FM) is an effective measure for increasing NUE and grain yield and decreasing N leaching loss in dry farmland...|$|R

40|$|Crop residue {{management}} (RM) {{plays an}} important role in maintaining soilorganic carbon (SOC) in horticulture, especially where annual crop rotations rely on frequent tillage. A trial investigating the short-term effects of sweet corn (Zea mays L. var. rugosa) residue incorporation on crop yields in a corn-cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) rotation using organic (Org) and conventional (Conv) soil management systems (SMS) was established on 14 December 2009 in two contrasting soil types (Vertosol and Chromosol). The <b>effect</b> of <b>mulched</b> corn residue incorporation on weed biomass production was also studied. Corn was grown under the two SMS and residue was retained (+RES) or removed (-RES) after harvest on 23 April 2010. Cabbage was then grown from 4 May to 14 October 2010, under the same SMS in a three-way factorial design (SMS × RM × soil type). In both systems, equal quantities of macro-nutrients were supplied. Crop yields and weed biomass and apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of soil were measured. There was no significant difference in total corn biomass for SMS or soil type. However, cabbage yield was significantly greater at the Chromosol site. The SMS × RM × soil type interaction was significant for weed biomass in cabbage, with Org having less weed biomass at the Vertosol site, especially in -RES. The +RES treatment had reduced weed biomass by 20 and 64 % in conventional and organic SMS, respectively, in comparison to -RES in Chromosol. Soil ECa was significantly different for soil type only. The reduction of weed biomass in +RES treatment could be attributed to the <b>mulching</b> <b>effect</b> of the incorporated corn residue, the differences in weed seed bank and drainage between two sites. In conclusion, crop yields and soil ECa were not influenced by SMS or RM in short-term, but incorporation of residue in soil reduced weed biomass...|$|R
