25|$|On August 28, 1943, Stanley Lovell {{was asked}} to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> {{in front of a}} not very {{friendly}} audience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, since the U.S. top brass were largely skeptical of all OSS plans beyond collecting military intelligence and were ready to split the OSS between the Army and the Navy. While explaining the purpose and mission of his department and introducing various gadgets and tools, he reportedly casually dropped into a waste basket a Hedy, a panic-inducing explosive device {{in the shape of a}} firecracker, which shortly produced a loud shrieking sound followed by a deafening boom. The presentation was interrupted and did not resume since everyone in the room fled. In reality, the Hedy, jokingly named after Hollywood movie star Hedy Lamarr for her ability to distract men, later saved the lives of some trapped OSS operatives.|$|E

25|$|Before the 3rd Test against India in March 2013, {{the team}} {{management}} of Michael Clarke, {{who was also}} a selector at the time, and coach Mickey Arthur, dropped four players from the 3rd test, which included vice-captain Shane Watson, along with James Pattinson, Mitchell Johnson and Usman Khawaja for failing to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> on team performance. Watson had subsequently flown back to Australia due to the birth of his first child. Michael Clarke and coach Mickey Arthur were severely criticized and ridiculed by the public, media and former players for such a silly decision. Watson returned to the team for the fourth and final test of the series, and captained the test side (due to an injury to Clarke) for the only time in his career. After the tour, Watson resigned as vice-captain, while Cricket Australia sacked Mickey Arthur as coach and stripped Michael Clarke as a selector in the following weeks.|$|E

[...] "Instead of calling up the {{companies}} and asking them how much they would pay Michael Jordan, we called them up {{and asked them to}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> and explain what they could do to promote him. Needless to say, this got a lot of quizzical replies." [...] Unbeknownst to Falk and Jordan, Nike had decided to target Jordan as their player of the future. [...] Jordan himself was initially reticent; throughout college he had worn Converse because of the company's endorsement deal with Tar Heels coach Dean Smith, and off the court, he wore Adidas. [...] Jordan had never worn or even seen a Nike shoe before the company contacted him.|$|E
500|$|The people {{chosen to}} present the trophies were {{dependent}} on the race order, with Daimler-Benz chairman Jürgen Schrempp only willing to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation</b> to a McLaren-Mercedes driver. As the McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard passed Villeneuve's Williams on the last lap, this would have meant he could present either the trophy for first or second position or the winning constructor trophy. There was some confusion due to the late changes in position and whilst the Mayor {{and the president of}} the region presented trophies, Schrempp did nothing. FIA president Max Mosley later announced [...] "The disruption caused embarrassment and inconvenience to those presenting the trophies and therefore, no further rounds of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship will be held at the Jerez circuit." [...] As of 2017, this race was the last time that Jerez hosted a Formula One Grand Prix, although it held many pre-season test days.|$|E

500|$|He {{also built}} a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the {{foundation}} of the Pyramid which he called the [...] "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off and on {{for the next five years}} whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted that he seemed to just [...] "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged [...] high and [...] long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation.</b> Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.|$|E

60|$|On which Strether {{saw that}} Chad was again at hand, and he {{afterwards}} scarce knew, absurd {{as it may}} seem, what had then quickly occurred. The moment concerned him, he felt, more deeply than he could have explained, {{and he had a}} subsequent passage of speculation as to whether, on walking off with Chad, he hadn't looked either pale or red. The only thing he was clear about was that, luckily, nothing indiscreet had in fact been said and that Chad himself was more than ever, in Miss Barrace's great sense, wonderful. It was one of the connexions--though really why it should be, after all, was none so apparent--in which the whole change in him came out as most striking. Strether recalled as they approached the house that he had impressed him that first night as knowing how to enter a box. Well, he impressed him scarce less now as knowing how to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>presentation.</b> It did something for Strether's own quality--marked it as estimated; so that our poor friend, conscious and passive, really seemed to feel himself quite handed over and delivered; absolutely, as he would have said, made a present of, given away. As they reached the house a young woman, about to come forth, appeared, unaccompanied, on the steps; at the exchange with whom of a word on Chad's part Strether immediately perceived that, obligingly, kindly, she was there to meet them. Chad had left her in the house, but she had afterwards come halfway and then the next moment had joined them in the garden. Her air of youth, for Strether, was at first almost disconcerting, while his second impression was, not less sharply, a degree of relief at there not having just been, with the others, any freedom used about her. It was upon him at a touch that she was no subject for that, and meanwhile, on Chad's introducing him, she had spoken to him, very simply and gently, in an English clearly of the easiest to her, yet unlike any other he had ever heard. It wasn't as if she tried; nothing, he could see after they had been a few minutes together, was as if she tried; but her speech, charming correct and odd, was like a precaution against her passing for a Pole. There were precautions, he seemed indeed to see, only when there were really dangers.|$|E
