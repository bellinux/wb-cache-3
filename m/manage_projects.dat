500|$|The World Bank loaned India {{funds for}} development, and Mayawati was to <b>manage</b> <b>{{projects}}</b> with this money in UP. The projects were preplanned and on schedule, but the Mayawati government made changes which put the projects behind schedule, including rapidly transferring high-caste managers {{in and out}} of rural posts. The World Bank sent a letter of complaint on 1 August 2002 to India's central government stating, [...] "We have now learnt that project managers have been replaced within three weeks of assuming office. The project coordinator of the Diversified Agriculture Support Project has been changed twice in quick succession and at the moment there is no project coordinator. In the forestry project, numerous changes have been made over the past six months ... Such developments do not augur well for these time-bound projects that require consistently good leadership." [...] Mayawati initially responded by saying the letter was a fake and later said there had been a misunderstanding. She then decreased the number of transfers, stopped creating new posts, and temporarily reduced the level of government spending on furniture and vehicles in response to the allegations. The World Bank continued to criticise the level of corruption even after these measures had been implemented.|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{of species}} is challenging, {{and there is}} {{continuing}} interest in finding more effective means to achieve conservation goals. State provision of conservation occurs in many countries, alongside a growing range of alternative providers including Not For Profit organisations and the private sector. Few studies have compared the effectiveness and efficiency of State provision against Not For Profit or private sector provision. This research assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multiple-species projects {{in regard to the}} conservation of threatened and endangered species using a cost-utility analysis. Three State <b>managed</b> <b>projects,</b> three Not For Profit <b>managed</b> <b>projects</b> and one <b>project</b> <b>managed</b> by the State yet funded privately, were evaluated. All of the Not For Profit <b>managed</b> <b>projects</b> were enclosed by predator-proof fences, while the other projects relied on natural barriers and/or intensive predator control methods. Results indicate that State <b>managed</b> multiple-species <b>projects</b> are both more effective and cost-effective than those <b>projects</b> <b>managed</b> by Not For Profits. While the Not For Profit <b>managed</b> <b>projects</b> are not so effective in improving national population totals, they are essential for ensuring regional biodiversity of threatened and endangered species. The objectives set by the projects appear to {{have a significant impact on}} their outputs. A number of recommendations are made for improving conservation efforts in the future. Most importantly, the development of a threatened and endangered species database to be contributed to by all conservation project providers. The importance of standardised reporting techniques is highlighted to allow comparisons both over time and between projects.
