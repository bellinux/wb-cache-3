The intention of the extension was to avoid a legal gap between the close of LIFE III at the end of 2004, and the adoption of new EU financial perspectives in 2007. The proposal for an extension of the programme was based on the positive assessment reached in a <b>mid-term</b> <b>evaluation</b> report.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of USAID funded farming systems research projects must {{play an important}} role in the design of future projects if one is to build on past experience to improve project performance. The development of an institutional memory is particularly important as FSR is new and still taking shape.

30|$|Currently the EU RTD {{evaluation}} practices {{comprise of}} continuous monitoring, 5  year assessments and <b>mid-term</b> <b>evaluations.</b> They are characterised {{by a strong}} focus on monitoring compared to impact assessment, on projects and programmes rather than the broad policy context, and a heavy reliance on expert panels rather than studies. Also, there is a constraint imposed by the limited time and financial resources devoted to evaluation (EC Joint Research Centre (2002) RTD Evaluation Toolbox. [URL] Georghiou and Polt [10] detail {{that in terms of}} evaluation on a European level, ‘there is no single model of good practice’, but peer reviews and expert groups are used for evaluation processes. This is also emphasised by Durieux and Fayl [6], who state that the most important means within the evaluation of European RTD programmes are independent expert panels, interviews, questionnaires and core indicators. The panels are made up of people with high levels of responsibility in the field, which in practice results in a balance of experts with either an industrial or an academic background [6]. Experts are selected by the Commission {{on the basis of their}} experience and knowledge of community research policy, which indicates that they will be drawn primarily from the knowledge sector. Efforts are also made to ensure a balance among different sectors of the research community as well as a geographic spread of evaluators.|$|R
