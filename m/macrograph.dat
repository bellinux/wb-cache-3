Rajamouli announced that Prabhas will star in his upcoming movie. In January 2013, he announced that the working title as Baahubali and the actual film production started at Rock Gardens in Kurnool on 6 July 2013. The waterfall scenes in the film were shot at Athirappilly Falls in Kerala, huge sets for the Mahishmati kingdom were constructed at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad and the snow episodes in the film were shot in Bulgaria. The screen writer, K. V. Vijayendra Prasad who wrote stories for most of Rajamouli's films once again penned the story for Baahubali. The film boasts of one year pre production work where in 15,000 story board sketches for the film were created which is highest for any Indian Film till date. More than 90 percent of the film had visually enhanced shots {{and according to the}} producer, more than 600 VFX artists worked for the film from 18 facilities around the world led by Makuta VFX and Firefly in Hyderabad, Prasad Studios in Hyderabad and Chennai, Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad, Tau Films in Malaysia, and Dancing Digital Animation and <b>Macrograph</b> in South Korea. Makuta VFX which had prior experience of working with S.S.Rajamouli was chosen as principal visual effects studio. The cinematography of the movie was done by KK Senthil Kumar for 380 days using Arri Alexa XT camera with Master Prime lens marking Rajamouli's first film using digital camera. Most of the film was shot in ARRIRAW format in 4:3 aspect ratio while ARRIRAW 16.9 was used for slow motion shots at 120 fps. Open Gate format, which can utilise the full 3.4K sensor in the camera to produce frames larger than the standard ARRIRAW format was tapped in to get the maximum image quality in VFX shots. For the first time in Indian movies, 4K movie print was rendered with an aspect ratio of 1:1.88 as compared to Cinemascope at 1:2.35 to get the best cinematic experience in screens that support the 4K projection claimed the Producer. Sabu Cyril, production designer for the film created 10,000 different kinds of weaponry ranging from swords, helmets and armors required for the soldiers. To make the swords light weight Carbon-fibre was used instead of steel, the same material used in manufacture of Helicopter blades claimed the art director. 3D printing technology was used to create the head of 100 foot Bhallaladeva's character in the movie and flexi foam was used to create amours to make them light weight and to have the look of leather. V. Srinivas Mohan was chosen as visual effects supervisor and Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao was the Editor. PM Satheesh was the sound designer and Peter Hein was responsible for the action sequences.

It {{is especially true in}} the case of multipass welds when the remelting process after each pass causes complex solidification process. With the new model MINA (Modelling anisotropy from Notebook of Arc welding) we show that we are able to predict thoroughly grains orientations. This model has been validated with microstructural analysis and ultrasonic measurements. With these orientations we define a precise description of the heterogeneous and anisotropic material. Grain orientation give the Cartesian coordinates system in which we expressed the elastic constants. Incorporating this description in an ultrasonic propagation code allows simulating ultrasonic inspection. Comparisons are made with previous models given by several authors. The reference grain structure is obtained by <b>macrograph</b> analysis. Different propagations of the elastic waves induced by a modification of the evolution of the grains orientations are shown.

Due to the increase in the demand of high strength and low weight components in different manufacturing applications, {{there is a need for}} using pure aluminium and its alloys in lap configuration. Research studies are required to characterize and obtain optimum process parameters, which can be used to produce good quality lap welds. This paper reports lap welded 1050 Aluminium Alloy using friction stir welding process and established the effect of rotational speed on the joint integrity of the welds. The welds were produced by varying the rotational speed in the range of 1200 and 2000 rpm, and maintaining the traverse speed constant at 150 mm/min. The welds were characterized through microstructural evaluation, microhardness profiling and tensile testing in order to determine the joint integrity of the welds. The results from the <b>macrograph</b> of the welded joints, show a basin shaped nugget resulting from the stirring of the tool during the welding process. Fine and equiaxed grains characterized the microstructure in the stirred zone, which was a result of a dynamic recrystallization. The tensile test data revealed that as the tool rotational speed was increased, the fracture strength also increases, the highest value of the fracture strength was 195 N/mm and was found on the welds produced at 2000 rpm.

Welding processes involve localized heating which in turn give rise to thermal stresses and distortion. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state joining process where temperatures below melting are experienced. Nonetheless, some degree of thermal heating and consequently thermal stresses develop at the joint. This study aims to quantify the stresses developed in friction stir welding of mild steel DH 36 plates, through an experimental and numerical investigation. The temperatures and transient strains developed during FSW, are experimentally measured and used to validate thermo-elastoplastic numerical models. These models are used to investigate the evolution of thermal stresses and distortion for different welding parameters. This study was being funded by the European Commission in call FP 7 -SST- 2012 -RTD- 1 under the project titled High Integrity Low Distortion Assembly ‚Äì HILDA. peer-reviewe...|$|R
