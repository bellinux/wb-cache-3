500|$|On Sunday, October 1, 2017, Morgan {{was one of}} a {{group of}} fellow athletes visiting Epcot in Orlando, Florida, who were {{described}} in an incident filed by police as being [...] "impaired and verbally aggressive....toward staff and around guests". The group, including Morgan, were removed from the park for [...] "trespass" [...] and no charges were filed. According to a deputy, Morgan was [...] "yelling, screaming and....appeared to be highly impaired".

5000|$|Returning the Rover, {{they drove}} 650 ft (200 m) {{to a large}} boulder. Even walking short {{distances}} on the slope was time consuming so {{it was easier to}} just have the crew use the Rover to get there. The boulder was 10 ft (3 m) across. It was necessary for one crewmember to stay by the Rover, holding <b>it</b> to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not slide down the hill, which was now had a 15-degree slope. With time running out on the stop, Scott was able to confirm what Irwin had seen earlier [...] - [...] the rock had a greenish tinge. The color was found to come from magnesium oxide.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1996 the European Directive No. 89/336/EEC (known as the EMC Directive) {{came into}} force from the European Union. This meant that all {{electronic}} equipment sold {{had to be}} tested to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not emit excessive electromagnetic interference. If the product passed the test it was issued with the CE mark. Trading Standards officers could fine a company £5,000 {{that did not have}} a CE mark on an electronic product. The CE mark was originally going to be needed for electronic equipment from January 1992, and from January 1993 the DTI spent £450,000 informing companies about the change in legislation, spending another £100,000 after January 1996. The legislation was passed in early 1992.|$|R

Harley goes to great lengths to kill the creature, in order to save his concert from being cancelled, but Simon thinks that the creature is just protecting its territory from trespassers. Harley assembles a team of hunters and mercenaries to track down Bigfoot. A group of men and women try to capture Bigfoot on camera, but all of them get killed.|$|E
50|$|The best {{solution}} {{in this case}} is to use a whitelist of accepted language parameters. If a strong method of input validation such as a whitelist cannot be used, then rely upon input filtering or validation of the passed-in path to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not contain unintended characters and character patterns. However, this may require anticipating all possible problematic character combinations. A safer solution is to use a predefined Switch/Case statement to determine which file to include rather than use a URL or form parameter to dynamically generate the path.|$|E

However, after Israel's November seven-day [...] "Operation Pillar of Defense" [...] military actions against Hamas, Falk claimed [...] "there arose an urgent need to investigate Israel’s seemingly deliberate attacks against civilian targets." [...] After visiting Palestinian survivors of military attacks, Falk stated that [...] "some attacks killed and harmed civilians in a grossly disproportionate manner and thus appear to violate international law." [...] He called today on Israel [...] "to abide by and fully implement the cease fire agreement" [...] and called on the international agreement to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> so.|$|R
5000|$|The raids were {{referred}} to on both sides as [...] "Baedeker raids", derived from a comment by a German propagandist. Baron Gustav Braun von Stumm, {{a spokesman for the}} German Foreign Office, is reported to have said on 24 April 1942, [...] "We shall go out and bomb every building in Britain marked with three stars in the Baedeker Guide", a reference to the popular travel guides of that name. Goebbels was furious; keen to brand British attacks as [...] "terror bombing", he was equally keen to designate German efforts as [...] "retaliatory measures". Stumm's off-the-cuff remark [...] "effectively admitted the Germans were targetting cultural and historic targets, just what the German leadership did not want to do, and Goebbels took steps to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not happen again".|$|R
5000|$|Calverley was retroactively {{declared}} the men's basketball season scoring leader for 1944. But Calverely was most notable for one particular shot. Dubbed the [...] "shot heard round the world", {{it was a}} midcourt shot from 62 feet away, as time expired at Madison Square Garden in the 1946 National Invitation Tournament against Bowling Green {{to tie the game}} and send it to overtime. Even after fifty years, he stated that he didn't think it was going to go in, as he had to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not hit the scoreboard while shooting with both hands. Rhode Island State (now known as Rhode Island) would win 82-79 in overtime to send them to the semifinal round. The Rams would eventually lose in the NIT final against Adolph Rupp's Kentucky Wildcats by one point. Not soon after, Calverly would join the BAA.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after Gusinsky left Russia, CEO of Gazprom Media Alfred Koch, {{asked the}} Russian Prosecutor General {{to launch a}} new {{investigation}} against Gusinsky and Media Most, alleging improper use of Gazprom’s guarantees to attract credits (at that time Gazprom was a shareholder of 12.5% of Media Most and 30% of NTV). Prosecutor General Office asked Interpol's head office in Lyon, to issue an international arrest warrant for Gusinsky’s detention and extradition. Interpol's head office declined the Russian request asking to clarify the reason to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not violate Interpol Charter, that forbids intervention based on political character. Eventually Interpol firmly refused to issue any warrant of arrest for Gusinsky, and when Russian authorities appealed the refusal the Interpol headquarters firmly upheld their refusal.|$|E
50|$|SMS {{marketing}} services typically run off a short code, but sending text messages to an {{email address is}} another methodology (though this method is {{not supported by the}} carriers). Short codes are 5 or 6 digit numbers that have been assigned by all the mobile operators in a given country especially for the use of brand campaign and other consumer services. Due to the high price of short codes of $500-$1000 a month, many small businesses opt to share a short code in order to reduce monthly costs. The mobile operators vet every short code application before provisioning and monitor the service to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not diverge from its original service description. Another alternative to sending messages by short code or email is to do so through one's own dedicated phone number.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the locking {{techniques}} used in most modern multithreaded applications, STM is often very optimistic: a thread completes modifications to shared memory {{without regard for}} what other threads might be doing, recording every read and write that it is performing in a log. Instead of placing the onus on the writer to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not adversely affect other operations in progress, it {{is placed on the}} reader, who after completing an entire transaction verifies that other threads have not concurrently made changes to memory that it accessed in the past. This final operation, in which the changes of a transaction are validated and, if validation is successful, made permanent, is called a commit. A transaction may also abort at any time, causing all of its prior changes to be rolled back or undone. If a transaction cannot be committed due to conflicting changes, it is typically aborted and re-executed from the beginning until it succeeds.|$|E

50|$|The {{final and}} {{successful}} erection event {{was organized by}} Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, {{it could have been}} done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15° had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.|$|R
5000|$|While Minister of Inchinnan, he {{took part}} in {{agitation}} {{in response to the}} granting to Roman Catholics of some relief from legal restrictions under which they suffered at the time. He signed a proclamation in Glasgow newspapers, {{in the name of the}} Minister, Elders and Heads of Families of the Parish of Inchinnan, denouncing [...] "the unchristian spirit and savage cruelties of Popery", declaring that [...] "we desire to see no Papist suffering ... for conscience sake, nor for his speculative opinions, however absurd or erroneous, while he lives quietly and inoffensively, and does not attempt in any manner of way to seduce or pervert others". However, they would not submit to allowing Popish priests, [...] "ever zealous and artful ... to teach and preach openly, and with impunity, in a Protestant country" [...] They threatened to [...] "use every legal and constitutional measure in our power" [...] to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not happen. This was part of widespread opposition, including the Gordon Riots of the following year, but the Relief Act had already been passed in Parliament.

50|$|Time is {{responsible}} for scheduling all human events {{to make sure everything}} runs smoothly, and the natural laws like cause and effect are honoured. He works most closely with Fate, helping her to fix crossed threads, caused by human error or simply random chance. He also schedules notable births and deaths, important events in people's lives and in history, and makes sure the flow of time remains stable when it is bent, as it is by his allowance that the other Incarnations are also capable of local timestops. He is also responsible for guaranteeing that the course of history flows as it should. As Time, he is immune to paradox, and to the possibility of multiple futures. Should actions occur to change the course of the future, his memories will change with it. However, typically his original memories are accepted as the desirable ones, as one of his major tasks is to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not get changed around without adequate reason. This is, of course, why he lives backwards - he would be unable to properly deal with making the future happen as planned if he was unaware of the plan.|$|E
5000|$|S. musiva {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} more and more common in the hybrid poplar population. What used to be isolated in Northern Canada has spread into the North of the United States including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Maine, and North Dakota. Since the disease is wind borne, it is easily transmitted. It is described as being endemic. [...] Septoria is a relatively common fungus with over 1000 different variations. [...] S. musiva will spread rapidly if not contained. It has established itself in the North and Northeast of the country, the likely US origin being Wisconsin and spreading out from there. There is a major concern to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not reach Europe, as it will likely take over the native poplars very quickly there. The pathogen can be cultured in a lab, however to really study its effects you must be able to observe it in nature. Studies are often focused on an infected selection of poplar trees for about five years. In study conditions, scientists transfer the disease by moving the cuttings of infected poplar trees. S. musiva {{does not appear to have}} any disease that attacks it, however, when it attacks a poplar it leaves the poplar open to a multitude of pernicious secondary infections.|$|E
30|$|Selection of the knobs in Table 1 {{is limited}} to the {{controllable}} parameters of IEEE 802.11 g interfaces in the test environment which will be described in Section 3.1. 1.

The 1470 UDP packet size is used to avoid fragmentation of the packets.|$|E
50|$|Recently trained {{transport}} {{security officers}} (TSOs) examined test images of bags {{with and without}} inserted threat images; threats were inserted at low and high prevalence rates. Research has found that a period of high-prevalence testing with good feedback to the observer reduces the miss rate for a subsequent period of low prevalence with poor feedback, so a feedback task was introduced between bothe experiments.Miss error rates were higher at low prevalence than at high, although they provided feedback for the high-prevalence task. The feedback, rather than the prevalence manipulation, may have changed the TSOs’ behavior in the final test. Feedback magnifies the effects of prevalence by giving the searcher information about prevalence. If prevalence alters the behavior of TSOs, it may be counteracted. In laboratory settings, the effect appears resistant {{to a number of}} attempted solutions. One solution would be to raise the prevalence rate to 50 percent by adding threat-image projections (TIP) to half of the bags. The time required to clear a bag with a TIP is greater than that required to clear a bag without one, and the bag would need to be re-scanned without the TIP to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not obscure a real target.|$|R

40|$|What {{if someone}} argued {{that one of}} your basic conceptions about how to develop {{software}} was misguided? What would it take to change your mind? That's essentially the dilemma faced by advocates of test-driven development (TDD). The TDD paradigm argues that the basic cycle of developing code and then testing it to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> what it's supposed to do-something drilled into most of us from the time we began learning software development- isn't the most effective approach. TDD replaces the traditional "code then test" cycle. First, you develop test cases for a small increment of functionality; then you write code that makes those tests run correctly. After each increment, you refactor the code to maintain code quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{death of}} young people, {{regardless}} of the cause, is dev-astating, {{and its effect on}} families and society is tragic and incalculable. No good can come from this tragedy. Or can it? Prevention of sudden unexplained death (SUD) in the young may be achievable but remains a challenge because the major-ity of deaths occur without prior symptoms or a family his-tory of sudden death 1 or at least without recognition of these symptoms and their connection to sudden death. Although we hotly debate the issue of electrocardiographic screening in the young, we cannot miss the high-yield screening opportunities that occur {{as a consequence of the}} tragedy of young people’s sudden death. We must approach each of these deaths with an investigative mindset and the availability of resources that one would approach a criminal investigation.

40|$|Diabetes Mellitus {{or simply}} {{diabetes}} is a chronic metabolic disease that affects about 5 % {{of the world}} population. The increasing rate of diabetes patients is a serious challenge {{that needs to be}} controlled worldwide. Management of diabetes involves monitoring blood sugar level to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not go beyond the normal range. Failure to monitor the level of glucose in diabetes patients can increase the risk of complications like hypertension, stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, skin, foot, and eye complications, etc. However, healthcare delivery cost can be reduced by using telemedicine applications that focus on monitoring patients from outside the clinics or hospitals. This paper proposes a framework of a low-cost telemedicine system based on GPRS, SMS and NFC technologies, for remote monitoring patients with diabetes. The solution presented in this paper is especially useful for developing countries, where Internet data connection may not be available everywhere, even though GSM network can be found in almost every place. Another advantage of this system is patients with basic phone (no Internet capability) can also benefit from it, by using SMS as an alternative means of sending data to healthcare centre. Finally, we envisage the decrease in the cost of monitoring diabetes patients when this system is developed and implemented...|$|E
25|$|Worship and temples {{appear to}} have been {{routinely}} offered by Greeks to their Roman governors, with varied reactions. Cicero declined a temple proposed by the city officials of Roman Asia to his brother and himself, while the latter was proconsul, to avoid jealousy from other Romans; when Cicero himself was Governor of Cilicia, he claimed to have accepted no statues, shrines, or chariots. His predecessor, Appius Claudius Pulcher, was so pleased, however, when the Cilicians built a temple to him that, when it was not finished at the end of Claudius' year in office, Claudius wrote Cicero to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> was <b>done,</b> and complaining that Cicero was not active enough in the matter.|$|R

5000|$|Crum's term as sheriff of Mingo County was brief, {{but made}} a huge impact. Within the 93 days that Crum was the Sheriff of Mingo County, he had 57 felony drug convictions. According to the Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury, Crum had done {{more than any other}} sheriff of Mingo County within the {{previous}} 30 years and he had made more indictments than Mingo County had seen in the previous eight years. As sheriff, Crum was determined {{to put a stop to}} illegal drug trafficking in the county. As a sign of dedication to Mingo County and to his passion in law enforcement, Crum would eat his lunch in his official cruiser every day, just to observe a pill mill that had been shut down a few years before to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not open again. Even before Crum took office as sheriff in January, he worked day and night making arrests and obtaining indictments, while he was a Drug Task Force Commander. While Sheriff Crum, his deputies, and other law enforcement agencies in Mingo County worked to wipe out crime, especially targeting drug dealers, Crum had received personal threats because of his fight to stop prescription drug abuse. When Crum was confronted by Judge Michael Thornsbury about the threats that he had been receiving, he said, [...] "I'm fighting back, I'm going to fight the good fight."

25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not run into any dead-ends. If <b>it</b> <b>did</b> encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|R
30|$|While [18 F]FDOPA-PET {{can be used}} {{to image}} dopaminergic system {{integrity}} in the anaesthetised animal, [18 F]FDG uptake must occur in the awake state [14] as anaesthesia strongly decreases cerebral glucose metabolism [15]. Resting state [18 F]FDG-PET measurements were performed between days 13 and 24 after 6 -OHDA injection. 73.0  ±  3.7  MBq of [18 F]FDG in 500  μl NaCl was injected intraperitoneally into the awake animal, which was then transferred to a dark chamber of 30  ×  24  ×  21  cm equipped with a video camera (Logitech webcam) and infrared LEDs. The rat was watched during [18 F]FDG uptake to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not sleep. The resulting conditions (awake and free to move, without sensory stimulation or an assigned task) will subsequently be called ‘resting state’. After 45  min in the chamber, the animal was anesthetised (initial dosage 5 % isoflurane in O 2 /air (3 : 7), reduced to 1.5 – 2.5 % isoflurane for maintenance) and fixed on an animal holder (Medres®, Cologne, Germany) with a respiratory mask. Body temperature was maintained at 37  °C using a feedback-controlled warming system (Medres®). A 30 -min emission scan was started 60  min after [18 F]FDG injection using a Focus 220 micro-PET scanner (CTI-Siemens).
