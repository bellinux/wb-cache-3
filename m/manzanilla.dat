25|$|Any {{wars that}} did occur, and any marriages for that matter, {{occurred}} between sites {{at an average}} distance of 38km (<b>Manzanilla,</b> 1997). This brings {{the idea that there}} was violence at this site. <b>Manzanilla</b> (1997) also states the Dorado stresses the difficulty of maintaining widespread territorial control in the tropical rainforest and that strength is based on kinship ties. However, there are several key pieces of evidence missing for any further conclusions. The architecture does not suggest any preparation for warfare, through the lack of walls and other fortifications. It is hard to make any conclusions based on the burials described above due to the sheer lack of a data set. Furthermore, there are no written records of violence Oxkintok, nor are there evidences of tributes received/paid or of conquest. Through the lack of so many indicators of violence and warfare, it isn't unreasonable to conclude that Oxkintok was not frequently involved in large scale violence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Manzanilla</b> Sherry {{comes from}} the Sanlucar {{district}} along the sea coast. The sea air leads the Sherry to develop a salty taste. These wines also have flor. This wine is produced using exactly the same process as Fino, but as weather conditions are very different in Sanlucar district it develops into a slightly different kind of wine. It often contains 15 to 19% of alcohol.|$|E
60|$|And {{the effect}} of a bodega is picturesque, too, though in a {{different}} way. It is a bright and cheerful spot, a huge shed with whitewashed walls and an open roof supported by dark beams; great casks are piled up, impressing you in their vast rotundity with a sort of aldermanic stateliness. The whole place is fragrant with clean, vinous perfumes. Your guide carries a glass and a long filler. You taste wine after wine, in different shades of brown; light wines to drink with your dinner, older wines to drink before your coffee; wines more than a century old, of which the odour is more delicate than violets; new wines of the preceding year, strong and rough; Amontillados, with the softest flavour in the world; <b>Manzanillas</b> for the gouty; Marsalas, heavy and sweet; wines that smell of wild-flowers; cheap wines and expensive wines. Then the brandies--the distiller tells you proudly that Spanish brandy is made from wine, and contemptuously that French brandy is not--old brandies for which a toper would sell his soul; new brandies like fusel-oil; brandies mellow and mild and rich. It is a drunkard's paradise.|$|R

25|$|After this Williams {{set about}} {{spreading}} the word and he embarked on lecture tours to set up branches in Jamaica, Trinidad and the United States. On 28 June 1901 the Trinidad branch of the Pan African Association was formed, with branches in Naparima, Sangre Grande, Arima, <b>Manzanilla,</b> Tunapuna, Arouca and Chaguanas. He spent two months here and after his departure for the US even more local branches were formed.|$|E
25|$|In {{sparkling}} wine production some winemakers select strains (such as one known as Épernay {{named after the}} town in the Champagne wine region of France and California Champagne, also known as UC-Davis strain 505) that are known to flocculate well, allowing the dead yeast cells to be removed easily by riddling and disgorgement. In Sherry production, the surface film of yeast known as flor {{used to make the}} distinctive style of fino and <b>manzanilla</b> sherries comes from different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, though the commercial flor yeast available for inoculation is often from different species of Saccharomyces, Saccharomyces beticus, Saccharomyces fermentati and Saccharomyces bayanus.|$|E
500|$|Eater {{reviewed}} {{the three other}} establishments as well, finding them to be commonplace compared to Trump Tower's stature. The ice cream was described as [...] "almost too soft to be scooped", and the cafe contained food such as a [...] "rubbery and overcooked" [...] hamburger patty and some [...] "inedible" [...] steak fries. The reviewers at Eater also wrote that the bar offered a small, overpriced drink menu and snacks that [...] "do little to affirm the luxury that the place aspires to". Vice magazine also {{reviewed the}} bar and {{found it to be}} overpriced, with [...] "a strong pour of watered-down vodka and a few <b>Manzanilla</b> olives" [...] costing twenty dollars. New York magazine, reviewing the cafe, found the food to be [...] "safe classics" [...] that contrasted with the cafe's grandeur.|$|E
2500|$|V. [...] On October 16, a {{tropical}} cyclone existed somewhere between Acapulco and Cape Corrientes. Two days later, it made landfall near La <b>Manzanilla,</b> Jalisco as a hurricane near with a pressure of [...] It or its remnants managed {{to cross the}} Isthmus of Tehuantepec and enter the Bay of Campeche, where they dissipated on October 20.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is clear}} {{evidence}} of inequality and sources of power in Oxkintoks architecture. It is hard however to separate the government structure from what we know of the religion at Oxkintok: [...] "The layout of the city {{seems to have been}} related to the movements of the sun and the political power of the leader (<b>Manzanilla,</b> 1997)". Religion, government, and to an extent inequality are best understood, and frequently discussed simultaneously through the lens of architecture. Therefore, to avoid repetition, I have included most of this in the Religion section (see above).|$|E
2500|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) the {{traditional}} importance of appellations for wine, {{there has been}} little harmonisation of national provisions within the European Union. Member States delimit the specified areas of production and determine the rules and appellations which apply: the European Commission restricts itself to publishing the information provided by the Member States. Appellations are usually the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced, although there are some historical exceptions: muscadet and blanquette in France, cava and <b>manzanilla</b> in Spain and vinho verde in Portugal. The appellations are not necessarily unique: Cava may refer either to a quality sparkling wine psr produced in Spain or to a Greek table wine which has been aged (as a transliteration of [...] "Κάβα").|$|E
2500|$|The {{taste of}} most of the wine world was still geared towards sweet and strong wines, and the Portuguese were seeing great success in adding brandy to make their port wines stronger. The Jerezanos began to {{experiment}} with adding brandy to Sherry and discovered that the increased alcohol content also had the effect of killing off the flor, which then made the wine oxidize more and develop into another style of wine. The merchants began to call this wine oloroso meaning [...] "pungent". The Sherry makers in Sanlúcar were a little more restrained in the use of their brandy, finding that the unique aspect of flor took on new distinction amid the salty sea breezes that cooled most of the area's bodegas. The finos produced here were even lighter and more delicate with a freshness reminiscent of apples. They began to call these wines <b>manzanilla</b> or [...] "little apple".|$|E
60|$|And in the music-halls the {{national}} dances are, with {{the national}} songs, the principal attraction. Seville possesses but one of these establishments; it is a queer place, merely the patio of a private house, with a stage at one end, in which chairs and tables have been placed. On holiday nights it is crammed with students, with countrymen and artisans, with the general riff-raff of the town, and with women of no particular reputation. Now and then appears a gang of soldiers, giving a peculiar note with the uniformity of their brown holland suits; and occasionally a couple of British sailors come sauntering in with fine self-assurance, their fair hair and red cheeks contrasting with the general swartness. You pay no entrance money, but your refreshment costs a real--which is twopence ha'penny; and for that you may enjoy not only {{a cup of coffee}} or a glass of <b>manzanilla,</b> but an evening's entertainment. As the night wears on the heat is oven-like, and the air is thick and grey with the smoke of countless cigarettes.|$|E
6000|$|I had a {{few days}} of {{pleasant}} wandering in the centre of the island, about the districts which bear the names of Naparima and Montserrat; a country of such extraordinary fertility, as well as beauty, that it must surely hereafter become the seat of a high civilisation. [...] The soil seems inexhaustibly rich. I say inexhaustibly; for as fast as the upper layer is impoverished, it will be swept over by the tropic rains, to mingle with the vegas, or alluvial flats below, and thus enriched again, while a fresh layer of virgin soil is exposed above. I have seen, cresting the highest ridges of Montserrat, ten feet at least of fat earth, falling clod by clod right and left upon the gardens below. There are, doubtless, comparatively barren tracts of gravel toward the northern mountains; there are poor sandy lands, likewise, at {{the southern part of the}} island, which are said, nevertheless, to be specially fitted for the growth of cotton: but from San Fernando on the west coast to <b>Manzanilla</b> on the east, stretches a band of soil which seems to be capable of yielding any conceivable return to labour and capital, not omitting common sense.|$|E
60|$|An {{heritage}} of Moordom is the Spanish {{love for the}} improvisation of well-turned couplets; in olden days a skilful verse might procure the poet a dress of cloth-of-gold, and it did on one occasion actually raise a beggar-maid to a royal throne: even now it has power to secure the lover his lady's most tender smiles, or at the worst a glass of <b>Manzanilla.</b> The richness of the language helps him with his rhymes, and his southern imagination gives him manifold subjects. But, being the result of improvisation--no lady fair would consider the suit of a gallant who could not address her in couplets of his own devising--the Spanish song has a peculiar character. The various stanzas have no bearing upon one another; they consist of four or seven lines, but in either case each contains its definite sentiment; so that one verse may be a complete song, or the singer may continue {{as long as the}} muse prompts and his subject's charms occasion. The Spanish song is like a barbaric necklace in which all manner of different stones are strung upon a single cord, without thought for their mutual congruity.|$|E
60|$|As for the {{southern}} shore of this supposed channel of the Orinoco, it at once catches the eye of any one standing on the northern range. He must see that he is on one shore of a vast channel, the other shore of which is formed by the Montserrat, Tamana, and <b>Manzanilla</b> hills; far lower now than the northern range, Tamana only being over a thousand feet, but doubtless, in past ages, far higher than now. No one can doubt this who has seen the extraordinary degradation going on still about the summits, or who remembers that the strata, whether tertiary or lower chalk, have been, over {{the greater part of}} the island, upheaved, faulted, set on end, by the convulsions seemingly so common during the Miocene epoch, and since then sawn away by water and air into one rolling outline, quite independent of the dip of the strata. The whole southern two thirds of Trinidad represent a wear and tear which is not to be counted by thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of years; and yet which, I verily believe, has taken place since the average plants, trees, and animals of the island dwelt therein.|$|E
6000|$|And I {{think of}} Andalusia. My mind is {{suddenly}} ablaze with its sunshine, with its opulent colour, luminous and soft; I {{think of the}} cities, the white cities bathed in light; of the desolate wastes of sand, with their dwarf palms, the broom in flower. And in my ears I hear the twang of the guitar, the rhythmical clapping of hands and the castanets, as two girls dance in the sunlight on a holiday. I see the crowds going to the bull-fight, intensely living, many-coloured. And a thousand scents are wafted across my memory; I remember the cloudless nights, the silence of sleeping towns, and the silence of desert country; I remember old whitewashed taverns, and the perfumed wines of Malaga, of Jerez, and of <b>Manzanilla.</b> (The rain pours down without stay in oblique long lines, the light is quickly failing, the street is sad and very cheerless.) I feel on my shoulder the touch of dainty hands, of little hands with tapering fingers, and on my mouth the kisses of red lips, and I hear a joyous laugh. I remember the voice that bade me farewell that last night in Seville, and the gleam of dark eyes and dark hair {{at the foot of}} the stairs, as I looked back from the gate. 'Feliz viage, mi Inglesito.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think if}} I had shot him I {{should have done}} nobody any harm? No, sir; I waited for his challenge, but it never came {{and the next time}} I met him he begged my pardon, and said, 'Strong, I beg your pardon; you whopped me and you served me right.' I shook hands: but I couldn't live with him after that. I paid him what I owed him the night before," [...] said Strong with a blush, [...] "I pawned {{everything}} to pay him, and then I went with my last ten florins, and had a shy at the roulette. If I had lost, I should have let him shoot me in the morning. I was weary of my life. By Jove, sir, isn't it a shame that a man like me, who may have had a few bills out, but who never deserted a friend, or did an unfair action, shouldn't be able to turn his hand to anything to get bread? I made a good night, sir, at roulette, and I've done with that. I'm going into the wine business. My wife's relations live at Cadiz. I intend to bring over Spanish wine and hams; there's a fortune to be made by it, sir,--a fortune--here's my card. If you want any sherry or hams, recollect Ned Strong is your man." [...] And the Chevalier pulled out a handsome card, stating that Strong and Company, Shepherd's Inn, were sole agents of the celebrated Diamond <b>Manzanilla</b> of the Duke of Garbanzos, Grandee of Spain of the First Class; and of the famous Toboso hams, fed on acorns only in the country of Don Quixote. [...] "Come and taste 'em, sir,--come and try 'em at my chambers. You see, I've an eye to business, and by Jove this time I'll succeed." ...|$|E
60|$|Such a play as Los Borrachos {{is nothing}} less than a genre picture of Seville life. It reminds one of a {{painting}} by Teniers; and I should like to give some idea of it, since it is really one of the best examples of the class, witty, varied, and vivacious. But an obstacle presents itself in the fact that I can find no vestige of a plot. The authors set out to characterise the various lovers of the vine, (nowhere in Andalusia are the devotees of the yellow <b>Manzanilla</b> more numerous than in Seville,) and with telling strokes have drawn the good-natured tippler, the surly tippler, the religious tippler. To these they have added other types, which every Andalusian can recognise as old friends--the sharp-tongued harridan, the improviser of couplets with his ridiculous vanity, the flower-seller, and the 'prentice-boy of fifteen, who, notwithstanding his tender years, is afflicted with love for the dark-eyed heroine. The action takes place first in a street, then in a court-yard, lastly in a carpenter's shop. There are dainty love-scenes between Soledad, the distressed maiden, and Juanillo, the flower-seller; and one, very Spanish, where the witty and precocious apprentice offers her his diminutive hand and heart. Numerous people come and go, the drunkards drink and quarrel and make peace; the whole thing, if somewhat confused, is very life-like, and runs with admirable lightness and ease. It is true that the play has neither beginning nor end, but perhaps that only makes it seem the truer; and if the scenes have no obvious connection they are all amusing and characteristic. It is acted with extraordinary spirit. The players, indeed, are not acting, but living their ordinary lives, and it is pleasant to see the zest with which they throw themselves into the performance. When the hero presses the heroine in his arms, smiles and passionate glances pass between them, which suggest that even the love-making is not entirely make-believe.|$|E
6000|$|For M--- (the civiliser of Montserrat) {{had gone}} off early, with mule, cutlass, and haversack, back over the Doubloon and into the wilds of <b>Manzanilla,</b> to settle certain disputed {{squatter}} claims, and otherwise enforce the law; and now the night had fallen, {{and he was not}} yet home. However, he rode up at last, dead beat, with a strong touch of his old swamp-fever, and having had an adventure, which had like to have proved his last. For as he rode through the Doubloon at low tide in the morning, he espied in the surf that river-god, or Jumby, of which I spoke just now; namely, the gray back-fin of a shark; and his mule espied it too, and laid back her ears, knowing well what it was. M--- rode close up to the brute. He seemed full seven feet long, and eyed him surlily, disinclined to move off; so they parted, and M--- went on his way. But his business detained him longer than he expected; when he got back to the river-mouth it was quite dark, and the tide was full high. He must either sleep on the sands, which with fever upon him would not have been over-safe, or try the passage. So he stripped, swam the mule over, tied her up, and then went back, up to his shoulders in surf; and cutlass in hand too, for that same shark might be within two yards of him. But on his second journey he had to pile on his head, first his saddle, and then his clothes and other goods; few indeed, but enough to require both hands to steady them: and so walked helpless through the surf, expecting every moment to be accosted by a set of teeth, from which he would hardly have escaped with life. To have faced such a danger, alone and in the dark, and thoroughly well aware, as an experienced man, of its extremity, was good proof (if any had been needed) of the indomitable Scots courage of the man. [...] Nevertheless, he said, he never felt so cold down his back as he did during that last wade. By God's blessing the shark was not there, or did not see him; and he got safe home, thankful for dinner and quinine.|$|E
