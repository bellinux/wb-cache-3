5|$|On March 17, 2012, the Cavaliers re-signed Harris for the {{remainder}} of the season. On March 21, Harris moved into the main rotation and began playing about 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> per game. On April 6 with Parker, Kyrie Irving and Gibson all injured, Harris made his first start of the season and 16th of his career against the Toronto Raptors. On April 20, Harris posted his first NBA double-double of the season with 19 points and a game-high and career-high 12 rebounds against the New York Knicks. In two seasons with the Cavaleiers, Harris averaged 6.2 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 17.4 minutes in 80 games (including 20 starts).|$|E

25|$|Most lines {{operate with}} trains running at {{intervals}} of every 5 minutes during peak hours, {{but due to}} lines overlapping, a suitable train for a journey can be as frequent as every 2 minutes. Outside of peak times lines operate trains at frequencies of every 10 minutes; however, around the start of operations and after midnight the line frequency decreases to every 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> on most lines. Again with line overlap this means that a suitable train will arrive (often much) more frequently.|$|E

25|$|Currently, Tasers are {{programmed}} to be activated in automatic five second bursts, although the officer {{can stop the}} energy charge at any time by engaging the safety switch. The charge can also be prolonged beyond five seconds if the trigger is held down continuously. The operator can also inflict repeated shock cycles with each pull of the trigger as long as both barbs remain attached to the subject. The only technical limit to the number or length of the electrical cycles is {{the life of the}} battery, which can be ten <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E

They are disproportionately represented in the military, service academy graduates, in higher education and academia, major professions, the clergy, business and politics. Eagles are more likely to exercise for 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> every day, volunteer for religious and nonreligious organizations, have closer relationships with family and friends, be in a leadership position at their place of employment or local community, donate money to charitable groups, and to work with others to improve their neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|Complimentary coffee, tea {{and water}} is offered on all flights with Dash 8 Q400 and Dash 8 Q300/300 aircraft, if the flight is {{scheduled}} for 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> On international flights, in flex/business class a complimentary meal is offered, and cold drinks are for free. Flights before 09:30 have breakfast; on later flights there is a snack. On flights to the United Kingdom, flexible ticket holders receive a better breakfast on flights before 09:30, and a meal and dessert after then. On routes operated on Dash 8-100 aircraft, snacks and cold drinks are for sale; no other refreshments are served on these aircraft, due to there being no galley on board.|$|E

25|$|Taxi {{operations}} are coordinated at each terminal by Massport. Massport's regulations prohibit taxis from picking up fares at any location {{other than the}} designated taxi stands located at curbside on {{the lower levels of}} Terminals A, C and E. For both sides of Terminal B, shuttle van services, limos and taxis all wait for passengers inside the Terminal B Parking Garage on the lower level. Signage inside B terminals directs passengers to the various modes of ground transportation. A large Taxi Pool near the South Cargo complex serves as the staging area for up to 400 taxis, which are typically paged to terminal taxi stands in groups of five or ten after waiting for up to ninety <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown {{benefits}} of delayed cord clamping: A meta-analysis showed that delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in full-term neonates {{for a minimum of}} 2 minutes following birth is beneficial to the newborn in giving improved hematocrit, iron status as measured by ferritin concentration and stored iron, as well as a reduction in the risk of anemia (relative risk, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40-0.70). A decrease was also found in a study from 2008. Although there is higher hemoglobin level at 2 months, this effect did not persist beyond 6 months of age. Not clamping the cord for three minutes following the birth of a baby improved outcomes at four years of age. A delay of three <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in umbilical cord clamping after birth reduce the prevalence of anemia in infants.|$|E
25|$|In about 1840, the English {{industrial}} chemist Hugh Lee Pattinson travelled to Canada, {{stopping at}} the Niagara Falls {{long enough to make}} the earliest known photograph of the falls, a daguerreotype in the collection of Newcastle University. It was once believed that the small figure standing silhouetted with a top hat was added by an engraver working from imagination as well as the daguerreotype as his source, but the figure is clearly present in the photograph. Because of the very long exposure required, of ten <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> the figure is assumed by Canada's Niagara Parks agency to be Pattinson himself. The image is left-right inverted, and taken from the Canadian side. Pattinson made other photographs of the Horseshoe Falls as well as of Rome and Paris. These were then transferred to engravings to illustrate Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours' Excursions Daguerriennes (Paris, 1841–1864).|$|E

25|$|In the United States and a {{few other}} countries, Doppler capable weather radar {{stations}} are used. These devices are capable of measuring the radial velocity, including radial direction (towards or away from the radar) of the winds in a storm, and so can spot evidence of rotation in storms from more than a hundred miles (160nbsp&km) away. A supercell is characterized by a mesocyclone, which is usually first observed in velocity data as a tight, cyclonic structure in the middle levels of the thunderstorm. If it meets certain requirements of strength, duration, and vorticity, it may trip the mesocyclone detection algorithm (MDA). Tornadic signatures are indicated by a cyclonic inbound-outbound velocity couplet, where strong winds flowing in one direction and strong winds flowing in the opposite direction are occurring in very close proximity. The algorithm for this is the tornadic vortex signature (TVS) or the tornado detection algorithm (TDA). TVS is then an extremely strong mesocyclone found at very low level and extending over a deep layer of the thunderstorm, not the actual tornadic circulation. The TVS is, however, indicative of a likely tornado or an incipient tornado. The couplet and TVS typically precede tornado formation by 10–30 minutes but may occur at nearly the same time or precede the tornado by 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological and other characteristics of hydrometeors that are helpful to tornado detection and nowcasting. Nonmeteorological reflectors co-located with a couplet, can confirm that a tornado has likely occurred and lofted debris. An area of high reflectivity, or debris ball, may also be visible {{on the end of the}} hook. Either the polarimetric data or debris ball are formally known as the tornado debris signature (TDS). The hook echo feature is formed as the RFD occludes precipitation around the mesocyclone and is also indicative of a probable tornado (tornadogenesis usually ensues shortly after the RFD reaches the surface).|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast on February 1, 2009, [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was viewed by 22.9 million viewers in 13.34 million homes, according to Nielsen Media Research, {{making it the}} most watched episode of The Office and the only episode to reach over 20 million viewers. The episode drew a 10.6 rating and 14.46 million viewers between the ages 18 and 49. It more than doubled the show's previously highest rating in the age group, and constituted the largest 18–49 rating for an NBC entertainment telecast in four-and-a-half years, since the tenth season finale of the medical drama series ER on May 13, 2004. An estimated 37.7 million viewers watched at least six <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> of [...] "Stress Relief". As expected, The Office benefited highly from following the broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII, which was seen by 98.7 million average viewers, making it the most watched Super Bowl in history at the time.|$|E
