50|$|His administration's {{domestic}} {{policy in the}} first term was marked by fiscal and <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> on the economic front, aimed at stabilising a national economy that had stagnated and was in decline. His social vision was focused on unleashing the entrepreneurial, creative and innovative potential of Ghanaians {{as a means of}} creating wealth and hence dealing with the social challenges facing them. This socio-economic vision was encapsulated in the Five Priority Areas Programme, viz., the pursuit of good governance, modernisation of agriculture for rural development, private sector participation, enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructure development. His administration is said to have received the most financial assistance of any in the history of Ghana, due essentially to donors' distrust for the military governments before it, as well as those with some military connections.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} the panic in the United States {{included}} the destruction of credit from over-speculation in the stock markets and railroad industry. Eight years of unprecedented growth after the Civil War had brought {{thousands of miles of}} railroad construction, thousands of industrial factories, and a strong stock market; the South experienced a boom in agriculture. However, all this growth was done on borrowed money by many banks in the United States that have over-speculated in the Railroad industry by as much as $20 million. A stringent monetary policy under Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell, {{during the height of the}} railroad speculations, contributed to unsettled markets. Boutwell created <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> by selling more gold then he bought bonds. The Coinage Act of 1873 made gold the de facto currency metal over silver.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} mutual funds under different Central Bank of China monetary policy environments in the emerging Taiwan market. To measure monetary policy changes effectively, we exploit changes in the discount rate and further categorize the monetary environment as either restrictive or expansive. We consider a restrictive monetary environment to be {{a period in which}} the discount rate rises, whereas an expansive monetary condition is a period in which the discount rate drops. It is found that all mutual funds, both domestic and international funds, exhibit a higher mean return, lower risk, and higher Sharpe and Treynor ratios under expansive monetary policy environments. Regression results show that domestic mutual fund returns are related significantly to local monetary policy. Furthermore, after controlling for the possible effect of macro factors on the association between the monetary policy dummy variable and mutual fund returns, the significant influence of monetary policy on domestic mutual fund returns remains robust. In contrast, changes in U. S. <b>monetary</b> policy <b>stringency,</b> in general, do not affect the performance of either domestic or international mutual funds in Taiwan. discount rate, monetary policy, mutual fund returns, Taiwan,...|$|R
40|$|In an Efficient Market prices adjust instantaneously {{toward their}} {{fundamental}} values, and trading volume contains {{no information about}} future price developments. However, the sequential arrival of information model implies a positive causal relation between absolute stock returns and trading volume in either direction, and the mixture model suggests a positive causal relation running from volume to absolute returns. Empirical evidence supports these theories, since large movements in stock prices typically take place on days with high trading volume. Here, we consider the relationship between stock return and trading volume using a nonlinear framework. First, nonlinearity in the Helsinki Stock Exchange data is tested using a STAR-model. Next, we compute nonlinear impulse responses; first to check {{the stability of the}} models, and second to scrutinize the persistence of shocks in return and volume series. Linear Granger causality tests indicate bidirectional causality between returns and volume. By contrast, the nonlinear causality tests suggest that only in a few cases can volume be used to forecast returns. Thus, the empirical findings give only slight support to the mixture model. Finally, we exploit the outcome of causality tests to specify a STVEC model in order {{to take into account the}} influence of the composition effect and common persistence on the results. We conclude that causality runs mainly from returns to trading volume, corroborating the positive feedback trading hypothesis. There is a large body of empirical evidence that stock markets perform poorly during inflationary periods. Several explanations have been offered for this so-called "anomaly. " Here, we test the claim that the "spurious" negative correlation between stock returns and inflation is due to counter-cyclical monetary policy. We identify various regimes in the Finnish data using the Markov-switching vector autoregressive model. When necessary, the existing long run relation-ships between the model variables are incorporated using the MS-VEC model. Using alternative sets of explanatory variables including measures for <b>monetary</b> policy <b>stringency,</b> we conclude that the sign of the relation between returns and inflation depends especially on the time horizon chosen. In monthly models the statistically significant contempo-raneous correlations between returns and inflation are always negative, but positive in the case of quarterly data. Stocks thus seem to be a good hedge against inflation in the long run. To be more specific, stocks seem to maintain protection against purely monetary inflation but fail to provide a hedge against inflation arising from real output shocks. Last, this is tested using the regime-dependent impulse response function. Endast sammandrag.

50|$|Moreover, at the time, the Act {{was criticized}} for {{widening}} {{the influence of the}} federal government {{at the expense of the}} states. However, it is now believed that as a result of the assumption of state debts, the states were in a better position to focus on economic growth and development, whereas the federal government was left with trying to finance the large debt it had acquired. The most controversial aspect of the Act was the large benefits allegedly reaped by speculators - especially by the assumption of state debts. Many states’ securities sold in the open market for 10% of their face value or less at the time the Act was being debated. This furnished considerable scope for speculative gains. However, taking into account the low security prices before 1790 owing to the general economic depression, <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> of the times and the use of paper money by the states for debt service, the rise in security values was inevitable after 1790, once the causes of depreciation were ameliorated.|$|E
40|$|Ample {{evidence}} shows that size and book-to-market equity explain significant cross-sectional variation in stock returns, whereas beta explains little or none of the variation. Recent studies also demonstrate that proxies for <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> increase the explained variation in stock returns. We reexamine a three-factor model that includes beta, size, and book-to-market equity, while allowing monetary conditions to influence the relations between these risk factors and average stock returns. We find that ex-ante proxies for <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> significantly influence the relations between stock returns and all three risk factors. Additionally, all three variables are found to contribute significantly to explaining cross-sectional returns in a three-factor model that includes the monetary sector.

The issue is analyzed by first constructing an Index of Stock Price Misalignement in which the fundamental value of the stocks is computed {{on the basis of the}} discounted cash flow approach and by then including this index, among the regressors, into a forward looking Taylor rule. In accordance with the descriptive evidence, based mainly on the analysis of the FOMC meetings and public statements, our findings show that the Fed tends to lower the Fed funds rate when stock prices fall below their fundamental value, while there is no evidence of <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> during episodes of exuberance in the stock market. ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{empirical}} data, {{this study}} discusses the introduction, acceptance and circulation of two complementary currencies in Argentina {{that do not}} fit well in the main approaches {{to the nature of}} money. These two monetary circuits, provincial and community currencies, were introduced as units of account to denominate the value of debt and circulated as means of payment to overcome <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> during the crisis of 1999 - 2003. After discussing several theories on the nature of money, we reflect on the institutional significance of currency circuits as concurrent and rather stable pairs of trade and money.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{explanations}} for {{the severity of the}} Great Depression focus on the malfunctioning of the international monetary system. One such explanation emphasizes the deflationary monetary consequences of the liquidation of foreign-exchange reserves following competitive devaluations by Great Britain and her trading partners. Another emphasizes instead the international monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the Rank of France. This paper analyzes both the exceptional behavior of the U. S. and France and the shift out of foreign exchange after 1930. While both Franco-American gold policies and systemic weaknesses of the international monetary system emerge as important factors in explaining the international distribution of reserves, the first of these factors turns out to play the more important role in the <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> associated with the Great Depression. ...|$|E

The {{analysis}} of this topic has continued to draw attention from academics such as Jensen Johnson and Mercer (1996), Patelis (1997) and Booth and Booth (2001) who examine the results of Fama et al. (1988) under differing monetary policy regimes. Jensen et al. (1996) posit that <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> affects investors' required rate of return, {{which is consistent with}} Fama et al. 's (1989) arguments that predictable variation in returns reflects rational variation in required returns. Patelis (1997) finds that monetary variables used in his analysis are marginally significant predictors of security returns across different time horizons, while Booth et al.

40|$|When in {{the latter}} half of 1985 South Africa was struck with a {{shocking}} debt crisis which forced the government to declare a temporary moratorium on all short-term debt repayments, some economic commentators said the crisis derived largely from the careless policies of the South African Reserve Bank. The deregulation of exchange controls had gone too far between 1983 and 1985, and the SARB had encouraged reckless borrowing overseas. A period of <b>monetary</b> <b>stringency</b> and fiscal restraint should restore South Africa's foreign accounts, which had always been considered very sound. Four years later, however, there are no signs of a return to what once was considered normality. Foreign reserves are lower than they were after the Sharpeville massacre, when the country was considered on the brink of insol-vency. After Sharpeville American loans restored confidence in the economy, and South Africa entered a period of very rapid growth, especially in manufacturing. In 1989, four years after the current debt crisis broke, the South African government is scratching for foreign exchange, and capital is draining from the South African economy almost as fast as it poured in during the 1960 s. The peril of insolvency casts a shadow over South Africa's growth prospects, and over every government activity, or plan, from attempts to finance the privatisation of Eskom (Sunday Star, 6. 6. 88), through plans for upgrading black townships (Boraine, 1988), to the pursuit of war in Southern Africa (Cape Times, 5. 8. 88; New York Times, 8. 7. 88). Moreover, every time the economy begins to boom, the government is forced to turn it off because of balance of payments pressures arising primarily out of the debt crisis. Peri-odic interest rate hikes and credit restrictions since 1985 illustrate the severe constraints placed on the South African economy in large measure because of its current position in international capital markets. Today both liberal incrcmentalists and Nationalists push for socio-economic improvements in the black communities as a prelude to, or sub-stitute for, political change. The government believes that black politica...|$|E
