60|$|We {{have seen}} that distant {{countries}} possess distinct domestic races of the cat. The differences may be {{in part due to}} descent from several aboriginal species, or at least to crosses with them. In some cases, as in Paraguay, Mombas, and Antigua, the differences seem due to the direct action of different conditions of life. In other cases some slight effect may possibly be attributed to natural selection, as cats in many cases have largely to support themselves and to escape diverse dangers. But man, owing to the difficulty of pairing cats, has done nothing by methodical selection; and probably very little by unintentional selection; though in each litter he generally saves the prettiest, and values most a good breed of <b>mouse-</b> or rat-catchers. Those cats which have a strong tendency to prowl after game, generally get destroyed by traps. As cats are so much petted, a breed bearing the same relation to other cats, that lapdogs bear to larger dogs, would have been much valued; and if selection could have been applied, we should certainly have had many breeds in each long-civilised country, for there is plenty of variability to work upon.|$|E

50|$|The {{physiological}} {{action of}} RLN and its tandem duplicates (RLN1, INSL4, INSL6) and INSL3 {{has been quite}} well studied in human and <b>mouse-</b> they are primarily associated with reproductive functions, such as the relaxation of uterine musculature and of the pubic symphysis during labor (RLN1 & RLN2), the progression of spermatogenesis (INSL6) and possibly trophoblast development (INSL4) and testicular descent and germ cell survival (INSL3), but the functions of INSL5 and RLN3 are relatively unexplored. Both RLN3 and INSL5 are thought to play important roles in neuroendocrine regulation. In the case of INSL5 this hypothesis is based on its expression (and also co-expression with its receptor) in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), intestine and lymph nodes. At the same time, RLN3 is predominantly localized in the brain and locally affects selected regions of the CNS, such as those responsible for the sense of appetite and stress regulation. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} RLN3 stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and hence affects levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the blood.|$|E

She concluded that the game gives [...] "me very mixed feelings ... Getting through this Ultima will require {{a certain amount of}} patience and forebearance". In 1993 she wrote that [...] "the game has its annoying aspects ... it is certainly worth playing". Charles Ardai acknowledged the widespread sentiment that after six installments the Ultima series had been done to death, but argued that [...] "Ultima VII is not more of the same. It is daring and unusual, has a sophisticated interface and story, takes full advantage of both its own history and the conventions of the genre, and manages to be at once grounded in tradition and unpredictable". Ardai praised the plot as the best in the series, stating that it is highly original, evokes genuine emotion, and serves as an allegory for problems in the real world. He also generally praised the game's puzzles, simple interface, and pacing. Ultima VII: The Black Gate and Forge of Virtue were reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #191 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column.

40|$|Two {{colorectal}} (HT 29, LoVo) and one gastric (MKN 45) human tumour {{cell lines}} were examined for their in vitro trophic response to human gastrin- 17. MKN 45 and HT 29 responded by increased 75 Se selenomethionine uptake to exogenous gastrin (139 +/- 5. 5 % and 123 +/- 3 % of control values respectively) whereas LoVo {{showed no significant}} response to this hormone. When these same cell lines were grown as xenografts in nude mice, similar responses were seen to exogenously administered human gastrin- 17 (10 micrograms <b>mouse-</b> 1 day- 1, subcutaneous injection).

The hormone-treated xenografts had a two-fold increase in tumour cross-sectional area and growth rate when compared to saline-treated controls. Dose-response studies revealed that 0. 4 micrograms gastrin <b>mouse-</b> 1 day- 1 appeared to be the minimally effective dose. As gastric and colorectal tumour cells show a trophic response to gastrin, antagonists of the gastrin receptor may prevent this effect causing tumour stasis.

40|$|Bacterial and {{synthetic}} DNAs containing CpG dinucleotides in specific sequence contexts activate the vertebrate immune system through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR 9). In the present study, {{we used a}} synthetic nucleoside with a bicyclic heterobase [1 -(2 ′-deoxy-β-d-ribofuranosyl) - 2 -oxo- 7 -deaza- 8 -methyl-purine; R] to replace the C in CpG, resulting in an RpG dinucleotide. The RpG dinucleotide was incorporated in <b>mouse-</b> and human-specific motifs in oligodeoxynucleotides (oligos) and 3 ′- 3 -linked oligos, referred to as immunomers. Oligos containing the RpG motif induced cytokine secretion in mouse spleen-cell cultures. Immunomers containing RpG dinucleotides showed activity in transfected-HEK 293 cells stably expressing mouse TLR 9, suggesting direct involvement of TLR 9 in the recognition of RpG motif. In J 774 macrophages, RpG motifs activated NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Immunomers containing the RpG dinucleotide induced high levels of IL- 12 and IFN-γ, but lower IL- 6 in time- and concentration-dependent fashion in mouse spleen-cell cultures costimulated with IL- 2. Importantly, immunomers containing GTRGTT and GARGTT motifs were recognized to a similar extent by both mouse and human immune systems. Additionally, both <b>mouse-</b> and human-specific RpG immunomers potently stimulated proliferation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} obtained from diverse vertebrate species, including monkey, pig, horse, sheep, goat, rat, and chicken. An immunomer containing GTRGTT motif prevented conalbumin-induced and ragweed allergen-induced allergic inflammation in mice. We show that a synthetic bicyclic nucleotide is recognized in the C position of a CpG dinucleotide by immune cells from diverse vertebrate species without bias for flanking sequences, suggesting a divergent nucleotide motif recognition pattern of TLR 9...|$|E

A single-base polymorphism which varied among samples was identified. Apart from this nucleotide, the DNA sequences of all samples were identical.

40|$|SummarySuboptimal axonal {{regeneration}} {{contributes to}} the consequences of nervous system trauma and neurodegenerative disease, but the intrinsic mechanisms that regulate axon growth remain unclear. We screened 50, 400 small molecules {{for their ability}} to promote axon outgrowth on inhibitory substrata. The most potent hits were the statins, which stimulated growth of all <b>mouse-</b> and human-patient-derived neurons tested, both in vitro and in vivo, as did combined inhibition of the protein prenylation enzymes farnesyltransferase (PFT) and geranylgeranyl transferase I (PGGT- 1). Compensatory sprouting of motor axons may delay clinical onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Accordingly, elevated levels of PGGT 1 B, which would be predicted to reduce sprouting, were found in motor neurons of early- versus late-onset ALS patients postmortem. The mevalonate-prenylation pathway therefore constitutes an endogenous brake on axonal growth, and its inhibition provides a potential therapeutic approach to accelerate neuronal regeneration in humans...|$|E

Imatinib not only prevented fibrosis in the bleomycin-induced model of dermal fibrosis and the tight skin <b>mouse-</b> 1 model but also reduced established fibrosis in a modified bleomycin model. Open-label, proof-of-concept trials in SSc showed moderate effects on skin fibrosis, biological measures of skin fibrosis, and lung fibrosis compared with baseline measures.

Consistent with the neuroscience literature, we found that mouse and touchscreen pointing were faster and more accurate for items presented in the LVF when compared to pointing at identical targets presented in the UVF. Further analysis found previously unreported performance differences between the visual fields for touchscreen pointing that were not observed for mouse pointing.

40|$|Background: Induction of nonshivering {{thermogenesis}} {{can be used}} {{to influence}} energy balance to prevent or even treat obesity. The pungent component of mustard, allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC), activates the extreme cold receptor transient receptor potential channel, subfamily A, member 1 and may thus induce energy expenditure and metabolic changes. Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential of mustard AITC to induce thermogenesis (primary outcome) and alter body temperature, cold and hunger sensations, plasma metabolic parameters, and energy intake (secondary outcomes). Design: Energy expenditure in mice was measured after subcutaneous injection with vehicle, 1 mg norepinephrine/kg, or 5 mg AITC/kg. In our human crossover study, 11 healthy subjects were studied under temperature-controlled conditions after an overnight fast. After ingestion of 10 g of capsulated mustard or uncapsulated mustard or a capsulated placebo mixture, measurements of energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, and plasma parameters were repeated every 30 min during a 150 -min period. Subjects were randomly selected for the placebo and capsulated mustard intervention; 9 of 11 subjects received the uncapsulated mustard as the final intervention because this could not be blinded. After the experiments, energy intake was measured with the universal eating monitor in a test meal. Results: In mice, AITC administration induced a 32 % increase in energy expenditure compared with vehicle (17. 5 ± 4. 9 J · min- 1 · <b>mouse-</b> 1 compared with 12. 5 ± 1. 2 J · min- 1 · <b>mouse-</b> 1, P = 0. 03). Of the 11 randomly selected participants, 1 was excluded because of intercurrent illness after the first visit and 1 withdrew after the second visit. Energy expenditure did not increase after ingestion of capsulated or uncapsulated mustard compared with placebo. No differences in substrate oxidation, core temperature, cold and hunger scores, or plasma parameters were found, nor was the energy intake {{at the end of the}} experiment different between the 3 conditions. Conclusion: The highest tolerable dose of mustard we were able to use did not elicit a relevant thermogenic response in humans.

40|$|AbstractUnequivocal {{evidence}} for pluripotency in which {{embryonic stem cells}} contribute to chimeric offspring {{has yet to be}} demonstrated in human or nonhuman primates (NHPs). Here, rhesus and baboons ESCs were investigated in interspecific mouse chimera generated by aggregation or blastocyst injection. Aggregation chimera produced mouse blastocysts with GFP-nhpESCs at the inner cell mass (ICM), and embryo transfers (ETs) generated dimly-fluorescencing abnormal fetuses. Direct injection of GFP-nhpESCs into blastocysts produced normal non-GFP-fluorescencing fetuses. Injected chimera showed > 70 % loss of GFP-nhpESCs after 21 h culture. Outgrowths of all chimeric blastocysts established distinct but separate <b>mouse-</b> and NHP-ESC colonies. Extensive endogenous autofluorescence compromised anti-GFP detection and PCR analysis did not detect nhpESCs in fetuses. NhpESCs localize to the ICM in chimera and generate pregnancies. Because primate ESCs do not engraft post-implantation, and also because endogenous autofluorescence results in misleading positive signals, interspecific chimera assays for pluripotency with primate stem cells is unreliable with the currently available ESCs. Testing primate ESCs reprogrammed into even more naïve states in these inter-specific chimera assays will be an important future endeavor...|$|E
