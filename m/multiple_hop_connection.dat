40|$|Network {{multimedia}} applications require certain performance {{guarantees that}} can be provided through proper resource allocation. Allocation techniques are needed to provide these guarantees as efficiently as possible since resources are limited. This paper presents an allocation method called Dynamic Search Algorithm (DSA+). DSA+ is an on-line algorithm that dynamically adjusts the resource allocation based upon the measured quality of service. Advantages of DSA+ include efficient use of resources, reasonable implementation cost and stringent quality of service control. In this paper we demonstrate how DSA+ dynamically allocates bandwidth to achieve a given loss rate for actual variable bit rate MPEG videos. Performance and cost advantages over other allocation methods are presented, as well as allocation for <b>multiple</b> <b>hop</b> <b>connections.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|As mobile ad hoc {{networks}} {{emerge as}} a promising solution for future ubiquitous communications, there is a compelling demand to design a reliable method for supporting good quality video considering the increasing importance of video applications over the cyberspace nowadays. As commonly known, video application is usually associated with rigid requirements on bandwidth, lost, delay and jitter. Moreover, {{it is a great}} challenge to support video in ad hoc networks due to the frequent link breakage and the lack of centralized management system. In this dissertation, we tackle the problem of video unicast and multicast over mobile ad hoc networks using the concept of path and server diversities. The potential of this concept lies on the mesh topology of a mobile ad hoc network that allows each node to be virtually connected to any other node as long as a valid single <b>hop</b> or <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> <b>connection</b> can be established between them. To tackle the issue of video unicast in mobile ad hoc networks, we propose a framework that combines Multipoint-to-Point (MP 2 P) communication an...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces the}} concept of the High Capacity Airborne Ad Hoc Network. Such an ad hoc mobile network is formed by interconnecting aircraft with high capacity directional microwave links. Electronically steered antennas and suitable antenna multiplexing and ad hoc routing protocols are employed to produce these links. The High Capacity Airborne Ad Hoc Network addresses the long standing difficulties extant in the provision of high capacity digital links to aircraft which are beyond the line of sight of the fixed ground based digital communications infrastructure. It also has the potential, when sufficient density of air traffic is available, to provide an alternative to established satellite communications for long and medium haul communications. The bounds on achievable signal to noise ratio and channel capacity performance for point to point links between aircraft in the troposphere and lower stratosphere are explored, using the comprehensive TROPPO propagation simulation algorithm developed for this purpose. Requirements and design constraints for active electronically steered antennas suitable for such applications are determined at a system and component level. A number of optimal antenna configurations are proposed, and antenna placement and tracking problems identified and resolved. The signal to noise ratio and channel capacity performance models are applied to empirical commercial air traffic position and altitude track datasets for the continental United States and North Atlantic and the behaviour of a wide area High Capacity Airborne Ad Hoc Network formed by linking this commercial air traffic is explored. The Etrack simulation algorithm was developed for this purpose and employed to simulate ad hoc network behaviour under a wide range of conditions and constraints. The properties of High Capacity Airborne Ad Hoc Networks are then explored to define constraints upon commercial and military applications of such a technology. Comparisons are made with existing LEO, MEO and GEO satellite communication schemes and extant airborne communication schemes. Finally, the behaviour of extant communications multiplexing and ad hoc routing strategies are explored {{in the context of a}} High Capacity Airborne Ad Hoc Network. The AQEM and DACR distributed multiplexing and routing protocols are proposed, respectively, as more suitable alternatives. This dissertation demonstrates that substantial connectivity and network capacity can exist between aircraft participating in an ad hoc network, under a range of weather conditions, traffic densities and traffic altitudes. <b>Multiple</b> <b>hop</b> <b>connections</b> spanning distances of several thousand kilometres, with link capacities of up to Gigabits/s are shown to be feasible, and to exhibit uninterrupted durations of hours.

30|$|In {{wireless}} networks, users or subscribers {{can experience}} unfairness {{depending on their}} location in the network. Users with <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> to destination are given less bandwidth than those with fewer hops. The unfairness stems from the shared wireless medium and unfair network protocols {{that are designed to}} maximize network capacity, that is, the aggregate throughput or do {{not take into account the}} fairness at all. Maximizing capacity and ensuring fairness are contradictory requirements and usually maximizing capacity has been preferred [2]. Unfairness is also present in multihop multichannel WMN. Users with <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> can be completely starved, while capacity, in terms of throughput, is maximized. This is naturally not fair, especially if the users pay the same amount for the service.|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from poor}} performance, mesh {{networks}} suffer from multihop performance degradation and unfairness [7]. Multihop performance degradation, that is, {{the fact that}} traffic that is forwarded over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> receives {{only a fraction of}} the throughput that a single-hop flow achieves, occurs because of the random access of the MAC protocol. A flow that traverses <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> has to compete multiple times in order for the medium to reach the destination. With existing 802.11 protocols, each competition is fair, such that the probability that a multihop flow packet reaches the destination is significantly lower than that of a single-hop flow. This issue is well known, and is expected to be addressed in the upcoming 802.11 s standard for mesh networks.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Multi-hop {{wireless}} meshed {{networks are}} being considered as backbones in metro broadband deployments. In such networks, wireless links need to offer low link-latencies, high goodput and low residual loss rates. Due to non-line-of-sight deployments involving fading/interference, such links experience high/bursty errors, especially at higher bit rates. Traditionally, wireless links use retransmissions (ARQ) and adaptive modulation/coding to overcome loss. The price paid is reduced goodput (affecting bulk applications) and higher per-hop latencies (affecting latency-sensitive applications over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops).</b> Our paper {{starts with the}} design of a link-level hybrid ARQ scheme (LL-HARQ) to achieve high goodput and low residual loss rate with limited ARQ attempts. While LL-HARQ performs well, it exports a small residual loss rate under high/bursty loss scenarios. Over <b>multiple</b> <b>hops,</b> this small residual loss accumulates and TCP-SACK performance suffers. A transport protocol (LT-TCP) designed for loss tolerance achieves the best performance in combination with LL-HARQ, though TCP-SACK is sufficient if residual loss accumulation is under 5 %. This suggests a division of reliability functions where link-layer attempts reliability with tight latency constraints, and transport layer support handles residual erasures. We develop insights for structuring FEC, and verify the goodput-loss rate-latency trade-offs and impact of bursty losses and <b>multiple</b> <b>hops</b> through simulations. I...|$|R
