Two responsibility center structures are analyzed: Consolidated structures are produced when managers are attributed to <b>multiple</b> <b>activities.</b> These structures imply less ratcheting but at the loss of comparative performance information. Specialized structures mean managers are responsible for one activity thus providing a higher level of comparative performance information but also a higher level of ratcheting. Performance evaluation in firms with specialized structures is more informative because of the use of comparative measurements.|$|E
25|$|The {{diarrhoea}} {{is caused}} by <b>multiple</b> <b>activities</b> of the virus. Malabsorption occurs because {{of the destruction of}} gut cells called enterocytes. The toxic rotavirus protein NSP4 induces age- and calcium ion-dependent chloride secretion, disrupts SGLT1 transporter-mediated reabsorption of water, apparently reduces activity of brush-border membrane disaccharidases, and possibly activates the calcium ion-dependent secretory reflexes of the enteric nervous system. Healthy enterocytes secrete lactase into the small intestine; milk intolerance due to lactase deficiency is a symptom of rotavirus infection, which can persist for weeks. A recurrence of mild diarrhoea often follows the reintroduction of milk into the child's diet, due to bacterial fermentation of the disaccharide lactose in the gut.|$|E

A provisionally fitted-out space was arranged in the building to seat the Assembly of Notable in 1787, and again in 1788. Then, to accommodate the press of representatives of the three estates, in the Estate-General, a grander but still temporary Salle des États designed by Pierre-Adrien Pâris was set up in one of the two courtyards of the Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs. The old Hôtel des Menus-Plaisirs is now the home of the Centre de Musique Baroque de Versailles.|$|E

The obtained data were analyzed by using Armstrong’s framework (2009) of <b>Multiple</b> Intelligence <b>Activities.</b> The data collection methods used observation, interview, and data analysis. The findings revealed that the teacher implemented eleven <b>multiple</b> intelligence <b>activities</b> in the classroom, namely drilling for linguistic; riddle and counting number in sequence for logic-mathematic; showing pictures and color games for spatial; body answer and take the ball game for bodily-kinesthetic; sing a song for musical; pairs game for interpersonal; personal connection for intrapersonal; and observe the weather for natural. The students’ responses toward <b>Multiple</b> Intelligence <b>activities</b> are generally positive. The indicators of students’ response can be observed from four aspects, namely: students’ participation, students’ achievement, students’ potentials improvement, and students’ way of learning. The results indicate that varieties of activity have been provided to accommodate students’ interest and intelligences. However, those activities are not intended to cater each student’s interests specifically. In conclusion, the implementation of <b>Multiple</b> Intelligence <b>activities</b> as has been observed {{in this study is}} an example of good practice as an attempt to providing learning experiences suited to the students’ interests and intelligences.

This research was designed to find out the type of <b>multiple</b> intelligence-based <b>activities,</b> the difficulty and the solution of the difficulty in implementing <b>multiple</b> intelligence-based <b>activities</b> by EYL student teachers of English Laanguage Education Department in UMM. This research employed qualitative research in order to analyze the types of <b>multiple</b> intelligence-based <b>activities</b> implemented in EYL class, its difficulties and solution.
