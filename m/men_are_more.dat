5|$|In Western countries, {{the number}} of new episodes per year has been {{estimated}} to be between 0.89 and 1.89 cases per 100,000 people. Children and young adults {{are less likely to be}} affected than the elderly: the risk increases by 20% for every decade of life. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to develop Guillain–Barré syndrome than women; the relative risk for men is 1.78 compared to women.|$|E
5|$|People over 20 {{years of}} age with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} have {{an increased risk of}} developing slow-growing kidney tumors (chromophobe renal carcinoma and renal oncocytoma, respectively), kidney cysts, and possibly tumors in other organs and tissues. These tumors often occur in both kidneys and in multiple locations in each kidney. The average number of kidney tumors found in a person with BHD is 5.3, though up to 28 tumors have been found. Hybrid oncocytoma/chromophobe carcinoma, found in 50% of cases, is the most commonly found cancer, followed by chromophobe renal carcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, renal oncocytoma, and papillary renal cell carcinoma. People over 40 years old and <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to develop kidney tumors, which are diagnosed at a median age of 48. Kidney cancer associated with BHD have been diagnosed in people at ages as young as 20.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their belief of equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

50|$|The Hippocratic Corpus writers {{indicated}} that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> rational than women, and that women's physiology made them susceptible to problems {{that would cause}} symptoms of irrationality.

25|$|Physicians tend {{to offer}} {{invasive}} procedures to male patients more than female patients. Furthermore, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to smoke than women and experience smoking-related health complications {{later in life}} as a result; this trend is also observed in regard to other substances, such as marijuana, in Jamaica, where the rate of use is 2–3 times more for men than women.

25|$|Research has {{indicated}} {{that women are more}} likely to be left hemisphere dominant, and <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to be right hemisphere dominant.

Men who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke also have significantly better rehabilitation outcomes than men who suffer a left hemisphere stroke. Recovery of functional abilities is often greater in male stroke survivors than females, especially in the area of activities of daily living.|$|E

25|$|<b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} have fat stored in the abdomen due to sex hormone differences.

50|$|Hollingworth also {{attacked}} the variability hypothesis theoretically, criticizing the underlying {{logic of the}} hypothesis. Hollingworth argued that the variability hypothesis was flawed because: (1) {{it had not been}} empirically established that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> anatomically variable than women, (2) even if greater anatomical variability in <b>men</b> <b>were</b> established this would not necessarily mean that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> also <b>more</b> variable in mental traits, (3) even if it <b>were</b> established that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> variable in mental traits this would not automatically mean that <b>men</b> <b>were</b> innately <b>more</b> variable, (4) variability is not significant in and of itself, but rather depends on what the variability consists of, and (5) that any possible differences in variability between men and women must also be understood with reference to the fact that women lack the opportunity to achieve eminence because of their prescribed societal and cultural roles. Additionally, the argument that great variability automatically meant greater range was criticized by Hollingworth.|$|R
25|$|Most {{people are}} married {{when they reach}} {{retirement}} age; thus, spouse's employment status may affect one's decision to retire. On average, husbands are three years older than their wives in the U.S., and spouses often coordinate their retirement decisions. Thus, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to retire if their wives are also retired than if they {{are still in the}} labor force, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions. Most people will experience at least one traumatizing event in their lifetime. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to experience a traumatic event, but women are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|Among other behaviors, {{this means}} that <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to favour {{chastity}} in a woman, as this way a male can be more certain that her offspring are his own. Such a strategy is seen in males, and maternity is never doubted by the female, and so a chaste male is not highly valued by a women. However, for men, female chastity confirms paternity, causing the male to compromising his sexual strategies in order to select a chaste mate.|$|E

25|$|Although men {{and women}} lie at equal frequencies, <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to lie in order to please {{themselves}} while {{women are more likely}} to lie to please others.

25|$|Establishing the {{incidence}} of aortic dissection has been difficult because many cases are only diagnosed after death (which may {{have been attributed to}} another cause), and is often initially misdiagnosed. Aortic dissection affects an estimated 2.0–3.5 people per every 100,000 every year. Studies from Sweden suggest that {{the incidence}} of aortic dissection may be rising. <b>Men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> commonly affected than women: 65% of all people with aortic dissection are male. The mean age at diagnosis is 63 years. In females before the age of 40, half of all aortic dissections occur during pregnancy (typically in the third trimester or early postpartum period).|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{literature}} and research surrounding TCKs has found that these individuals are more open to learning new languages, demonstrate more flexibility when interacting with a novel culture than their monoculture peers, and a greater interest in continuing a global nomad lifestyle, which includes an interest in international careers. It {{has been found that}} women are more inclined to seek out interpersonal relationships while <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> task-oriented in their relationships and choices. Such findings were used in the hypothesis of a study conducted by Gerner & Perry (2000) that predicted that gender differences would also be found in the cultural acceptance and experiences of TCKs.|$|E
