5|$|St. Rynagh's Church {{houses a}} {{work by the}} {{well-known}} German sculptor, Imogen Stuart, called The <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child,</b> a mandorla carved in 1974. The most outstanding feature of St. Paul's Church is the Window of the Resurrection, a stained-glass window commemorating the Bell family that was originally intended for Westminister Abbey in London.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel to {{the eastern}} end of the choir dates from between 1265 and 1290. It is of three bays, and {{contains}} the Shrine of StWerburgh, dating from the 14thcentury. The vault of the Lady Chapel is {{the only one in the}} cathedral that is of stone. It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity, the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child,</b> and the murder of Thomas Becket. The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} this information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child,</b> signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E
5|$|The chapel is unrealistically small {{compared}} to the Virgin; van der Weyden's intention was to emphasise the Virgin's presence while also symbolically representing the Church and the entire doctrine of the Redemption. The panel {{is one of three}} surviving of van der Weyden's in which both <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> are enclosed in this way. However it is unusual in that the niche exists as a separate feature within the picture, compared to the two other works where the enclosure is coterminous with the edge of the painting, almost as part of the frame, a reason why it is thought to predate The Madonna Standing.|$|E
5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E

5|$|On {{the left}} side of the altar are also two retablos. The larger altar, which is a twin of the altar {{opposite}} it, houses an image of a unidentified saint on the topmost level, presumably Michael the Archangel, and the crucified Christ (originally <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child)</b> in the center, Saint Anthony of Padua on the middle-left, and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino on the middle-right niches. The original images on the lowest level have been replaced. The smaller retablo, also of the same style, houses the images of Saint Joseph with the child Jesus, and St Isidore the Laborer on the lower and upper level, respectively. In the sacristy is another retablo, with a crucifix in its central niche. On the doorframes of the sacristy are two bas-reliefs depicting Saint Ignatius and the first Jesuits before Mary and the child Jesus and of St. Ignatius holding a book (in stucco).|$|E
5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the left-hand wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both left-hand panels, the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child</b> are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the <b>Madonna</b> <b>and</b> <b>Child.</b> As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E
