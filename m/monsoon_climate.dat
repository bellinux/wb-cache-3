50|$|Tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} found in South and Central America. However, there are sections of South Asia, Southeast Asia, Africa (particularly West and Central Africa), the Caribbean and North America that also feature this climate.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are only}} two types within the [...] "C" [...] or {{subtropical}} climate group, Cs which is a dry -summer or Mediterranean climate, and a Cf or humid Subtropical climate. Cw types occur within the Cf group and mean subtropical <b>Monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> (like much of east Asia).|$|R
5000|$|... 3. A lengthy wet {{season and}} a {{relatively}} short dry season. This version features seven or more wet season months and five or less dry season months. This version's precipitation pattern is similar to precipitation patterns observed in some tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates,</b> but does not experience enough rainfall during the wet season to be classified as such.|$|R
25|$|Belmopan {{features}} a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> (Am) under the Köppen climate classification. The {{city has a}} lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. As is the characteristic of several cities with a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> Belmopan sees some precipitation during its dry season. March and April are Belmopan's driest months with roughly 45mm of rainfall observed on average during those months. Like Belize City, these are somewhat unusual months for {{a city with a}} tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> to have its driest months of the year. Typically the driest month for a city with this climate type is the month after the winter solstice, which in Belmopan would be January. Average monthly temperatures are somewhat constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from 23°C to 28°C.|$|E
25|$|Olango has a {{tropical}} climate, which is typical to the Central Visayas. Most {{months of the}} year are marked by significant rainfall. The short dry season has little impact. This location is classified as Am (Tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate)</b> by Köppen–Geiger climate classification system.|$|E
25|$|Maceió has {{a typical}} {{tropical}} climate, specifically a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification: Am), with very warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and trade winds blowing from the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Changing {{pressure}} {{patterns that}} affect the seasonality of precipitation also occur in Africa though it generally differs from the way it operates in Asia. During the high-sun season, the Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) induces rain. During the low-sun season, the subtropical high creates dry conditions. The <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> of Africa, and the Americas for that matter, are typically located along tradewind coasts.|$|R
50|$|Deepwater rice {{is grown}} in {{tropical}} <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> normally around river deltas and their floodplains mainly in backswamps and natural levees. The {{nature of the}} flood is important for success of deepwater rice, with timing {{and the rate of}} rise of water affecting survival and crop density. Generally, the flood water comes from rainfall or rises in the water table. In places with low rainfall, water overspilling from rivers can flood rice-producing areas.|$|R
50|$|Sihanoukville {{lies in the}} Tropical <b>monsoon</b> (Am) <b>climate</b> zone. The {{city has}} two seasons: a wet season and a dry season.|$|R
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Malaysia, Penang has a {{tropical}} climate, specifically a tropical rainforest climate bordering on a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> though Penang does experience slightly drier conditions from December to February of the following year. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the wind system.|$|E
25|$|Rice paddy {{agriculture}} {{has existed}} in Southeast Asia {{for thousands of}} years, ranging across the subregion. Some dramatic examples of these rice paddies populate the Banaue Rice Terraces {{in the mountains of}} Luzon in the Philippines. Maintenance of these paddies is very labour-intensive. The rice paddies are well-suited to the <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> of the region.|$|E
25|$|As the Himalayas {{block the}} north-Asian bitter cold winds, the {{temperatures}} are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For most part, {{the climate of}} the region is called the <b>Monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of jute, tea, rice, and various vegetables in this region.|$|E
30|$|Landslides are {{important}} geological events {{in many parts}} of the world. Himalaya is extremely vulnerable to natural disasters due to its geology, steep slopes, high relief and <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates.</b> The active tectonics in the Himalaya is responsible for the generation of faults, crushed zones, and several sets of joints that make the rocks weak, resulting in steep hill slopes susceptible to sliding (e.g. Dadson et al. 2004; Kirby and Whipple 2012; Chen et al. 2015 a, 2015 b).|$|R
5000|$|Lowlands {{around the}} Equator {{generally}} have a tropical rainforest climate, {{also known as}} an equatorial climate, though cold currents cause some regions to have tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> with a dry season {{in the middle of}} the year. Average annual temperature is around [...] during the day and [...] at night. Rainfall is very high, from 2500 to 3500 mm per year. Average rainy days are around 200 per year and average annual sunshine hours around 2,000.|$|R
30|$|The biotic pump {{offers an}} {{alternative}} explanation. The switch between dry and wet conditions found in <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> {{arises from the}} positive feedbacks that occur as the predominant difference in evaporation rates kick the prevailing winds from a land-to-sea to a sea-to-land configuration (Makarieva and Gorshkov 2007; Sheil and Murdiyarso 2009; Makarieva et al. 2013). The most extreme seasonal switch occurs in the boreal forests where transpiration and thus inland moisture transport is predicted and observed only when transpiration can occur (Makarieva et al. 2013; Sheil 2014).|$|R
25|$|The {{climate is}} {{classified}} as a Tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> meaning the daily mean temperature from month to month is never less than 64.4°F (18°C), {{and there is a}} distinct wet and dry season. Rainfall is common in relative abundance throughout most of the year, although there is less rain than in the eastern coastal valleys. The land, however, is fertile and deep.|$|E
25|$|Kismayo has a Tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> (Köppen climate classification). Weather is hot year-round, with {{seasonal}} monsoon {{winds and}} irregular rainfall with recurring droughts. The gu rains, {{also known as}} the Southwest Monsoons, begin in April and last until July producing significant fresh water and allowing lush vegetation to grow. The gu season is followed by the xagaa (hagaa) dry season.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the rest}} of Sierra Leone, Bunce Island has a {{tropical}} climate with a rainy season that runs from May to October; {{the balance of the}} year represents the dry season. At {{the beginning and end of}} the rainy season, strong thunderstorms occur. Under the Köppen climate classification, Bunce Island has a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> mainy because of the large quantity of precipitation it receives during the rainy season.|$|E
5000|$|Sihanoukville {{lies in the}} Tropical <b>monsoon</b> (Am) <b>climate</b> zone. The {{city has}} two seasons: a wet season and a dry season. Monthly averages range from [...] in January to [...] in July.|$|R
500|$|Northern Guyana has two wet seasons: one {{in early}} spring {{and the other in}} early winter. In western Africa, there are two rainy seasons across {{southern}} sections, but only one across the north. Within the Mediterranean climate regime, the west coast of the United States and the Mediterranean coastline of Italy, Greece, and Turkey experience a wet season in the winter months. [...] Similarly, the wet season in the Negev desert of Israel extends from October through May. [...] At the boundary between the Mediterranean and <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> lies the Sonoran desert, which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime.|$|R
5000|$|The humid or <b>monsoon</b> {{subtropical}} <b>climate</b> {{is often}} {{located on the}} western side of the subtropical high. Here, unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours in the hot season. In the winter (dry season) the monsoon retreats, and the drier trade winds bring more stable airmass and often dry weather. Areas that have this type of subtropical climate include Australia, Southeast Asia, parts of South America, and the deep south of the United States. [...] Monsoon regions with a wet season include western Mexico. the Desert Southwest of the United States, [...] Within the Mediterranean climate regime, the west coast of the United States and the Mediterranean coastline of Italy, Greece, and Turkey experience a wet season in the winter months. [...] Similarly, the wet season in the Negev desert of Israel extends from October through May. [...] At the boundary between the Mediterranean and <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates</b> in North America lies the Sonoran desert, which receives the two rainy seasons associated with each climate regime.|$|R
25|$|Laterites {{are formed}} from the {{leaching}} of parent sedimentary rocks (sandstones, clays, limestones); metamorphic rocks (schists, gneisses, migmatites); igneous rocks (granites, basalts, gabbros, peridotites); and mineralised proto-ores; which leaves the more insoluble ions, predominantly iron and aluminium. The mechanism of leaching involves acid dissolving the host mineral lattice, followed by hydrolysis and precipitation of insoluble oxides and sulfates of iron, aluminium and silica under the high temperature conditions of a humid sub-tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like all provinces {{in north}} and north central of Vietnam, {{there are four}} {{distinct}} seasons in Đồng Hới. In the spring, it is cool, humid and foggy. The average annual temperature is 24.40C, average rainfall varies from 1,300 to 4,000mm, total sunshine hours per year is 1,786 hours, average annual moisture is around 84%. The city has <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> with three types of wind: south-east (gió nồm), south-west (gió nam), and north-east.|$|E
25|$|Shanxi has a {{continental}} <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate,</b> and is rather arid. Average January temperatures are below 0°C, while average July temperatures are around 21–26°C. Winters are long, dry, and cold, while summer {{is warm and}} humid. Spring is extremely dry and prone to dust storms. Shanxi {{is one of the}} sunniest parts of China; early summer heat waves are common. Annual precipitation averages around , with 60% of it concentrated between June and August.|$|E
50|$|The {{climate is}} typical of the Punjab plains i.e. hot in summers and cold in winters. It has sub-tropical {{continental}} <b>monsoon</b> type <b>climate.</b> Intensive cultivation in the district leaves no scope for forest cover and the wild life is practically nonexistent.|$|R
50|$|Medha Khole (born May 12, 1967) is an Indian Meteorologist. She is {{currently}} the Deputy Director (Weather Forecasting) of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune.

40|$|Although {{reliable}} {{figures are}} often missing, considerable detrimental changes due to shrinking glaciers are universally expected for water availability in river systems {{under the influence}} of ongoing global climate change. We estimate the contribution potential of seasonally delayed glacier melt water to total water availability in large river systems. We find that the seasonally delayed glacier contribution is largest where rivers enter seasonally arid regions and negligible in the lowlands of river basins governed by <b>monsoon</b> <b>climates.</b> By comparing monthly glacier melt contributions with population densities in different altitude bands within each river basin, we demonstrate that strong human dependence on glacier melt is not collocated with highest population densities in most basins...|$|R
25|$|The {{climate of}} the onshore stretch of the basin ranges from {{tropical}} savanna climate (Aw), tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> (Am) and tropical rainforest climate (Af) to a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). The onshore portion of the Santos Basin is in the Serra do Mar coastal forests ecoregion of the Atlantic Forest biome. On the islands of the Superagüi National Park in the Santos Basin, the endemic critically endangered Superagüi lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara) has its restricted habitat.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the country lies within the Tropical savanna climate zone, as the coastal areas in the South and West receive noticeably more and steady rain {{before and during the}} wet season. These areas constitute the easternmost fringes of the south-west monsoon, determined to be inside the Tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate.</b> Countrywide there are two seasons of relatively equal length, defined by varying precipitation as temperatures and humidity are generally high and steady throughout the entire year.|$|E
25|$|As {{with nearly}} {{all parts of}} Malaysia, Alor Setar {{features}} a tropical <b>monsoon</b> <b>climate</b> under the Köppen climate classification. Alor Setar has a very lengthy wet season. As is common in several regions with this climate, precipitation is seen even during the short dry season. Temperatures are relatively consistent {{throughout the course of}} the year, with average high temperatures around 32 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures around 23 degrees Celsius. Alor Setar sees on average roughly 2300mm of precipitation per year.|$|E
50|$|The Yangtze Delta has {{a marine}} <b>monsoon</b> {{subtropical}} <b>climate,</b> with {{hot and humid}} summers, cool and dry winters, and warm spring and fall.
