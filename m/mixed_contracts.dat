Results it was stated that marketing is the final stage of innovation process which is commercializing the innovation i. e. obtains profit through its sales therefore it is important to allocate the contractual structures that mediate sales and distribution of innovative products. It is shown that using contractual forms of organization of innovative products sales the parties determine the marketing scheme for the produced goods and thereby create modify and stop the property relations of the parties thus the contracts whose ultimate goal of signing and execution is marketing of innovations can be identified as organizational by their legal nature. The contractual forms that mediate marketing of innovative products include the contracts of sale agency agreements presented in the Russian civil legislation by the contract of agency contract of commission and agency agreements as well as franchising agreements.

40|$|Given the broad-ranging {{implications}} {{associated with}} having a dispute decided by a federal court pursuant to the court’s admiralty jurisdiction, potential parties to a dispute have strong motivations to either avoid a court sitting in admiralty or ensure the court hears the controversy under the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction. Prior to 2004, the legal test used by courts {{to determine whether or}} not they could hear a contractual dispute involving a contract with both maritime and non-maritime elements (“mixed contract”) pursuant to their admiralty jurisdiction was relatively straight forward. Under that test, a court could exercise admiralty jurisdiction to hear a mixed contractual dispute where the non-maritime portion of the contract was (1) merely incidental to the overall contract or (2) the non-maritime portion of the contract could be separated from the maritime portion of the contract. According to the above test, where the maritime and non-maritime claims were bound together and could not be separated, the court would dismiss the entire case, even the maritime portion of the contract, for a lack of admiralty jurisdiction. This test was relatively straight forward and fairly easy to apply to contractual disputes. However, in 2004, the U. S. Supreme Court handed down its decision in Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. Kirby, whereby the jurisdictional test was fundamentally changed. The rule asserted by the Court in Kirby focused on the maritime portions of the mixed contract and, according to this new test, a court could decide a contractual dispute involving a mixed contract under the exercise of its admiralty jurisdiction where the maritime portions of the contract were substantial, even when the dispute centered on non-maritime elements of the contract. Whereas the Court’s jurisdictional approach to <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts</b> as asserted in Kirby may have made sense with regard to contracts for multi-modal transportation, the application of the test by Circuit Courts has provided anything but uniformity or predictability with regard to other types of <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts.</b> This lack of uniformity or predictability in the application of the general maritime law through the exercise of courts’ admiralty jurisdiction is not a desirable outcome, especially as a predominant goal of admiralty practice in American courts has always been uniformity. This judicial emphasis on uniformity is best explained in the Supreme Court’s decision in The Lottawanna where the Court specifically stated: One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several States, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the States with each other or with foreign states. Given this disparity in the several Circuit Courts’ application of the Kirby test for <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts,</b> and the broad goal of admiralty jurisdiction to provide uniformity in its application of the general maritime law, the application of the Kirby test should be limited to multi-modal transportation contracts. With regard to other types of <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts,</b> the courts should take a different approach, specifically tailored to determine the substantiality of the maritime elements of that particular type of contract. The above approach would better facilitate the uniformity and predictability of maritime practice that courts have aspired to maintain since the beginning of the federal system of government in the United States. As such, this Article examines the three main types of contracts confronted by the courts in their application of the rule asserted in Kirby. These three main types of contracts include: (1) multi-modal transportation contracts exemplified by “through-bills of lading” (and other contracts with objective geographic elements); (2) master service agreements or blanket contracts common in the offshore oil rig context; and (3) umbrella or bumbershoot insurance policies that provide coverage for both shore-side and maritime risks. While master service agreements and multi-modal transportation contracts will be discussed herein, much of the jurisdictional confusion has been centered on mixed coverage insurance policies; therefore, this Article will focus on that issue area. In examining the application of the modern jurisdictional test for the aforementioned mixed contract types, this Article will begin by investigating the basis for the courts’ admiralty jurisdiction, looking at the historical, constitutional, statutory, and precedential origin of modern jurisprudence over admiralty jurisdiction. Through this prism, this Article will discuss the impact the Supreme Court’s decision in Kirby had on the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction over <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts.</b> By looking at the various Circuit Courts’ applications of the Kirby test, this Article seeks to illustrate the confusion the Supreme Court’s decision in Kirby has caused. Based on this examination, this Article asserts that courts have done an altogether inadequate job of formulating a uniform, cohesive, and predictable rule or set of rules with which to determine which marine insurance contracts—that provide both sea-side and shore-side risk coverage—are sufficiently “salty” to justify the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction for resolving controversies arising from such policies. Additionally, this Article argues that given the magnitude of the implications associated with the exercise of admiralty jurisdiction in resolution of contractual disputes, such as the use of general maritime law or the availability of admiralty-specific procedural devices, the Supreme Court has done the maritime industry a great disservice in its failure to formulate an understandable and applicable set of jurisdictional rules. As such, commercial interests would be better served by a coherent, uniform, and predictable rule or set of rules so as to more effectively negotiate and draft contracts and resolve disputes derived therefrom. Given this reality, the Kirby rule should be limited in its application to multi-modal transportation contracts and other contracts involving an element of geographic movement or insurance coverage thereof and master service agreements, as applied inGrand Isle Shipyard, Inc. v. Seacor Marine, LLC. But with regard to mixed insurance policies, the Supreme Court should follow the Second Circuit’s approach as discussed herein...|$|E

The focus of this paper is on the choice of contract instruments to incentivise the provision of {{ecosystem service}} outputs from farms. The farmer is better informed than the regulator in terms of hidden information about costs and hidden-actions relating to effort. The results show that with perfect information, the regulator can contract equivalently on inputs or outputs. With hidden information, input-based contracts are more cost effective at reducing the informational rent related to adverse selection than output-based contracts. <b>Mixed</b> <b>contracts</b> are also cost-effective, especially where one input is not observable. Such contracts allow the regulator to target variables that are “costly-to-fake” as opposed to those prone to moral hazard such as effort. Further results are given for fixed price contracts and input-based contracts with moral hazard. The model is extended to include a discussion of repeated contracting and the scope that exists for the regulator to benefit from information revealed by the initial choice of contract. The models are applied to a case study of contracting with farmers to protect high biodiversity native vegetation that also provides socially-valuable ecosystem services. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

The model of improved revenue-sharing contract is optimized when the market demand is in the additive form or in the multiplicative form with price dependent demand.

40|$|Abstract — Traditional {{contracts}} for network and computing resources are of “static ” type where {{the customer is}} buying {{the right to use}} for a given price a fixed amount of resources {{for a long period of}} time. Typical examples are the case of contracting bandwidth in access networks and VPNs and the case of computing infrastructure that a customer leases (or buys) for fulfilling its IT needs. Current technology in access networks and Grid computing allows suppliers to offer more flexible contracts to their customers allowing them to choose dynamically the amount of resources they are allowed to use at a given time. This flexibility may benefit the customers with bursty demand since it allows them to obtain resources only when they need them and pay only when they use them. We define contracts where time is discrete and a customer is allowed to buy a fixed amount of resources ahead of time for a price a, the “static ” part of the contract, and complement this at each new time period by purchasing an extra amount at price b, the “dynamic ” part of the contract. We investigate the properties of such contracts and compare them with contracts of purely static or dynamic type. Our results suggest that in general suppliers and customers are both better off when using such <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts,</b> and that purely dynamic contracts may not always be preferable compared to purely static ones. We also show that under price competition of suppliers using static contracts against suppliers using dynamic contracts, at the equilibrium both suppliers may secure some profit by segmenting the market.

40|$|According to the Labour Code of 1974 the {{employment}} relationship is an obligation between a single employee and an employer. The basis {{of such a}} relationship is {{the employment}} contract concluded with each employee separately. The Polish labour legislation does not provide for the institution of so-called group employment relationships concluded by several people jointly {{on the one hand}} and an employer on the other. However, such contracts appear in connection with a new trend of introducing in state enterprises so-called group forms of work organization. By virtue of such contracts, a voluntarily established group of people assumes the obligation of performing jointly a given production task for a stated remuneration which is later divided among the members of a group by the independent decision of the whole group. According to the majority opinion of legal scholars, such contracts are not a legally separate type of contracts but are in fact only a sum of so-called „autonomous clauses", i. e. contractual stipulations which complement the contents of employment contracts concluded by an employer with each individual member of a group. The author criticizes the above view and tries to prove that the basis of employing in a group system of work is a separate contract for collective labour which may be characterized as an innominate contract concluded between an employer {{on the one hand and}} a group of employees on the other. The above contract is a source of a so-called joint obligation on the part of the members of a group. The said contract is not the employment contract yet it contains elements typical for a contract of employment as well as a contract for performing a specified task or work and — with respect to relations between the members of a group — elements similar to those appearing in the partnership contract. A complex structure of those group contracts indicates that they are <b>mixed</b> <b>contracts</b> (a type of innominate contracts) imposing the obligation to achieve a stated effect and burdening the employment with a part of the risk to carry out that task. Since the employment contract components prevail, the said contracts are subject to the labour law regulation. Hence, the members of a group enjoy full protection granted by the labour law to people employed by virtue of contracts falling under the Labour Code provisions. The author postulates to adopt the provisions regulating the said type of innominate contracts in the amendments to the Labour Code. In his way a new type of a contract — a contract for rendering collective work — would appear in the Polish labour law. The author agrees in principle that it is high time to break away from a stereotype of the employment contract as a due diligence contract (locatio conducilo operarum), radically different from a contract for performing a specified task or work (locatio conductio operis). The elimination of differences between those two kinds of contracts finds justification in the world trends to make the labour law more flexible in response to the incoming „third wave" of the civilization of our epoch.

Uninformed buyers must either forfeit their warranty protection or resort to an expensive court determination of the Code’s applicability. This Article proposes a “penalty default” of applying the Code in consumer contracts that involve both goods and services. The new default rule would induce sellers to provide warranty information to buyers at the time of contracting. When sellers failed to provide information, buyers would receive warranties that sellers could not easily refuse to honor. If states adopted the proposal, therefore, buyers and sellers would decide warranty applicability during negotiations.

This setting {{gives rise to a}} nonconvex budget set and an efficient budget constraint (the upper envelope of contract-specific budget sets). We apply our model to data collected on specialist physicians working in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Our data set contains information on each physician’s labour supply and their work effort (as proxied by clinical services per hour worked). It also covers a period of policy reform under which physicians could choose between two compensation systems: the traditional fee-for-service, under which physicians receive a fee for each service provided, and mixed remuneration, under which physicians receive a per diem as well as a reduced fee-for-service. We estimate the model using a discrete choice approach. We use our estimates to simulate labour-supply elasticities and to predict (ex ante) the effects of contract on physician behaviour. Our results show that physician services and effort are more sensitive to contractual changes than is their time spent seeing patients; time spent on administrative duties and teaching is also sensitive to contractual changes. Our results also suggest that a mandatory reform, forcing all physicians to adopt the mixed remuneration system, would have had substantially larger effects on physician behaviour than those observed under the voluntary reform...|$|R

The Nyambaga Green Team successfully sustains itself through a <b>mix</b> of <b>contracts</b> {{with a range of}} natural resource management and other bodies which it carries out on a commercial basis.   At both locations a diverse range of significant cultural, social and economic benefits are emerging which the paper outlines. It then discusses some of the factors and conditions for success in these ventures and reflects briefly on the policy implications. Image: Nyambaga Indigenous Green Team, Nambucca Head...|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for greater {{efficiency}} and cost-containment, many health systems have introduced the practice of medical care providers operating under a fixed budget, {{often referred to as}} the capitation or fundholding contract. Although the capitation contract seems equitable at first glance, the sequential decision-making practice of providers—shaped by their rate of present-preference and their attitude toward the risk of running out of budget—may result in serious violations of basic equity principles. We propose a variable soft (or <b>mixed)</b> payment <b>contract</b> (VSC), where the share of the retrospective payment increases over time, as a way to make the contracts more equitable. We also discuss how the parameters of the capitation contract (length of the budget period, soft or hard contracts, solo vs. consortium practice etc.), which are usually set by efficiency criteria, may have serious implications with regard to the equity of the system.
