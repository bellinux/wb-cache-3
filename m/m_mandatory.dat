The two right columns include information from MARC 21 Format for Bibliographic Data: National Level Record [...] -Bibliographic: Full Level & Minimal Level. K y to the values in the columns: A — Mandatory if applicable. A data element that must be presentin a bibliographic record if it is appropriate for the item being described and if the bibliographic information is available. <b>M</b> — <b>Mandatory.</b> A data element that must be present in every bibliographic record.

40|$|In vitro {{propagation}} of Oroxylum indicum Vent. {{was carried out}} using cotyledonary node explants. Among {{the different types of}} cytokinins used for culture establishment, 6 -benzyladenine exhibited the best response with higher concentrations (8. 87 mu M or above) for inducing multiple shoots. Inclusion of indole- 3 -acetic acid (2. 85 mu M) into 6 -benzyladenine-supplemented medium triggered a high frequency of response as well as a proliferation of shoots. The best medium for proliferation was Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium with 6 -benzyladenine (8. 87 mu M) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (2. 85 mu M). However, incorporation of gibberellic acid (1. 44 mu <b>M)</b> was <b>mandatory</b> to enhance shoot elongation. Repeated subculturing of cotyledonary node and in vitro developed nodal segments in MS medium with 6 -benzyladenine (4. 44 mu M) at 4 -week intervals resulted in continuous mass multiplication of shoots without any evidence of decline. Root induction was best (91. 6 %) when MS strength was reduced to one-quarter and combined with a-naphthalene acetic acid (2. 69 mu M) and indole- 3 -acetic acid (5. 71 mu M), with a high survival rate (70 - 72 %) of plantlets hardened in either soil rite or soil: sand: soil rite (1 : 1 : 2) ...|$|R
40|$|Pulli kolam is a {{ubiquitous}} {{art form}} in south India. It involves drawing a line looped around {{a collection of}} dots (pullis) place on a plane such that three mandatory rules are followed: all line orbits should be closed, all dots are encircled and no two lines can overlap over a finite length. The mathematical foundation for this art form has attracted attention over the years. In this work, we propose a simple 5 -step topological method by which one can systematically draw all possible kolams {{for any number of}} dots N arranged in any spatial configuration on a surface. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figures, version 2 has corrected Fig. 10, and added a new figure 11. Discussion following Eq. 1 has been modified.

40|$|Background]: Carotid artery {{occlusion}} {{can lead}} to the development of rare true posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms because of hemodynamic stress on the PCoA. Surgical treatment of these lesions is challenging. [Case Description]: The authors report a case of a true PCoA aneurysm that developed and ruptured 37 years after ligation of the ipsilateral common carotid artery for epistaxis. The lesion was successfully treated with clipping of the distal M 1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) after the occipital artery-radial artery free graft-MCA bypass, which led to extreme reduction in collateral flow through the PCoA. A cortical branch, located just proximal to the obliteration site, functioned as a sufficient flow outlet. The aneurysm shrank, and the patient has been doing well without any symptoms for 5 years after surgery. [Conclusions]: M 1 obliteration combined with high-flow extra-intracranial bypass might be a promising option for a true PCoA aneurysm, and therapeutic design that leaves a sufficient flow outlet on the <b>M</b> 1 is <b>mandatory</b> to avoid unexpected occlusion of the M 1 and its perforators...|$|R
