25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E
25|$|The blacking-warehouse was {{the last}} house on the {{left-hand}} side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, {{and the sound of}} their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.|$|E
500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ... How did I feel this when my daughter, Allegra, died! While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could not live without her.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{outside the}} Pearl, Eko sees Yemi and follows {{him into an}} open field, where Yemi tells him {{it is time for}} Eko to confess his sins. Eko says he has not sinned, having not chosen the life he was given and that Eko had only done what he needed to do to survive. An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster. An arm of smoke attacks Eko, beating him into trees before he is slammed into the ground. Locke and the others rush out of the station to find a bloodied Eko. Locke {{approaches}} Eko, who whispers his dying words into Locke's ears. Sayid asks what he said, and Locke replies, [...] "We're next." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

[...] She ran multiple other clinics and tennis outreach programs {{over the next three}} decades, and coached numerous rising competitors, including Leslie Allen and Zina Garrison. [...] "She pushed <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were a pro, not a junior," [...] wrote Garrison in her 2001 memoir. [...] "I owe the opportunity I received to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look at <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson chose [...] "Montaigne; or, the Skeptic" [...] as {{a subject}} {{of one of his}} series of lectures {{entitled}} Representative Men, alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In [...] "The Skeptic" [...] Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, [...] "It seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience." [...] Friedrich Nietzsche judged of Montaigne: [...] "That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth". Sainte-Beuve advises us that [...] "to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose he}} had heard I was freshly passed and without {{experience}} as an officer, because he turned about and looked <b>me</b> over <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had been exposed for sale.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2016, an Israeli {{woman named}} Renee Rabinowitz {{filed a lawsuit}} against El Al after being {{involved}} in an incident where an ultra-Orthodox man refused to sit next to her on a flight from Newark International Airport to Tel Aviv and the flight attendants asked her to move seats. By her own admission though, she was happy to oblige after talking to her seatmate. [...] She was however upset that [...] "The flight attendant treated <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was stupid”. El Al has insisted that there was no gender discrimination on El Al flights, that the flight attendant had made it clear to Ms. Rabinowitz that she was in no way obligated to move. [...] Much as with any seating issue on flights, including overweight or disabled passengers, the airline always tries to find amicable solutions.|$|E
2500|$|Libby {{told the}} grand jury [...] "it seemed to <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was {{learning}} {{it for the first}} time" [...] when, according to his account, Russert told him about Plame on July 10 or 11, 2003. Only later, when looking at his calendar and notes, Libby said, did he remember that he actually learned the information from Cheney in June 2003. Libby told {{the grand jury}}: [...] "In the course of the document production, the FBI sent us a request for documents, or Justice Department, I'm not sure technically. In the course of that document production I came across the note that is dated on or about June 12, and the note... shows that I hadn't first learned it from Russert, although that was my memory, I had first learned it when he said it to me." [...] The note Libby referred to contains no suggestion that either Cheney or Libby knew at the time of Ms. Wilson's undercover status or that her identity was classified, but they do show that Cheney did know and told Libby that Ms. Wilson was employed by the CIA and that she may have helped arrange her husband's trip.|$|E
