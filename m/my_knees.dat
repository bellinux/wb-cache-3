25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} know how to dive into the base because I was getting {{strawberries}} on <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna's further {{inspiration}} for the track came from the Catholic belief of transubstantiation. She introduced liturgical words in the track, but changed the context so that the lyrics had dual meaning. With superficial pop lyrics about sexuality and religion on the surface, the song had different meaning underneath to provoke reaction from her listeners. Leonard {{explained that he was}} not comfortable with the lyrics and the sexual innuendos present in it. He gave the example of the first verse for [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] which goes [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer, I'm down on <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> I wanna take you there." [...] Leonard understood that the dual meaning referred to someone performing fellatio. Being aghast he requested that Madonna change the line, but she was adamant about keeping it.|$|E
500|$|Another {{character}} departure was Smalljon Umber, {{played by}} Dean S. Jagger. In an interview, Jagger {{talked about his}} casting: [...] "I prayed for it. When I heard I got the part <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> buckled. It was a life-changing moment." [...] Before becoming a professional actor, Jagger dug trenches and worked at a mattress factory to pay his way through acting school and was a professional rollerblader. Ian Whyte also made his last appearance in [...] "Battle of the Bastards" [...] as the giant, Wun Wun; he had played Gregor Clegane during the show's second season. Special-effects supervisor Joe Bauer said about Whyte's casting as Wun Wun, [...] "We wanted a large performer because somebody who would be 14, 15 feet tall would have more weight and mass to move around, and a person who's a normal size would have {{a very difficult time}} pulling that off".|$|E
500|$|When South Pacific {{opened in}} London in November 1951, the reviews were mixed. [...] London's Daily Express praised the music but disliked other {{elements}} of that show, writing, [...] "We got a 42nd Street Madame Butterfly, the weakest of all the Hammerstein-Rodgers musicals. The Daily Mail suggested, [...] "The play moved so slowly between its songs that it seemed more like South Soporific." [...] The Times applauded the songs but indicated that [...] "before the end the singing and the dancing have dwindled to almost nothing, while the rather sad little tale is slowly and conventionally wound up." [...] The Manchester Guardian, however, noted the anticipation {{in advance of the}} opening and concluded that [...] "there was no disappointment... the show bounces the audience and well deserves the cheers." [...] Drama critic Kenneth Tynan of The Spectator wrote that South Pacific was [...] "the first musical romance which was seriously involved in an adult subject... I have nothing to do but thank Logan, Rodgers and Hammerstein and climb up from <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> a little cramped from the effort of typing in such an unusual position." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{began her}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado. The gig required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. Although she enjoyed singing and dancing, she disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, [...] "I never really knew what the lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism." [...] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and {{artistic director of the}} Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams relocated to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the [...] "security and schedule" [...] of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: [...] "I had a lot of recurring injuriesbursitis in <b>my</b> <b>knees,</b> pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. My body was wearing out." ...|$|E

2500|$|She did {{not claim}} that she fought until being wounded, {{but she did}} say her weapon jammed {{immediately}} and {{that she could not}} have done anything anyway. Interviewed by Diane Sawyer, Lynch claimed, concerning the media and the Pentagon: [...] "They used me to symbolize all this stuff. It's wrong. I don't know why they filmed [...] or why they say these things." [...] She also stated [...] "I did not shoot, not a round, nothing. I went down praying to <b>my</b> <b>knees.</b> And that's the last I remember." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I'm {{not ashamed}} to say that I shed tears almost {{all the way through}} and that when the play was {{finished}} I rushed up to her and fell to <b>my</b> <b>knees</b> at her feet. The human drama, the play of a woman's great valor and an artist's truth, her own, far superseded, and even eclipsed, to my eye, the performance of my own play." [...] The director remarked that her performance exceeded Jessica Tandy and Vivien Leigh's in the role. However, the initial reviews had decided the production's fate, and the producer pulled the plug after 15 performances.|$|E

At the press conference announcing his retirement, Dierdorf said, [...] "This was an easy decision for me to make[...] [...] [...] Physically, I just can't play the type of game I want to."

By the time [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] was cut, Paul Williams' contributions to the Temptations' recordings had been reduced, and the group had Otis Williams' old associate Richard Street lined up as Paul Williams' replacement.
