2500|$|The first {{carriages}} {{used by the}} Inverness & Nairn Railway were of {{the short}} four-wheeled type and had accommodation for first and third class. A <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> made in 1858 for the Inverness to Keith route survived until 1903; this was [...] long, and fitted with Newall's chain brake. Luggage was carried on the roof, behind a railing, where {{there was also a}} seat for the guard, and dogs were placed in a boot. Later carriages did not have the seat for the guard and space for luggage on the roof. Longer carriages were ordered for the line to Wick, [...] long, and these seated 50 passengers in third class. Six-wheeled carriages were introduced in the late 1870s, the first class seating sixteen passenger with access to toilets and the third class seating fifty passengers; these were still lit by oil lamps. Second class accommodation was available after the direct line to Perth opened, but this was not popular as it offering little extra comfort over third class, and was abolished in 1893. A six-wheeled carriage built at Lochgram in 1909 has been preserved by the Scottish Railway Preservation Society.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{the service}} was {{provided}} by about 24 trams and {{the same number of}} trailers: the earliest date from 1893 and almost all are pre-1910. Two of the three cars that opened the line in 1893 are still in use, and are the oldest electric trams at work on their original line in the world. The design pre-dates any consensus on design, and they have distinctive boxy bodies. Most services are operated by a motor car towing a single trailer, although later cars can haul two trailers. This has never been common practice (in recent years this has included in a few [...] "special" [...] services as part of the long-running series of events) although it was not uncommon for cars to haul a box-van for freight and, until 1975, a <b>mail</b> <b>van.</b> In September 1975 the line was closed between Laxey and Ramsey and the contract with the Post Office was lost, but in 1977 the Ramsey section was reopened. Since then a limited winter service has operated on weekdays, suspended in 1998 as an economy measure. The line operates a seasonal timetable with services terminating at Laxey or Ramsey, with some short workings in connection with the Groudle Glen Railway in peak season, and limited evening operation as far as Laxey in peak season to tie in with evening services on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which since 2009 has provided a weekly Sunset Dinner service including a meal at the summit. The possibility of a limited evening service to Ramsey has been considered in recent times and trams are sometimes chartered during summer for enthusiasts' excursions.|$|E

50|$|Horse-drawn <b>mail</b> <b>vans</b> were {{replaced}} by automotive <b>mail</b> <b>vans.</b> These were commercial vans. For example, over almost two decades the U.K. General Post Office purchased 50,000 Morris Minor light commercial vehicles for use as either <b>mail</b> <b>vans</b> or telephone engineer vans. These Morris Minor vans became a familiar sight, {{and at least one}} survived until 1982 to sport the livery of British Telecom. The GPO vehicles were special order vehicles, and not quite the same as the commercial Morris Minor LCVs. The early series vans had one seat, no heater, and headlamps fitted {{to the front of the}} vehicle on rubber wings (US: fenders). Later series adhered more closely to conventional LCV norms, but differences remained. The Series III GPO Morris Minor van, for example, had a Yale lock on the driver's door.|$|R

Except for their own coup, the cable-cars, with their flaming foreheads, and the {{mechanical}} clangor of their gongs at the corners, seemed to have it altogether to themselves. A tall, lumbering United States <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> rolled by, and impressed my friend in the coup with a cheap and agreeable sense of mystery relative to the letters it was carrying to their varied destination at the Grand Central Station. He listened with half an ear to the child's account of the fun she had at the party, and he watched with both eyes for the sight of the men waiting at the bakery for the charity of the midnight loaves.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} by Hollingshead, mail vans in the United Kingdom were originally horse-drawn, operating {{in conjunction with}} the railway network, including Travelling Post Offices, carrying mail between railway stations and places distant from them, and between sub-post offices and sorting offices. Some of these vans were of the Brougham type. In the 1880s the General Post Office began hiring larger enclosed box vans from McNamara & Company. These vans had elliptical spring front suspension, semi-elliptical spring rear suspension, a double driving seat, and mail coach style headlamps. These were frequently called mail coaches, although unlike actual mail coaches they carried no passengers. At least six regular long-distance, i.e., not just to and from local railway stations, <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> services out of London existed in the late 19th century. A London-to-Chatham <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> service ran until the summer of 1908, and one <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> service ran from London to Oxford until 1909.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, he {{launched}} {{what is called}} the first conversion of a <b>mail</b> delivery <b>van</b> into a hybrid electric vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars were}} built over a steel truss underframe, with wooden bodies {{constructed}} with cedar and clerestory roofs to give ventilation and daytime lighting. Nighttime lighting was initially provided with Pintsch gas, and six-wheeled bogies with eight brake blocks each (two outside the outer wheels and two each per centre wheel) under all vehicles. Drop-toilets for both genders were provided in all passenger vehicles except the dining cars, along with staff toilets in the twelve <b>mail</b> <b>vans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1907/8, two 60'2" [...] <b>mail</b> <b>vans</b> were {{constructed}} by Newport Workshops {{as part of}} the E car order. They were classed as EEB 1 and 2 and were externally similar to their DVE cousins, except that they lacked the guard's cupolas and vestibules on either end of the carriage http://pjv101.net/fts/u01/aa025.jpg. Rather, the EEB cars were entirely empty save for two internal semi-partitions for strength, to be used for the transport of twenty tons of mail only.|$|R

50|$|The Chinese half cent {{stamp of}} 1898 was surcharged 5 cents and overprinted BRA. The stamps wereused for {{collection}} {{of a late}} letter fee on letters posted in a <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> on British operated railways.|$|E
50|$|With the {{completion}} of the Steel Bulk <b>Mail</b> <b>van,</b> one second-class carriage was deleted from the standard Spirit of Progress consist, to give eleven cars with four first-class and three second-class. This left one of each class spare, for a rotating maintenance schedule. If one of the other cars was unavailable, Murray could be replaced with the Long W type carriage Avoca; Steel Bulk Mail could be replaced with 1D, a 1929-build steel replacement for a destroyed E-type <b>mail</b> <b>van,</b> and the Steel CE could be replaced with a normal, timber CE. There was no replacement for the Parlor car; if this was faulty {{it would have to be}} removed from the train.|$|E
50|$|In the 1910 recoding {{the class}} was altered to ZDS, {{following}} the principle where the two bogie guard & <b>mail</b> sorting <b>vans,</b> previously DDMS, became CDS.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Great Central Railway on 15 March 1899, built to the {{standard}} GCR arrangement of having an island platform set between the two main running lines. The platforms are 400 ft long, capable of accommodating consists of up to 8 coaches and/or <b>mail</b> <b>vans.</b> The station buildings are unique on the preserved railway, the only station with a complete canopy, the longest in railway preservation. The station was closed by British Rail under the Beeching Axe, on 5 May 1969.|$|R
50|$|By April 1910, the WS fleet {{numbered}} 1 - 120. In the 1910 recoding, the WS class letters became simply _W__. The {{vehicles were}} re-numbered {{in the process}} which makes research from the Diagram Books difficult. Construction and conversion into this group continued after April 1910 as the 'W' class and in that number group.TypesThe WS class includes conversions from: _AB_ First/Second class fixed wheel cars, _B__ / _BH_ Second class fixed wheel cars, _E__ <b>mail</b> <b>vans</b> and _D__ Guards Vans. 1-8WS became 2-9W; 10-12WS became 1-3WW; 13-118WS became 11-118W.|$|R
50|$|According to A. Wallis Myers of the Daily Telegraph and the Daily <b>Mail,</b> <b>Van</b> Zyl {{was ranked}} in the world top ten in 1965, 1966, and 1968, {{reaching}} a career high of World No. 6 in those rankings in 1965 and 1966.|$|E
50|$|As steel sitting {{cars were}} {{introduced}} on The Overland, the sitting E type carriages were replaced, condemned and withdrawn from service. <b>Mail</b> <b>van</b> 1D {{had been destroyed}} at Glenorchy in 1923, while the 1929 Callington derailment had claimed earlier Joint Stock vehicles 5AE, 9BE and 2D.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, in the United States {{automotive}} mail vans {{used by the}} United States Postal Service were modified commercial vehicles. From June 1929 to March 1932, for example, the Ford Motor Company sold Model A and Model AA chassis to the USPS, whose regional garages {{would then}} outfit them with <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> bodies (in oak or white ash) painted in the USPS colours. These bodies came from five companies: the York-Hoover Body Company, of York, Pennsylvania; the Mifflinburg Body Company, of Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania; the August Schubert Wagon Works, of Syracuse, New York; the Metropolitan Body Company, of Bridgeport, Connecticut; and the General Motors Truck Company, of Pontiac, Michigan. In total, 400 such mail vans were built on the 1929 Model A chassis, 400 on the 1929 Model AA chassis, 1,000 on the 1931 Model A chassis, and 2,500 on the 1931 Model AA chassis. [...] One such 1931 Ford Model A <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> can be seen exhibited in the National Postal Museum in Washington, D.C.The first door to door mail truck was manufactured by the Twin Coach Company of Kent, Ohio, in 1954. It was first used by the Warren, Ohio, Post Office 4 August 1954, under Postmaster Sam Verlenichwho posed with five carriers next to their trucks, for the historic photograph {{on the front page}} of the Warren Tribune Chronicle.The <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> used by the USPS for local deliveries since the late-1980s is the Grumman LLV. LLV stands for Long Life Vehicle. This is a custom-made <b>mail</b> <b>van</b> manufactured by Grumman Corporation, whose US$1.1 billion contract with the USPS was for 99,150 vehicles in 1986. They were originally intended to last for 24 years, three times the lifetime of the mail vans that they replaced. Production of the LLV began in April 1987 in Grumman's plant in Montgomery, Pennsylvania. The vehicle is built on a General Motors chassis, is 175 in long, weighs 3000 lb, can carry up to 1000 lb of mail, and is driven by a 2.5 litre General Motors four-cylinder engine. In 1991, Grumman was awarded a further US$555 million contract for a further 43,500 vehicles.|$|E

The ZL would be the easiest conversion, because the only 1:87 scale change would be the [...] "L" [...] in the code. It would be relatively straightforward to backdate the kit to the D van, or postdate the van to ZD, ZL, ZP or ZZ types. Parts from the kit could be recycled, in conjunction with Steamandthings's carriage side etchings to construct a new body for passenger and <b>mail</b> <b>vans.</b>|$|R
