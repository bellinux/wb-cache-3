5|$|The Arnolfini {{is named}} after Jan van Eyck's {{masterpiece}} The Arnolfini Portrait (1434) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini.

The painting is in the National Gallery, London and it was one of the founder's favourite paintings.|$|E

25|$|The title L'Oiseau bleu (The Blue Bird) can {{be traced}} back to a French {{literary}} fairy tale by Madame d'Aulnoy (1650/1651 – 4 January 1705), published in 1697. When d'Aulnoy termed her works contes de fées (fairy tales), she originated the term that is now generally used for the genre. Prince Charming, in the story, is transformed by the fairy godmother into a blue bird. Aside from the subject of the title of Madame d'Aulnoy's story, there is further iconographic evidence in Metzinger's painting that suggests a link between the two. The first relates to the woman gazing into a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side of Metzinger's painting.|$|E
25|$|In his {{municipal}} planning work, Leavitt {{became a}} forceful practitioner of the City Beautiful architectural {{movement of the}} day. His design for the Lake Mirror Promenade in Lakeland, Florida, executed in the 1920s, {{is one of the}} best-known examples of the emerging movement in city planning which altered the course of landscape design and changed the face of urban planning. The promenade circles the side of Lake <b>Mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side of downtown, and incorporated a loggia, a pedestrian area with a mix of public and private buildings, and a large open circle of lawn designed to accommodate an obelisk sculpture (that was never built). The promenade, with its columns and other architectural elements, was meant to evoke ancient Rome or Greece.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

25|$|With the {{eventual}} outcome {{in terms of}} both votes and seats varying substantially from the bulk of opinion polls released in the final months before the election, the polling industry received criticism for their inability to predict what was a surprisingly clear Conservative victory. Several theories have been put forward to explain the inaccuracy of the pollsters. One theory was that there had simply been a very late swing to the Conservatives, with the polling company Survation claiming that 13% of voters made up their minds in the final days and 17% {{on the day of the}} election. The company also claimed that a poll they carried out a day before the election gave the Conservatives 37% and Labour 31%, though they said they did not release the poll (commissioned by the Daily <b>Mirror)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concern that it was too much of an outlier with other poll results.|$|E
25|$|While {{all these}} {{surgical}} advances were taking place, many important developments were also {{taking place in}} the science of optics. Many new optical instruments with medical applications were invented during the 19th century. In 1805, a German army surgeon named Philipp von Bozzini (1773–1809) invented a device he called the lichtleiter (or light-guiding instrument). This instrument, the ancestor of the modern endoscope, was used to examine the urethra, the human urinary bladder, rectum, oropharynx and nasopharynx. The instrument consisted of a candle within a metal chimney; a <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside reflected light from the candle through attachments into the relevant body cavity. The practice of gastric endoscopy in humans was pioneered by United States Army surgeon William Beaumont (1785–1853) in 1822 with the cooperation of his patient Alexis St. Martin (1794–1880), a victim of an accidental gunshot wound to the stomach. In 1853, Antonin Jean Desormeaux (1815–1882) of Paris modified Bozzini's lichtleiter such that a mirror would reflect light from a kerosene lamp through a long metal channel. Referring to this instrument as an endoscope (he is credited with coining this term), Desormeaux employed it to examine the urinary bladder. However, like Bozzini's lichtleiter, Desormeaux's endoscope was of limited utility due to its propensity to become very hot during use. In 1868, Adolph Kussmaul (1822–1902) of Germany performed the first esophagogastroduodenoscopy (a diagnostic procedure in which an endoscope is used to visualize the esophagus, stomach and duodenum) on a living human. The subject was a sword-swallower, who swallowed a metal tube with a length of 47 centimeters and a diameter of 13 millimeters. On 2 October 1877, Berlin urologist Maximilian Carl-Friedrich Nitze (1848–1906) and Viennese instrument maker Josef Leiter (1830–1892) introduced the first practical cystourethroscope with an electric light source. The instrument's biggest drawback was the tungsten filament incandescent light bulb (invented by Alexander Lodygin, 1847–1923), which became very hot and required a complicated water cooling system. In 1881, Polish physician Jan Mikulicz-Radecki (1850–1905) created the first rigid gastroscope for practical applications.|$|E

[...] "From that time on the cruel Queen ruled all alone, her every word was law, and all trembled in mortal fear of her anger." [...] The vain Queen owned a magical mirror with which she could look upon whatever she wished. The Magic Mirror shows a haunted, smokey face of her familiar demon which replies to the Queen's requests. She regularly asks the mirror who is the fairest in the realm ("Magic <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, who is the fairest one of all?" [...] which is often misquoted as [...] "Mirror <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall, who is the fairest of them all"), and the mirror would always reply that she is.|$|E

500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the <b>mirror</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
