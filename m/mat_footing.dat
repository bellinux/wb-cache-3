40|$|ARAMPATZIS, A., G-P. BRU ¨ GGEMANN, and G. MOREY KLAPSING. A {{three-dimensional}} shank-foot {{model to}} determine the foot motion during landings. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 34, No. 1, 2002, pp. 130 – 138. Purpose: The {{purposes of this study}} were a) to develop a model of the foot capable of describing the foot motion during dynamic movements and b) to study the influence of different <b>mats</b> on <b>foot</b> motion during landing in gymnastics. Methods: Six female gymnasts (height: 1. 63 0. 04 m, weight: 58. 21 3. 46 kg) participated in this study. All six gymnasts carried out barefoot landings, falling from 80 and 115 cm onto three mats each with a different stiffness (hard, medium, and soft). Three synchronized digital high-speed video cameras (250 Hz) captured the motion of the left shank and foot. At the same time, the reaction forces between <b>mat</b> and <b>foot</b> at the forefoot and rearfoot were measured by two instrumented insoles (Paromed, 1000 Hz). The kinematics of the tibiotalar, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid joints were examined. The lower leg and the foot were modeled by means of a multi-body system, comprising seven rigid bodies. For each joint, two joint coordinate systems attached on each of the connected segments were defined. Results: The mat stiffness did not show any influence on the maximal reaction forces or on the kinematics of the tibiotalar joint. For the soft mat, higher maximal eversion angles at the talonavicular and the calcaneocuboid joints were measured. Conclusions: The relative motion between forefoot and rearfoot was influenced by changing mat stiffness. Therefore, the construction of the mat influenced the motion of the foot. The observation of only the tibiotalar joint is not enough when studying the influence of different <b>mats</b> on <b>foot</b> motion. The functional benefit of the mechanica...|$|R

The singles game involves a single winker playing against another single winker, each playing two colors of winks in alternation.|$|R

50|$|Three {{separate}} but related recalls of automobiles by Toyota Motor Corporation {{occurred at the}} end of 2009 and start of 2010. Toyota initiated the recalls, the first two {{with the assistance of the}} U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), after reports that several vehicles experienced unintended acceleration. The first recall, on November 2, 2009, was to correct a possible incursion of an incorrect or out-of-place front driver's side floor <b>mat</b> into the <b>foot</b> pedal well, which can cause pedal entrapment. The second recall, on January 21, 2010, was begun after some crashes were shown not to have been caused by floor mat incursion. This latter defect was identified as a possible mechanical sticking of the accelerator pedal causing unintended acceleration, referred to as Sticking Accelerator Pedal by Toyota. The original action was initiated by Toyota in their Defect Information Report, dated October 5, 2009, amended January 27, 2010. Following the floor mat and accelerator pedal recalls, Toyota also issued a separate recall for hybrid anti-lock brake software in February 2010.|$|R

60|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the grass, squatted a score of Hawaiians. Well-muscled, broad-shouldered, they were all {{strapping}} men. Brown-skinned, with luminous brown eyes and black, their features large and regular, they showed all the signs of being as good-natured, merry-hearted, and soft-tempered as the climate. To all of which a seeming contradiction was given by the ferociousness of their accoutrement. Into the tops of their rough leather leggings were thrust long knives, the handles projecting. On their heels were huge-rowelled Spanish spurs. They had the appearance of banditti, save for the incongruous wreaths of flowers and fragrant maile that encircled the crowns of their flopping cowboy hats. One of them, deliciously and roguishly handsome as a faun, with the eyes of a faun, wore a flaming double-hibiscus bloom coquettishly tucked over his ear. Above them, casting a shelter of shade from the sun, grew a wide-spreading canopy of Ponciana regia, itself a flame of blossoms, out of each of which sprang pom-poms of feathery stamens. From far off, muffled by distance, came the faint stamping of their tethered horses. The eyes of all were intently fixed upon the solitary sleeper who lay on his back on a lauhala <b>mat</b> a hundred <b>feet</b> away under the monkey-pod trees.|$|R
40|$|The calf {{management}} on {{the farm}} is generally of a good standard. There are proper management systems in place with regard to both nutrition and housing of the calves and heifers. Considering feet, leg disease and injury, along with gastrointestinal disease are the major issues in animals prior to calving, further steps {{should be taken to}} address these problems. Improved colostrum management and vaccination programs are straightforward ways of negating deaths accredited to gastrointestinal disease. Enhanced stable and hoof management would significantly reduce deaths and cullings caused by feet and leg disease and injury. Regular manure removal, hoof paring, floor <b>mats</b> and <b>foot</b> baths should all be practiced to avoid unnecessary loss of life and productivity. Metabolic disease is the other major problem, which is also very preventable when a proper nutrition program is implemented with the milking herd. After heifer rearing targets are achieved, it seems shortsighted that animals only survive for a limited number of lactations, and do not regularly reach the fourth, fifth or sixth lactation. This is where mature milk yields are produced, and where the farmer can significantly benefit from reaching calving targets and improve profit margins. The benefit of meeting age and weight targets means there is a lower cost involved compared with not realising targets. This figure has been calculated in other studies to be in the region of $ 1. 50 per day. When all heifers {{on the farm}} are considered, this number can become extremely high and {{can be used as a}} way of highlighting the importance of a well run and coordinated management system. Incidence of dystocia and stillbirth were more or less as expected on any large dairy farm. Greater consideration should be given to heifers that conceive at 15 months, as it is this group that are more inclined to have problems even though they are of a good weight. In fact they may be over-conditioned, and so examination of other parameters such as height, body condition score, and pelvic width could give an early warning of any future obstetrical problems, together with improved observation around calving time...|$|R
60|$|He went forth, and dined in the Criterion: {{a dinner}} in consonance, {{not so much}} with his purse, as with the admirable wine he had discussed. What with one thing and another, it was long past midnight when he {{returned}} home. A cab was at the door; and entering the hall, Somerset found himself {{face to face with}} one of the most regular of the few who visited Mr. Jones: a man of powerful figure, strong lineaments, and a chin-beard in the American fashion. This person was carrying on one shoulder a black portmanteau, seemingly of considerable weight. That he should find a visitor removing baggage in the dead of night, recalled some odd stories to the young man's memory; he had heard of lodgers who thus gradually drained away, not only their own effects, but the very furniture and fittings of the house that sheltered them; and now, in a mood between pleasantry and suspicion, and aping the manner of a drunkard, he roughly bumped against the man with the chin-beard and knocked the portmanteau from his shoulder to the floor.

Every article of furniture, from the chairs that came into the world with me and have worn so much better, though I was new and they were second-hand, to the mantle-border of fashionable design which she sewed in her seventieth year, having picked up the stitch in half a lesson, has its story of fight and attainment for her, hence her satisfaction; but she sighs at sight of her son, dipping and tearing, and chewing the loathly pen.|$|R
