50|$|In 1878 it was {{proposed}} by a Hill End committee to sacrifice the pony mail run from Bathurst to Hill End via the Bridle Track {{in lieu of}} keeping a six-day a week mail coach via Peel and Sofala. This {{was in response to}} the Postmaster General deciding to reduce the coach <b>mail</b> to three <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week. It appears that the Bridle Track pony mail was discontinued as in 1878 a petition was started to recommence a mail run from Bathurst to Hill End via the Bridle Track.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s, the {{operations}} had outgrown even the expanded facilities at the Terminal Annex. The facility's volume had grown {{by the mid-1980s}} to 14 million pieces of <b>mail</b> <b>per</b> <b>day,</b> and the annex was plagued by inadequate space, overcrowding and inadequate work areas. Accordingly, the Postal Service Board of Governors in 1984 approved {{the construction of a}} new $151 million general post office in South Los Angeles. Almost 50 years after Terminal Annex became the city's main mail-processing facility, the new processing facility in South Central opened in 1989.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the large}} volume of mail that Psychiana was {{receiving}} and sending daily, the Moscow Post Office received a Class A Rating; which the post office still operates under today. As the religion began to grow, the religion began to outgrow the headquarters. In March 1934, they moved into a “beautiful, new concrete and brick building” which adorned the lots that Robinson acquired from the Shorts two years earlier. The new building contained an air change apparatus and could also accommodate up to three working crews, {{as well as the}} immense volumes of business. Psychiana employed approximately one hundred employees, and each employee handled up to 50,000 pieces of <b>mail</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> The headquarters received an average of 1,300 pieces of correspondence each day.|$|R

40|$|The Priority Inbox {{feature of}} Gmail ranks mail by the {{probability}} that the user will perform an action on that mail. Because “importance ” is highly personal, we try to predict it by learning a per-user statistical model, updated as frequently as possible. This research note describes the challenges of online learning over millions of models, and the solutions adopted. 1 The Gmail Priority Inbox Many Gmail users receive tens or hundreds of <b>mails</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> The Priority Inbox attempts to alleviate such information overload by learning a per-user statistical model of importance, and ranking mail by how likely the user is to act on that mail. This is not a new problem [3, 4], however to do this at scale, performing real-time ranking and near-online updating of millions of models <b>per</b> <b>day</b> significantly complicates the problem. The challenges include inferring the importance of mail without explicit user labelling; finding learning methods that deal with non-stationary and noisy training data; constructing models that reduce training data requirements; storing and processing terabytes of per-user feature data; and finally, predicting in a distributed and fault tolerant way. While ideas were borrowed from the application of ML in Gmail spam detection [6], importance ranking is harder as users disagree on what is important, requiring a high degree of personalization. The result {{is one of the largest}} and most user facing applications of ML at Google...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} {{based on how}} e-mail {{is used as a}} work tool for {{communication}} within an organisation was conducted. Interviews was based on questions concerning communicative, cognitive and technical aspects. The ten users interviewed was selected by strata from an earlier questionnaire study. The strata was based on the variables job category, amount of received and sent <b>mail</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> and experienced problems with handling e-mail. results show that although the e-mail system is entered continuously this is not experienced as disturbing other work activities but rather having a positive effect. Users experience of problems correlate with number of messages stored in inbox (. 72). The users experiencing the time for handling mail as not being enough experience problems with e-mail and give examples of communication problems. Despite of number of messages in inbox and experience of time the users have difficulties with organising stored messages into folders and catalogues. When building the structure no metaphor is used. The users explain that the structure is developed over time and when it is to large or not well functioning it takes to much tome to rearrange it. Among the stored mail there are messages saved with the purpose to keep old addresses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the changes in pain, dysfunction, and grip strength of patients with acute lateral epicondylitis and to suggest the appropriate treatment frequency and period. [Subjects] The subjects were divided into three: 2 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week group (n= 12), 3 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week group (n= 15), and 6 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week group (n= 13). [Methods] All groups received conventional physical therapy for 40 minutes and thera-peutic exercises for 20 minutes per session during 6 weeks. The outcome measurements were the visual analogue scale (VAS), Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE), and grip strength. [Results] The results of this study were as follows: at 3 weeks, there were no significant differences in VAS and PRTEE in the 3 groups, but at 6 weeks, 6 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week group significantly decreased these two outcomes. Grip strength was significantly increased in 3 and 6 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week groups at 6 weeks. [Conclusion] In conclusion, physical therapy is needed 3 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week for 3 weeks in patients with acute lateral epicondylitis.

40|$|The {{experiments}} were undertaken {{to investigate the}} changes in triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol, blood sugar, lactic acid and non -protein nitrogen levels of plasma immediately after the moderate physical training of different frequencies for 10 weeks in mice. Results obtained were as follows. 1) Triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and blood sugar levels were significantly lower in both the groups which were trained {{at the rate of}} 3 and 5 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week than in the untrained group. 2) Though {{there was no significant difference}} in tnglycende and free fatty acid levels between the two groups trained at the rate of 3 and 5 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week, total cholesterol and blood sugar levels were significantly lower in the group trained at 5 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week than in the group trained at 3 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week. 3) As to lactic acid and non-protein nitrogen levels, there seemed to be no significant difference between the group trained at 3 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week and the untrained group. 4) Content of the blood components described above have indicated no significant increase or decrease in the group trained at the rate of 1 <b>day</b> <b>per</b> week. From results mentioned above, it was found that training of 3 <b>days</b> <b>per</b> week is necessary for getting an effective difference in triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
