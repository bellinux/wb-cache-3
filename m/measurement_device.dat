5|$|The Copenhagen interpretation, Part I ("There is no deep reality.") Most notably {{associated}} with Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, Herbert identifies {{this as the}} most broadly accepted interpretation among physicists. In this interpretation, dynamic attributes do not describe the reality of quantum objects themselves, but inhere instead {{in the relationship between}} the observed object and the <b>measurement</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using noncontact <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> in oxy-acetylene torch ablation testing for UHTCs has been investigated. UHTCs are candidate materials {{for use in}} hypersonic and atmospheric re-entry vehicles for their oxidation resistance and thermal capabilities and an oxy-acetylene torch rig {{is being used to}} screen materials that show promise for these applications. Non-contact temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> have been used for similar testing, but there are some potential issues regarding their use, such as changing emissivity of the UHTCs and combustion interferences. The {{feasibility of}} using non-contact temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> will be evaluated through the use of thermocouples and a two-color pyrometer to measure sample surface temperature {{for the duration of the}} experiment. The reliability of non-contact temperature <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> can be measured in comparison to thermocouples and comparison of the results will indicate if these non-contact <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> are reliable and practical for use in oxy-acetylene torch ablation testing...|$|R

It is a gnomon, a device {{designed}} to cast a shadow {{on the ground in}} order to determine the position of the sun in the sky. In early modern times, other gnomons were also built in several Italian and French churches in order to better calculate astronomical events. Those churches are Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, San Petronio in Bologna, and the Church of the Certosa in Rome. These gnomons ultimately fell into disuse with the advent of powerful telescopes.|$|E

[...] In the second half of 2010, the testing forum applied STEP-NC to set up compensation with on-machine measurement of part and fixture datums using a FaroArm portable <b>measurement</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{differences}} between Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) {{are important and}} {{should be kept in}} mind when administering either of these drugs. Care and caution should always be taken in administering doses of Tincture of Opium, {{such as the use of}} a dosage syringe or other suitable <b>measurement</b> <b>device,</b> and by pharmacists in preparing Paregoric from Laudanum, and to note that the dosages in this article refer to Apothecaries weight and fluid measure. In particular, [...] "the difference between a minim and a drop should be borne in mind when figuring doses. A minim is always a sixtieth part of a fluidrachm regardless of the character of the substance, while a drop varies from a forty-fifth to a two-hundred-and-fiftieth part, according to the surface tension of the fluid." [...] Tincture of Opium (Laudanum) and Camphorated Tincture of Opium (Paregoric) each have 50.9 drops per gram; 50.0 drops per cc; 185.0 drops per fluid drachm; and 3.10 drops per minim." [...] The importance of these distinctions is evident in view of the dangers of erroneously relying upon more general descriptions of Apothecaries' fluid measures, which typically list 60 minims per fluid dram, and 8 fluid drams per fluid ounce (480 minims).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{everyday}} world, {{it is natural}} and intuitive to think of everything (every observable) as being in an eigenstate. Everything {{appears to have a}} definite position, a definite momentum, a definite energy, and a definite time of occurrence. However, quantum mechanics does not pinpoint the exact values of a particle's position and momentum (since they are conjugate pairs) or its energy and time (since they too are conjugate pairs); rather, it provides only a range of probabilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability. Therefore, it is helpful to use different words to describe states having uncertain values and states having definite values (eigenstates). Usually, a system will not be in an eigenstate of the observable (particle) we are interested in. However, if one measures the observable, the wave function will instantaneously be an eigenstate (or [...] "generalized" [...] eigenstate) of that observable. This process is known as wave function collapse, a controversial and much-debated process that involves expanding the system under study to include the <b>measurement</b> <b>device.</b> If one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement, one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible eigenstates. For example, the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a wave packet centered around some mean position x0 (neither an eigenstate of position nor of momentum). When one measures the position of the particle, it is impossible to predict with certainty the result. It is probable, but not certain, that it will be near x0, where the amplitude of the wave function is large. After the measurement is performed, having obtained some result x, the wave function collapses into a position eigenstate centered at x.|$|E

A variety of devices have been {{and will continue to}} be used for measuring turbidity in different watershed studies. It would be of great benefit if data from different locations could be compared through post-processing. The main objectives of this study are to quantify differences among several turbidity <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> and to determine the magnitude of the potential errors associated with attempts to standardize turbidity data. If a relationship between two <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> is insensitive to the suspension being measured, then conversions between different devices can easily be made once the relationship is established. Otherwise, conversions will introduce errors that could influence conclusions and two sensors might rank the same set of samples differently. This investigation compares eight turbidity <b>measurement</b> <b>devices</b> that are commonly used to measure turbidity in field or laboratory settings. The devices are compared in 24 different sediment samples, each mixed to seven different concentrations, from te...|$|R
