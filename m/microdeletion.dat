Proximal <b>microdeletions</b> are known as a susceptibility factor for thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome, but it is unclear if these proximal <b>microdeletions</b> have other phenotypic consequences. Therefore, to elucidate the clinical significance of rearrangements of the proximal 1 q 21. 1 region, we evaluated the phenotypes in patients identified with 1 q 21. 1 rearrangements after referral for clinical microarray testing. We report clinical information for 55 probands with copy number variations (CNVs) involving proximal 1 q 21. 1 : 22 <b>microdeletions</b> and 20 reciprocal microduplications limited to proximal 1 q 21. 1 and 13 <b>microdeletions</b> that include both the proximal and distal regions. Six individuals with proximal <b>microdeletions</b> have TAR syndrome. Three individuals with proximal <b>microdeletions</b> and two individuals with larger <b>microdeletions</b> of proximal and distal 1 q 21. 1 have a 'partial' TAR phenotype. Furthermore, one subject with TAR syndrome has a smaller, atypical deletion, narrowing the critical deletion region for the syndrome. Otherwise, phenotypic features varied among individuals with these <b>microdeletions</b> and microduplications. The recurrent, proximal 1 q 21. 1 microduplications are enriched in our population undergoing genetic testing compared with control populations.

Methods A case-control study comprising male children of couples in which {{the man had been}} previously vasectomized and chose vasectomy reversal (n= 31) or in vitro fertilization with sperm retrieval by percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (n= 30) to conceive new children, and a Control Group of male children of fertile men who had programmed vasectomies (n= 60). Y-chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> research was performed by polymerase chain reaction on fathers and children, evaluating 20 regions of the chromosome. Results The results showed no Y-chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> in any of the studied subjects. The incidence of Y-chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> in individuals born from vasectomized fathers who underwent vasectomy reversal or in vitro fertilization with spermatozoa recovered by percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration did not differ between the groups, and {{there was no difference between}} control subjects born from natural pregnancies or population incidence in fertile men. Conclusion We found no association considering <b>microdeletions</b> in the azoospermia factor region of the Y chromosome and assisted reproduction. We also found no correlation between these Y-chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> and vasectomies, which suggests that the assisted reproduction techniques do not increase the incidence of Y-chromosome <b>microdeletions...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{characteristics of}} classical and partial deletions of the Y chromosome azoospermia factor (AZF) region transmitted from father to son by natural fertilization. METHODS: Patients from northeastern China with primary male infertility (n = 10) and their fathers were investigated. Healthy fertile {{men and women}} were recruited as positive and negative controls, respectively. The Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Serum concentrations of reproductive hormones were determined by electrochemi-luminescence immunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Expansions of <b>microdeletions</b> were observed in seven father–son pairs; de novo <b>microdeletions</b> were found in the remaining three father–son pairs. The Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> were larger in sons than in their fathers. Patients with infertility had significantly higher levels of follicle stimulating hormone and lower levels of inhibin B than fertile men.

40|$|ABSTRACT Male {{partners}} of infertile couples {{are known to}} frequently have abnormal semen parameters. Some of these cases are due to underlying genetic factors such as Y chromosome <b>microdeletions,</b> an abnormal karyotype or cystic fibrosis mutations. Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> generally cannot be detected by karyotyping. At our clinic we undertook a study of male {{partners of}} infertile couples to determine the frequency and common loci of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> in India, using the PCR technique. We studied 100 patients mainly having azoospermia (AZ) or oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT). Multiplex PCR analysis for 18 loci on the Y chromosome was carried out using commercially available kit (Promega Version 1. 1). Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> were observed in 12 / 100 (12 %) patients including 8 / 27 (29. 63 %) with azoospermia, 3 / 56 (5. 35 %) with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and 1 / 7 (14. 28 %) with only asthenoteratozoospermia. All loci of the DAZ gene were deleted along with DYS 237 and DYS 236 from AZFd in 5 / 27 (18. 52 %) azoospermic males studied. The most commonly deleted loci were DYS 240 in 11 / 12 (91. 67 %) and DYS 219 in 7 / 12 (58. 33 %) patients with <b>microdeletions.</b> The use of ICSI in such patients can lead to transmission of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> and subsequent infertility from father to son.

40|$|Background : It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that <b>microdeletions</b> of Yq {{may account for}} {{a significant proportion of}} men with infertility. Three nonoverlapping regions, referred to as "azoospermia factors" (AZFa, b, c from proximal to distal Yq) have been defined as spermatogenesis loci and deletions in these regions {{have been shown to be}} pathogenically involved in male infertility associated with azoospermia or severe oligospermia. Aims : Evaluation the frequency of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> in Iranian population. Materials and Methods : Fifty infertile men were selected. Semen analysis was done and on the basis of the mean sperm count, all patients were categorized into azoospermia and oligozoospermia, groups. Blood samples were obtained for DNA extraction and chromosomal analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood lymphocytes and amplified by sequence tagged sites-polymerase chain reaction (STS-PCR) method to determine the presence of <b>microdeletions</b> in AZF locus. A total of 34 STS primers including two controls were selected to identify <b>microdeletions</b> of Y chromosome on each subject. Results and Conclusion : 26 / 50 cases (52 &#x 0025;) showed deletion of at least one of the STS Marker. Totally 41 <b>microdeletions</b> was observed. A total of 17 cases (34 &#x 0025;) had deletion in one STS. Four oligospermia cases (8 &#x 0025;) had deletion in 2 STS site. Three azoospermia cases (6 &#x 0025;) had again deletion in 2 STS site, but in different STSs. One case had three deletions in three STS site and finally one individual had seven deletions in AZF locus. The overall frequency of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> observed in the present study was found to be 26 / 50 (52 &#x 0025;). Comparison of our data with the result of other investigators world wide shows that the incidence of Yq <b>microdeletions</b> in Iranian population is much higher than international frequency.

40|$|Introduction Y {{chromosome}} <b>microdeletions</b> are {{the second}} most frequent genetic cause of male infertility after Klinefelter's syndrome. Objective The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the frequency of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> in a group of infertile men with an idiophatic cause of infertility, candidates for microfertilization (Intra-cytoplasmic Sperm Injection - ICSI) in Serbia and to correlate genotype-phenotype in patients with Y chromosome <b>microdeletions.</b> METHOD One hundred and sixty patients with low sperm count (less than 5 x 106 spermatozoa/ml) were enrolled in the study. Forty patients were excluded from the study: ten because they were diagnosed with cytogenetic abnormality and thirty patients were diagnosed with other known causes of infertility. The control group consisted of 150 men who fathered at least one child in the last two years. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and two multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) analyses were performed using specific primers to confirm the presence or absence of Y chromosome <b>microdeletions.</b> Results <b>Microdeletions</b> were detected in 12 of 120 (10 %) cases, while no deletions were detected in the control group. Of total number of 12 deletions, nine were detected in AZFc region (75 %), one in AZFa (8 %), and two in AZFbc (17 %). Conclusion Testing for Y chromosome <b>microdeletions</b> should be considered as an important element in diagnosis and genetic counselling of infertile couples in Serbia.

40|$|Abstract—Y {{chromosome}} <b>microdeletions</b> are {{the most}} common genetic cause of male infertility and screening for these <b>microdeletions</b> in azoospermic or severely oligospermic men is now standard practice. Analysis of the Y chromosome in men with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia has resulted in the identification of three regions in the euchromatic part of the long arm of the human Y chromosome (Yq 11) that are frequently deleted in men with otherwise unexplained spermatogenic failure. PCR analysis of <b>microdeletions</b> in the AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions of the human Y chromosome is an important screening tool. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the type of <b>microdeletions</b> in men with fertility disorders in Slovakia. We evaluated 227 patients with azoospermia and with normal karyotype. All patient samples were analyzed cytogenetically. For PCR amplification of sequence-tagged sites (STS) of the AZFa, AZFb and AZFc regions of the Y chromosome was used Devyser AZF set. Fluorescently labeled primers for all markers in one multiplex PCR reaction were used and for automated visualization and identification of the STS markers we used genetic analyzer ABi 3500 xl (Life Technologies). We reported 13 cases of deletions in the AZF region 5, 73 %. Particular types of deletions were recorded in each region AZFa,b,c. The presence of <b>microdeletions</b> in the AZFc region was the most frequent.
