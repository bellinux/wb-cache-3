5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found to be}} more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed <b>mounting</b> incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex <b>mounting</b> incidents occurred between females.|$|E

5|$|Another type of <b>mounting</b> {{that became}} fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} {{characteristically}} shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this <b>mounting</b> were used for ceremonial purposes but also in warfare, as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, an {{examination}} of the pylon attachment points revealed damage to the wing's pylon <b>mounting</b> bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the <b>mounting</b> bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's <b>mounting</b> bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Hence investigators were able to conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash, rather than being caused by it.|$|E

5|$|Above the <b>mounting</b> {{platform}} was the stabilization gyro. This {{was connected}} to a wedge-shaped metal plate, causing the plate to rotate around a <b>mounting</b> point {{at the tip of}} the wedge. The rear part of the reflector sight was mounted at this point and the opposite end was supported by a rotating pintle inserted into a gudgeon mounted to the frame. Rolling the aircraft caused the gyro to rotate in the same direction, which was geared to cause the opposite motion in the reflector. As the sights worked by reflecting light off the reflector in the center, motion of the mirror would result in twice the motion of the aim point. To address this, the gyro was attached through levers with a 2-to-1 reduction.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} the {{decision}} was made, French shipyards were heavily committed to producing vessels for the French Navy. So, despite its intention to develop a French concept, the KSCS engaged Yarrow Shipbuilders in Glasgow, Scotland, to build the ships. Unlike the French, who preferred to install guns of their own manufacture, Yarrow was happy to order the guns from the Czechoslovak firm Škoda. The initial Yarrow design {{was based on an}} enlarged version of the British Shakespeare class, with five Skoda 14 cm/56 naval guns. Excessive top weight resulted in the deletion of one of the guns, to be replaced with a seaplane <b>mounting.</b> The final version replaced the seaplane <b>mounting</b> with improved anti-aircraft armament.|$|E

50|$|There are contradicting {{definitions}} of <b>Mount</b> Seppiko.

However, maps of the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan show the peak of <b>Mount</b> Mitsuji as the peak of <b>Mount</b> Seppiko.
