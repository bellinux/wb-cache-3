6000|$|With {{the crew}} {{it was a}} {{different}} matter. As soon as they had got drunk on the wines and spirits they had brought from the wreck, and then had got sober because they had drunk all the liquors up, they began to be more manageable; when their provisions ran short, and they were made to understand {{that they would not be}} allowed to plunder the fields and woods, or loot the villages for something to eat, they became almost exemplarily docile. At first they were disposed to show fight, and the principles of the Altrurians did not allow them to use violence in bringing them to subjection; but the men had counted without their hosts in supposing that they could therefore do as they pleased, unless they pleased to do right. After they had made their first foray they were warned by Cyril, who came from the capital to speak English with them, that another raid would not be suffered. They therefore attempted it by night, but the Altrurians were prepared for them with the flexible steel nets which are their only means of defence, and half a dozen sailors were taken in one. When they attempted to break out, and their shipmates attempted to break in to free them, a light current of electricity was sent through the wires and the thing was done. Those who were rescued--the Altrurians will not say captured--had hoes put into their hands the next morning, and were led into the fields and set to work, after a generous breakfast of coffee, bread, and mushrooms. The chickens they had killed in their midnight expedition were buried, and those which they had not killed lost no time in beginning to lay eggs for the sustenance of the reformed castaways.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} electrical percolation and resistive switching behaviors of silver nanowire-polystyrene composites, which represent the first measurements of electrical percolation and resistive switching in bulk polymer composites containing finite-L/D cylinders. The measured percolation thresholds (2 ̆ 6 phis;c) are more closely described by our simulations of networks of finite-L/D cylinders than by existing analytical models, which assume infinite L/D. Samples with compositions close to ilk also exhibit resistive switching at room temperature. We attribute this behavior to the field-induced formation of <b>metallic</b> <b>filaments</b> that bridge conductive nanowire clusters within the composites under sufficient applied fields. The reversibility of the switching {{depends on the}} sample composition, and reversible switching over 10 cycles was only observed for samples with volume fractions between 1 - 2 times 2 ̆ 6 phis; c.
