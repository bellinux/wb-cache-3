40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{quality assessment}} of <b>motion</b> <b>rendition</b> in digital video coding. Motion estimation and compensation are critical modules in video coders. A computational metric, {{based on a}} spatio-temporal model of the human visual system and of human motion sensing, is proposed and used to evaluate MPEG- 2 compressed video. The metric is able to assess the quality of <b>motion</b> <b>rendition</b> and exhibits a good correlation with subjective data. Keywords: Quality assessment, vision model, motion sensing, motion estimation, MPEG, test 1. INTRODUCTION Video transmission systems are currently {{in a state of}} transition from a completely analog system to a digital system. The digital system which will be extensively deployed will incorporate source coders employing the MPEG compression standards. Testing of such systems is problematic as the methodology to test digital video transmission systems has not been formalized and the analog testing methodology cannot be used for digital systems. A cruc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple {{iterative}} method to verify whether a coded bitstream conforms to a hypothetical reference decoder (HRD). A concept of maximum tolerate delay (MTD) is introduced {{to study the}} possible low-delay operation such that we can bound the degree of incorrect <b>motion</b> <b>rendition</b> caused by the variation in end to end delay {{in the neighborhood of}} big pictures. Our method can be used in the design of a rate control algorithm to improve the possibility for the coded bitstream that conforms to the HRD. 1. INTRODUCTION. When a digital video is compressed, the coded bit rate may vary significantly over time. The bitstream is usually transmitted over a channel at a constant bit rate (CBR). The buffer size of an encoded picture buffer (EPB) associated with an encoding process and tha...|$|E
50|$|Neo-noir is {{a modern}} or {{contemporary}} <b>motion</b> picture <b>rendition</b> of film noir. The term film noir (a term popularised by two French critics, namely, Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955), when translated from French to English, reads dark movie, indicating a sense of something sinister and shadowy. As a cinematic term film-noir is used to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, neo-noir being the same, but with updated themes, content, style, visual elements or media that were absent in the films of the film noir period from the 1940s and 1950s.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} the song was recorded by two the film's stars, Garrett Hedlund and Leighton Meester, for a companion album titled Country Strong (More Music from the <b>Motion</b> Picture). Their <b>rendition</b> charted at 79 in the United States and at 94 in Canada from digital sales, and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in February 2014.|$|R
40|$|The {{late twentieth}} century saw a surge in {{cinematic}} adaptations of Jane Austen’s novels, the films generating wide-spread interest and zeal from a new caste of modern-day Janeites, {{many of whom were}} previously unfamiliar with Austen’s work. While the notion of a Janeite culture based purely on <b>motion</b> picture <b>renditions</b> of the original novels is sure to displease literary purists, the purpose of this discussion is not to initiate a debate regarding our responsibility to remain faithful to Austen in her original form. Rather, this article identifies the type of cinematic alterations and emphases which render Austen films more appealing to a certain group of modern-day Janeites. It will be argued that modern-day audiences’ demand for recognisably modern protagonists necessitates the modernization of Austen on film. Thus, cinematic adaptations tend to emphasize Austen’s nascent feminism, re-imagining her heroines as more fiercely independent, lively and witty than their original incarnations. Through additional scenes, altered dialogue and substantial changes to the characters, film producers not only highlight the plight of women in the early nineteenth century, but also circumvent such restrictions by allowing their female protagonists the degree of independence demanded by modern-day audiences...|$|R
