2500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} in 2001 that researchers {{have not found}} sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of stress hormones. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a “free access” <b>maternity</b> <b>pen</b> configuration in which sows are in individual pens {{for the first four}} weeks of pregnancy but can “unlock” the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time. [...] Other researchers say the pigs' behavior does indicate chronic frustration. Sows in crates bite the bars, chew even when they have no food, and press their water bottles obsessively, all reportedly signs of boredom. The Post(uncited reference) writes that a report by veterinarians for the European Union concluded that abnormal behavior in sows [...] "develop when the animal is severely or chronically frustrated. Hence their development indicates that the animal is having difficulty in coping and its welfare is poor." ...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} infectious causes of diarrhea in adult dairy cattle with salmonellosis being most important. In my opinion, salmonellosis {{is the most}} important infectious disease of adult dairy cattle, regardless of clinical signs! The number of herds with Salmonella spp. infected cattle is estimated to be as high as 40 % (CEAH and NAHMS, 2009). Among infected cattle, clinical disease (diarrhea) can range from 0 % to nearly 100 % (epidemic) (Van Kessel et al., 2007). Epidemics usually occur when a new Salmonella serovar (often introduced from a newly purchased cow or from a feed source) is introduced into the herd. These epidemics may have a significant mortality, although most cows in the herd recover with supportive care within two weeks. Most recovered cows shed the organism in the manure in large numbers for three to four weeks and some become more chronic shedders. Farms that are endemically infected with a particular serovar may have sporadic diarrhea cases, often in periparturient cows or in cows with other medical conditions. A heavily contaminated <b>maternity</b> <b>pen</b> frequently serves as the source of infection for both cow and calf, and the stress of calving, early lactation, and other medical disorders enhance colonization of th...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of the dry cow management system (pasture or confined) on: (1) lying behaviour and activity; (2) feeding and heat stress behaviours; (3) intramammary infections, postpartum. Non-lactating Holstein cows were assigned to either deep-bedded, sand freestalls (n = 14) or pasture (n = 14) using rolling enrollment. At dry-off, cows were equipped with an accelerometer to determine daily lying time (h/d), lying bouts (bouts/d), steps (steps/d) and divided into periods: far-off (60 to 15 d prepartum), close-up (14 to 1 d prepartum), calving (calving date) and postpartum (1 to 14 d postpartum). Respiration rates were recorded once weekly from dry off to calving from 1300 to 1500 h. Feeding displacements were defined as one cow successfully displacing another from the feed bunk and were recorded once per week during the 2 h period, immediately after feeding at 800 h. Pastured cows were fed a commercial dry cow pellet during far-off and total mixed ration during close-up, with free access to hay and grazing. Freestall housed cows were fed a total mixed ration at far-off and close-up. Cows housed in freestalls were moved to a <b>maternity</b> <b>pen</b> with a mattress at commencement of labour. Pastured cows calved in pasture. After calving, all cows were commingled in a pen identical to the freestall housing treatment. Cows housed in freestalls laid down for longer during far-off and close-up periods, had fewer lying bouts during the calving period and took fewer steps throughout the study period when compared to pastured cows. Freestall housed cows experienced more displacements after feeding than did pastured cows. Respiration rates increased with an increasing temperature humidity index, more in pastured cows than in freestall housed cows. Pastured cows altered their lying behaviour and activity, suggesting a shift in time budget priorities between pastured and confined dry cows. Pastured cows also experienced less aggression around feeding but may be more susceptible to heat stress...|$|E
40|$|Risk factors {{associated}} to leptospirosis {{were identified in}} cows from São Paulo State. The State was divided into seven productive circuits from which 8, 216 cows older than 24 months of age from 1, 021 herds were sampled. For serological diagnosis of Leptospira spp. infection, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) was carried out. Of the investigated herds, 718 (71. 3 %; 95 % CI = 68. 5 % - 74. 0 %) presented at least one reactant animal at MAT to any serovar. Serovar Hardjo was the most prevalent, with 55. 2 % (95 % CI = 51. 4 % - 58. 9 %) of the positive herds. Herd size, animal purchase, share pasture, presence of ovine and swine, and utilization of artificial insemination were identified as risk factors. Utilization of <b>maternity</b> <b>pens</b> was a protective factor against leptospirosis...|$|R
40|$|This poster was {{presented}} at the UWEC Research day 2007 {{as well as at the}} Midwestern Conference of Parasitology in 2007. Cryptosporidium is a genus of protozoan parasites that live on the surface of epithelial cells in the digestive tract. They infect a wide range of vertebrates, including humans. Bovine cryptosporidiosis, primarily caused by infection with Cryptosporidium parvum, has long been associated with neonatal calf scours. When a major human outbreak occurred in Milwaukee in 1994, surface water contamination by agricultural runoff was identified as the source of infection. While Cryptosporidium has been reported worldwide, there have been no reports documenting the prevalence of this parasite in Wisconsin cattle. Sampling 11 different dairy farms, we analyzed fecal specimens from a total of 99 pre-weaned calves. We found that 42 of the calves were infected with the parasite, and calves 8 - 14 days of age were most likely to be infected. We suggest that contaminated soil and <b>maternity</b> <b>pens</b> are reservoirs for calf infections. Our results may indicate the widespread nature of cryptosporidiosis in Wisconsin dairy cattle. Consequently, veterinarians should consider Cryptosporidium when assessing herds that experience chronic calf scours. UWEC Office of Research and Sponsored Program...|$|R
40|$|Objective - To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} maintaining joint hospital and maternity pens;and persistence of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica serovar Newport on 2 dairy farms. Design - Observational study. Sample Population - Feces and environmental samples from 2 dairy herds. Procedure - Herds were monitored for fecal shedding of S enterica Newport after outbreaks of clinical disease. Fecal and environmental samples were collected approximately monthly from pens housing sick cows and calving cows and from pens containing lactating cows. Cattle shedding the organism were tested serially on subsequent visits to determine carrier status. One farm was resampled after initiation of interventional procedures, including separation of hospital and <b>maternity</b> <b>pens.</b> Isolates were characterized via serotyping, determination of antimicrobial resistance phenotype, detection of the CMY- 2 gene, and DNA fingerprinting. Results - The prevalence (32. 4 % and 33. 3 % on farms A and B, respectively) of isolating Salmonella from samples from joint hospital-maternity pens {{was significantly higher than}} the prevalence in samples from pens housing preparturient cows (0. 8 %, both farms) and postparturient cows on Farm B (8. 8 %). Multi-drug-resistant Salmonella Newport was isolated in high numbers from bedding material, feed refusals, lagoon slurry, and milk filters. One cow excreted the organism for 190 days. Interventional procedures yielded significant reductions in the prevalences of isolating the organism from fecal and environmental samples. Most isolates were of the C 2 serogroup and were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Management practices may be effective at reducing the persistence of MDR Salmonella spp in dairy herds, thus mitigating animal and public health risk...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{determine}} the prevalence and risk factors for shedding of Cryptosporidium spp. in dairy calves, a cross-sectional study was carried out in the northeastern region of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Fecal samples from a total of 552 calves from 27 dairy herds were collected, along with a questionnaire about management factors. Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were detected by light microscopy using Kinyoun staining. Putative risk factors were tested for association using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Oocyst shedding calves were found in 67 % (CI 95 %= 49 – 84) of herds (corresponding to a true herd prevalence of 98 %) and 16 % (CI 95 %= 13 – 19) of calves (corresponding to a true calve prevalence of 8 %). Within-herd prevalence ranged from 0 to 60 %, with a median of 8 %. Cryptosporidium spp. excretion was not associated with the type of liquid diet, gender, time the calf stayed with the dam after birth, use of antibiotics, blood presence in feces, and calving season. However, important highly significant risk factors of oocyst shedding of calves was an age of less or equal than 20 days (OR= 7. 4; 95 % CI 95 %= 3 – 16; P< 0. 0001) and occurrence of diarrhea (OR= 5. 5; 95 % CI 95 %= 2 – 11; P< 0. 0001). The observed association with young age strongly suggests an early exposure of neonatal calves to Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts in <b>maternity</b> <b>pens</b> and/or an age-related susceptibility. Association with diarrhea suggests that Cryptosporidium spp. is an important enteropathogen primarily responsible for the cause of the observed diarrheal syndrome. Results demonstrate that Cryptosporidium spp. infection is widespread in the study region. Monitoring and control of this parasitic protozoan infection in dairy herds is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to obtain {{data on the}} {{occurrence}} of Giardia duodenalis in calves in four major cattle rearing countries in Europe (Germany, UK, France and Italy), along with genotyping data and risk factors associated with these infections. A total of 2072 calves were sampled on 207 farms. The majority of the animals were Holstein dairy or mixed Holstein calves (n = 1565 or 75. 5 %), and were female (n = 1640 or 79. 1 %). The average age was 7. 8 weeks (SD= 4. 1; median= 7; range= 2 – 16 weeks). All fecal samples were tested using a commercially available monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. The overall apparent prevalence of G. duodenalis for the four countries was 45. 4 % (n = 942 / 2072) and the overall farm prevalence was 89. 9 % (186 / 207), with differences in both animal and farm prevalence between the four countries. The prevalence was significantly higher in animals up to 8 weeks (OR= 1. 88; P < 0. 001) compared to older calves, and several management factors including contact with the Dam, Frequency of cleaning of the <b>Maternity</b> <b>Pens,</b> and Disinfection of the Calf Housing {{were found to be}} associated with infection. Positive samples were withheld for genotyping using the β-giardin and triose phosphate isomerase gene: G. duodenalis assemblage E was most prevalent, although 43 % of the isolates were typed as assemblage A, with differences in between countries. Furthermore, 32 % of the examined samples was found to be a mixed assemblage A and E infection, which is consistent with previous reports. The {{results of the present study}} confirm previous findings in other European countries that G. duodenalis infections are common in calves. The infection especially occurs in animals younger than 2 months, and the proportion of positive animals gradually decreased with increasing age...|$|R
