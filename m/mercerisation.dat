Special treatments to the materials that add cost, such as <b>mercerisation</b> or labor-intensive hand-painting of colors, can influence a manufacturer's desired length per unit as well. Knitters and crocheters rewind the hanks into balls or centre-pull skeins prior to use, in order to prevent the yarn from becoming tangled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mercerisation</b> is a {{treatment}} for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric a lustrous appearance. The process is applied to materials like cotton or hemp. The process was devised in 1844 by John Mercer of Great Harwood, Lancashire, who treated cotton fibres with sodium hydroxide. The treatment caused the fibres to swell, which in Mercer's version of the process shrunk the overall fabric size and made it stronger and easier to dye. In 1890 H. A. Lowe held the yarn under tension during treatment. This prevented shrinking and gave the yarn or resulting fabric a lustrous appearance.Mercerisation alters the chemical structure of the fibre,inter-convertings from alpha-cellulose to a thermodynamically more favorable beta-cellulose polymorph thus swelling of the cell wall. This increases the surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel.|$|E
40|$|If a plasmatic CORONA {{discharge}} {{is applied}} in desized cotton fabrics, <b>mercerisation</b> is easily integrated {{in the chain}} of their wet preparation, meaning better whiteness and darker and cleaner colours in posterior direct dyeing, when compared with a <b>mercerisation</b> done in presence of an adequate wetting agent. This means that CORONA achieves fibre modifications which promote quicker penetration of the caustic soda inside the material. These results have great impact in the wet processing of cellulosic materials, meaning a reduction of pollution in the source, by eliminating the wetting agent, as well as an increase in <b>mercerisation</b> performance, with better whiteness and better dyeing effect in desized/mercerised materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{cleaning}} and swelling operations in cotton’s pre-treatment make it prepared for posterior dyeing and finishing. From those, <b>mercerisation</b> {{is the one}} able to confer a major increase in overall quality of the fibrous material. It consists in a very strong alkaline treatment of the cotton fabric maintained under a controlled tension. The effects of <b>mercerisation</b> are: improved lustre, higher ability to absorb dyes and other finishing products, better dimensional stability, higher mechanical properties and smoothness. <b>Mercerisation</b> changes structure of the fibre, the interfibrillar space swells, consequently changing the orientation on crystallite distribution. A decrystallization on native cellulose (Cellulose I) that is converted into Cellulose II occurs. Morphological alterations in cotton fibre are mainly related to transversal swelling and deconvolution. The present study proposes new conditions for <b>mercerisation</b> showing that a CORONA plasmatic discharge previously made is able to provide a faster reaction between the alkali and the cellulose, permitting a <b>mercerisation</b> without wetting agent presence. CORONA treatment consists on the application of an electrical discharge of high voltage (around 10. 000 V) through air between two electrodes, using frequencies around 40 kHz, at normal atmospheric temperature and pressure, on dry cotton fabric. The influence of CORONA treatment on absorption capacity of cotton to sodium hydroxide was determined. The degree of <b>mercerisation</b> was evaluated using barium activity number and fibre section circularity was analysed using electronic microscopy. Dyeing ability was studied by K/S evaluation and tests for colour fastness. Results show that CORONA treatment allows the penetration of sodium hydroxide molecules to the fibres core and, in consequence, makes possible to mercerise with higher efficiency than the traditional method obtaining better dyeing results {{and the possibility of}} a new process with lower ecological impact and lower costs of processing...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} behaviour of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) fibres under a nitrogen atmosphere was investigated by using thermogravimetry (TGA). The kinetic activation energy of treated fibres was calculated from TGA data {{by using a}} varied heating rate from 2. 5 to 30 °C/min. The greater activation energy of treated hemp fibre compared with untreated fibre represented an increase of purity and improvement in structural order. A hydrophobic solvent affected the degree of non-cellulosic removal. <b>Mercerisation</b> and enzyme scouring removed non-cellulosic components from the fibre; however, structural disruption was observed after higher alkaline concentration, 20 %wt/v and longer scouring time, respectively. Structural disruption was observed by X-ray measurement. The FTIR results indicated an elimination of the non-cellulosic components by the <b>mercerisation</b> treatment and a specific removal of low methoxy pectin by use of pectate lyase enzyme (EC 4. 2. 2. 2). An increase of temperature at the maximum rate of degradation {{and the rate of}} weight loss was characteristic of the purity and structure of treated hemp fibre...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of using cellulose {{to reinforce the}} thermal stability of kenaf derived cellulose (KDC) /polylactic acid (PLA) composite was investigated in this study. The cellulose was derived from kenaf bast fibre which was chemically treated via chlorination and <b>mercerisation</b> processes. The composites with various loadings of cellulose (dry weight basis) ranging from 0 % to 60 % were produced by melt mixing and compression moulding. Dynamic mechanical properties namely storage modulus (E’), loss modulus (E”) and tan δ of the KDC/PLA composites and the commercial PLA were analysed and compared {{as a function of}} temperature. ESEM micrographs demonstrated that the <b>mercerisation</b> of kenaf fibres have successfully removed the lignin and hemicellulose, thus producing cellulose which can be observed by its rougher surface and greater size reduction than the raw fibre. The DMA results demonstrated that the storage modulus of 60 % KDC/PLA composite is twice higher than the commercial PLA {{and the rest of the}} composites within a high temperature range (above 80 °C). The glass transition temperatures (Tg) generated from the loss modulus curves exhibit that the peak of the loss modulus was shifted to higher temperature as the percentage of the cellulose loading was increased.

40|$|Wettability and sorptivity {{improvements}} {{for different}} textile materials {{are the major}} tasks during textile finishing. In order to improve the sorption characteristics of a cellulose fabric, different pre-treatment processes are applied, usually washing, bleaching and <b>mercerisation.</b> Differences in the sorption properties of un-treated and pre-treated (washed and bleached) regenerated cellulose fibres were obtained using tensiometry and compared with the classical method for determining moisture adsorption. Results show that compared to raw fibres, viscose fibres have the highest moisture and the smallest contact angle whilst modal fibres have the biggest contact angle. Pre-treatment increases the sorption abilities and makes the material more accessible to Chemicals used in the finishing processes. Using the conventional method, it can be confirmed that fibres with the highest moisture have the smallest contact angle (tensiometry) ...|$|E

Changes in crystallinity of fibres, moisture regain, fabric weight, fabric surface thickness, tensile strength, stiffness and fibre surface appearance of material were observed and studied. It was confirmed by the experiments that the fibre structure, accessibility and physical properties of linen pretreated with caustic soda could further strengthen the effectiveness of enzyme treatment by exhibiting high reduction of fabric stiffness, minimising the loss of tensile strength and shortening the original treatment time.

30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the textile finishing processes for making a finished fabrics. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process mercerizing process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the yarn number, mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). Mercerised cotton fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the <b>mercerisation</b> process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. Mercerizing process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various chemical finishes. Mercerized cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to understand the influence of fibre surface treatment as well as yarn twist on the tensile properties of unidirectional (UD) jute polyester composites. Jute and polyester are chosen in this work as both are cheap. As received jute yarn, physical and chemical surface treated jute yarn and raw jute fibre are used to manufacture UD composites. Physical surface treatment includes removing yarn hairs, sizing by hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), water treatment, sizing by cellulose nano-particle (CNP) and chemical treatment includes <b>mercerisation</b> with and without applying tension. Composites manufactured with unsized hairy yarn show an increase in tensile modulus {{and a decrease in}} strain at failure compared to composites manufactured with unsized hairless yarn in the longitudinal direction. However yarn hairs do not affect the tensile strength of composites. Application of HEC improves the tensile properties of composites with respect to composites manufactured with unsized yarn. Water treatment of yarn with tension enhances the tensile properties of composites and water treatment of yarn without tension decreases the tensile properties of composite with respect to composites manufactured with untreated yarn. Similar to water treatment, composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn with tension show higher tensile strength with respect to composites manufactured with alkali treated yarn without tension. Non-dried CNP treatment of yarn improves the tensile properties of composites. Composites manufactured with raw fibres have increased tensile properties with respect to composites manufactured with twisted yarn...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{renewable}} energy must emerge to sustainably meet the energy {{demands of the}} present and future. Current alternatives to fossil fuels are electricity from solar, wind and tidal energies and biofuels. Biofuels, especially bioethanol could be produced from lignocellulosic feedstock via pre-treatment and fermentation. The cellulose I content of most lignocellulosic feedstock is significant, yet its highly crystalline amphiphilic structure interlinked with the lignin network {{makes it difficult to}} process for bioethanol production. Processing lignocellulosic biomass via a range of physico-chemical, mechanical and biological pre-treatment methods have been well established, however a relatively new area on the use of cellulose II (a polymorph of native cellulose obtained via <b>mercerisation</b> or regeneration) for the production of bioethanol is still in its early stages. Hence, this review discusses in detail the advantages of using cellulose II over cellulose I as feedstock for bioethanol production. Furthermore, current green and sustainable methods for cellulose II production and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each method are discussed. In addition, examples from literature reporting higher fermentable sugar and bioethanol yields using cellulose II as feedstock are reviewed, thereby highlighting its importance in the field of bioethanol production. The conclusion from this review suggests that, in all the cases studied, fermentable sugar and/or bioethanol production was found to be higher when cellulose II was used as feedstock instead of native cellulose/lignocellulosic biomass. This higher yield could be attributed to the modified structural and lattice arrangement of cellulose II, its porous volume and degree of polymerisation.

40|$|The {{conventional}} viscose {{manufacturing process}} is a mature process {{that needs to be}} improved with respect to its environmental impact and its production cost structure. Therefore a research study has been done with the aim to improve the reactivity of the dissolving pulp used, {{in order to reduce the}} chemical demand in the viscose process and thus reduce the cost and indirectly the environmental impact. The work described in this thesis has shown that it is possible to enhance the pulp reactivity and to use less carbon disulphide in the production of viscose, while maintaining a good quality viscose dope, by two entirely different pretreatment methods, one chemical and one enzymatic. The chemical method used pressurized oxygen after the <b>mercerisation</b> step, which increased the reactivity of the alkali cellulose. The viscose dopes produced from the pressurized oxygen treated alkali cellulose had lower filter clogging values, Kw, compared to conventionally produced viscoses. The temperature and the oxygen treatment time of the alkali cellulose were however crucial for the viscose quality. The best performing enzyme of several tested was a cellulase of the mono component endoglucanase preparation Carezyme®. This enzymatic treatment was optimized with respect to viscose dope preparation. The study showed that the enzyme treatment could be carried out under industrially interesting conditions with respect to temperature, enzyme dose and reaction time. A re-circulation study of the enzyme showed that it was possible to re-use the spent press water from the enzymatic treatment step several times, and thus lower the production cost. Some of the viscose process stages were modified to properly fit the enzymatically treated dissolving pulp and a comparison between viscose made from enzyme-treated pulp and viscose made from conventional pulp, showed that the enzyme-treated samples had a lower filter clogging value, Kw. This indirectly indicates that the enzyme pretreatment could reduce the carbon disulphide charge in the viscose manufacturing process. An initial study of how the Carezyme® influenced different cellulosic sources was also performed...|$|E
40|$|Cotton {{possesses}} many {{characteristics that}} make it desirable to the consumer, and this has resulted in its usage in {{a broad range of}} products. Cotton, however, is a flammable material that is easily ignited and rapidly consumed. The flame retardant treatment of cotton is, therefore, an important textile process that has received wide attention over many years. There are a number of commercial flame retardant treatments available for cotton, the most common being phosphate-based. These treatments, however, often have drawbacks or {{have a negative impact on}} the desirable properties of the fibre and the challenge still exists for designing better flame retardant products and systems that are durable and have limited impact on fibre properties. The study considers the application of the sol-gel as a coating on fabric that was pre-treated with a phosphate-based flame retardant or as a means for applying a phosphate-based flame retardant. Both treatment methods were found to be suitable for imparting flame resistance to the fabric. The effect of various phosphate-based flame retardants on flammability and fabric properties such as colour, handle and strength was investigated and it was shown that a diammonium phosphate and urea combination gave the best flame resistance. In this regard, a flame resistance was achieved with a lower amount of phosphorous than was used in similar conventional treatments. The durability of the coating to rinsing with water and soaping with a detergent was also investigated. It was found that the flame resistance was lost after rinsing or soaping but the prevention of afterglow combustion was retained. It was shown that the preparatory treatment of the fabric influenced the sol-gel coating process and the flammability of the fabric. <b>Mercerisation</b> and bleaching of the fabric increased the “wet pick-up” during the coating process and improved the flame resistance. The influence of various factors was also investigated in further detail. The ratio of the sol-gel components, the delay after coating prior to drying (hang time) and the curing time were investigated using an experimental design. The curing time and the ratio of components in the sol-gel were shown to have the greatest influence on fabric properties and fabric flammability. It was shown that there is a trade-off between the desired high level of fabric flame resistance and preserving the inherent properties of the fabric such as colour, handle and strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} this project was to optimise extraction of cellulose nanofibres from banana tree and rye grass feedstocks and to investigate the potential use of these products as high value-reinforcing agents in thermoplastic polymers, particularly in polyvinyl alcohol (PV A) and polyethylene (PE). To this end, {{in association with the}} Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBr) in Belfast, the following extraction techniques were investigated to obtain cellulose nanofibres from these natural fibre sources: (i) chemical modification, involving <b>mercerisation,</b> acid hydrolysis and chemical bleaching; (ii) mechanical treatment, using a high speed (Turrax) mixer and high pressure microfluidisation and (iii) chemical and mechanical (chemo-mechanical) processes, by combining TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation. The nanofibres produced were characterised using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy, particle size measurement (static image analysis and laser diffraction), chemical analysis (zeta potential analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction), and thermogravimetric analysis. It was especially evident that the chemo-mechanical procedure yielded higher aspect ratio nanofibrils, a greater yield and higher crystallinity, than nanofibrils made by solely chemical or mechanical treatments. The cellulose nanofibres obtained were subsequently incorporated into PVA by a solution casting technique. The effect of different treated nanofibres on the mechanical, structural and thermal properties of these composites was determined. It was notable that banana nanofibres made by TEMPO-oxidation and high pressure microfluidisation showed phenomenal reinforcing effects in the PVA. Furthermore, ryegrass nanofibre, derived from the high speed Turrax mixer, was, incorporated into PV A and PE by using more commercially acceptable melt processing procedures, involving surface treatment of the nanofibres using silane coupling agents, their pre-dispersion in a PVA carrier, twin-screw extrusion compounding and compression lamination methodologies. Varying degrees of success were seen, from poor dispersion using cryogenically milled nanofibres, yielding little effect on mechanical properties, to very significant enhancement with melt processable PVA, being of a similar order to solution cast nanofibre-reinforced PVA To assess the relative reinforcing efficiency of cellulose nanofibres, conventional PE composites were also made using macro-scale banana and sisal fibres. To aid compatibility and enhance interfacial bonding between fibre and matrix in this system, maleic anhydride modified polyethylene was applied with both nano- and macro- fibre variants. By way of example, there was a 100 % improvement in tensile modulus of conventional banana fibre-reinforced PE composite with a 30 wt% loading of micron-sized banana fibres, whereas a 300 % improvement was recorded in tensile modulus for cellulose nanofibre-reinforced PVA with only 5 wt% of cellulose nanofibres.
