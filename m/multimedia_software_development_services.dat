40|$|Availability of precise, yet usable {{modeling}} languages {{is essential}} to the construction of multimedia systems based on software engineering principles and methods. Although several languages have been proposed for the specification of isolated multimedia system aspects, there not yet exists an integrated modeling language that adequately supports <b>multimedia</b> <b>software</b> <b>development</b> in practice. We propose an extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for the integrated specification of multimedia systems based on an object-oriented development method. Since integration of co-existing timed procedural and interactive behavior {{is at the heart of}} multimedia systems, we focus on UML-based specification of behavior in this paper. In addition, we outline how these behavioral aspects are to be integrated with media, presentation, and software architecture modeling to achieve a coherent and consistent model.

40|$|Internet-enabled {{markets are}} {{becoming}} viable venues for procurement of professional services. We investigate bidding behavior within {{the most active}} area of these early knowledge markets [...] -the market for <b>software</b> <b>development.</b> These markets are important both because they provide an early view {{of the effectiveness of}} online service markets and because they have a potentially large impact on how <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>services</b> are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and transaction behavior, taking into account costly bidding. We then test our model using data from an active online market for <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>services,</b> which yields contracts for 30 % [...] 40 % of posted projects. In its current format, however, the studied market may induce excessive bidding by vendors. Consistent with our theoretical predictions and those of Carr (2003), higher-value projects attract significantly more bids, with lower average quality. Greater numbers of bids raise the cost to all participants, due to costly bidding and bid evaluation. Perhaps as a consequence, higher-value projects are also much less likely to be awarded.
