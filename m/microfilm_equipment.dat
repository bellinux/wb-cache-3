40|$|Pond {{in front}} of Shambaugh library. 2 ̆ 2 A pledge of 100, 000 for a new library was {{received}} by the college board September 20 [1960].... The library building will be constructed completely fireproof, of Willamina brick, concrete and steel, of the most modern and approved design, and will include space of 50, 000 books, ample reading and listening areas, study rooms, <b>microfilm</b> <b>equipment,</b> seminar room and museum, music, art and periodical collections, and processing and staff working areas. 2 ̆ 2 From The Crescent, October 7, 1960.

40|$|The PDG {{was founded}} in 1957 by {{thirteen}} European chemical and oil companies, with the main aim of abstracting patent documents and searching for patent families. During the 1960 s the group became engaged in other activities, notably exchanging views on patent information management matters and testing new systems for polymer patents. In 1969 the Group was reorganised with a permanent secretary in Basel, and objectives and activities fixed by statutes. In the early 1970 s, due {{to the development of}} Derwent's abstract services, the PDG discontinued its abstracting work, and efforts were concentrated on Working Groups studying matters such as networks and online retrieval, <b>microfilm</b> <b>equipment,</b> and developments in national and international patent laws. In 1984 the statutes were changed to allow 'non-chemical' companies to become members, and in 1985 membership increased to 23 companies covering five countries. ...|$|E
50|$|Overdyke twice {{received}} Carnegie Foundation {{grants and}} a grant for special {{study from the}} Hemenway furniture store in Shreveport. From 1945 to 1948, {{he was chairman of}} the division of social science. He {{was a member of the}} building committee that planned and built the Magale Library at Centenary. He was a pioneer in the use of portable <b>microfilming</b> <b>equipment</b> as a research tool.|$|R
50|$|He and Jamison {{head for}} the laundry. Along the way, they come upon the {{unconscious}} Donald. They revive him and take him along. Inside, they find secret rooms and overpower Karl. They also discover the body of Whistler and a clue, shards of a distinctive watch crystal, {{just like the one}} King has, <b>microfilming</b> <b>equipment,</b> and ashes of the defence plans. Lanyard deduces that the plans have been transferred to King's watch. When she telephones, Lanyard pretends to be Karl and learns that she is at the hotel. Before they get there, however, Rembrandt kills her and takes the watch to Karl.|$|R
40|$|After {{researching the}} current applications, problems, and {{evaluation}} techniques of planetary microfilming systems, the authors designed and constructed a standard Planetary Microfilming camera Target Array (PMTA) that essentially satisfied three criteria, i. e. 1) inexpensive to produce, 2) simple to use, and 3) satisfies testing criteria for both <b>microfilming</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacture and user. Ten evaluation parameters were incorporated in two targets PMTA-I and PMTA-II. PMTA-I includes tests for 1) resolution, 2) readability of printed matter, 3) reduction ratio, 4) exposure and processing, 5) full field visual distortion, and finally 6) corner visual distortion. PMTA-II {{was designed to}} evaluate, 7) quatitative distortion, 8) continous tone, 9) evenness of illumination, and 10) alignment of microfilming system...|$|R
50|$|Pratt {{invented the}} Optigraph an early {{microfilm}} reader. This development {{led to the}} formation of the International Filmbook company to manufacture and sell <b>microfilm</b> reading <b>equipment.</b> An innovative approach to film reading was the use of cassettes that allowed for rotating the viewof the film. Unfortunately, the expense of this innovation led to the bankruptcy of International Filmbook.|$|R
40|$|Methods {{for data}} storage and output in data banks and memory files are {{discussed}} {{along with a}} survey of equipment available for this. Topics discussed include magnetic tapes, magnetic disks, Terabit magnetic tape memory, Unicon 690 laser memory, IBM 1360 photostore, <b>microfilm</b> recording <b>equipment,</b> holographic recording, film readers, optical character readers, digital data storage techniques, and photographic recording. The individual types of equipment are summarized in tables giving the basic technical parameters...|$|R
50|$|Students {{have access}} to photocopying, <b>microfilm</b> and {{microfiche}} <b>equipment,</b> commercial databases on CDROM and the library’s own databases, which will be developed {{as a basis for}} a Ghana legal information service. The library staff develop and maintain the collections, on a reserve and loan system; they help students to find the meanings of legal citations, and to locate the cited material.|$|R
50|$|The Memex {{article in}} The Atlantic {{is most often}} cited because of its longer text which details the {{proposal}} {{of a system of}} shared microfilm based hyperlinks which could be considered as a precursor to the World Wide Web. Those citations tend to overlook the massive organization it would have taken to mail all those microfilm reels between scientists, and eventually between any knowledge worker, {{in order to make the}} system work. The citations also tend to overlook that Memex was an entire system, composed not only of a massive desk which housed the <b>microfilm</b> hyperlinking <b>equipment,</b> and the <b>microfilm</b> library but also of a speech activated typewriter (also capable of speech synthesis from normal paper text) and other accessories.|$|R
50|$|Although {{no major}} changes {{occurred}} in the National Library immediately after its relocation, two significant events {{took place in the}} 1970s: first, the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 812 on October 18, 1975, which allowed the National Library to exercise the right of legal deposit, and second, the resumption of work on the Philippine National Bibliography (PNB) which had been suspended since 1941. For this purpose, the library acquired its first mainframe computer and likewise trained library staff in its use with the assistance of both UNESCO and the Technology and Livelihood Resource Center. The first edition of the PNB was published in 1977 using simplified MARC standards, and subsequently updated ever since. The library subsequently purchased three microcomputers in the 1980s and, through a Japanese grant, acquired three IBM PS/2 computers and <b>microfilming</b> and reprographics <b>equipment.</b> The Library for the Blind Division was organized in 1988 and subsequently launched in 1994.|$|R
40|$|Nicholson Baker, {{his name}} {{has already been}} {{mentioned}} several times during this conference. In 1994 he published an erotic fantasy novel: The Fermata. I will not discuss the contents of this novel before this audience, but I want to read to you a quotation: "The particular library table I had chosen with some care, of course. It had one other resident, a petite woman in her late thirties with curly salt and pepper hair (…). She was looking through several piles of microfilm copies, sorting them and and circling paragraphs ever so often. She spun her pen silently on the table as she read, {{as if it was}} a spinner in a child's game. Her eyes moved with impressive speed over the chemical smelling, legal sized pages, but she looked tired from spending hours gazing at the grey light in one of the libraries horrible microfilm readers, contending with the trembling magnified crotch hairs and scratches on its screen. " It appears that Baker already was concerned about <b>microfilming</b> and reading <b>equipment</b> by that time. Seven years later he launched his famous campaign against libraries' abuse of microfilming as an excuse for destroying originals, mainly newspapers and periodicals in his book Double Fold (Baker, 2001) ...|$|R
