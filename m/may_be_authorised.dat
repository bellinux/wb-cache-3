25|$|For {{his conduct}} as President of Zimbabwe, {{including}} allegations {{of torture and}} murder of political opponents, it is suggested Robert Mugabe may be prosecuted using this doctrine. Because Zimbabwe has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>authorised</b> by the United Nations Security Council. The precedent for this was set by its referral to bring indictments relating to the crimes committed in Darfur. Otherwise, a Zimbabwean regime following Mugabe's would have jurisdiction over his alleged crimes (in {{the absence of any}} amnesty law) as would the numerous countries with universal jurisdiction over torture, including the UK.|$|E

2500|$|In {{times of}} war, natural disaster, {{societal}} collapse, {{or in the}} absence of an established system of criminal justice, there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> increased incidences of extrajudicial punishment. In such circumstances, police or military personnel <b>may</b> <b>be</b> unofficially <b>authorised</b> to punish severely individuals involved in looting, rioting and other violent acts, especially if caught in flagrante delicto. [...] This position is sometimes itself corrupted, resulting in the death of merely inconvenient persons, that is, relative innocents who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time.|$|R

While there, it was reorganised from two 12-gun {{batteries}} to three 8-gun batteries when the third battery (507th) was formed in the regiment in <b>May</b> 1941.

2500|$|The High Court {{upheld the}} {{validity}} of the 1918 Ordinance but that removal could only occur if it was considered as being best interests of the Aboriginal child, [...] "judged by the values and standards prevailing at the time". In this way the Court left open the possibility that the removal of some Aboriginal children <b>may</b> not have <b>been</b> <b>authorised</b> by the 1918 Ordinance. Only one member of the Stolen Generation, Bruce Trevorrow in South Australia, has obtained compensation as a result of litigation. Limited compensation schemes have been implemented in New South Wales and South Australia.|$|R

5000|$|The {{legal status}} of {{abortion}} in Uganda is unclear because it provides for some exceptions while criminalizing the procedure in most cases. The Ugandan Constitution, in Article 22, item 2 states: [...] "No person {{has the right to}} terminate the life of an unborn child except as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>authorised</b> by law." [...] However, what is authorized by law remains poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|Marriage {{was once}} seen as {{necessary}} for couples who cohabited. While such an experience for some couples did exist, mostly {{because it is}} hard to detect, it was relatively uncommon up until the 1950s in much of the western world. If both partners are under the age of 18, marriage in Australia is not permitted. In ‘exceptional circumstances’ the marriage of persons under 18 but over 16 <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>authorised</b> by a court.|$|E

Gustavo Deutsch acquired the company in 1984, when it had a network consisting of two domestic routes served with a single propeller aircraft.|$|R

50|$|The ambush at Barrowhouse on 16 <b>May</b> 1921 <b>was</b> <b>authorised</b> but {{the eight}} men {{who took part}} were poorly {{equipped}} in terms of arms and ammunition. The participants in what {{would result in the}} last of the pre-truce casualties involving members of the Carlow Brigade were Captain Joe Maher of Cullenagh, Lieutenant Joe Lacey of Barrowhouse, Paddy Dooley of Kilabbin, Maganey, Mick Maher of Barrowhouse, Jack O’Brien of Barrowhouse, Joe Ryan of Kilmoroney, James Lacey of Barrowhouse and William Connor of Barrowhouse. Jack O’Brien, the last surviving member of the unsuccessful ambush, was interviewed by Jack McKenna many years ago when O’Brien was living in Kilkenny following his retirement from the Gardaí and he confirmed the names of the eight men involved. They had been members of an eight-man ambush party which planned to attack at Barrowhouse a group of RIC men who were travelling on bicycles from Ballylinan Barracks to nearby Grangemellon Barracks. The IRA men were members of the B. Company 5th Battalion Carlow Brigade. James Lacey and William Connor both were killed and are buried together in the same grave behind Barrowhouse Roman Catholic Church.|$|R

In some dioceses or parishes, lay administration is limited to the chalice, and lay administrators may also be permitted to take the consecrated elements from the church to the sick or shut-in to be administered there.|$|E

This overdraft facility can be used at any time without consulting the bank and can be maintained indefinitely (subject to ad hoc reviews). Although an overdraft facility <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>authorised,</b> technically the money is repayable on demand by the bank. In reality this is a rare occurrence as the overdrafts are profitable for the bank and expensive for the customer.|$|E

5000|$|The External Relations Act set {{out that}} the {{appointment}} of the Free State's diplomatic and consular representatives and the conclusion of international agreements would be either by or on {{the authority of the}} Executive Council (ss. 1-2).
