5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

25|$|Before Darwin, {{adaptation}} {{was seen}} as a fixed relationship between an organism and its habitat. It was not appreciated that as the climate changed, so did the habitat; and as the habitat changed, so did the biota. Also, habitats are subject to changes in their biota: for example, invasions of species from other areas. The relative numbers of species in a given habitat are always changing. Change is the rule, though <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the speed and degree of the change.|$|E
25|$|The aborigines’ diet very <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> nature. With profuse {{vegetation}} and wild animals, the aborigines were natural hunter-gatherers. Essentially, {{much of what}} Aborigines ate depended on their environment – that is, whether they lived in coastal or mountainous areas. Tribes like Amis, Atayal, Saisiyat and Bunun hunt what they can, and gather what they cultivate. On the other hand, tribes like the Yamis and the Thao have fish as a predominant source of food. Majority of foods consisted of millet, taro, sweet potato, wild greens and game like boar and rat. This {{is in contrast to}} the main foods eaten by the Han, which consisted of rice and chicken.|$|E
500|$|Hudson {{argues that}} Tryggvason's return to Norway in 994 {{coincided with the}} {{temporary}} expulsion of Sigtrygg from Dublin by his rival Ivar of Waterford,. [...] Ivar may have already ruled there from 989 until forced out by Sigtrygg in 993. <b>Much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the interpretation. Either way, Sigtrygg was back within a year. In 995, he and his nephew, Muirchertach Ua Congalaich, attacked the church at Donaghpatrick in County Meath. [...] In retaliation, Máel Sechnaill entered Dublin and took the ring of Thor and the sword of Carlus. [...] Sigtrygg then attacked Kells and Clonard in 997. [...] In 998, Máel Sechnaill and the King of Munster, Brian Boru, forced Sigtrygg to recognise their lordship by giving hostages.|$|E

500|$|In the Browns' early years, Paul Brown {{wanted to}} keep on reserve a number of {{promising}} players who {{did not make the}} team's official roster. McBride made this happen by putting the reserves on his payroll as taxi drivers, although none of them were asked to drive cabs. This group {{came to be known as}} the [...] "taxi squad", a term still in use to describe players kept on hand to fill in for injured team members. The taxi squad was just one of the ways in which McBride backed Brown. He viewed owning the team as primarily a civic duty – as a gift to the city. [...] "Cleveland has been good to me," [...] he said in a 1947 interview. [...] "I've made a great deal of money here. If I was looking for a get-rich-quick investment, the last thing I'd do is buy a pro football club. It's a risky business.

2500|$|The poem is {{generally}} more valued by historians than by literary criticsit has been thought to lack elegance and wit, and it strangely includes elements of choral lyric {{though it is}} not a choral song but a solo performance. The choral elements are dactylo-epitrite meter and what seems to be triadic structure (i.e. strophe, antistrophe, epode) C.M. Bowra considered it [...] "a strange and uncomfortable poem". Another scholar saw parallels between it and Anacreon's Artemon but judged Anacreon's poem to have more grace and wit. However, scholarly analysis of the poem has not produced agreement or convincing results and <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> how we interpret the poet's tone. The reference to Leto is obscure but she may have had some connection with Salamis or perhaps there was a temple to her at Corinth.|$|E

2500|$|A {{review of}} post-2013 {{proposal}} by Prof. Alan Matthews underlines {{the lack of}} ambition in tackling the issue. [...] "This CAP reform {{was not intended to}} address the trade barriers used to keep some EU market prices higher than world market levels. The EU has reduced the effect of these barriers for a number of developing countries through extending the scope of preferential access under various trade agreements, and a further reduction is being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round. Nonetheless, developing countries will be disappointed that the opportunity was not taken in this reform to set a final date for the ending of export subsidies. A more ambitious CAP reform, in which the targeting of direct payments was pursued more insistently and coupled payments were phased out, would also have a greater effect in removing the remaining distortions caused by the CAP to world markets." [...] In another study, Prof. Matthews showed how linking EU farm subsidies to goals such as environmental protection could help farmers in poor countries, although <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the size of the payments and how they are made.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{applications}} of matrix methods {{were applied to}} articulated frameworks with truss, beam and column elements; later and more advanced matrix methods, referred to as [...] "finite element analysis", model an entire structure with one-, two-, and three-dimensional elements {{and can be used}} for articulated systems together with continuous systems such as a pressure vessel, plates, shells, and three-dimensional solids. Commercial computer software for structural analysis typically uses matrix finite-element analysis, which can be further classified into two main approaches: the displacement or stiffness method and the force or flexibility method. The stiffness method is the most popular by far thanks to its ease of implementation as well as of formulation for advanced applications. The finite-element technology is now sophisticated enough to handle just about any system as long as sufficient computing power is available. Its applicability includes, but is not limited to, linear and non-linear analysis, solid and fluid interactions, materials that are isotropic, orthotropic, or anisotropic, and external effects that are static, dynamic, and environmental factors. This, however, does not imply that the computed solution will automatically be reliable because <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the model and the reliability of the data input.|$|E

2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since <b>much</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E
