5|$|Self-harm (SH), {{also known}} as self-injury, {{is defined as the}} intentional, direct {{injuring}} of body tissue, done without suicidal intentions. These terms are used in the more recent literature in an attempt to reach a more neutral terminology. The older literature, especially that which predates the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), almost exclusively refers to self-mutilation.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E

40|$|The Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> (DSM) <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> {{disorders}} is evaluated {{according to}} the empirical scientific criteria of validity and reliability, and it {{is found to be}} fundamentally flawed on both counts. Additionally, any diagnostic approach based on the objectivizing principles of empirical science is found to be both ontologically and epistemologically unable to account for the complexity of human subjectivity/intersubjectivity. A revisioning of psychological diagnosis according to specifically human scientific criteria is called for; and an outline of criteria to serve as fundamental guidelines for the development of phenomenological and holistic approaches to diagnosis is presented...|$|R

These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Asperger's is unknown. While it is {{probably}} partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the overlap between AS and high-functioning autism (HFA—autism unaccompanied by {{intellectual}} disability) is unclear.

In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder. Like the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, the change was controversial and AS was not removed from the WHO's ICD-10.|$|E
50|$|The constructivist AI {{methodology}} {{proposed by}} Thórisson addresses the numerous significant challenges involved in building AGI systems, by replacing the top-down architectural design approaches that are ubiquitous today with methods that allow {{a system to}} autonomously manage its own cognitive growth.

40|$|In mental {{rotation}} tasks, reaction time increases linearly with increasing angular disparity (Shepard & Metzler, 1971). Extensive repetition <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> rotation {{has been shown}} to reduce reaction times (e. g., Tarr & Pinker, 1989). This training effect, however, seems {{to be based on the}} retrieval of memory representations rather than on a faster execution of the rotation process itself (e. g., Heil, Roesler, Link, & Bajric, 1998). The main purpose of the present experiments was to investigate whether {{mental rotation}} can be trained by a manual rotation task in a virtual environment. Since manual rotation does visualise the process <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> rotation and as mental rotation is assumed to be a covert motor rotation (Wexler, Kosslyn, & Berthoz, 1998), it should train the rotation process itself and thus should not be memory based. In Experiment 1, a new virtual mental rotation test was validated successfully. Experiment 2 shows that <b>manual</b> training <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> rotation in a virtual environment is effective but limited to trained objects.

5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical <b>Manual</b> <b>of</b> <b>Mental</b> Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between mental and manual rotation {{was investigated in}} 2 experiments. Experiment 1 compared the response times (RTs) <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> rotation about 4 axes in space with the RTs shown in the same task when participants were allowed to reorient the stimuli by means of rotational hand movements. For the 3 Cartesian axes, RT functions were quantitatively indistinguishable. Experiment 2 investigated interference between mental rotation and 4 kinds of simultaneously executed hand movements that did not reorient the stimuli. Interference was observed only when axes <b>of</b> <b>manual</b> and <b>mental</b> rotation coincided in space. Regardless of the hand used, concordant rotational directions facilitated, whereas discordant directions inhibited, mental rotation. The results suggest that mental object rotation and rotatory object manipulation share a common process that is thought to control the dynamics of both imagined and actually performed object reorientation. The basic task in mental rotation experiments is to decide whether two stimuli differing in orientation are identical or are mirror versions of each other. Angular disparity between stimuli is varied systematically, and response times (RTs...|$|R

An alternative approach to conceptualising the material stuff of Utopia will be advanced, one in which the full re-appropriation of the body is given a more central role...|$|R

Our aim {{was to examine the}} feasibility and acceptability of a randomised controlled trial of a group intervention based on CBT principles for women with depression in primary care. Methods Women aged 30 to 55 years were recruited and randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of the group intervention or usual care (control). The group intervention was based on a manual and used CBT and problem solving principles with weekly topics including raising activity levels, spotting and catching negative thoughts, problem solving and relaxation. Women were recruited from deprived areas of Bristol. The groups were run by facilitators with some experience and background in group work and one weeks training in use <b>of</b> the course <b>manual.</b> Assessments <b>of</b> <b>mental</b> health were made using measures including the PHQ- 9. Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months after the intervention. Qualitative methods were used to support the design of the intervention and to help understand issues of acceptability and feasibility. Interviews were conducted with all participants at baseline and at 3 and 6 months although detailed qualitative analysis was based on a purposive sample of 20 participants at the 3 time points. Results Of the 86 participants assessed for eligibility, 52 were allocated to the intervention arm and 21 to the control group. The intervention was delivered according to the manual despite the limited training of the facilitators. The intervention was received favourably by participants and facilitators, with good attendance at sessions for those who engaged with the intervention. Follow up rates at 3 and 6 months for women in both the intervention and control arms were also good. The trial methodology used was appropriate and feasible. Conclusions This study showed that a randomised controlled trial of group CBT for women with depression is feasible and the intervention is acceptable, and may possibly prove to be effective in a larger trial. The cost effectiveness of group CBT for depression should be explored further in a full trial. Trial registration NCT 00663078 </p...|$|R
