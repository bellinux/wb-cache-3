If the uterus had moved upwards, this could be done by placing malodorous and acrid substances near the woman’s mouth and nostrils, while scented ones were placed near her vagina; on the contrary, if the uterus had lowered, the document recommends placing the acrid substances near her vagina and the perfumed ones near her mouth and nostrils." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Allegory of the Cave (often said by {{scholars}} to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that {{only people who}} have {{climbed out of the}} cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the [...] "philosopher-king", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are wise enough to choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the Republic, that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.|$|E
2500|$|In {{ancient and}} medieval medical texts, {{a child was}} thought to be {{conceived}} from the father's [...] "seed" [...] and the mother's blood. The gello, herself infertile and envious, aimed to drink blood, the source of fertility, and was attracted to the dangerous time of birth and recovery in part because the new mother was regarded in Judaeo-Christian tradition as unclean; this state of pollution was congenial to demons. As long as the infant remained exclusively within the birth mother's sphere of influence, it was vulnerable to female demons seeking blood. In the story of Melitene, sister of the saints Sisinnios and Sisynodorus, the child is in peril until it is [...] "returned" [...] to the hands of men. In one version, the gello swallows the child and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> by the male saints to regurgitate it alive. This cycle — death by swallowing, regurgitation, new life — may be symbolized in initiation ceremonies such as baptism, which marked the separation of the child from the taint of its mother's gello-attracting blood.|$|E
2500|$|Water (feedwater) must be {{delivered}} to the boiler to replace that which is exhausted as steam after delivering a working stroke to the pistons. As the boiler is under pressure during operation, feedwater <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> into the boiler at a pressure that {{is greater than the}} steam pressure, necessitating the use of some sort of pump. Early engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons (axle pumps), which were simple to operate and reliable, but only operated when the locomotive was moving, and could overload the valve gear and piston rods at high speeds. Steam injectors later replaced the pump, while some engines transitioned to turbopumps. Standard practice evolved to use two independent systems for feeding water to the boiler; either two steam injectors or, on more conservative designs, axle pumps when running at service speed and a steam injector for filling the boiler when stationary or at low speeds. By the 20th century virtually all new-built locomotives used only steam injectors – often one injector was supplied with [...] "live" [...] steam straight from the boiler itself and the other used exhaust steam from the locomotive's cylinders, which was more efficient (since it made use of otherwise wasted steam) but could only be used when the locomotive was in motion and the regulator was open.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which abnormal pressure conditions may develop according to Bourgoyne et al. (1991) are the following: (1) overburden pressure, (2) rock compressive strength, and (3) dynamic equilibrium. When the overburden pressure acts downwards upon a formation {{in a state of}} dynamic equilibrium, since the formation is not moving, there <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>forces</b> opposing the overburden force in order for the formation to remain motionless. These opposing <b>forces</b> <b>are</b> (1) the rock compressive strength, and (2) the fluids in the pore spaces.|$|R

50|$|Beer head (also head or collar), is the frothy foam {{on top of}} beer {{which is}} {{produced}} by bubbles of gas, typically carbon dioxide, rising to the surface.
