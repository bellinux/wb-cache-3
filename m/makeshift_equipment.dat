25|$|In mid-January 1942 the 56th FG {{shifted to}} air defense of New York City, with its {{headquarters}} at Bendix AAF, New Jersey, and its squadrons assigned respectively to Bridgeport, Connecticut; Bendix; and Farmingdale, New York. In April 1942 it received a {{full complement of}} new P-40F Warhawks to replace its <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 1989, Radio Caroline {{restarted}} broadcasting {{from the}} Ross Revenge using <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> and low power, {{to retain the}} 558kHz frequency. Engineer Peter Chicago had hidden transmitter parts during the raid and retuned one 5kW transmitter, previously used on short-wave, to 558kHz. Over following months, Caroline's signal quality improved as transmitting valves were donated and programming returned to normal.|$|E
500|$|Mariano Rivera {{was born}} in Panama City, Panama, on November 29, 1969, to Mariano Rivera Palacios and Delia Jiron. The couple's second child, Rivera has one older sister, Delia, and two younger brothers, Alvaro and Giraldo. Supported by Mariano Sr.'s job as captain of a fishing boat, the family lived in Puerto Caimito, a Panamanian fishing village that Rivera {{described}} as [...] "poor". As a young man, Rivera played soccer and baseball with his friends on the beach during low tide. Soccer was his favorite sport, while his favorite athlete was Pelé. For baseball games, they substituted cardboard milk cartons for gloves and tree branches for bats, and they fashioned balls by taping worn-out baseballs and wads of shredded fishing nets. Rivera used this <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> until his father bought him his first leather glove when he was 12 years old. Speaking about his youth, Rivera said that although he stayed out of trouble, he [...] "was hanging with the wrong people".|$|E
50|$|When Bum-soo {{is killed}} by local gangsters, the Koreans from the {{compound}} vow revenge and attack the Japanese gangs. The fight ends abruptly for Bae-dal {{when he is}} knocked unconscious by {{a blow to the}} head. Bae-dal, vowing to never again lose a fight, retreats to the mountains where, living in his karate gi, he trains day and night; running in the mountains, lifting tree trunks and using <b>makeshift</b> training <b>equipment</b> to harden his body and fighting spirit through austerity.|$|R
500|$|Frenetic in {{progression}} {{and explicit}} in lyrical content, Adkins {{was known for}} having an unconventional take on traditional rockabilly. His unpolished sound was a praised by-product of the <b>makeshift</b> studio <b>equipment</b> used {{for the majority of}} his career. [...] "I didn't try to be primitive, I just had bad microphones", he wrote. His lyrics explored topics such as eating peanut butter on the moon and the suggestive strut of a chicken. Recurring themes in Adkins' catalogue included sex, heartbreak, decapitation, aliens, hot dogs and poultry. Together with country and honky-tonk, Adkins' assortment of styles helped delineate a genre known as psychobilly.|$|R
50|$|This leg's Detour was {{a choice}} between Keep The Beat or Work Your Feet. In Keep The Beat, teams {{traveled}} along R. General Osório street and had to perform a musical routine with a samba group. Each team member had to learn a different instrument: either the surdo drum or the chocalho jingle stick. When the band leader was satisfied with their performance, they would get their next clue. In Work Your Feet, teams {{made their way to}} a viaduct below Palmorino Mônaco street where they had to assemble <b>makeshift</b> workout <b>equipment</b> using rudimentary supplies including a tire, a refrigerator, weight racks, metal cans, and a barrel (which must contain a specified volume of water). When the judge, a professional boxer, approved their installations, he would give them their next clue.|$|R
2500|$|Swanton {{served in}} the Bedfordshire Yeomanry in the Second World War. He was in the rank of acting major when wounded and {{captured}} by the Japanese {{in the fall of}} Singapore, and spent three years as a prisoner of war. [...] His unit spent time in camps along the Burma–Siam railway, and he contracted polio and lost a considerable amount of bodyweight, but his well-thumbed copy of the 1939 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack boosted morale. [...] He later described playing cricket with <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> and under conditions of extreme privation and the constant threat of brutality in an article, [...] "Cricket under the Japs", for the 1946 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in a Ukrainian {{hospital}} full of desperate patients and <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment,</b> {{but it is not}} a medical film—it is about Henry Marsh, and his partnership with Ukrainian colleague Igor Petrovich Kurilets, and their struggle with moral, ethical and professional issues.|$|E

5000|$|While good-quality, {{reasonably}} rapid copies from a hectograph require fairly specific materials (Aniline dye is {{the most}} effective), passable copies can be produced from a bewildering array of improvised materials on <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment.</b> Practically speaking, any dye that soaks into the gelatin and can then be drawn out by the available paper will work. This meant that improvised hectography {{assumed the role of}} reproducing nearly every sort of censored material from subversive literature to pornography.|$|E
50|$|Around that time, Westinghouse Lamp Plant {{was able}} to supply {{a small amount of}} pure uranium metal. By 1941, there was an order for the uranium metal of 10 {{kilograms}} which was considered an enormous amount. The plant ramped up the production using <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> including metal garbage cans from a local market to use in the process. The order was fulfilled within a couple of months. By early 1942, there was another order from Arthur H. Compton of the Metallurgical Laboratory for three short tons of the uranium metal for the Chicago Pile-1.|$|E

5000|$|Audus {{joined the}} Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1940, {{after which he}} {{received}} training in radar. In 1941, he was posted to Malaya as a flight lieutenant. While there, he explored the rain forest in Johore with John Corner, the {{assistant director of the}} Johore botanical gardens, and later became a distinguished botanist at Cambridge. According to the Telegraph, [...] "Audus made himself popular by bringing with him a turntable, loudspeakers and a collection of records." [...] After the fall of Singapore, he and his unit escaped to Jakarta, where he was captured by the Japanese on 8 March 1942. While being held at the Jaarmarkt prisoner of war camp at Surubaya on Java, he used <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> and maize grain to produce yeast to supplement the diet of himself and his fellow POWs.|$|E
50|$|When {{his parents}} are killed in a botched drug deal, a young boy is taken in by a bag lady who teaches him about the Blue Coats (Cops) and White Coats (Doctors). After her death he becomes an urban Tarzan {{defending}} innocents in a large city. He soon becomes an urban legend and champion of street justice, espousing a 1960s philosophy and coming {{to the aid of}} the helpless and oppressed. Jane (Kathleen Quinlan) is the concerned social worker who falls for the hero. Armed with a bow and arrow and <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment</b> such as a grappling hook made from an old umbrella he and his cat sidekick set out to avenge his parents death when he finds the drug dealer that killed them. The song Wild Thing by the Troggs is played as a sort of theme music for this unlikely hero, played by Robert Knepper.|$|E

40|$|Eight {{hospitals}} reported 781 non-iatrogenic accidents occurring {{to patients}} and visitors under 16 years of age during an 18 month period up to October 1989. Accidents more often involved boys and children aged 3 to 5 years old. Falls from a height, slips, and striking accidents were common by day and falls by night. A total of 41 % of accidents to inpatients occurred when parents were present. Only three accidents were serious. Altogether 27 % involved beds and cots, and only one consequent injury was more than minor. Data collected routinely in case of medicolegal action can be presented {{in a form that}} may facilitate preventative work. Potentially remediable causes for concern include falls from beds and cots and the use of <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Full of drama, dedication, and humor, {{this book}} narrates the author’s often {{frustrating}} experiences {{working as an}} experimental physicist in Cuba after {{the disintegration of the}} so-called socialist block. Lacking finance and infrastructure, faced with <b>makeshift</b> <b>equipment,</b> unpredictable supplies, and unreliable IT, Altshuler tells how he and his students overcame numerous challenges to make novel and interesting contributions to several fields of science. Along the way, he explains the science - from studies of ant colonies to superconductivity - either qualitatively or quantitatively, but always at a level fully understandable to an undergraduate student of natural sciences or engineering. An even wider audience, however, may skip the technical sections without missing the essence. With numerous anecdotes, photographs and the author’s own delightful cartoons, the book tells a remarkable, and often amusing story of how successful science can be performed against all odds...|$|E
