[...] The second Airedale belonged to William E. Carter of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Carter</b> was the owner of the Renault automobile in which Jack and Rose trysted in the movie Titanic.

2500|$|From the Middlesex Journal (Thurs 6 July) [...] "Yesterday a <b>Mr.</b> <b>Carter,</b> a very eminent butcher of Grub Street, {{but of a}} corpulent body, {{was playing}} at Cricket in the Artillery Ground, making a stroke at the ball which he missed, he threw himself round with so great force that he broke his knee pan (knee cap). He was carried home, with little hope of ever {{recovering}} {{the use of his}} leg again".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{specific}} set of contracts, negotiating parties must conduct themselves in utmost good faith (or [...] "uberrima fides") by disclosing all material facts to one another. In one of the earliest cases, Carter v Boehm, <b>Mr</b> <b>Carter</b> bought an insurance policy for any losses to a naval fort of the British East India Company in Sumatra, but failed to tell his insurer, Boehm, that the fort was only built to resist attacks from locals, and the French were likely to invade. Lord Mansfield held the policy was invalid. Since insurance is a contract based on speculation and the special facts [...] "lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only", good faith precluded <b>Mr</b> <b>Carter</b> [...] "concealing what he privately knows". The same policy was extended for sale of shares in a company. So in Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co the promoter and director-to-be of a guano mining business failed to disclose he had paid for the mining rights on the island of Sombrero half as much as he subsequently was valuing the company at. The House of Lords held that, despite a delay in making a claim, the purchasers of the shares had a right to their money back. Lord Blackburn held, further, that it was no barrier to rescission that the guano could not be put back in the ground. Counter-restitution (i.e. both parties giving back what they had got), if it could be substantially made in its monetary equivalent, was enough. However, outside insurance, partnerships, surety, fiduciary relations, company shares, a narrow range of regulated securities, and consumer credit agreements, the duty on negotiating parties to disclose material facts does not extend to most contracts. Even though there is a duty to correct previous false statements, in Smith v Hughes, it was held that the general duty is merely to not make active misrepresentations.|$|E
