50|$|Ethical value <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{regarded}} <b>as</b> a study under ethics, which, in turn, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> grouped <b>as</b> philosophy. Similar to that ethics <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regarded <b>as</b> a subfield of philosophy, ethical value <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regarded <b>as</b> a {{subgroup of}} the more broad (and vague) philosophic value. Ethical value denotes something's degree of importance, {{with the aim of}} determining what action or life is best to do, or at least attempt to describe the value of different actions. It <b>may</b> <b>be</b> described <b>as</b> treating actions themselves as abstract objects, putting value to them. It deals with right conduct and good life, in the sense that a highly, or at least relatively highly, valuable action or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regarded <b>as</b> good, and an action of low, or at least relatively low, value <b>may</b> <b>be</b> regarded <b>as</b> bad.|$|R

5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be {{further complicated by}} concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in}} the past.|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{religious}} definitions and varying population data, the United States currently has {{the second largest}} Jewish community in the world (after Israel). The American Jewish population {{was estimated to be}} approximately 5,128,000 (1.7%) of the total population in 2008 (304,060,000). However, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 6,444,000 (2.2%). As a contrast, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics estimated the Israeli Jewish population was 5,435,800 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> a result of an increase in glucagon levels.|$|E

5|$|Links in some areas, {{especially}} lower-income and lower-traffic areas, {{are expected}} to not display advertisements {{because it is not}} worthwhile for CityBridge to advertise in these areas.

5|$|Many {{farmers in}} central Washington build dams on their {{property}} for irrigation and to control frost on their crops. The Washington Department of Ecology, using new techniques involving aerial photographs, estimated there <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> many as a hundred such dams in the area, {{most of which are}} illegal. Six such dams have failed in recent years, causing {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} of damage to crops and public roads. Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally.|$|E
5|$|Musical accompaniment <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> {{simple as}} {{clapping}} hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and talking drums, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, {{accompanied by a}} harplike instrument.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it {{may be involved in}} horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
50|$|The crossed square cupola <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> {{a part of}} some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron <b>may</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R

5|$|Tadpoles {{are highly}} {{vulnerable}} to being eaten by fish, newts, predatory diving beetles, and birds, such as kingfishers.

5|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{estimates}} that 35% {{of women in}} the world have experienced physical or sexual violence over their lifetime and that the commonest situation is intimate partner violence. 30% of women in relationships report such experience, and 38% of murders of women are due to intimate partners. These figures <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 70% in some regions. Risk factors include low educational achievement, a parental experience of violence, childhood abuse, gender inequality and cultural attitudes that allow violence to be considered more acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The eggs of Lepidoptera {{are usually}} rounded and small (1mm) though they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> large as 4mm {{in the case}} of Sphingidae and Saturniidae. They are {{generally}} quite plain in colour, white, pale green, bluish-green, or brown. Butterfly and moth eggs come in various shapes; some are spherical, others hemispherical, conical, cylindrical or lenticular (lens-shaped). Some are barrel-shaped or pancake-shaped, while others are turban or cheese-shaped. They may be angled or depressed at both ends, ridged or ornamented, spotted or blemished.|$|E
5|$|Though rare, TBI is {{a serious}} condition; it may cause {{obstruction}} of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about half of cases. Of those people with TBI who die, most do so before receiving emergency care, either from airway obstruction, exsanguination, or from injuries to other vital organs. Of those who do reach a hospital, the mortality rate <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> high as 30%.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter from}} Pope Adrian to Charlemagne survives which makes {{reference}} to Offa, but the date is uncertain; it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> early as 784 or {{as late as}} 791. In it Adrian recounts a rumour that had reached him: Offa had reportedly proposed to Charlemagne that Adrian should be deposed, and replaced by a Frankish pope. Adrian disclaims all belief in the rumour, {{but it is clear}} it had been a concern to him. The enemies of Offa and Charlemagne, described by Adrian as the source of the rumour, are not named. It is unclear whether this letter is related to the legatine mission of 786; if it predates it, then the mission might have been partly one of reconciliation, but the letter might well have been written after the mission.|$|E
