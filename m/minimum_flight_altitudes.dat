40|$|Flight {{operations}} {{dependent on}} digitized {{terrain elevation data}} for navigational reference or trajectory generation are constrained in minimum flight altitude, due to airborne navigation errors and inaccuracies of the reference terrain elevation data. This limitation is not restrictive in traditional medium-altitude implementations of such databases, such as in unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, or high-performance, high-speed aircraft. In low-altitude, lower speed terrain hugging helicopter missions, however, such constraints on <b>minimum</b> <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> greatly reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} missions and diminish the benefits of employing terrain elevation maps. A Kalman filter state estimator has been developed which blends airborne navigation, stored terrain elevation data, and a radar altimeter in estimating above-ground-level (AGL) altitude. This AGL state estimator was integrated in a near-terrain guidance system aboard a research helicopter and flight tested in moderately rugged terrain over a variety of flight and system conditions. The minimum operating altidude of the terrain database referenced guidance system was reduced from 300 ft to 150 ft with the addition of the Kalman filter state estimator...|$|E

We used a laser range finder and marine surveillance radar to measure <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes,</b> and identified significant effects on avian <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> by several weather components, particularly wind conditions, visi-bility and cloud cover. Wind components played a particularly significant role. Tailwinds were generally associated with elevated <b>flight</b> <b>altitude,</b> and reductions in <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> were usually associated with high wind speed, possibly because of enhanced energetic costs or risk of being blown off course.

40|$|Birds pose {{a serious}} risk to flight safety worldwide. A Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) is being {{developed}} in the Netherlands {{to reduce the risk}} of bird-aircraft collisions. In order to develop a temporally and spatially dynamic model of bird densities, data are needed on the flight-altitude distribution of birds and how this is influenced by weather. This study focuses on the dynamics of <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of several species of birds during local flights over land in relation to meteorological conditions. We measured <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of several species in the southeastern Netherlands using tracking radar during spring and summer 2000. Representatives of different flight strategy groups included four species: a soaring species (buzzard Buteo buteo), an obligatory aerial forager (swift Apus apus), a flapping and gliding species (blackheaded gull Larus ridibundus), and a flapping species (starling Sturnus vulgaris). Maximum <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> varied among species, during the day and among days. Weather significantly influenced the <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of all species studied. Factors such as temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric instability, cloud cover, and sea level pressure were related to <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Different combinations of factors explained 40 %- 70 % of the variance in maximum <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Weather affected <b>flight</b> strategy groups differently. Compared to flapping species, buzzards and swifts showed stronger variations in maximum daily altitude and f lew higher under conditions reflecting stronger thermal convection. The dynamic vertical distributions of birds are important for risk assessment and mitigation measures in flight safety as well as wind turbine studies...|$|R
40|$|By {{altering}} its <b>flight</b> <b>altitude,</b> a bird {{can change}} the atmospheric conditions it experiences during migration. Although many factors may influence a bird's choice of altitude, wind is generally accepted as being the most influential. However, the influence of wind is not clearly understood, particularly outside the trade-wind zone, and other factors may play a role. We used operational weather radar to measure the <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of nocturnally migrating birds during spring and autumn in the Netherlands. We first assessed whether the nocturnal altitudinal distribution of proportional bird density {{could be explained by}} the vertical distribution of wind support using three different methods. We then used generalized additive models to assess which atmospheric variables, in addition to altitude, best explained variability in proportional bird density per altitudinal layer each night. Migrants generally remained at low <b>altitudes,</b> and <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> explained 52 and 73 % of the observed variability in proportional bird density in spring and autumn, respectively. Overall, there were weak correlations between altitudinal distributions of wind support and proportional bird density. Improving tailwind support with height increased the probability of birds climbing to higher altitude, but when birds did fly higher than normal, they generally concentrated around the lowest altitude with acceptable wind conditions. The generalized additive model analysis also indicated an influence of temperature on <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes,</b> suggesting that birds avoided colder layers. These findings suggested that birds increased <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> to seek out more supportive winds when wind conditions near the surface were prohibitive. Thus, birds did not select <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> only to optimize wind support. Rather, they preferred to fly at low altitudes unless wind conditions there were unsupportive of migration. Overall, <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> of birds in relation to environmental conditions appear to reflect a balance between different adaptive pressures...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{provides}} a detailed {{assessment of the}} net impact of global <b>flight</b> <b>altitude</b> changes on radiative forcing and temperature response. Changes in contrail coverage and chemical perturbations (H 2 O, O 3, CH 4) and associated radiative forcings were determined from simulations with a quasi CTM. Future development of global mean radiative forcing and temperature response was calculated {{by means of a}} linear response model. The range of possible effects arising from various future scenarios is analyzed, and tradeoffs between partially counteracting short- and long term effects are studied. Present-day global mean radiative forcing of short-lived species and CH 4 is reduced when flying lower, whereas that of CO 2 increases. The opposite effect is found for higher <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> For increasing and sustained emissions, the climate impact changes are dominated by the effect of short-lived species, yielding a reduction for lower <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> and an increase for higher <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> For future scenarios involving a reduction or termination of emissions, radiative forcing of short-lived species decreases immediately, that of longer lived species decreases gradually, and respective temperature responses start to decay slowly. After disappearance of the shorter lived effects, only the counteracting CO 2 effect remains, resulting in an increased climate effect for lower <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes</b> and a decrease for higher <b>flight</b> <b>altitudes.</b> Incorporating knowledge about the altitude sensitivity of aviation climate impact in the route planning process offers substantial mitigation potential. Scenarios and time horizons for the evaluation of future effects of mitigation instruments must be chosen carefully depending on the mitigation aim...|$|R
