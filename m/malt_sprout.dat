40|$|The liquid {{pineapple}} waste contains mainly sucrose, glucose, fructose {{and other}} nutrients. It therefore can potentially {{be used as}} carbon source for lactic acid fermentation. The lactic acid is utilised in food technology as pH regulator, microbial preservative, buffering agent and in the chemical industry. Recently, lactic acid has been {{considered to be an}} important raw material for production of biodegradable lactate polymer. The experiments were carried out in batch fermentation at anaerobic condition with stirring speed: 50 rpm, temperature: 40 oC, pH: 6. 0, and inoculum size: 5 %. Effect of nitrogen source and initial sugar concentration were studied. The effect of nitrogen source on lactic acid production shows that the yeast extract is highest yield, followed by urea, corn steep liquor, <b>malt</b> <b>sprout</b> and ammonium sulphates with the yield of 78. 52; 26. 68; 19. 14; 14. 10 and 5. 6 %, respectively. The highest yield of initial sugar concentration on lactic acid production obtained was 78. 52 % (54. 97 g/l) at 70 g/l, if the concentration of sugar was increased to 110 g/l, the lactic acid production or yield decrease to 51. 53 g/l or 54. 24 %...|$|E
40|$|In the {{experiment}} was the effect of absorbens supplementation on the fermentation quality of brewers´ grains silage by comparing with the untreated control. As effective substance of experimental groups were barleygroats and <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts.</b> The addition of <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> „B“ and barleygroats „C“ in our experiment conditions increased statistically significantly (P< 0. 01) the content of DM in silage. The addition of <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> decreased pH value in experimental silage (4. 29 ± 0. 007) in comparison with control silage (4. 43 ± 0. 049). The <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> increased significantly (P< 0. 01) the contents of lactic acid (67. 15 ± 2. 796 g/kg DM), sum of acids (84. 30 ± 2. 97 g/kg DM) and decreased (P< 0. 01) in the trial the ethanol content (0. 51 ± 0. 102 g/kg DM) and acetic acid content (17. 15 ± 0. 227 g/kg DM). Silage with <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> has the highest (P< 0. 01) ammonia content from all silages in trial (966, 67 ± 33, 33 mg/kg DM). The use of absorbens inhibited significantly (P< 0. 01) in comparison with control silage (without absorbens) the content of propionic and butyric acid production. Brewers´grain silage with <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> and barleygroats addition were free of butyric and propionic acid, but had higher lactic acid content.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of addition of humidity absorbent (malt sprouts) and chemical conservation additive on fermentation process quality of brewer grains’ silage. Chemical conservation additive was based on formic acid, propionic acid, benzoic acid and ammonium formate content. In a model experiment the fresh brewer grains were used. A dry matter (DM) content of brewer grains was 187. 4  g / kg. Six treatments with three repetitions per treatment were prepared. The treatments A 1, A 2 and A 3 were not supplied by humidity absorbent. Treatment A 1 was a control treatment without any additive. The treatments A 2 and A 3 were supplied by chemical conservation additive in a dose of 3 L per tonne and 6 L per tonne, respectively. The treatments B 1, B 2 and B 3 were supplied by malt sprouts to reach DM content of conserved matter on level 320 – 350  g / kg. Moreover the treatments B 2 and B 3 were supplied by chemical additive with its dose 3 and 6 L per tonne. Model silages were evaluated after 8 months of conservation at average laboratory temperature 26 – 28  °C, from each treatment were the final laboratory samples taken and analyzed. During conservation of treatments B 1, B 2 and B 3 were no drain recognized. From A 1 treatment drained 1300  ml of waste fluid that is 145 L per tonne of conserved matter. That was significant (P <  0. 01) the malt sprouts addition support the lactic acid production and eliminate acetic acid production. There was no propionic acid or butyric acid detected in silages with malt sprouts event in these silages were analyzed higher (P <  0. 01) concentration of ammoniac. Chemical additive supplementation improved (P <  0. 01) the pH value and water leach acidity. The results show the <b>malt</b> <b>sprout</b> addition eliminates waste fluid drain and improves fermentation process.

40|$|In Switzerland, transplants {{for organic}} {{vegetable}} growing have been fertilised traditionally with slaughterhouse by-products. In autumn 2000, the Swiss government restricted {{the use of}} such products because of the BSE crisis. To maintain the production of organic transplants, alternative fertilisers needed to be tested. Eleven alternatives to horn powder (standard fertiliser) were selected based on the organic standards of the European Union, including feather powder (as an animal based product without BSE risk). The products were mixed with a standard growing media for organic transplants in a concentration of 300 mg nitrogen L- 1 growing media. Different experiments where set up with head lettuce (Lactuca sativa), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa var. pekinensis) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), at two different planting times: immediately after mixing the growing media and six weeks after mixing, in heated and cold greenhouses. Beside weight per plant, we assessed phytotoxic effects 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after mixing the media, and mineralised nitrogen in the growing media. When planting immediately after mixing, potato protein, vinasse (wastes of food processing), and feather powder resulted in the highest weight per plant. Plants fertilised with horn powder, sunflower oil cake and ground field beans had the lowest weight per plant (40 % less). Horn powder, ground <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts,</b> vinasse, potato protein and feather powder with stored growing media produced the strongest transplants. Phytotoxicity tests (four different methods) showed significant differences between horn powder (slight damage) and field beans (seriously harmed). Horn powder is still the best fertiliser for organic transplant production followed by feather powder. Horn powder causes little phytotoxicity to the crop even under extreme conditions. The most promising pure plant products are potato protein, <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> and vinasse. Plant-based fertilisers need to be applied carefully; the fertiliser should be mixed with the growing media at least two weeks before sowing...|$|R
40|$|The yeast growth {{stimulant}} produced during {{the growth of}} Aspergillus niger on sucrose media {{was found to be}} similar to that obtained from the extract of <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts.</b> Bios II prepared from the mold-produced stimulant by means of alcoholic barium hydroxide and Bios II from <b>malt</b> <b>sprouts</b> had similar effects upon the growth of yeast. The results obtained by Schopmeyer (1931), to the contrary, may be explained on the difference in the media and the yeast employed;The importance of magnesium sulfate in media used in bios studies was emphasized. The effect of the concentration of magnesium sulfate upon the growth of various strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the presence of Bios II and inositol was determined. With all the strains studied, the addition of magnesium sulfate to Medium C increased the stimulative effect of Bios II and inositol;The effect of inositol upon the stimulation of yeast growth by Bios II was studied. The complementary effect of inositol is dependent upon the strain of yeast employed, and upon the concentration of magnesium sulfate. In the absence of inositol the higher concentrations of magnesium sulfate are toxic toward certain strains of yeast. In such cases the addition of inositol gave large increase in growth;Twenty strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied in regard to growth in the presence of inositol, Bios II, and magnesium sulfate. The strains were divided into four groups according to their reactions to various combinations of the three substances;Photomicrographs were made of four different strains to show the ability of inositol to reduce the clumping of cells;Comparison was made of the growth of various strains of yeast in the media of Clark, Williams, and Fulmer {{in order to determine the}} suitability of each for use in bios studies...|$|R

500|$|Fermentation of THB beer {{requires}} approximately {{eight hours}} for each mash of 130 hectoliters. The mash is {{a blend of}} <b>malt</b> (<b>sprouted</b> barley) and corn in an 80/20 ratio to which water and hops are added. [...] The mash is heated in a vat for around two hours to support fermentation. The product is filtered and then heated to 100 degrees Celsius to concentrate and sterilize it. The beer is then decanted and cooled for an hour at 10 degrees Celsius. Finally, a type of mushroom is added as a leavening and fermenting agent; the beer is allowed to ferment for a full week, and excess carbon dioxide produced by the process is collected for the production of soft drinks and other carbonated beverages at the factory. The beer is allowed to rest in vats for several more days before being filtered once more and then bottled and pasteurized at 62 degrees Celsius for three minutes. The automated bottling process yields crates of THB that are ready for shipment to regional wholesale distribution points.|$|R
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of disease affecting a herd of 16 dairy cattle which were fed mouldy, sprouted maize is described. Eight of the cattle were affected, 5 of which died. The clinical signs included muscular tremors, hypersensitivity, ataxia, anorexia and salivation. Aspergillus clavatus was the only fungus isolated from the sprouts. Clinical signs that were indistinguishable {{from those in the}} field outbreak were reproduced by dosing the mouldy maize sprouts to a steer and a sheep, and by dosing another sheep with maize inoculated with a pure culture of A. clavatus isolated from the mouldy maize on the farm. Light microscopical examination revealed neuronal degeneration and necrosis in the midbrain, medulla oblongata and spinal cord of all 3 of these animals.

Modern grain-harvesting practices have reduced the naturally occurring enzymes that grains had in former times, a result of no-longer-used grain-storage processes, so today small amounts of enzymes are routinely added to flour by manufacturers, often in the form of <b>malted</b> barley or <b>sprouted</b> grain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Experimental {{measurements}} during transporting and manipulating with grains {{were carried}} out at post-harvesting line under operational conditions. Measurements {{were carried out}} in Agro Division Selice and POD Abrahám. Effect of the transportation and manipulation on the external quality of grains was evaluated. Grain volume weight, foreign matters, impurities and grain damage were assessed. Obtained results: Manipulation with grain is a big source of grain mechanical damage. Bucket elevators are intended for vertical transportation of grain, they cause crushing the grain leading to breaking kernels rather than to small damages of transported grain. Chain conveyors (redlers) are intended for horizontal transportation of grain. The mechanical damage of grain is particularly observed at the capacity lower than the nominal capacity. Screw conveyors with closed channel are rarely used in post-harvesting lines. They cause large damage of transported grain and therefore absolutely improper for <b>malting</b> barley (<b>sprouts</b> are broken by them) ...|$|R

Six treatments {{were laid out}} in a 392 factorial arrangement of treatments with three dietary inclusion levels of MSP (0, 50, and 100 g/kg) and supplemented with 200 mg/kg yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or 200 mg/kg of a commercial enzyme. The experiment lasted for the starter (day 28 – 56) and grower phases (day 57 – 84) of the birds. Each treatment group consisted of 20 turkeys replicated four times with five birds each. Data were analysed using analysis of variance while polynomial contrast was used to determine the trends (linear and quadratic) of MSP inclusion levels. Irrespective of dietary supplementation with enzyme or yeast, final body weight (BW), total BW gain, and feed intake for turkey poults from day 29 – 56 was reduced (p 0. 05) on AME. Inclusion of MSP resulted in poor growth performance. This confirms earlier studies that utilization of MSP by poultry is rather poor.

The MSP was incorporated into the diet at 0, 10, 20 and 30 % levels. The experiment lasted for 56 days. Feed and water were supplied ad libitum. The performance characteristics, nutrient utilization, carcass characteristics and economics of production were measures of response. The result showed that, the final live weight and daily weight gain of rabbits on 0 and 20 % MSP diets were highest (p< 0. 05). The daily feed intake of rabbits on MSP diets were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than those on 0 % MSP. The dry matter, crude protein and crude fibre digestibility significantly declined (p< 0. 05) as the level of MSP inclusion increases. Energy intake and energy retained followed a similar trend. Carcass weight, liver, kidney and heart weights were significantly (p< 0. 05) influenced by the dietary treatment.

40|$|<b>Malt</b> (dried, <b>sprouted</b> cereal grain) is {{the major}} {{ingredient}} in most beers and in certain hot and cold beverages. It is also a useful ingredient in some cereal food products such as bread and infant porridges. In terms of nutrients, malt contains mainly complex carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber), but also protein of reasonable quality and availability, B vitamins and minerals. Malt {{is a source of}} hydrolytic enzymes, especially amylases. In brewing, the malt amylases produce the sugars which the yeast ferments to alcohol and carbon dioxide The amylases also increase the sweetness and improve the texture of food products such as bread and porridges. Floor malting of sorghum and millet is a traditional craft that has been carried out throughout Africa for hundreds of years. The modern factory manufacture of barley malt and sorghum malt is in principle identical to traditional malting. This guide shows how traditional floor malting can be scaled-up into a small commercial-scale operation, through the application of simple, sound food manufacturing practices. Note: The guide is an introduction to the technology of sorghum and millet floor malting. It is not intended to provide complete instructions on how to floor malt sorghum and millets.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in wort {{production}} is to make <b>malt</b> from dried, <b>sprouted</b> barley. The <b>malt</b> is then run through a roller mill and cracked. This cracked grain is then mashed, that is, mixed with hot water and steeped, a slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars. At set intervals, most notably when the mixture has reached temperatures of 45, 62 and 73 °C (113, 144 and 163 °F), the heating is briefly halted. The temperature of the mixture is usually increased to 78 °C (172 °F) for mashout. Lautering is the next step, which means the sugar-extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort. In homebrewing, the malt-making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water. The mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and, {{in the case of}} most beer production, to extract the bittering, flavour and aroma from hops. In beer making, the wort is known as [...] "sweet wort" [...] until the hops have been added, after which it is called [...] "hopped or bitter wort". The addition of hops is generally done in three parts at set times. The bittering hops, added first, are boiled in the wort for approximately one hour to one and a half hours. This long boil extracts resins, which provides the bittering. Then, the flavouring hops are added, typically 15 minutes {{from the end of the}} boil. The finishing hops are added last, toward the end of or after the boil. This extracts the oils, which provide flavour and aroma but evaporate quickly. In general, hops provide the most flavouring when boiled for approximately 15 minutes, and the most aroma when not boiled at all.|$|R
