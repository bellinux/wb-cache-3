5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the <b>mind</b> <b>being</b> a fortress, and says that Edge died to remind people that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E
25|$|Rias {{develops}} {{feelings for}} Issei {{over the course}} of the series. In the storyline where she is to be Riser Phoenix's fiancee, she resigns her Rating Game against him in order to save Issei; however, after Issei subsequently defeats Riser, she kisses him and moves into his family's home. She does not <b>mind</b> <b>being</b> intimate with Issei, but gets upset when other girls want to steal him away. Later, Rias' mother, Venelana, encourages her to push her relationship further with Issei (in which Rias would attempt to seduce Issei), but gets upset when Issei could not call her by her name. Eventually, Issei finally professes his love for her and calls Rias by her first name instead of her President title. She cries tears of joy and tells him that she feels the same way and the two officially become a couple. Though it seems none of the other girls (Akeno, Xenovia, Asia, Koneko, Irina, Rossweisse and Ravel) have given up on Issei. She has also shown more tolerance towards Issei's dreams of becoming Harem King, even allowing everyone to make dates with Issei with the understanding that he will always return to her afterwards.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{featured}} matches of Triplemanía XX saw three former tag teams, and current rivals, reunite and {{face each other}} in a Parejas Suicidas match. The first team is the former La Familia de Tijuana of Extreme Tiger and Halloween. Together, Tiger and Halloween held the AAA World Tag Team Championship from April to September 2008, after which the team disbanded, when Halloween left AAA to join Perros del Mal Producciones. Halloween returned to AAA on June 6, 2010, at Triplemanía XVIII as a member of Los Perros del Mal and has ever since remained {{on the opposite side of}} Extreme Tiger, who turned técnico during Halloween's time away from the promotion. The rivalry between Halloween and Tiger ignited in early 2012, when the two ended up on opposite sides during the rivalry between Tiger's tag team partner Jack Evans and Los Perros del Mals leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. The second team in the match is the former The Hart Foundation 2.0 of Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, who joined AAA together in early 2008 as representatives of the rudo stable La Legión Extranjera (Foreign Legion). In May 2009, the team disbanded with Evans turning técnico, after which the two started feuding over the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. The feud ended without a proper conclusion in early 2010, when AAA suspended Hart indefinitely. Hart finally returned to AAA on March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, and was on April 1 revealed as the newest member of Los Perros del Mal, taking over El Hijo del Perro Aguayo's feud with Evans as Aguayo moved on to chasing the AAA Mega Championship. The final team in the match is the former La Hermandad 187 of Joe Líder and Psicosis. After winning the AAA World Tag Team Championship from La Familia de Tijuana in September 2008, Líder and Psicosis, then known as Nicho el Millonario, held the title for 18 months, becoming the longest reigning champions in AAA history. Even after losing the title, Líder and Nicho remained together as a técnico team, feuding with the La Sociedad stable. In June 2011, AAA, in storyline, suspended Nicho, after he interfered in a six-man tag team match at Triplemanía XIX, where Líder, Heavy Metal and Electroshock, replacing the previously injured Nicho, faced Chessman, Silver King and Último Gladiador. On July 16, Nicho turned on Líder, believing that Líder had not stood up for him as he was, in his <b>mind,</b> <b>being</b> wronged by AAA. With Nicho joining Los Perros del Mal, he and Líder have had a bloody rivalry ever since. On April 6, 2012, the rivalry took another twist, when Líder burned Nicho's face with a fireball. Following the burning, Nicho began once again wearing his old mask and working under the ring name Psicosis, with the storyline being that Líder's fireball had not only severely burned Nicho's face, but the incident had also driven him insane. On July 11, it was announced that the Parejas Suicidas match would be taking place inside a steel cage. At the following day's Triplemanía XX press conference, the team of Chessman and AAA Cruiserweight Champion Juventud Guerrera was added to the match. Unlike the other teams in the match, Chessman and Guerrera have no prolonged history with each other, though they are on opposite sides in the battle between La Sociedad and AAA. In the months before Triplemanía XX, Chessman had been feuding with Vampiro, while Guerrera was busy with his former protégé Daga, who had turned on him and joined Los Perros del Mal. The losing team in the match would then face {{each other in a}} Lucha de Apuestas. If La Familia de Tijuana lost, the match would be a Mask vs. Hair match, in other cases it would be a Hair vs. Hair match.|$|E

It was simply that they detest the way we depicted them." [...] Feminists were uncertain how {{to react to the}} series, with some being concerned that audiences would not perceive the show as satire but as an attempt to represent how a female-dominated society would actually operate. Lear marketed the program through his company, TAT Syndication. The series ran five nights a week.|$|E

500|$|It was the IsoDidact who {{activated}} the Halo Array. Despite this, the Ur-Didact preferred the Composer – a device capable of disintegrating {{the bodies of}} organic beings, digitizing their minds and giving them powerful robotic forms (known as [...] "Promethean Knights") immune to the Flood, which could only assimilate living tissue. Seeing this as an ideal strategy to defeat the Flood, the Ur-Didact used the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into Prometheans, but there were too few of them to turn the tide. Seeking to both {{increase the size of}} his army and exact a measure of revenge for their past aggression, the Ur-Didact forcibly used the Composer on humans. Horrified, the Librarian incapacitated him and sealed him away in another Cryptum on Requiem, in the hope that meditation and long exposure to the Domain, a Forerunner network that spans the known galaxy, would amend his motives and heal his damaged mind. However, the Domain was evidently destroyed with the activation of the Halo Array, and as a result, instead of his <b>mind</b> <b>being</b> healed in his meditation, the Ur-Didact would spend the next 100,000 years in complete silence, dwelling on his rage and madness.|$|E
