5000|$|The <b>mimic</b> {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the original Monster Manual (1977), by Gary Gygax. This book described <b>mimics</b> as [...] "subterranean creatures which cannot stand {{the light of the}} sun. They are able to perfectly <b>mimic</b> stone or wood." [...] According to the book, <b>mimics</b> thus pose as items such as stonework, doors, or chests; when a character or creature touches the disguised <b>mimic,</b> the <b>mimic</b> can lash out with a bludgeoning pseudopod. A <b>mimic</b> excretes an adhesive glue to hold fast whatever touches it. The book states that all <b>mimics</b> move about constantly in search of prey. <b>Mimics</b> are described as neutral in alignment.|$|R

5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{involves}} {{only two}} species. The potential host (or prey) drives away its parasite (or predator) by <b>mimicking</b> it, {{the reverse of}} host-parasite aggressive mimicry. It was coined by Pasteur as a phrase for such rare mimicry systems, and is named after the American ecologist Lawrence E. Gilbert.|$|E
40|$|Batesian mimics—benign {{species that}} predators avoid because they {{resemble}} a dangerous species—often vary geographically in resemblance to their model. Such geographical variation in mimic–model resemblance may reflect geographical variation in model abundance. Natural selection should favour even poor <b>mimics</b> where their model is common, but only good <b>mimics</b> where their model is rare. We tested these predictions in a snake-mimicry complex where the geographical {{range of the}} <b>mimic</b> extends beyond that of its model. <b>Mimics</b> {{on the edge of}} their model's range (where the model was rare) resembled the model more closely than did <b>mimics</b> in the centre of their model's range (where the model was common). When free-ranging natural predators {{on the edge of the}} model's range were given a choice of attacking replicas of good or poor <b>mimics,</b> they avoided only good <b>mimics.</b> By contrast, those in the centre of the model's range attacked good and poor <b>mimics</b> equally frequently. Generally, although poor <b>mimics</b> may persist in areas where their model is common, only the best <b>mimics</b> should occur in areas where their model is rare. Thus, counter-intuitively, the best <b>mimics</b> may occur on the edge of their model's range...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>mimic</b> {{appears in}} the Monster Manual (2000) for the game's third edition. In this edition, the <b>mimic</b> is given the {{aberration}} creature type. This book describes <b>mimics</b> as [...] "strange and deadly creatures that can change their pigmentation and shape. They use this ability to lure hapless victims close enough to slay." [...] This book notes that a weapon striking a <b>mimic</b> becomes stuck to the creature's thick, slimy adhesive, though the weapon can be pried off. In this edition, a <b>mimic</b> can assume the general shape of any object that fills roughly [...] The <b>mimic</b> also {{appears in the}} revised Monster Manual (2003) for v 3.5.

40|$|Mimicry theory {{predicts that}} <b>mimics</b> in a Batesian mimicry complex evolve to {{resemble}} models closely, {{and that there}} is a limit on the numbers of <b>mimics</b> relative to models. For hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), supposed <b>mimics</b> of social wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, neither of these is true; many <b>mimics</b> are imperfect and in the UK and Europe they outnumber their models manifold. We hypothesized that the high abundance of <b>mimics</b> relative to models in the UK may be the result not just of <b>mimic</b> model dynamics, but of habitat changes caused by humans. Most of the larvae of poor <b>mimics</b> are aphidophagous, and changes from ancient forest to agricultural and/or urban habitats may have vastly augmented aphid numbers. Using new and literature data, we compared mimicry profiles of habitats differing in their degree of habitat disturbance. In both cases more highly disturbed habitats had proportionally more poor <b>mimics</b> and fewer high-fidelity <b>mimics</b> than less disturbed habitats. This supports the hypothesis that habitat change has an effect on model to <b>mimic</b> ratios...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>mimic</b> first {{appeared}} for second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons {{in the second}} volume of the Monstrous Compendium series (1989). In this set, the creature is described as magically-created, and usually appears {{in the form of}} a treasure chest, although its natural color is a speckled grey that resembles granite. The entry notes that a <b>mimic</b> can alter its pigmentation to resemble varieties of stone (including marble), and various metals (including gold, silver, and copper); a <b>mimic</b> cannot lose mass in this transformation, but may radically alter its dimensions. This entry reveals the in-game origin of the mimic: [...] "Mimics were originally created by wizards to protect themselves from treasure hunters"; the language spoken by the smaller variety of <b>mimic,</b> also known as the common <b>mimic,</b> is a corruption of the original language spoken by their wizard creators. <b>Mimics</b> have no moral code and are sometimes difficult to employ as guardians; the killer <b>mimic</b> is neutral in alignment like the common <b>mimic,</b> but has a tendency towards evil. The entry also notes that alcohol will weaken a <b>mimic's</b> glue, and that the <b>mimic</b> may neutralize the glue at any time; a <b>mimic</b> is also immune to acid attacks and is unaffected by molds, green slime, and various pudding monsters. The <b>mimic's</b> entry is reprinted in the Monstrous Manual (1993).|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose Previous {{studies have}} shown a stroke <b>mimic</b> rate of 9 %– 31 %. We aimed to {{establish}} the proportion of stroke <b>mimics</b> amongst suspected acute strokes, to clarify the aetiology of stroke <b>mimic</b> {{and to develop a}} prediction model to identify stroke <b>mimics.</b> Methods This was a retrospective cohort observational study. Consecutive “stroke alert” patients were identified over nine months in a primary stroke centre. 31 variables were collected. Final diagnosis was defined as “stroke” or “stroke mimic”. Multivariable regression analysis was used to define clinical predictors of stroke <b>mimic.</b> Results 206 patients were reviewed. 22 % were classified as stroke <b>mimics.</b> Multivariable scoring did not help in identification of stroke <b>mimics.</b> 99. 5 % of patients had a neurological diagnosis at final diagnosis. Discussion 22 % of patients with suspected acute stroke had a stroke <b>mimic.</b> The aetiology of stroke <b>mimics</b> was varied, with seizure, encephalopathy, syncope and migraine being commonest. Multivariable scoring for identification of stroke <b>mimics</b> is not feasible. 99. 5 % of patients had a neurological diagnosis.

40|$|Batesian and {{aggressive}} <b>mimics</b> {{are considered to}} be under selective pressure to resemble their models, whereas signal receivers are under selection to discriminate between <b>mimics</b> and models. However, the perceptual ability of signal receivers to discriminate between <b>mimics</b> and models is rarely studied. Here we examined 15 model [...] <b>mimic</b> coral reef fish pairs using nonsubjective methods to judge the accuracy of <b>mimics</b> in terms of color and luminance. We then investigated the potential ability of fish with various visual systems to discriminate between model and <b>mimic</b> colors using theoretical vision models. We found the majority of <b>mimics</b> closely resembled models in terms of color and luminance from a nonsubjective perspective. However, fish that have potentially trichromatic (3 distinct cone photoreceptors) visual systems with ultraviolet sensitivity had a much better capacity to discriminate between models and <b>mimics</b> compared with fish with midrange sensitivity or dichromatic (2 cone photoreceptors) fish. The spectral reflectance of color patches reflected by models and <b>mimics</b> became more similar with an increase in depth, indicating that signal receivers {{may be more likely to}} distinguish <b>mimics</b> from models in habitats located closer to the surface. There was no such change in luminance contrast with depth. The selection pressure on <b>mimics</b> to accurately resemble their model is therefore predicted to vary depending on the visual system of the signal receiver and the light environment.

A purpose-built phylogeny for the hover flies was used to control for potential lack of independence due to shared evolutionary history.
