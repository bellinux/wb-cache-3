5|$|Horizontal jumps (long {{jump and}} triple jump) and all throws must be {{initiated}} behind a line. In {{the case of}} horizontal jumps, that line is a straight line perpendicular to the runway. In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt invalidates the attempt—it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line {{on the edge of}} sector is a foul (the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The <b>measuring</b> <b>tape</b> is carefully straightened to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record (or potential record) occurs, that measurement is taken (again) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials (plus usually the meet referee). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors (usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set—so the competitor in first place {{at the end of the}} third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets rearrange the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point. At other competitions, meet management may choose to limit all competitors to four or three attempts. Whatever the format, all competitors get an equal number of attempts.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>measures</b> {{that were}} {{intended}} for use in tailoring or dressmaking were made from flexible cloth or plastic. They are named [...] "sewing tape". These types of <b>tape</b> <b>measures</b> were mainly used for the measuring of the human's waist line. Today, <b>measuring</b> <b>tapes</b> made for sewing are made of fiberglass, which does not tear or stretch as easily. <b>Measuring</b> <b>tapes</b> designed for carpentry or construction often use a stiff, curved metallic ribbon that can remain stiff and straight when extended, but retracts into a coil for convenient storage. This type of <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> will have a floating tang or hook on the end to aid measuring. The tang {{is connected to the}} tape with loose rivets through oval holes, and can move a distance equal to its thickness, to provide both inside and outside measurements that are accurate. [...] A <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> of 25 or even 100 feet can wind into a relatively small container. The self-marking <b>tape</b> <b>measure</b> allows the user an accurate one hand measure.|$|R

25|$|A {{tape measure}} or <b>measuring</b> <b>tape</b> is a {{flexible}} form of ruler. It {{consists of a}} ribbon of cloth, plastic, fiber glass, or metal strip with linear-measurement markings.

25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, {{making it easy to}} cut a smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of the}} ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible to cut a piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a <b>measuring</b> <b>tape</b> and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E

The nominal length of tapes can be affected by physical imperfections, stretching or wear. Constant use of tapes cause wear, tapes can become kinked and may be improperly repaired when breaks occur.|$|R

40|$|A {{document}} discusses lightweight instrument booms {{under development}} for use aboard spacecraft. A boom {{of this type}} comprises a thin-walled graphite fiber/ matrix composite tube with an integral hinge that can be bent for stowage and later allowed to spring back to straighten the boom for deployment in outer space. The boom design takes advantage of both the stiffness of the composite in tubular geometry and the flexibility of thin sections of the composite. The hinge is formed by machining windows in the tube at diametrically opposite locations so that there remain two opposing cylindrical strips resembling <b>measuring</b> <b>tapes.</b> Essential to the design is a proprietary composite layup that renders the hinge tough yet flexible enough to be bendable as much as 90 in either of two opposite directions. When the boom is released for deployment, the torque exerted by the bent hinge suffices to overcome parasitic resistance from harnesses and other equipment, so that the two sections of the hinge snap to a straight, rigid condition {{in the same manner}} as that of <b>measuring</b> <b>tapes.</b> Issues addressed in development thus far include selection of materials, out-of-plane bending, edge cracking, and separation of plies...|$|R
