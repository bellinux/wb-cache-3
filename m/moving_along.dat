5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the coastline {{of the southeastern}} United States, a new hurricane was observed in the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Sentries did detect boats <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> {{the river}} that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the first wave lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times.

5|$|As river {{development}} {{continued in}} the 20thcentury, each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam, beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938. The development was accompanied by extensive negotiations between natives and US government agencies. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, a coalition of various tribes, adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids; Still, in the 1930s, there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round, <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> with the fish's migration patterns throughout the seasons. The Yakama were slower to do so, organizing a formal government in 1944. In the 21stcentury, the Yakama, Nez Perce, Umatilla, and Warm Springs tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00 on {{the morning}} of 31May, Laforey sent the boats from his {{squadron}} inshore to attack the grounded Confiante. Coming alongside the wreck at 12:45, the British boarding party, under Lieutenants George Acklom and William J. Simonds, found no one alive on the ship, but counted a large number of French dead still on board. Removing the French colours and paperwork, the boarding party started fires in the bow and stern of the corvette before withdrawing, despite a steady but ineffective musket fire from French troops overlooking the beach and a force of cavalry <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the shore. The fire rapidly destroyed Confiante and the British boarding party retired without casualties.|$|E

5|$|On 7August the 6th Airborne {{division}} {{was ordered to}} prepare to move over to the offensive, with its objective being {{the mouth of the}} River Seine. The division began to advance as the Germans retreated from France following their defeat in the Battle of Falaise. The 6th Airlanding Brigade, now commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, had the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade under its command. Together they would form the left flank of the division's advance, <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the French coast, while the remainder of the division advanced further inland.|$|E
5|$|The worm {{starts at}} some point of an {{infinite}} triangular grid. It starts <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> {{one of the six}} gridlines that meet at each point and, once it has travelled one unit of distance, it arrives at a new point. The worm then decides, based on the distribution of traversed and untraversed gridlines, what direction it will take. The directions are relative to the worm's point of view. If the worm has not encountered this exact distribution before it may leave along any untraversed gridline. From then on, if it encounters that distribution again, it must move in the same way. If there are no untraversed gridlines available, the worm dies and the simulation ends.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the effects}} of a larger upper-level low, Juan slowed on October 28 while {{approaching}} the Louisiana coastline. At 1200 UTC that day, the hurricane attained peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). After executing a loop just offshore southern Louisiana, Juan turned back to the east, making landfall at peak intensity near Morgan City at 1100 UTC on October 29. Subsequently, Juan turned sharply to the northwest, executing another loop over southern Louisiana near Lafayette. Late on October 29, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, emerging into Vermilion Bay early the next day with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Juan turned to the east, <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the southern Louisiana coast and re-organizing slightly.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was clear}} at 03:00 that the German Army {{in front of the}} {{division}} was pulling back, the first divisional unit to follow up was the 3rd Parachute Brigade. By 07:00 Bures was occupied by the 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions and by 08:00 the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was in the Bois de Bavent. The rest of the division started advancing around the same time. The 4th Special Service Brigade headed for Troan and Saint Pair, while the 1st Special Service Brigade made for Bavent and Robehomme. In the north, the 6th Airlanding Brigade started <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the road from Bréville to Merville.|$|E
5|$|Advancing in bounds, occupying company {{bases and}} sending out patrols, the {{battalion}} began its move south on 15 January 1945. Throughout {{the rest of}} the month, the battalion was involved in a number of relatively minor engagements with the Japanese as they carried out patrolling and ambush operations along the Australian line of advance. By the start of February they reached Mosina and after receiving intelligence that a Japanese force had been detected at Warapa, they sent out to raid their camp. Upon reaching Warapa the patrol set fire to the huts in which the Japanese force was billeted and then withdrew. Later reconnaissance determined that 15 Japanese had died in the blaze. By 12 February the battalion married up with patrols from the 25th Battalion that were <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the Tavera River and then later, as the battalion continued on towards Mosigetta, one company linked up with patrols from the 9th Battalion on 17 February.|$|E

5|$|During September 12, the {{depression}} continued to develop quickly {{with both the}} JMA and the JTWC reporting that {{the depression}} had intensified into a Tropical Storm later that day, with the JMA assigning the international name of Choi-wan and the international designation of 0915. During September 13, Choi-wan gradually developed whilst moving west with the JMA reporting that Choi-wan had become a severe tropical storm late that day, before reporting along with the JTWC early the next day that Choi-wan had intensified further and had become a weak Typhoon with multiple spiral bands that had wrapped into the fully consolidated center to form a banding eye. During September 14, Choi-wan intensified further whilst <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> the southwestern edge of a deep level subtropical ridge of the northeast, intensifying into a Category 4-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 1-minute winds of 220km/h (140mph).|$|E
5|$|James {{was born}} in Kirkdale, Liverpool, {{the son of the}} Rev. Dr. David James, who was rector of Panteg, Monmouthshire, from 1856 to 1871. Herbert James was educated at King Henry VIII Grammar School, Abergavenny, and then studied at two Oxford colleges. He matriculated at Jesus College in 1863, before winning a {{scholarship}} and <b>moving</b> <b>along</b> Turl Street to Lincoln College in 1864, obtaining a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1867. He was appointed a Fellow of St John's College in 1869 and was President of the Oxford Union Society in 1871 (where he nominated H. H. Asquith to the Standing Committee). He was then ordained, and received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1874. Later, on 31 May 1895, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, having previously been excused by the University from satisfying the requirements normally set for the award of the degree.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>along</b> the {{southern}} edge of the ridge, Roy accelerated again as it headed towards the Philippines. On January 14, the storm crossed 135°E, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration to issue advisories on Roy, assigning it with the local name Asiang. As it neared the country, wind shear began to increase, resulting in further weakening. On January 16, Roy made landfall in the Bicol Region as a minimal typhoon before succumbing to shear and increased friction with the mountains of the Philippines. Later that day, the system weakened to a tropical storm before entering the South China Sea. The JTWC downgraded Roy to a tropical depression during the afternoon of January 17 and ceased issuing advisories early the next day. However, the JMA continued to monitor Roy as a tropical storm until the morning of January 18 and declared the system dissipated early on January 19, at which time the depression was situated roughly 700km (435mi) east-northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.|$|E
