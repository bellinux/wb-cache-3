40|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief {{there is a}} clear {{correlation}} between the primary antitoxin response in guinea-pigs and the potential immunity established by the first injection of toxoid. The magnitude of the secondary response is determined by the potency and amount of the toxoid contained in the first dose and is largely independent of both quality and quantity of that contained in the second dose. One-injection and two-injection methods of assay would probably give the same answer if appropriate doses were chosen but the use of more than one injection is recommended because the sera produced are more avid. The first injection could be of graded doses of the toxoids under test and the second the same for all animals, e. g., a suitable dose of a plain toxoid. A response <b>metameter</b> defined as U 0. 2 was preferred to log U in analysing the results, U being the antitoxin concentration in international units...|$|E
40|$|Kurokawa, Masami (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan), Motoichi Hatano, Noboru Kashiwagi, Tateo Saito, Setsuji Ishida, and Reiko Homma. A {{new method}} for the turbidimetric {{measurement}} of bacterial density. J. Bacteriol. 83 : 14 – 19. 1962. —It was demonstrated that {{by a combination}} of two types of <b>metameter</b> of transmittance (T), –log T (0. 0 ≤ T ≤ 0. 5) and 0. 6 + log (1 – T) (0. 5 ≤ T ≤ 1. 0), the optical density thus expressed showed a linear relationship to bacterial density or cell concentration over the whole range of T, except at the extreme ends. This allows measurement of relative bacterial density and cell concentration, and eliminates unnecessary sampling and dilution. In this respect, the proposed method seems superior to the method based upon Beer's law. The possible error derived from the fact that organisms may vary in size and shape at different stages of their growth is a fault common to all known methods of turbidimetric measurement, and is not peculiar to the method presented here...|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal growth {{experiments}} using rats, lambs, and heifers were analysed {{by establishing}} linear relationships between ages, live weights and body lengths in individual animals. Various analytical methods were investigated. Statistical and biological reasons forced the logarithmic transformation of weights and lengths, a three parameter logarithmic <b>metameter</b> was used if {{means and standard}} deviations were correlated on a two parameter logarithmic <b>metameter.</b> Age was transformed to give linear relationships. Changes to the experimental design and analysis of growth experiments were suggested. Effects were demonstrated in individual animals that were previously only shown for grouped data and the techniques' sensitivity produced novel findings. Rats were ovariectomised at three ages and/or treated with oestrogen and slaughtered at four ages. The rat ovary inhibited growth pre-pubertally, and the response to ovariectomy or oestrogen was negatively related to the pre-treatment growth rate. Compensatory growth occurred following weaning in rats and following birth in ruminants. Estimated initial weights explained more of the variation in subsequent growth rates than did observed weights. In rats pre-weaning growth lines diverged (compensation being negligible), birth and weaning weights being positively correlated, post-weaning growth rate was strongly negatively correlated with weaning weight. Estimated birth and final weights, and weaning and final weights, were unrelated; compensation being nearly complete. Two sets of pre-weaning lamb live weights (collected by others) were, for individual animals, linearised. Pre-weaning compensation occurred, as it did in two independent sets of weighings from monozygotic twin heifers (also collected by others). Compensatory growth, between and within sets of twin, occurred rapidly to weaning, then slowed. The efficiency of identical twins for experimentation, using these methods, was shown, as were the disadvantages of using average daily gains. The linear relationships did not explain all the systematic variation, short- and long-term oscillations in growth rate occurred. Long-term oscillations were related to live weight rather than to age. Neo-natal testosterone treatment of female rats transposed and advanced the pattern of growth. Both Sex and Strain affected the pattern of growth. The possible use of these techniques in animal breeding was discussed. The logarithms of lengths and weights, assumed by many biologists to be linearly related (allometry), showed curvilinear relationships. A technique of carcass analysis was developed and applied. Ovariectomy increased rat body weight and length but did not produce obesity (assayed by percentage composition and by allometry). Oestrogen stimulated fat deposition but inhibited linear growth. Body weight's response to oestrogen was adaptive,bone growth's non-adaptive. Similarly there was a large pre-pubertal sex difference in body length but a small difference in body weight. This separation of the mechanisms controlling bone growth and body weight increase was discussed. Part of the increased size of ovariectomised rats was attributed to increased skin size (and altered composition) and decreased tail length, giving decreased heat loss, and improved energy utilisation for growth. Body growth occurs in two overlapping phases, of cell hypertrophy and cell hyperplasia, represented by different growth equations, and controlled by different mechanisms. A possible mechanism controlling cell hypertrophy, and directing compensatory growth, based on cartilage growth, would explain some of the effects described. The endocrinology of the mechanism, and oestrogen's interaction with it, were discussed...|$|E
40|$|Calcitonin {{inhibits}} bone resorption {{through a}} direct {{action on the}} osteoclast. We report a quantitative analysis of bone resorption by disaggregated rat osteoclasts. We then used our findings to develop a formal bioassay for calcitonin. Osteoclasts were mechanically disaggregated from neonatal rat long bones and dispersed at low densities on slices of devitalized bovine cortical bone. The resulting areas of bone excavation were quantified to micrometric precision by scanning electron microscopy together with computer-assisted image analysis. These findings were correlated with the volumes of bone resorption in the same slices measured by confocal scanning microscopy for the first time. The total planar areas of bone resorption per slice correlated linearly (r = 0. 78) with the confocal microscopic measurements of total volume resorbed, provided that volume was expressed to its two-thirds power. The latter transformation resulted in representations of the determined areas ([length] 2) and volumes ([length] 3) which were dimensionally consistent. These findings thus demonstrate that osteoclastic bone excavations show a consistent relationship between area and volume and that assessments of the area of excavations accordingly provide an empirical representation {{of the volume of}} bone resorbed. Furthermore, in view of the skewed nature of the distributions of area measurements, we assessed the effect of transforming the response variable to derive a <b>metameter,</b> (planar area of resorption) 1 / 2. Such transformed data points, which expressed the data in the dimensions of [length], were more normally distributed than the raw data points and had more stable variances over a wider concentration range. We accordingly determined relative potencies using parallel line analyses on the transformed data. The latter offered a consistent correlation to the volume measurements when these were also converted to dimensions of [length] (r = 0. 805). It was confirmed that the inhibition of bone resorption by calcitonins from various species, namely, pig, salmon and eel, was quantitatively dependent upon concentration of the respective peptides. The resulting assay was also found to be sufficiently sensitive to measure picomolar peptide concentrations with a precision, lambda (standard deviation/slope), ranging between 0. 3 and 0. 8. Finally, we identified factors affecting assay precision and sensitivity...|$|E
