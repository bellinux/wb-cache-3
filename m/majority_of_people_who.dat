5|$|In the Royal Audiencia, the {{education}} situation worsened after of {{the expulsion of}} the Jesuit priests; too few learned people lived in Quito {{to be able to}} fill the void. The majority of the population neither read nor wrote well. On the other hand, the few who could enter the university were given an education which was heavily theoretical and used memorization as the primary learning technique. Scholasticism, which was in decline in these times, was still taught; and the students spent their time in metaphysical discussions. As a result, the intellectual people in Quito—most of whom were clerical—had affected manners when expressing themselves, while having no new ideas. Furthermore, in 1793 only two medical doctors were available in Quito, of which one was Espejo; the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> fell ill were helped by curanderos. In Quito at the time, ethnic prejudice was common, and therefore most people considered society to be divided into estates of the realm, which differed by racial origin. Because of this, a person's dignity and honor could be damaged by racial prejudices.|$|E
25|$|In Classical Greek Mythology, {{the section}} of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much {{resembling}} Limbo, to which the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were held to have deserved neither the Elysian Fields (Heaven) nor Tartarus (Hell) were consigned for eternity.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine. It is used most commonly for pain relief, though it is also used to treat a wide range of conditions. The <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> seek out acupuncture do so for musculoskeletal problems, including low back pain, shoulder stiffness, and knee pain. Acupuncture is generally only used in combination with other forms of treatment. For example, American Society of Anesthesiologists states it may be considered in the treatment for nonspecific, noninflammatory low back pain only in conjunction with conventional therapy.|$|E

25|$|The stages model, {{which came}} {{about in the}} 1960s, is a theory based on {{observation}} {{of people who are}} dying, not people who experienced the death of a loved one. This model found empirical support in a study by Maciejewski et al. The research of George Bonanno, however, is acknowledged as inadvertently debunking the five stages of grief because his large body of peer-reviewed studies show that the vast <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have experienced a loss do not grieve, but are resilient. The logic is that if there is no grief, there are no stages to pass through.|$|E
25|$|Auditory hallucinations, {{particularly}} {{experiences of}} hearing voices, {{are the most}} common and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities. Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not always be a negative one. One research study has shown that the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help. The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental disorder or not.|$|E
25|$|This {{period was}} fueled by {{skateboard}} companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, {{made it possible for}} skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.|$|E

25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with gamma-aminobutyric acid. This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the motor cortexes of SPS patients.|$|E
500|$|Fenwick also asks rhetorically, [...] "Should we {{completely}} {{discount the}} testimonials of est graduates, {{knowing that they}} are not sufficiently rigorous measures to qualify as scientific evidence? [...] I don’t think so. The fact that positive testimonials are so readily obtained from est graduates, in combination with the observation that a <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> take the est training, continue to participate and have found the est experience to be rewarding. [...] Even if 'objective' changes are not documented in people's lives, it is noteworthy that people feel happier, more satisfied, more relaxed, and more 'alive.' If you 'feel' happier, then you 'are' happier – objective circumstances notwithstanding. Subjective states are clearly an important component of our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The Historia Augusta is {{considered}} by historians as the least trustworthy for all accounts of events, historiography, and biographies among the ancient works and is full of fabricated materials and sources. The works of Herodian of Antioch are, by comparison, [...] "far less fantastic" [...] than the stories presented by the Historia Augusta. Historian Andrew G. Scott suggests that Dio's work is frequently considered the best source for this period. However, Doctor and Professor Clare Rowan questions Dio's accuracy {{on the topic of}} Caracalla, referring to the work as having presented a hostile attitude towards Caracalla and thus needing to be treated with caution. An example of this hostility is found in one section where Dio notes that Caracalla is descended from three different races and that he managed to combine all of their faults into one person: the fickleness, cowardice, and recklessness of the Gallic, the cruelty and harshness of the Africans, and the craftiness that is associated with the Syrians. Despite this, the outline of events as presented by Dio are described by Rowan as generally accurate, while the motivations that Dio suggests are of questionable origin. An example of this is his presentation of the Edict of Caracalla; the motive that Dio appends to this event is Caracalla's desire to increase tax revenue. Doctors Olivier Hekster, Nicholas Zair, and Rowan challenge this presentation because the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> were enfranchised by the edict would have been poor. In her work, Rowan also describes Herodian's depiction of Caracalla: more akin to a soldier than an emperor.|$|E

50|$|Each province, {{and their}} {{component}} cities, {{has their own}} separate plebiscite.

500|$|Journalists have {{described}} [...] "Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish" [...] as a satire on American politics. Joanne Ostrow, a reviewer for The Denver Post, said only a cartoon {{could get away}} with [...] "such pointed satire" [...] of American political campaigning and advertising that is featured in the episode. She compared it to the [...] "counter-cultural posture" [...] television shows such as Second City Television and Saturday Night Live took in the mid-1970s: [...] "In those days, this sort of alternative viewpoint was kept out of prime time. , it's still relegated to the (distant) fourth network, but at least the time is prime." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk wrote: [...] "The writers of The Simpsons have often come across as unabashedly liberal and this episode is no exception as political/social commentary takes a step closer to the foreground during this episode." [...] Al Jean, current show runner of The Simpsons, has himself admitted in an interview that the show is of a [...] "liberal bent". In the DVD commentaries, creator Matt Groening and the <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> work on the show state several times that they are very liberal, but some, such as John Swartzwelder (one of the writers of this and many other The Simpsons episodes), are libertarian. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In The Simpsons, politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.|$|E

In his book The Really Inconvenient Truths: Seven Environmental Catastrophes Liberals Don't Want You to Know About- Because They Helped Cause Them, Iain Murray described [...] "The Frying Game" [...] as [...] "subversively conservative", and wrote that it shows [...] "The best popular explanation of the liberal environmentalist model for endangered species." [...] In the episode, Homer buys a koi pond for Marge, only to find a screamapillar has taken residence in their garden. When Homer tries to squash it, an EPA official tells him that allowing an endangered species to die is a federal offense, under the [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act of 1994." [...] Homer is forced to coddle the screamapillar, and when he accidentally squashes it, Homer is found guilty of [...] "attempted insecticide and aggravated buggery." [...] The [...] "Reversal of Freedoms Act" [...] is a reference to the Endangered Species Act, an environmental law that Murray opined had [...] "indeed become the Reversal of Freedoms Act." [...] He continued, [...] "Landowners who happened to have threatened or endangered species on their lands or who simply have habitat that might be used by endangered species are routinely prevented from using their lands or property. They are stopped from undertaking such activities as harvesting their trees, grazing their cattle, irrigating their fields, clearing brush along fence lines, disking firebreaks around their homes and barns, or building new homes.|$|E

2500|$|Even {{though they}} are not {{necessarily}} synonyms, {{the concept of a}} single culturally Basque area spanning various regions and countries has been closely associated with the politics of Basque nationalism.

While the early Washington, D.C. hardcore punk scene is often praised for its commitment to positive social change, both the youth crew movement of the 1980s and the vegan movement of the 1990s have drawn criticism. Straight edge has often been approached with skepticism and hostility, despite the ideologically less dogmatic and more multifaceted character of contemporary straight edge.|$|E
