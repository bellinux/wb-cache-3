40|$|Perpetual {{pavements}} {{represent a}} significant investment to an owner who {{has committed to}} spending additional dollars at initial construction in order to benefit from potential long-term savings from the enhanced performance of this asset. This makes the monitoring of a perpetual pavement critical {{to ensure that this}} asset is optimally preserved and maintained {{in order to meet the}} expectations of service for the design life and potentially beyond. This Thesis research involved investigation of methods of completing the long-term monitoring of a perpetual asphalt pavement including the development of a testing protocol using a falling weight deflectometer (FWD) as well as a framework for the monitoring of long term perpetual pavement performance. The project site used for the research consisted of one perpetual pavement section (with rich bottom mix (RBM)) which was constructed and instrumented at the Capitol <b>Paving</b> <b>Plant</b> in Guelph, Ontario. It was constructed by a consortium that included the Ontario Ministry of Transportation (MTO), Ontario Hot Mix Producers Association (OHMPA), the University of Waterloo Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT), the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), Stantec Inc., and McAsphalt Industries Limited. An initial testing program was required to accurately locate the embedded sensors within the test section. This testing program was completed with an array of FWD testing completed within the test section followed by analysis of the response of the embedded sensors to the testing in order to determine their location. This initial testing was successful in determining the embedded sensor locations and the locations were marked in the field for use in future testing programs. The next step consisted of validation of the performance of the embedded sensors. This involved predicting the expected strains using mechanistic design software (Kenpave) followed by a comparison with the strains recorded with the embedded sensors on the site. A significant discrepancy was found between these results and supplemental testing was completed to attempt to isolate and mitigate the source of the variability. The in-situ resilient modulus values were backcalculated using and the FWD results which were adjusted in order to obtain design deflections similar to the deflections measured using the FWD. The resilient modulus of the asphalt concrete layer was adjusted for temperature and the expected strains recalculated using the mechanistic design software. While the results showed signs of converging, the known sources of variability had been evaluated and the remaining difference between the predicted and calculated strain values were considered to be due to a change in the calibration factor of the gauges. New calibration factors were calculated for the gauges and the new calibration factors applied to the sensors and checked using the FWD in order to validate the new calibration factors. The additional testing showed that the embedded sensors were now within the tolerance expected for the types of monitoring equipment used at the site and the new calibration factors were considered to be suitable. Finally, a framework was developed to provide guidance for the long-term monitoring of perpetual pavements using the knowledge and experience gained during the research...|$|R

To improve resistance to rice blast, the most serious fungal disease of rice, we aimed to create a defense system that combines high affinity of CEBiP for CE and the ability of XA 21 to confer disease resistance. Cultured rice cells expressing the chimeric receptor CRXA, which consists of CEBiP and the intracellular region of XA 21, induced cell death accompanied by an increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species after exposure to CE.

Bukit Bintang Street and Tun Perak Street which are located in the inner part of Kuala Lumpur City Center were selected as the case studies. To achieve the research objectives, a sequential mixed method was adopted. Firstly, the 15 influential physical attributes on design and livability of streetscape were identified. Secondly, the current conditions of physical attributes of two case study streets examined qualitatively through observation and photography to explore physical problems of the studied areas. Then, questionnaire surveys conducted to examine the importance of identified problems and the role of different organizations on decreasing the problems.

While it is well established that bumblebees exploit urban green spaces, this is the first study to explore the land use and floral preferences of the UK’s seven most common bumblebees in gardens and allotments cultivated for food. A citizen science survey was carried out at 38 sites, between 1 st June and 30 th September 2013. At the landscape scale, bumblebee abundance and species richness was not significantly correlated with surrounding land use characteristics (both p > 0. 05). Bombus pratorum was the only species to show correlations with surrounding land use, demonstrating a positive relationship with built areas and gardens and allotments, and a negative correlation with greenspace and agriculture.

[...] Plants common to the area were selected based on their regional presence. The gradual elevation change (approximately 15 ft) within the garden is meant to symbolize the ascent from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem while also accommodating the practical requirement of the connecting various elevations of the parking garages with adjacent roads. Aronson symbolizes the Mediterranean coastline through the formal arrangement of materials like stone (a local limestone) and stainless steel. Gravel is used to represent the beaches of the western border of Israel, and a grid of palm trees recalls the seaside promenades that are growing in popularity within Israel. The grid arrangement also references the agricultural plantings of palm trees in the region. With the shift in elevation through the site comes a change from <b>paved</b> surface to <b>planted</b> areas of wheat fields, grasses, and orange groves. Small channels of water run through the garden, using a traditional technique for areas prone to rapid evaporation and indicating the need for human intervention in hydrating the arid landscape. The uppermost terrace contains a grove of olive trees, a tree common to the Judean Mountains around Jerusalem and the highest elevations within the country.

The study was conducted over one year in three different areas (urban, rural and pasture). We made monthly observations of the foraging strategies used by the species and the habitats they selected. Possible variations in availability of resources over the twelve months of the study did not influence the type of foraging used by the three species. Significant differences between the foraging strategies used by the species were observed in relation to the foraging site, specifically the foraging substrate. Soil, grass and paving were the foraging substrates that were most used by all three species, indicating that they are ground-foraging birds. Differences in the time spent in the foraging areas were significant between species; Z. auriculata remained in the foraging area for the longest time, often foraging in a group, suggesting a possible adaptation of this species in order to obtain a greater amount of resources. Adapting to anthropological environments without continuous forest cover could be one of factors that the most influential in the selection of habitat by the three species of Columbidae. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed differences between the proportions of herbaceous and gramineae <b>plants,</b> <b>paving,</b> plantations and shrubs in the habitats selected by each species.
