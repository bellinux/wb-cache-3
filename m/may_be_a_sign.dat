5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid {{has no effect on}} the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E

25|$|To win dive meets, divers {{create a}} dive list {{in advance of}} the meet. To win the meet the diver must {{accumulate}} more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of their extreme skill, or it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.|$|E
25|$|Pica in dogs <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of Immune-mediated {{hemolytic}} anemia, {{especially when}} it involves eating substances such as tile grout, concrete dust, and sand.

25|$|Many misconceptions exist {{about what}} {{can help prevent}} hair loss, one of these being that lack of sexual {{activity}} will automatically prevent hair loss. While a proven direct correlation exists between increased frequency of ejaculation and increased levels of DHT, as shown {{in a recent study}} by Harvard Medical School, the study suggests that ejaculation frequency <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign,</b> rather than a cause, of higher DHT levels. Another study shows that although sexual arousal and masturbation-induced orgasm increase testosterone concentration around orgasm, they reduce testosterone concentration on average (especially before abstinence) and because about 5% of testosterone is converted to DHT, ejaculation does not elevate DHT levels.|$|E
25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E
25|$|Hemolytic anemia* {{is a type}} of {{regenerative}} anemia {{found in}} dogs characterized by destruction of the red blood cell. The most important type is immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, which can be a primary disease or secondary to cancer, infection, drugs, or vaccinations. Antibodies are present on the cell surface, leading to lysis and severe anemia. Other causes of hemolytic lesion include hypophosphatemia, exposure to toxins such as lead, infections such as ehrlichiosis or babesiosis, and rarely, neonatal isoerythrolysis. The behavioral condition pica, especially when involving the eating of concrete dust, tile grout, or sand, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of hemolytic anemia, indicating the need for a complete blood count to investigate a possible diagnosis.|$|E

[...] The body of the Pharaoh, who was argued to be either Ramesses II or his son Merneptah, had been thought to be lost at sea until the mummies of both were {{discovered}} in the 19th century, and put on display in Cairo's Egyptian Museum; {{it is argued that}} the prophecy that the Pharaoh's body would be preserved has been fulfilled.|$|R
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil has too much potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

50|$|NGU is {{more common}} in men than women. Men may have a {{discharge}} (strange liquid) from the penis, pain when urinating, and itching, irritation or tenderness around the opening of the penis. Women might not have any symptoms and may not know they have NGU until severe problems occur. Women might have discharge from the vagina, burning or pain when urinating, pain in the abdominal (stomach) area, or bleeding from the vagina that <b>is</b> not from <b>a</b> monthly period. (This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>sign</b> that NGU has become worse and turned into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or PID).|$|R
25|$|Elevated {{levels of}} serum B12 (cobalamin above about 600pmol/L) {{in the absence}} of dietary supplementation or {{injections}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic <b>sign</b> of serious disease.

500|$|Italian {{paleontologist}} Andrea Cau has {{speculated that}} the aberrant features present in Balaur {{may have been a}} result of this theropod being omnivorous or herbivorous rather than carnivorous like most non-avian theropods. The lack of the third finger <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of reduced predatory behavior, and the robust first toe could be interpreted as a weight-supporting adaptation rather than a weapon. These characteristics are consistent with the relatively short, stocky limbs and wide, swept-back pubis, which may indicate enlarged intestines for digesting vegetation as well as reduced speed. Cau referred to this as the [...] "Dodoraptor" [...] model. However, in light of the research done by Fowler et al., Cau has remarked that the anatomy of Balaur may be more congruent with the hypothesis that Balaur was predatory after all.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} that Offa constructed a series of defensive burhs, or fortified towns; the locations are not generally agreed on but may include Bedford, Hereford, Northampton, Oxford and Stamford. In addition to their defensive uses, these burhs {{are thought to have}} been administrative centres, serving as regional markets and indicating a transformation of the Mercian economy away from its origins as a grouping of midland peoples. The burhs are forerunners of the defensive network successfully implemented by Alfred the Great a century later to deal with the Danish invasions. However, Offa did not necessarily understand the economic changes that came with the burhs, so it is not safe to assume he envisioned all their benefits. In 749, Æthelbald of Mercia had issued a charter that freed ecclesiastical lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges– obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the trinoda necessitas. Offa's Kentish charters show him laying these same burdens on the recipients of his grants there, and this <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the obligations were being spread outside Mercia. These burdens were part of Offa's response to the threat of [...] "the pagan seaman".|$|E
