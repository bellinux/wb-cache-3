5|$|A {{juvenile}} {{often has}} a dark, brownish-grey nape that <b>may</b> <b>look</b> {{darker than the}} pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young {{may not be as}} fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup {{of blood in the}} pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae <b>may</b> <b>look</b> similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals <b>may</b> <b>look</b> similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E

60|$|Dr. <b>May</b> <b>looked</b> piteously, despairingly, at Leonard; but {{the brow}} was still open and unclouded, the eye glanced back {{reassurance}} and confidence.|$|R
60|$|Mr. <b>May</b> <b>looked</b> {{down in the}} mouth. He {{cocked his}} blue eyes at her, miserable and frightened. Failure began to frighten him abjectly.|$|R
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork <b>may</b> <b>look</b> for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they <b>may</b> <b>look</b> at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun <b>may</b> <b>look</b> like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E

5|$|Good field {{characteristics}} for Suillus luteus {{include the}} slimy brown cap, glandular dots {{on the upper}} stipe, and prominent purplish ring. A frequent lookalike is Suillus granulatus, which is another common, widely distributed and edible species occurring in the same habitat. Suillus granulatus is yellow fleshed and exudes latex droplets when young, but most conspicuously bears neither a partial veil nor a ring. Other than that, Suillus luteus {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other mushrooms, especially if its preferred habitat under pine trees and the whitish partial veil are considered. In Europe, the related Suillus grevillei is found under larch and has a yellow cap, while immature fruit bodies of Gomphidius glutinosus <b>may</b> <b>look</b> comparable from above but have gills rather than pores underneath. In North America, Suillus borealis and S.pseudobrevipes also have partials veils, but lack the distinctive ring of S.luteus. S.cothurnatus forms a band-like ring on the stipe that tends to be brownish rather than purplish.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which <b>may</b> <b>look</b> like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of an ala is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore. A given ala <b>may</b> <b>look</b> {{like a black}} wind, a gigantic creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An ala may also assume various human or animal shapes, and can even possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described {{is due to the}} ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike ala, her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live in the clouds, or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or gigantic tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E

25|$|There may be dust {{along the}} line of sight from the GRB to Earth, both in the host galaxy and in the Milky Way. If so, the light will be {{attenuated}} and reddened and an afterglow spectrum <b>may</b> <b>look</b> very different from that modeled.|$|E
60|$|Mr. <b>May</b> <b>looked</b> {{even more}} distant, drawing {{himself up in}} an odd fashion, so that {{he looked as if}} he were trussed. But Madame's shrewd black eyes and busy mind did not let him off.|$|R
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Dr. <b>May,</b> <b>looking</b> at Dr. Spencer, {{as if to}} say, I {{told you}} so, in the first triumph of {{professional}} sagacity; but the next moment exclaiming, [...] "Poor little Meta!" [...] he hurried away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! if we {{only knew}} some one in New York {{who would take}} it to them," [...] said <b>May,</b> <b>looking</b> piteously at the horizon, {{as if she were}} apostrophising some one {{on the other side of}} the Atlantic.|$|R
25|$|Some {{of these}} steps <b>may</b> <b>look</b> {{different}} in {{various types of}} cells, which, in part, contributes to the defined and quite limited native tropism of AAV. Replication of the virus can also vary in one cell type, depending on the cell's current cell cycle phase.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 2006, the ABC {{announced}} {{the program was}} cancelled and the final episode of the series would go to air on 29 November 2006 as a one-hour special. Anderson mentioned on the show that they <b>may</b> <b>look</b> at Network Ten as a possible home for the show in the future.|$|E
25|$|Secured {{creditors}} whose {{security interests}} survive {{the commencement of}} the case <b>may</b> <b>look</b> to the property {{that is the subject}} of their security interests, after obtaining permission from the court (in the form of relief from the automatic stay). Security interests, created by what are called secured transactions, are liens on the property of a debtor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I {{stay here}} all alone? I shall be cold and afraid {{so far from}} my own little bed and my dear mother," [...] said <b>May,</b> <b>looking</b> anxiously about her, for the sky was growing dim and night coming on.|$|R
50|$|The {{first episode}} {{documents}} {{his search for}} the ultimate form of personal transport, ranging from jetpacks to flying cars. In the second episode, <b>May</b> <b>looks</b> at bionics and robotics and if robots can exceed the boundaries of their programming. The third episode focuses on energy.|$|R
6000|$|<b>May</b> <b>looked</b> up in {{his face}} as she asked the question. There was {{something}} in the look and in the tone which caused George Aspel's heart to beat like a sledge-hammer. He stooped down, and, looking into her eyes,--still in a brotherly way, said-- ...|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} such {{compression}} <b>may</b> <b>look</b> similar to trying to transform the trie into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), because the reverse transform from a DAG to a trie is obvious and always possible. However, {{the shape of the}} DAG is determined by the form of the key chosen to index the nodes, in turn constraining the compression possible.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{that become}} {{infected}} experience hemorrhaging of their internal organs, skin, and muscle. Some fish show no external symptoms, but others {{show signs of}} infection that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, bruised-looking reddish tints to the eyes, skin, gills and fins. Some infected fish have open sores that <b>may</b> <b>look</b> like the lesions from other diseases or from lamprey attacks.|$|E
25|$|Dizygotic twins, {{like any}} other siblings, have an {{extremely}} small chance of having the same chromosome profile. Even if they happen {{to have the same}} chromosome profile, they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome, due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins <b>may</b> <b>look</b> similar, particularly given that they are the same age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} know how to do that, my boy," [...] said Dr. <b>May,</b> <b>looking</b> tenderly at the fairy figure between them, and ending with a sigh, remembering, perhaps, the sense of {{protection}} with which he had felt another Margaret lean on his arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{this is very}} queer, but not so dreadful as the wasp. I hope no {{one will}} see it when I'm asleep. I do wish I'd let those cakes and things alone," [...] sighed <b>May,</b> <b>looking</b> at the black bag, and vainly {{trying to get her}} hands free.|$|R
