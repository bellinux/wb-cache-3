40|$|The {{arginine}} deiminase pathway (ADI) {{gene cluster}} in Lactococcus lactis contains {{two copies of}} a gene encoding an L-arginine/L-ornithine exchanger, the arcD 1 and arcD 2 genes. The physiological function of ArcD 1 and ArcD 2 was studied by deleting the two genes. Deletion of arcD 1 resulted in loss of the growth advantage observed {{in the presence of}} high L-arginine in different growth media. Uptake of L-arginine and L-ornithine by resting cells was reduced down to the low level observed for a ArcD 1 /ArcD 2 double deletion mutant. Deletion of the arcD 2 gene did not affect the growth enhancement and uptake activities were slightly reduced. Nevertheless, recombinant expression of ArcD 2 in the ArcD 1 /ArcD 2 double mutant did recover the growth advantage. Kinetic characterization of ArcD 1 and ArcD 2 showed high affinities for both L-arginine and L-ornithine (Km in the μM range). A difference between the two transporters was the significantly lower affinity of ArcD 2 for the cationic amino acids L-ornithine, L-lysine and L-histidine. In contrast, the affinity of ArcD 2 was higher for the neutral amino acid L-alanine. Moreover, ArcD 2 efficiently translocated L-alanine while ArcD 1 did not. Both transporters revealed affinities in the mM range for agmatine, cadaverine, histamine and putrescine. These amines only bind but are not translocated. It is concluded that ArcD 1 is the <b>main</b> L-arginine/L-ornithine <b>exchanger</b> in the ADI pathway and that ArcD 2 is not functionally expressed in the media used.

It consists of a resonator tube and a loop which contains a regenerator, three heat exchangers, and a bypass loop. A regenerator is a porous medium with a high heat capacity.

In contrast to the stack, the pores in the regenerator are much smaller than the thermal penetration depth, so the thermal contact between gas and material is very good.

It was concluded {{that there is an}} optimum pressure where the system reaches the highest coefficient of performance. Variation of coefficient of performance of the combined system with discharge pressures {{is similar to that of}} the airconditioning system without heat recovery. Load ratio affects the performance of the air-conditioning side. Coefficient of performance of the air-conditioning side (cooling-COP) increased with increasing load ratio. Optimum discharge pressure was affected by load ratio. Improvement of cooling-COP depends on both cooling medium and inlet water temperatures. The cooling-COP was lower at higher cooling medium temperature and higher inlet water temperature. When inlet water temperature is higher than cooling medium temperature, the cooling-COP will be lower compared to the airconditioning system without heat recovery. The system performance decreased as hot water temperature increased. The decrease is due to a need for higher discharge temperature to achieve maximum cooling-COP. Internal heat exchanger plays an important role in achieving higher system performance. Coefficient of performance is higher for the combined system with internal heat exchanger. The length of internal heat exchanger affects the cooling-COP and the location of the optimum discharge pressure.

40|$|One-quarter of the {{worldwide}} greenhouse gas emissions is emitted by fossil fuel based power plants. In order to limit future climate changes caused by these emissions, several types of CO 2 -capturing power plants are currently being developed. An integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. It is the mission of a European collaboration project called DECARBit to enable the commercial use of this type of power plant. One of themain process units of an IGCC is the air separation unit (ASU). It provides both oxygen and nitrogen to the gasifier, and nitrogen to the gas turbine. The main objective of this thesis is to improve the Second law efficiency of a cryogenic ASU, with a focus on the use of novel distillation concepts. Improving the Second law efficiency of a process is equivalent to improving its exergy efficiency. In this thesis, the exergy efficiency is defined as the desired change in exergy contents of the ASU products divided by the net amount of added work. Using exergy analysis, it is shown that the exergy efficiency of a state-of-the-art two-column ASU with a pumped liquid cycle is approximately 35 %. Most of the exergy destruction is located in the compressor after-coolers, the distillation section, and the <b>main</b> heat <b>exchanger.</b> The irreversibilities in the compressor after-coolers are caused by the use of cooling water. They can almost completely be eliminated by transferring the heat of compression to the ASU products instead of to the cooling water. The achieved reduction in exergy destruction corresponds to almost 1 % of the net electric efficiency of the IGCC and it increases the exergy efficiency of the ASU to approximately 70 %. Two alternatives are presented that can improve the distillation section efficiency. The first one is the addition of a third distillation column; it can reduce the exergy destruction in the distillation section by approximately 30 %. The second option is to improve the heat integration of the two distillation columns, by using heat-integrated distillation stages (HI stages). These HI stages are the basis of a relatively novel distillation column configuration called a heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC). In an ASU, the use of HI stages enables a lower operating pressure in the high-pressure column, which reduces the required work input to ASU. Depending on the amount of heat-transfer capacity per HI stage, the exergy destruction in the distillation section can be reduced by 20 to 30 % due to the use of HI stages. HI stages and HIDiCs are not yet in industrial use. So far, only two complete HIDiCs have been built, both using concentrically-integrated columns equipped with structured packing. They have proven the feasibility of the HIDiC concept, but detailed knowledge on the performance of the columns is still very scarce. As a result, simulations of packed concentric HIDiCs still involve several uncertainties. They are related to the achievable overall heat-transfer coefficient, to the performance of a ring-shaped distillation column, and to the effects that a radial heat flux has on the column performance. In order to obtain more insight into these phenomena, two research directions have been pursued: a theoretical one and an experimental one. The theoretical work concerns the further development of a model for the simultaneous transfer of mass and thermal energy, based on the theory of irreversible thermodynamics. The model describes the vapour–liquid interface region of a mixture as a series of connected control volumes that together represent a vapour film, the interface, and a liquid film. This interface region is located in between the bulk vapour and bulk liquid phases; the conditions at its boundaries are equal to the adjacent bulk phase conditions. A routine has been developed that calculates the thermal and molar fluxes through the interface region, based on input values for the boundary conditions, or driving forces. The film thicknesses ratio is found by requiring consistency between the entropy productions calculated using the entropy balance and using the product-sum of conjugate fluxes and driving forces. By applying this model to a nitrogen–oxygen mixture, it has been shown that the direct coupling between heat and diffusion fluxes has a considerable influence on the calculated values of the fluxes. The measurable heat flux is most sensitive to the coupling effect, which makes a correct description of the effect especially important when simulating a HIDiC. Another important model parameter is the number of control volumes that is used to represent the films. The effect of the interface resistances on the calculation results was relatively small. The experimental work concerns the development of a new experimental HIDiC. The designed set-up consists of a cylindrical inner column with a diameter of 14 cm that is surrounded by a ring-shaped outer column with a diameter of 22 cm. A difference in operating pressures causes thermal energy to be transferred from the high-pressure inner column to the low-pressure outer column. Both columns will be equipped with 1. 6 m of structured packing and will operate at total reflux conditions. The set-up is designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures, elevated pressures, and high oxygen concentrations. At the top of the set-up, two copper-brazed plate heat exchangers will be used as condensers, using evaporating nitrogen as coolant. Electrical heaters with a maximum duty of 25 kW will be used as reboilers. Radial and angular temperature and composition gradients inside the columns will be measured directly at several height levels, in both the vapour and liquid phases. These measurements can also be used to determine the separation efficiency of the columns. The total amount of thermal energy transfer will be obtained based on two independent measurements of the condenser and reboiler duties of both columns. The set-up can also be used to assess the coupling between thermal and molar fluxes. PhD i kjemiPhD in Chemistr...|$|R
40|$|Removal of CO 2 from {{exhaust gas}} (CO 2 capture) {{has become a}} very {{important}} topic the last years. There is international agreement to limit the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} to reduce the global warming problem, and CO 2 is regarded {{to be the most important}} greenhouse gas. One of the possible ways to reduce CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere is to perform large scale CO 2 capture and storage. There are several suggested methods for removal or capture of CO 2. The most mature method is to absorb CO 2 in an aqueous amine solution followed by desorption. Many calculation models for CO 2 removal by absorption have been developed. These models differ in accuracy, efficiency and robustness. In the case of absorption column calculations combined with flowsheet calculations, there will often be a question whether a detailed and complex model is better than a simple and robust model. In this work, calculation methods for CO 2 removal from atmospheric exhaust have been developed. To improve and validate these methods, some experimental work has also been included. Emphasis has been on calculation methods for an absorption and desorption process using MEA (monoethanolamine). One aim of the work has been to calculate cost optimum parameters in the process. Most of the calculations have been performed in combination with the process simulation tool Aspen HYSYS. Measured viscosities and densities in CO 2 loaded solutions of MEA and water up to 80 ºC have been correlated. The new viscosity data of CO 2 loaded MEA solutions at higher temperatures have reduced the uncertainty in the viscosity at typical absorption conditions. Pressure drop, liquid distribution and effective mass transfer area have been measured in a 0. 5 m diameter column in collaboration with NTNU/SINTEF. The experiments validate the performance of structured packing in columns at typical process conditions. Murphree efficiencies have been estimated for typical CO 2 absorption conditions in MEA solutions. According to calculations of absorption rates based on concentration profiles in the liquid film and approximation calculations, the deviation from pseudo first order conditions is less than 10 % for typical operation conditions below 50 ºC. Murphree efficiencies as a function of temperature for typical conditions at column top and column bottom have been calculated. These efficiencies are convenient to implement in stage to stage column calculation models. On the assumptions that pseudo first order conditions are met and the temperature at a stage is approximately constant, the accuracy in calculating overall CO 2 removal efficiency using Murphree efficiencies is the same as for more rigorous calculations. A CO 2 removal process from exhaust gas from a natural gas based power plant has been calculated in Aspen HYSYS. Total CO 2 removal grade and heat consumption have been calculated as a function of circulation rate, absorber temperature and other parameters. Simulations of the absorber have also been performed with Aspen Plus using both constant Murphree efficiencies and rate-based simulation and all the simulations give similar trends as a function of the varying parameters. Aspen HYSYS calculations using varying Murphree efficiencies give similar temperature profiles compared to Aspen Plus rate-based calculations. The process simulation calculations have also included split-stream configurations. A splitstream process using MEA with a heat consumption of only 3. 0 GJ/ton CO 2 removed has been calculated in Aspen HYSYS compared to approximately 4. 0 GJ/ton CO 2 for a standard process. However, cost estimation calculations show that it is uncertain whether a splitstream process is more economical than a standard process. Equipment dimensioning and cost estimation have also been included in the calculations. From a series of calculations, a cost optimum can be calculated. Optimum gas inlet temperature to the absorber has been calculated to values between 33 and 35 ºC which is lower than traditionally assumed values. Optimum minimum temperature difference in the <b>main</b> amine/amine heat <b>exchanger</b> has been calculated to values between 12 and 19 ºC which is higher than traditionally assumed. This optimum is very dependent on the ratio between investment and energy cost. Optimum rich loading has been calculated to 0. 47 mol CO 2 /mol MEA which is similar to earlier optimization calculations. Automatic calculation of these optimums is possible when using e. g. Aspen HYSYS with specified Murphree efficiencies...|$|R
