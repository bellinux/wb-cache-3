500|$|Elizabeth Murrell died in Hadleigh on 16 April 1839, aged forty-nine. The {{cause of}} death was cited as [...] "inflammation of the chest", and her body was buried on 21 April in Hadleigh's St. James the Less Church. In the 1841 {{national}} census, Murrell was documented as a shoemaker living in Hadleigh with four of his children (Eliza, Matilda, Edward, and Eleanor). However, in the June 1844 wedding documentation of Eliza, Murrell was listed as a labourer, and on the October 1844 <b>marriage</b> <b>documentation</b> of Matilda, he was listed as a herb doctor. By the 1851 national census, he again specified his profession as that of a shoemaker, and recorded that he was living in Hadleigh with his children Edward, Eleanor, and Louisa, as well as with his grandson William Spendle.|$|E
50|$|Politically, the low-country {{governments of}} Virginia and the Carolinas {{did little to}} assist and much to exploit this cohee migration. During the {{earliest}} decades, the established Anglican Church refused to recognize Presbyterian weddings and required exorbitant marriage bond fees of the up-country settlers {{in order to obtain}} a legally recognized marriage certificate. Failure to obtain legal <b>marriage</b> <b>documentation</b> could have severe consequences when trying to sell land, and during the handling of estates. Similarly, upcountry political representation in colony governments was inhibited, while wealthy low-country aristocrats held dominance in political, military and taxation matters. The stage was set for a major cultural divide, and tuckahoe-cohee antagonism grew from this early social dynamic.|$|E

Based on a conjectural methodology newspapers ads of the nineteenth century were consulted and also codices relating to records of baptism, <b>marriage,</b> and <b>documentation</b> of the Government Secretary, located in the Public Archives of the State of Maranhão and Public Library Benedito Leite...|$|R
5000|$|Not much {{is known}} about Nemessányi's early life. His middle name of [...] "Félix" [...] {{is thought to be}} wrong, as it does not appear in any known <b>documentation</b> (<b>marriage</b> or birth certificate). It was assumed that he was born in Preschau, but it is now known that Nemessányi was indeed born in Liptau-St. Nikolaus (formerly Verbicz-Hušták) to the son of an impoverished shoemaker. His father had urged young Samuel to take up glass blowing, but found that his {{interest}} lay in working with wood. At the age of 18, he moved to Pest to learn carpentry and cabinet making.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} contains {{a copy of}} a privately printed genealogical chronicle of the Windmüller (later Windmueller) family and of the Jewish community of Beckum, as well as original materials regarding the Windmueller's resettlement from Germany to the United States, including appraisal and sale documents for their factory in Beckum. The first folder of documents contains several financial, official, and legal documents and correspondence regarding emigration, insurance, and a dispute over an appraisal of the family's factory property. Documents regarding the sale of their property are also in this folder, as well as some receipts and two athletic certificates. The second folder contains a photocopy of an undated letter from George Washington to various American Jewish communities. The second series contains the volume 'Chronik der Familie Windmüller, Geschichte der Gemeinde Beckum' compiled and printed during the 1930 s in Germany. Genealogical tables comprise the bulk of this volume, but there are also several photographs and a few brief essays. Addenda that were added to the original collection in 2013 consist of legal documents, such as contracts and documents that pertain to property or estates. Other documents include birth or <b>marriage</b> or military <b>documentation</b> and financial records. These original documents ranging back to 1765 have been preserved by Fred (formerly Fritz) Windmueller. The addenda also contain some personal correspondence and genealogical research, including family trees; newspaper clippings provide information on the community of Beckum and its synagogue, with a few that relate to family members.

40|$|Genealogies for the Mexican‐American city of Laredo, Texas, {{have been}} {{assembled}} by computer from individual civil and church records of birth, <b>marriage,</b> and death. <b>Documentation</b> {{is available on}} vital events {{in the lives of}} over 300, 000 individuals, about 80 % of the city population from 1870 – 1981. These data were collected to determine the degree to which death from cancer is more clustered in families than would be expected by chance alone; methods specific to this data base have been developed to accomplish this task. A statistically significant excess of familial cancer was observed overall when all cancer sites were pooled, but no evidence was observed for excess familial risk at single sites except for breast cancer and perhaps for ovarian cancer. The excess of breast cancer risk is comparable to that observed in other populations. A few site‐combinations manifest excess familial risk, most notably those involving and dominated by breast cancer and certain digestive system sites. We do not confirm the degree of familiality observed elsewhere for cancers of the lung, colorectum, stomach, or other sites in this generally low‐risk population. Even where we find evidence of excess risk, the degree of excess is small and the number of multiply affected families too small to test etiologic models by segregation analysis. The absence of excess familial risk {{does not appear to be}} due to inadequate numbers of cases, since breast cancer is familial with no more occurrences in Laredo than other sites. These results differ to some extent from those found in a similar study of Utah Mormons, but it is unclear whether this is because of differences in risk patterns or statistical properties of the analytic methods used in the two studies...|$|R
