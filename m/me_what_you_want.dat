25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want!</b> in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

The film also starred Gloria Swanson. In 1978, she appeared in the film The End {{as the mother of}} the main character played by Burt Reynolds. Her last motion picture performance was in 1980 in Sidney Lumet's Just Tell <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want.</b> She also returned to the stage, making her Broadway debut in a short-lived 1973 revival of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women. She toured in a 1978 production of Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, directed by David Clayton.|$|E

"Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me to buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E

6000|$|Desmond {{spread his}} hands out as the men of her own {{nationality}} did. [...] "The assurance is a relief to me, but I should feel easier if <b>you</b> told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted.</b> After all, {{it could not have}} been merely the pleasure of seeing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look out!" [...] shouted Burnamy. [...] "You {{never asked}} me {{anything}} about it. <b>You</b> told <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> done, and I did it. How could I believe you were such an ignoramus {{as not to}} know the a b c of the thing you were talking about?" [...] He added, in cynical contempt, [...] "But you needn't worry. You can make it right with the managers by spending a little more money than you expected to spend." ...|$|R
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I could be your sister, I could be your mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> / Tell me what you need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|E
