50|$|Oil {{from the}} Thistle and Deveron {{reservoirs}} is recovered by platform wells. The oil is processed through a two-stage production separation system. Stabilized oil is metered and exported using the <b>main</b> <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> pumps to the Brent Pipeline System. The original gas compression {{system has been}} decommissioned {{as a result of}} a small volume of gas separated from the oil being flared. Produced water is cleaned and discharged to the sea.|$|E
50|$|A typical oil {{production}} platform is self-sufficient in energy and water needs, housing electrical generation, water desalinators {{and all of the}} equipment necessary to process oil and gas such that it can be either delivered directly onshore by pipeline or to a floating platform or tanker loading facility, or both. Elements in the oil/gas production process include wellhead, production manifold, production separator, glycol process to dry gas, gas compressors, water injection pumps, oil/gas export metering and <b>main</b> <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> pumps.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation of oil temperature control system as means of forced diesel engine (cylinder diameter – 150 mm) cold start characteristics improvement. The effect of operating conditions and oil temperature control system design on the thermal state and the cold start characteristics of the diesel engine was determined experimentally (in “climate” chamber). It is proved, that the application of this system and coolant heater with the recommended design parameters and operating modes, ensures the diesel compliance with the requirements of normative and technical documentation, and allows increasing oil temperature in the <b>main</b> <b>oil</b> <b>line</b> (without coolant heating) by - 10 [...] . 23 °C, in the crankcase – by 5 [...] . 10 °C, the average temperature of the diesel engine – by 7 [...] . 8 °C, before the start, providing a guaranteed engine start at ambient temperatures of - 25 °C within 5 [...] . 8. 5 minutes, at - 50 °C – within 21 [...] . 28 min. The impact of the diesel engine start with coolant heater and oil temperature control system on the wear of engine parts is analyzed. It was established experimentally, that the main power and fuel consumption parameters of the engine meet the technical requirements. The condition of the engine parts friction surfaces, to which oil is supplied under pressure (crankshaft and camshaft, oil pump, etc.), is normal. This confirms the satisfactory condition of these parts lubrication in the cold start-up process...|$|E
