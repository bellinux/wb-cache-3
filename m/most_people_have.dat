5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been tolerant and oppose the militants desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal cancer unless both the primary tumor and any metastases can be fully removed by surgery. No potentially curative treatment exists except surgery, but <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> advanced stage disease at presentation and are inoperable at the time of diagnosis. People with cholangiocarcinoma are generally managed - though not cured - with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other palliative care measures. These are also used as additional therapies after surgery in cases where resection has apparently been successful (or nearly so).|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox and shingles. <b>Most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E

5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E

25|$|In Iceland, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{no family}} name; a person's last name is most {{commonly}} a patronymic, i.e. {{derived from the}} father's first name. For example, when a man called Karl has a daughter called Anna and a son called Magnús, their full names will typically be Anna Karlsdóttir ("Karl's daughter") and Magnús Karlsson ("Karl's son"). The name is not changed upon marriage.|$|E

25|$|A {{congenital}} physical anomaly is an abnormality of {{the structure}} of a body part. An anomaly {{may or may not be}} perceived as a problem condition. Many, if not <b>most,</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> one or more minor physical anomalies if examined carefully. Examples of minor anomalies can include curvature of the 5th finger (clinodactyly), a third nipple, tiny indentations of the skin near the ears (preauricular pits), shortness of the 4th metacarpal or metatarsal bones, or dimples over the lower spine (sacral dimples). Some minor anomalies may be clues to more significant internal abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is not usually}} inherited from a person's parents. No environmental risks are known, and the mother's age does not play a role. Turner {{syndrome is}} due to a chromosomal abnormality in which all or part of one of the X chromosomes is missing or altered. While <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> 46 chromosomes, people with TS usually have 45. The chromosomal abnormality may be present in just some cells in which case it is known as TS with mosaicism. In these cases, the symptoms are usually fewer and possibly none occur at all. Diagnosis is based on physical signs and genetic testing.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} include jumping {{in front of}} cars as done in Russia. The driving conditions and roads are dangerous with many people trying to scam drivers by jumping in front of expensive-looking cars or crashing into them. Hit and runs are very common and insurance companies notoriously specialize in denying claims. Two-way insurance coverage is very expensive and almost completely unavailable for vehicles over ten years old–the drivers can only obtain basic liability. Because Russian courts do not like using verbal claims, <b>most</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> dashboard cameras installed to warn would-be perpetrators or provide evidence for/against claims.|$|E
