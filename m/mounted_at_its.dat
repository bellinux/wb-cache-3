50|$|A whaler or {{whaling ship}} is a {{specialized}} ship, designed for whaling, the catching and/or processing of whales. The former includes the whale catcher - a steam or diesel-driven vessel with a harpoon gun <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> bow. The latter includes such vessels as the sail or steam-driven whaleship of the 16th to early 20th {{century and the}} floating factory or factory ship of the modern era. There have also been vessels which combined the two activities, such as the bottlenose whalers of the late 19th and early 20th century, and catcher/factory ships of the modern era.|$|E

50|$|Also a Mass-Produced unit of Kiba's army. This unit {{is based}} on the enemy mecha Doublas M2, also from Mazinger Z. It retains the dual head design and spikes on the legs. Changes made were to the lizard-like heads being more mechanic, {{sporting}} three sets of scopes and a <b>mounting</b> weapon <b>at</b> <b>its</b> mouth. It is given a more desert-style color scheme and a large Gatling gun is attached to the right hand.|$|R
50|$|Guyed masts are {{frequently}} used for radio antennas. The mast can either support aerials (for VHF and UHF) <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> top, or the entire structure itself can {{function as an}} antenna (for VLF, LF, MF); {{this is called a}} mast radiator. In the latter case, the mast needs to be insulated from the ground. Guyed radio masts are typically tall enough that they require several sets of guy lines, 2 to 4, attached at different heights on the mast, to prevent them from buckling. An exception was the Blaw-Knox tower, widely used during the 1930s, whose distinctive wide diamond (rhomboidal) shape gave it the shear strength that it only required one set of guys.|$|E
50|$|The re-embarkation began shortly afterwards. The sea {{had become}} very rough, and the boats {{were unable to}} ground. The sailors on the beach had to wade out in water up to their necks to embark. As the sailors crowded {{together}} in the choppy water, the landing force was {{at the mercy of}} a well-timed Chinese attack. Fortunately for the French, the Chinese came up slowly and did little to hinder the evacuation. During the confusion, as the French sailors struggled to clamber aboard the boats, one of the launches capsized, tipping all its occupants into the sea. The Hotchkiss canon-revolver <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> bow also fell overboard. The launch was soon righted but the French had to abandon the Hotchkiss, which was later recovered by the Chinese and displayed as a trophy of victory.|$|E
50|$|Modules are {{assembled}} into arrays on {{some kind}} of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For solar parks a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used. Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.|$|E
50|$|The Nankai Trough is {{the surface}} {{expression}} of the subduction zone between the Philippine Sea and Amur plates. Honshu itself is formed from the island arc developed over the subducting plate. The megathrust boundary extends about 700 km from {{the southern end of}} Kyūshū to the triple junction with the Okhotsk Plate near <b>Mount</b> Fuji. <b>At</b> <b>its</b> southwestern end, there is another triple junction, where the overriding plate becomes the Okinawa Plate.|$|R
50|$|The B-4's {{empennage}} was conventional, framed {{like the}} wings and fabric covered. The tailplane was <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> mid-fuselage height; <b>its</b> angle of incidence could be varied in-flight for trimming. It carried split, unbalanced elevators. There was a small fin with a curved-topped, straight-edged balanced rudder which extended down to the keel between the elevators.|$|R
50|$|In {{the winter}} the <b>Mount</b> stays <b>at</b> <b>its</b> winter home <b>at</b> the port in Center Harbor. Bubblers {{in the water}} around the Mount keep the water from {{freezing}} and protect the boat from ice damage. There is also a marine railway at Center Harbor {{that can be used}} to pull the massive ship entirely from the water. The task of pulling the Mount from the lake is a large one and only undertaken when a major maintenance job requires it.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> centre on a chordwise circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed hinge rod, providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of telescopic, sprung struts from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, pilot operated ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{this paper}} the {{transverse}} vibration of a fixedfixed end beam attached with dynamic vibration absorbers (DVA) has been analyzed experimentally. The DVA {{is composed of}} a flexible beam with two masses symmetrically <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> both sides. The fixed end beam was clamped to a static frame structure where the DVAs were then being attached onto it. One side of end of the beam is harmonically excited in transversal direction by an electric shaker. An accelerometer {{was attached to the}} beam centre to measure its vibration response amplitudes and natural frequencies. The dynamic vibration absorbers were tested in four different conditions according to its location of placement. The beam amplitudes before and after the absorbers attachment were compared and discussed. The experimental results proved that the DVA has significantly absorbed the beam vibration hence reduced the vibration amplitude of the beam structure. The knowledge and result obtained from this study can help engineers control the vibration level of beam structure.

40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of {{incorporating}} path planning with image-based control of a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM) performing visually-guided tasks in complex environments. TheWMMconsistsofawheeled(non-holonomic) mobile platform and an on-board robotic arm equipped with a camera <b>mounted</b> <b>at</b> <b>its</b> end-effector. The visually-guided task is to move the WMM from an initial to a desired location while respecting image and physical constraints. We propose a kinodynamic planning approach that explores the camera state space for permissible trajectories by iteratively extending a search tree in this space and simultaneously tracking these trajectories in the WMM configuration space. We utilize weighted pseudo-inverse Jacobian solutions combined with a null space optimization technique to effectively coordinate the motion of the mobile platform and the arm. We also present the preliminary results obtained by executing the planned trajectories on a real WMM system via a decoupled control scheme where the on-board arm is servo controlled along the planned feature trajectories while the mobile platform is simultaneously controlled along its trajectory using a state feedback tracking method.
