5|$|The Cambodian {{government}} was not informed of the incursion until it was already under way. The Cambodian leadership however welcomed the intervention against PAVN bases and the resulting weakening of PAVN <b>military</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The leadership had hoped for permanent US occupation of the PAVN sanctuaries because FANK and ARVN forces were unable to fill the vacuum in these territories following US withdrawal. It has been argued by some scholars that the incursion heated up {{the civil war and}} helped the insurgent Khmer Rouge gather recruits to their cause.|$|E

40|$|Abstract - This paper reviews {{existing}} <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> {{models and}} the capability life cycle. It proposes a holistic capability life-cycle model (HCLCM) that combines capability systems with related capability models. ISO 15288 standard {{is used as}} a framework to construct the HCLCM. The HCLCM also shows how capability models and systems relate to each other throughout the capability life cycle. The main contribution of this paper is conceptual in nature. The model complements the existing, but still evolving, understanding of the <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> life cycle in a holistic and systemic way. The model also increases understanding and facilitates communication among various <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Service {{oriented}} architecture (SOA) {{is becoming}} established in computing {{as a means}} to integrate processing and data across organisations. This paper proposes that system-level integration can benefit from service oriented architectural descriptions and loose coupling between the problem domain requirements and different system solutions. The problem domain is exemplified as <b>military</b> <b>capability,</b> from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), in particular, network enabled capability (NEC). Representations of <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> in the problem domain can be described in terms of processes. The processes are sequences of functions that can be described as services. Then different types of system solutions can implement the described services. Firstly, the paper presents an overview of conceptual SOA and in the context of <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> compares three levels of service integration: business services, systems services and computing services. Secondly, the paper presents a framework for evaluating the performance and effectiveness of service integration to compare different solutions in delivering <b>military</b> <b>capability...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK) <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> management. Specifically, the study focuses on how {{and to what}} extent the DPRK’s domestic situational and structural factors determine the capabilities of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) and mould national defence strategy. The thesis shows how the DPRK’s <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> management and its military industrial complex have been subject to intense centralization and politicization by the Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) and the National Defence Commission (NDC). These processes have led to the diversified asymmetric capabilities of the KPA. Since the mid- 1960 s, the DPRK has pursued the dangui gunsa roseon (Military Lines of the Party) as the fundamental doctrine of its <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> management. The doctrine aimed to make the state’s <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> conform to Kim Il-sung’s juche (self-reliance) ideology. Soon afterwards, the DPRK established the Second Economic Committee (SEC) to oversee the development of the KPA’s capabilities. However, as the economy went into steady decline, the KPA’s capabilities were inevitably affected. Further politicization of the military strengthened from 1999 through songun (military-led) politics, also raised questions over the policy’s effectives in the defence planning context. Moreover, with the death of Kim Jong-il and continuing economic failures, there is now greater uncertainty regarding the future of this military policy given the advent of the third generation DPRK leadership under Kim Jong-un. Given domestic circumstances, it is often assumed that the DPRK does not have sufficient capacity or flexibility to reconfigure its <b>military</b> <b>capability.</b> This dissertation examines these assumptions in greater depth by posing the following questions: What is the essential function of DPRK defence planning? What {{is the nature of the}} DPRK’s <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> development? How are the KPA’s capabilities reflected in the DPRK’s military strategy? This thesis applies methods used in defence planning such as the input-conversion-output model to the DPRK’s political-economic structure and situation to uncover the dynamics and objectives of the DPRK’s <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> management process. The thesis finds that Pyongyang faces numerous planning dilemmas, which not only have had decisive implications for the KPA’s mobilization capabilities, but also explain many aspects of the DPRK’s military behaviour to date...|$|R

5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th Belgian Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th Belgian Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its Belgian ally, the British were now unsure about Belgian <b>military</b> <b>capabilities.</b>|$|E

40|$|Balance {{of power}} (“power”) and balance of threat (“threat”) provide competing, but related, {{explanations}} of balancing. Which better explains balancing? Power in conditions of bipolarity expects {{that the two}} powers will engage in balancing that will produce a balance in which each is capable of a defending its vital interests. A change in the <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> of one sufficient to affect {{the ability of the}} other to defend its interests with good prospects for success will cause balancing by the other. Threat differs in its expectation that a great power with <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> at least sufficient for a high-confidence defense in all contested theaters will balance if it perceives that the other country has aggressive intentions, defined as a high propensity to attempt to compel it that may involve initiation of war for gain or acceptance of the risk that initiation of compellence may lead to war. Fearing its <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> is insufficient to dissuade such a country, it increases its <b>military</b> <b>capability.</b> ^ Three observable implications allow a test of power and threat as explanations of US balancing in the late- 1970 s: sufficiency of US general purpose and strategic forces, US wartime prospects, and US assessments of Soviet intentions. The increasing insufficiency of US <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> and perceptions that the US did not have good wartime prospects means that increases in US capability are readily explained by power. It also means that the condition of threat that the US had sufficient <b>military</b> <b>capability</b> in all contested theaters is not satisfied and threat 2 ̆ 7 s additional element of aggressive intentions is not required. Finally, there was not a dominant perception among US leaders that the Soviet Union was attempting to compel the US so a critical positive expectation of threat is not satisfied. I conclude that power provides the better explanation. I address Walt 2 ̆ 7 s argument that the US was more powerful than the Soviet Union and three appendices consider economic elements of power and military expenditures. ...|$|R
