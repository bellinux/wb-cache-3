Literature reports on the microbial degradation of <b>methoxychlor</b> are scarce, and in those reports the major {{emphasis is on the}} interaction of this pesticide with bacteria. Therefore, studies concerning the interaction of micro-organisms with <b>methoxychlor</b> were initiated. The micro-organisms used were the common soil fungi: Trichoderma viride, Mortierella isabellina, M,pusilla, and the aquatic fungus Saprolegnia parasitica. Also because of anomalous results reported in the literature on the possible biodegradation of <b>methoxychlor</b> by a bacterium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, this aspect of the environmental fate of <b>methoxychlor</b> was reinvestigated. Known metabolites of <b>methoxychlor</b> required for this study were synthesized. Some of the synthetic methods were slightly modified so as to improve yields or facilitate purification of the products. Also to facilitate the identification of possible degradation products, the spectroscopic properties (MS and NMR) of these various <b>methoxychlor</b> derivatives were studied. A gas chromatographic method was developed for the analyses of these compounds and included the silylation of the phenolic compounds. Little is known about the fungitoxicity of <b>methoxychlor</b> or its metabolites, thus such fungitoxicity studies were carried out. It was found that the dihydroxy <b>methoxychlor</b> derivatives were more toxic than the dimethoxy <b>methoxychlor</b> derivatives, towards the fungi used. In fungal metabolism studies with <b>methoxychlor,</b> M. isabellina, M. pusilla and S. parasitica were found to be capable of partially degrading <b>methoxychlor,</b> by effecting the ether cleavage of the methoxy groups in the molecule.

This MRL supercedes the previous MRL of 0. 02 mg/kg/day for intermediate-duration exposure derived in the 1994 profile. A chronic-duration oral MRL was not derived. A reference dose (RfD) of 0. 005 mg/kg/day was derived (in 1991) by EPA based on the NOEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits dosed during gestational days 7 - 19 (IRIS 2001; Kincaid Enterprises 1986).

40|$|Abstractâ€”p,p 9 -Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and <b>methoxychlor</b> {{were tested}} alone and in {{combination}} {{to assess the}} similarity of their actions on hormone synthesis in gonadal tissue from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus), a species whose reproductive fitness has relevance to ecosystem health in Florida (USA). Gonads were harvested from adult female bass (age, two to three years) during the peak reproductive season (Januaryâ€“May), minced, and incubated in culture medium with or without test agents for 48 h. Duplicates of each treatment were performed in each of three experiments using tissue from a different female. Both 17 b-estradiol and testosterone were measured in aliquots of culture medium by validated radioimmunoassay procedures. Doseâ€“response relationships of individual agents were characterized over a 6 -log concentration range (1 3 1022 to 1 3 104 ppb). Both DDE and <b>methoxychlor,</b> tested individually, produced a dose-dependent decrease in testosterone levels. 17 b-Estradiol levels were unaffected. Mixtures of the agents were tested at all concentration combinations of 0. 01, 1, 100, and 10, 000 ppb in culture medium. Statistical tests indicated that of 16 dose combinations tested, 15 were antagonistic, and only 1 was additive based on the Loewe additivity model of no interaction. These results imply that <b>methoxychlor</b> and DDE inhibit testosterone production by different mechanisms in bass ovaries.

Chironomids were dominant and significatnly increased after a certain level of treatment.
