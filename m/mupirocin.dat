2500|$|Mechanisms of {{resistance}} have been extensively studied only in Staphylococcus aureus. [...] The most important mechanism {{is the development}} of point mutations in fusA, the chromosomal gene that codes for EF-G. [...] The mutation alters EF-G so that fusidic acid is no longer able to bind to it. [...] Resistance is readily acquired when fusidic acid is used alone and commonly develops during the course of treatment. As with most other antibiotics, resistance to fusidic acid arises less frequently when used in combination with other drugs. For this reason, fusidic acid should not be used on its own to treat serious Staph. aureus infections. However, at least in Canadian hospitals, data collected between 1999-2005 showed rather low rate {{of resistance}} of MSSA and MRSA to fusidic acid, and <b>mupirocin</b> was found to be the more problematic topical antibiotic for the aforementioned conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mupirocin</b> is {{a mixture}} of several pseudomonic acids, with pseudomonic acid A (PA-A) constituting greater than 90% of the mixture. Also present in <b>mupirocin</b> are pseudomonic acid B with an {{additional}} hydroxyl group at C8, pseudomonic acid C with a double bond between C10 and C11, instead of the epoxide of PA-A, and pseudomonic acid D with a double bond at C4` and C5` in the 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid portion of <b>mupirocin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Mupirocin</b> {{is used as}} {{a topical}} {{treatment}} for bacterial skin infections, for example, furuncle, impetigo, open wounds, etc. It is also useful in the treatment of superficial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. <b>Mupirocin</b> is inactive for most anaerobic bacteria, mycobacteria, mycoplasma, chlamydia, yeast and fungi.|$|E
50|$|Both 2 percent ointments {{are applied}} to {{patients}} 3 times daily for 7 days to cure primary and secondary skin infections. The <b>mupirocin</b> bacteriologic cure rate is 97 percent and the fusidic acid bacteriologic cure rate is 87 percent, but <b>mupirocin</b> is more expensive than fusidic acid.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{clinical}} use of <b>mupirocin</b> began, strains of Staphylococcus aureus that were resistant to <b>mupirocin</b> emerged, with nares clearance rates {{of less than}} 30% success. Two distinct populations of mupirocin-resistant S. aureus were isolated. One strain possessed low-level resistance, MuL, (MIC = 8-256 mg/L) and another possessed high-level resistance, MuH, (MIC > 256 mg/L). Resistance in the MuL strains is probably due to mutations in the organism's wild-type isoleucinyl-tRNA synthetase. In E. coli IleRS, a single amino acid mutation was shown to alter <b>mupirocin</b> resistance. MuH {{is linked to the}} acquisition of a separate Ile synthetase gene, mupA. <b>Mupirocin</b> is not a viable antibiotic against MuH strains. Other antibiotic agents such as azelaic acid, nitrofurazone, silver sulfadiazine, and ramoplanin {{have been shown to be}} effective against MuH strains.|$|E
50|$|The 74 kb <b>mupirocin</b> {{gene cluster}} {{contains}} six multi-domain enzymes and twenty-six other peptides (Table 1). Four large multi-domain type I polyketide synthase (PKS) proteins are encoded, {{as well as}} several single function enzymes with sequence similarity to type II PKSs. Therefore, it is believed that <b>mupirocin</b> is constructed by a mixed type I and type II PKS system. The <b>mupirocin</b> cluster exhibits an atypical acyltransferase (AT) organization, in that there are only two AT domains, and both are found on the same protein, MmpC. These AT domains are the only domains present on MmpC, while the other three type I PKS proteins contain no AT domains. The <b>mupirocin</b> pathway also contains several tandem acyl carrier protein doublets or triplets. This may be an adaptation to increase the throughput rate or to bind multiple substrates simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|S. aureus is {{particularly}} common, and asymptomatically colonizes about 30% {{of the human}} population; attempts to decolonize carriers have met with limited success and generally involve <b>mupirocin</b> nasally and chlorhexidine washing, potentially along with vancomycin and cotrimoxazole to address intestinal and urinary tract infections.|$|E
50|$|By culturing P. fluorescens, <b>mupirocin</b> (an antibiotic) can be produced, {{which has}} been found to be useful in {{treating}} skin, ear, and eye disorders.Mupirocin free acid and its salts and esters are agents currently used in creams, ointments, and sprays as a treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>mupirocin</b> differs from other clinical antibiotics, rendering cross-resistance to other antibiotics unlikely. However, the MupA gene may co-transfer with other antibacterial resistance genes. This {{has been observed}} already with resistance genes for triclosan, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. [...] It may also result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mupirocin</b> (Bactroban) 2% {{ointment}} can {{be effective}} at reducing the size of lesions. A secondary covering of clothing is preferred.

50|$|In skin {{infections and}} in {{secondary}} infection sites topical <b>mupirocin</b> is used successfully. For bacteremia and endocarditis, vancomycin or daptomycin is considered.

Clindamycin is not approved for the treatment of MRSA infection it is still used in children for soft tissue infections.|$|E
50|$|Medicines {{historically}} discovered or {{developed at}} GSK and its legacy companies and now sold as generics include amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, ticarcillin-clavulanate, <b>mupirocin,</b> and ceftazidime for bacterial infections, zidovudine for HIV infection, valacyclovir for herpes virus infections, albendazole for parasitic infections, sumatriptan for migraine, lamotrigine for epilepsy, bupropion and paroxetine for major depressive disorder, cimetidine and ranitidine for gastroesophageal reflux disorder, mercaptopurine and thioguanine {{for the treatment}} of leukemia, allopurinol for gout, pyrimethamine for malaria, and the antibacterial trimethoprim.|$|E
50|$|Antibiotic creams are the {{preferred}} treatment for mild cases of impetigo, despite their limited systemic absorption. Such prescribed ointments include neosporin, fusidic acid, chloramphenicol and <b>mupirocin.</b> More severe cases of impetigo however (especially bullous impetigo) will likely require oral agents with better systemic bioavailability, such as cephalexin. Cases {{that do not}} resolve with initial antibiotic therapy or require hospitalization may also be indicative an MRSA infection, which would {{require the use of}} agents specifically able to treat it, such as clindamycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mupirocin</b> {{reversibly}} binds to the isoleucyl t-RNA synthetase in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus, {{resulting in}} inhibition of protein synthesis. DNA and cell wall formation are also negatively impacted {{to a lesser}} degree. The inhibition of RNA synthesis was {{shown to be a}} protective mechanism in response to a lack of one amino acid, isoleucine. In vivo studies in Escherichia coli demonstrated that pseudomonic acid inhibits isoleucine t-RNA synthetase (IleRS). This mechanism of action is shared with furanomycin, an analog of isoleucine.|$|E
50|$|It is {{proposed}} that MmpB to catalyzes {{the synthesis of}} 9-HN (Figure 5). MmpB contains a KS, KR, DH, 3 ACPs, and a thioesterase (TE) domain. It does not contain an enoyl reductase (ER) domain, which would be required for the complete reduction to the nine-carbon fatty acid. MupE is a single-domain protein that shows sequence similarity to known ER domains and may complete the reaction. It also remains possible that 9-hydroxy-nonanoic acid is derived partially or entirely from outside of the <b>mupirocin</b> cluster.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, {{treatment}} of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. Diiodohydroxyquinoline is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, <b>mupirocin,</b> metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.|$|E

5000|$|Skin {{microflora}} can be commensals, mutualistic or pathogens. Often {{they can}} be all three depending upon {{the strength of the}} person's immune system. Research upon the immune system in the gut and lungs has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is an example of a}} mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause dermatitis. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as <b>Mupirocin).</b> This works against staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of fungus species such as Candida krusei, Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus. It can also inhibit the growth of Helicobacter pylori. So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that [...] "removing P. aeruginosa from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection." ...|$|E
50|$|PD is less {{efficient}} at removing wastes {{from the body}} than hemodialysis, {{and the presence of}} the tube presents a risk of peritonitis due to the potential to introduce bacteria to the abdomen. There is not sufficient evidence to be clear about the best treatment for PD-associated peritonitis, although direct infusion of antibiotics into the peritoneum appears to offer slight advantage over the intravenous route of administration; there is no clear advantage for other frequently used treatments such as routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. The tube site can also become infected; the use of prophylactic nasal <b>mupirocin</b> can reduce the number of tube site infections, but does not help with peritonitis. Infections can be as frequent as once every 15 months (0.8 episodes per patient year). Compared to hemodialysis, PD allows greater patient mobility, produces fewer swings in symptoms due to its continuous nature, and phosphate compounds are better removed, but large amounts of albumin are removed which requires constant monitoring of nutritional status. The costs of PD are generally lower than that of HD {{in most parts of the}} world, this cost advantage is most apparent in developed economies. There is insufficient research to adequately compare the risks and benefits between CAPD and APD; a Cochrane Review of three small clinical trials found no difference in clinically important outcomes (i.e. morbidity or mortality) for patients with end stage renal disease, nor was there any advantage in preserving the functionality of the kidneys. The results suggested APD may have psychosocial advantages for younger patients and those who are employed or pursuing an education.|$|E

40|$|Perioperative {{decolonization}} of Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers with <b>mupirocin</b> {{together with}} chlorhexidine body washing reduces {{the incidence of}} S. aureus surgical site infection.

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of the use of <b>mupirocin</b> {{ointment}} on colonization, transmission, and infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a long-termcare facility. : All 321 residents of a Veterans Affairs long-term-care facility from June 1990 through June 1991 were studied for MRSA colonization and infection. MRSA-colonized patients received <b>mupirocin</b> ointment to nares in the first 7 months and to nares and wounds in the second 5 months. The effect of <b>mupirocin</b> use on MRSA colonization and infection was monitored. All S. aureus strains isolated were tested for the development of resistance to <b>mupirocin.</b> : A total of 65 patients colonized with MRSA received <b>mupirocin</b> ointment. <b>Mupirocin</b> rapidly eliminated MRSA at the sites treated in most patients by the end of 1 week. Weekly maintenance <b>mupirocin</b> was not adequate to prevent recurrences [...] 40 % of patients had recurrence of MRSA. Overall, MRSA colonization in the facility, which was 22. 7 % +/- 1 % prior to the use of <b>mupirocin,</b> did not change when <b>mupirocin</b> was used in nares only (22. 2 % +/- 2. 1 %), but did decrease to 11. 5 % +/- 1. 8 % when <b>mupirocin</b> was used in nares and wounds.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mupirocin</b> {{competitively}} inhibits bacterial isoleucyl transfer-RNA synthetase and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Widespread {{usage and}} over the counter availability of the drug has resulted in resistance among Staphylococcus species. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the overall prevalence of <b>mupirocin</b> resistance among staphylococci. Correlate clinical significance of <b>mupirocin</b> resistance {{and its relationship to}} clinical use. Methods: Consecutive, nonrepetitive, clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 98), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (n = 45) from skin and soft-tissue infections between January 2014 and June 2014 were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Low- and high-level <b>mupirocin</b> resistance was screened by using 5 µg and 200 µg discs respectively and confirmed by agar dilution. Annual consumption of <b>mupirocin</b> was studied and correlated with resistance. Results: High-level <b>mupirocin</b> resistance was found in 8. 2 % S. aureus and 15. 6 % of CoNS, while low-level <b>mupirocin</b> resistance was found in 17 % S. aureus and 8. 9 % CoNS. High-level <b>mupirocin</b> resistance was more common in methicillin-sensitive S. aureusisolates when compared with methicillin-resistant S. aureusisolates (P < 0. 05). <b>Mupirocin</b> resistant S. epidermidiswere associated with methicillin resistance and constitutive clindamycin resistance. Conclusion: High prevalence of <b>mupirocin</b> resistance was found in the present study. Increased prevalence of <b>mupirocin</b> resistance among community-acquired staphylococci demands the judicious use of the drug in the community...|$|E
