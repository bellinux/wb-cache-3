40|$|Surface {{temperature}} {{is a crucial}} parameter in proposed schemes that are aimed at assessing the thermal state of permafrost by remote sensing. However, the spatial resolution of satellite-based surface temperature measurements is usually not sufficient to capture the variations that occur in highly structured terrain typical of permafrost regions. Moreover, in arctic regions, cloud cover is likely to preclude measurements for prolonged periods that {{can result in a}} biased surface temperature record. To further explore these problems and develop suitable correction algorithms, ground-based surface temperature studies with adequate spatial and temporal resolution are required. We present a continuous surface temperature record from a high-arctic continuous permafrost site on Svalbard, Norway, obtained with two thermal camera systems, each mounted on a 10 m mast. Both systems featured a sensor size of 384 x 288 pixels, allowing for spatial resolutions ranging from several cm² per pixel to several m² per pixel. The first thermal camera system covered a single scene that included different expositions, surface covers and soil water contents with a temporal resolution of 10 min. The second system was mounted on a rotating head that captured 15 different images every hour. The total area monitored with this system was approximately 300 x 100 m 2. The study was performed from mid-July to September 2008, thus covering {{a large part of the}} snow-free season. The study area is characterized by hilly tundra with sparse vegetation, alternating with exposed soil and rock fields. The volumetric soil water content spatially varied from approximately 10 % to more than 50 %. The data set is discussed with respect to the following issues: 1. Do systematic differences in average surface temperature exist between regions with different soil water contents, surface covers and expositions? 2. What is the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> to correctly determine average surface temperatures for different time periods? 3. Is it possible to determine a correct average surface temperature if only measurements from periods with little or no cloud cover are considered...|$|E

The overall goal of this dissertation is to objectively measure PA in youth with Down syndrome (DS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> period needed for each group using data-based evidence. In study 1, I sought to objectively estimate PA in youth with DS using accelerometers and to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> days and hours needed. Results indicated that there were significant differences in daily PA between genders and age groups, not between weekdays and weekends, and that overall, 95 % of the youth with DS who participated met the national physical activity guidelines. Regarding the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> period, the results demonstrated that 4 days and 14 hours of monitoring per day were required to reliably estimate typical PA in youth with DS. In study 2, I aimed to objectively estimate PA using accelerometers and to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> days and hours needed in youth with ASD. Results demonstrated that there were significant differences in daily PA between genders and age groups, not between weekdays and weekends, and that approximately 90 % of the youth with ASD who participated met the physical activity guidelines. In addition, at least 2 days and 9 hours of monitoring per day were needed to reliably estimate typical PA in youth with ASD. Finally, in study 3, I aimed to compare PA and the <b>minimum</b> <b>monitoring</b> days and hours needed between youth with DS and youth with ASD with the PA data measured on the ankle using accelerometers. Results indicated that placing an accelerometer on the ankle as the monitoring placement appeared to be reliable when measuring PA in youth with DS and ASD. No significant differences were observed for PA between the DS and ASD group, and 3 days of monitoring may be the most reasonable <b>minimum</b> number of <b>monitoring</b> days if both groups are combined into a larger group, categorized as developmental disabilities.

40|$|Resting {{sites are}} key {{structures}} for many mammalian species, which can affect reproduction, survival, population density, and even species persistence in human-modified landscapes. As a consequence, {{an increasing number}} of studies has estimated patterns of resting site use by mammals, as well as the processes underlying these patterns, though the impact of sampling design on such estimates remain poorly understood. Here we address this issue empirically, based on data from 21 common genets radiotracked during 28 months in Mediterranean forest landscapes. Daily radiotracking data was thinned to simulate every other day and weekly <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and then used to evaluate the impact of sampling regime on estimates of resting site use. Results showed that lower <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> were associated with major underestimates of the average number of resting sites per animal, and of site reuse rates and sharing frequency, though no effect was detected on the percentage use of resting site types. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> also had a major impact on estimates of environmental effects on resting site selection, with decreasing <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies</b> resulting in higher model uncertainty and reduced power to identify significant explanatory variables. Our results suggest that variation in <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> may have had a strong impact on intra- and interspecific differences in resting site use patterns detected in previous studies. Given the errors and uncertainties associated with low <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequencies,</b> we recommend that daily or at least every other day monitoring should be used whenever possible in studies estimating resting site use patterns by mammals...|$|R

INTRODUCTION When setting up land-use monitoring systems, spatial uncertainties {{and their impact on}} the detection of indicator changes are usually ignored. To capture a significant change in land-use indicators is thus strongly related to its spatial resolution, the velocities of the process it represents and the accuracy of the used indicators.

Here we want to determine the satisfaction of well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients with either three-monthly or six-monthly diabetes monitoring and their future preference. Methods: Survey among 2215 well-controlled type 2 diabetes patients (not using insulin, HbA 1 c Results: Most patients (70. 8 %) would like to continue their <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency.</b> Patients from the preference groups were more often satisfied than randomised patients (92. 7 % and 88. 1 %, respectively) and patients monitored three-monthly were more often satisfied than patients monitored six-monthly (93. 5 % and 88. 5 %, respectively).

40|$|Using {{remote sensing}} {{technology}} becomes an important method for monitoring the land-use practice in China. For pursuing economic benefits, the local governments often implement various development programs by using state land illegally, {{thus it is}} essential to identify these illegal cases in using proper techniques such as remote sensing technology.

40|$|Background: Adherence to {{treatment}} {{has been defined}} as {{the degree to which a}} patient’s behavior corresponds to medical or health advice; however, the most appropriate method to evaluate adherence to diabetes care has yet to be identified. We conducted analyses to compare adherence assessments and blood glucose monitoring measures with regard to their ability to predict glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We analyzed four instruments to evaluate adherence: Self-Care Inventory-Revised, a self-administered survey; Diabetes Self-Monitoring Profile (DSMP), administered by trained researchers; a categorical (yes/no/sometimes) adherence self-evaluation; and a continuous (0 – 100) adherence self-evaluation. Blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> was evaluated by self-report, diary, and meter download. Results: Participants (n = 82) were aged 39. 0 ± 13. 1 years with a mean diabetes duration of 21. 2 ± 11. 1 years; 27 % monitored blood glucose > 4 times/day. The DSMP score was the strongest predictor of glycemic control (r = − 0. 32, P = 0. 004) among adherence assessments, while blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> assessed by meter download was the strongest predictor among blood glucose monitoring measures (r = − 40, P < 0. 001). All the self-report assessments had a significant but weak correlation with glycemic control (r ≤ 0. 28, P ≤ 0. 02). The final adjusted model identified the assessment of blood glucose <b>monitoring</b> <b>frequency</b> by meter download as the most robust predictor of HbA 1 c (estimate effect size = − 0. 58, P = 0. 003).

40|$|Insufficient {{temporal}} {{monitoring of}} water quality in streams or engineered drains alters the apparent shape of storm chemographs, resulting in shifted model parameterisations and changed interpretations of solute sources that have produced episodes of poor water quality. This so-called 'aliasing' phenomenon is poorly recognised in water research. Using advances in in-situ sensor technology {{it is now}} possible to monitor sufficiently frequently to avoid the onset of aliasing. A systems modelling procedure is presented allowing objective identification of sampling rates needed to avoid aliasing within strongly rainfall-driven chemical dynamics. In this study aliasing of storm chemograph shapes was quantified by changes in the time constant parameter (TC) of transfer functions. As a proportion of the original TC, the onset of aliasing varied between watersheds, ranging from 3. 9 - 7. 7 to 54 - 79 %TC (or 110 - 160 to 300 - 600 minutes).
