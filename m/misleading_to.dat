25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, {{they could}} have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it is <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> think of them as axes, {{they could have}} been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, {{piercing}} and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|E

It {{would be just as}} accurate and <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> say that Courtney Love wrote most of Nirvana's third album, In Utero: you can certainly see her influence in Kurt's lyrics. Before the pair met, it was often guesswork as to his intentions. Afterwards, his lyrics were far more direct.|$|E
25|$|One notable feature, {{related to}} the number of simple bivectors and so {{rotation}} planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it is <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.|$|E
25|$|One of the Copenhagen Consensus panel experts later distanced {{himself from}} {{the way in which}} the Consensus results have been {{interpreted}} in the wider debate. Thomas Schelling now thinks that it was <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> put climate change at the bottom of the priority list. The Consensus panel members were presented with a dramatic proposal for handling climate change. If given the opportunity, Schelling would have put a more modest proposal higher on the list. The Yale economist Robert O. Mendelsohn was the official critic of the proposal for climate change during the Consensus. He thought the proposal was way out of the mainstream and could only be rejected. Mendelsohn worries that climate change was set up to fail.|$|E

25|$|By March 2011, {{the market}} share of OS X in North America had {{increased}} to slightly over 14%. Whether {{the size of the}} Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, gives the impression that fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.|$|E

He maintains, for example, that contemporary anthropologists comparing musical instruments from two cultures that existed at the same time but differed in organization, culture, and handicraft cannot determine which instruments are more [...] "primitive". Ordering instruments by geography is also not totally reliable, as it cannot always be determined when and how cultures contacted one another and shared knowledge.|$|E

500|$|In the 20th century, {{some historians}} argued that Parkman exaggerated {{the extent of}} Pontiac's {{influence}} in the conflict {{and that it was}} <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> name the war after Pontiac. For example, in 1988 Francis Jennings wrote: [...] "In Francis Parkman's murky mind the backwoods plots emanated from one savage genius, the Ottawa chief Pontiac, and thus they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac,' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance' involving many tribes." [...] Alternate titles for the war have been proposed, but historians generally continue to refer to the war by the familiar names, with [...] "Pontiac's War" [...] probably the most commonly used. [...] "Pontiac's Conspiracy" [...] is now infrequently used by scholars.|$|E
500|$|Archaeoastronomy (also spelled archeoastronomy) is {{the study}} of how people in the past [...] "have {{understood}} the phenomena in the sky, how they used these phenomena and what role the sky played in their cultures". Clive Ruggles argues it is <b>misleading</b> <b>to</b> consider archaeoastronomy to be the study of ancient astronomy, as modern astronomy is a scientific discipline, while archaeoastronomy considers symbolically rich cultural interpretations of phenomena in the sky by other cultures. It is often twinned with ethnoastronomy, the anthropological study of skywatching in contemporary societies. Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with historical astronomy, the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the history of astronomy, which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.|$|E
500|$|For modern readers he is {{most famous}} for the Kitab al-I'tibar and his {{descriptions}} of life in Syria during the early crusades. The disjointed {{nature of the work}} has given him a reputation as a senile rambler, although it is actually written with an anthological structure, with humorous or moralistic tales that are not meant to proceed chronologically, as a true autobiography would. Since this style of literature, adab in Arabic, does not necessarily have to be factual, historians {{are quick to point out}} that Usama's historical material cannot always be trusted. Usama's anecdotes about the crusades are sometimes obvious jokes, exaggerating their [...] "otherness" [...] to entertain his Muslim audience.
