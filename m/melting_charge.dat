40|$|The {{indirect}} resistance heating {{is one of}} {{many ways}} of heating a <b>melting</b> <b>charge.</b> It is used in metallurgy, mostly for melting of soft metals. Its principle is a direct resistance heating in correspondence with the Joule´s law. The principle of indirect resistance heating is in generating of thermal energy in heating element and heat transferring this heat into the <b>melting</b> <b>charge.</b> The theoretical part of this Bachelor Work (the first three chapters) is focused to thermal energy generation and possibility of thermal transmittance. The fourth chapter is devoted to possibility of utilizing of the indirect heating in praxis. The simplest general design and calculation of a pot-type furnace for aluminium melting is done in the fifth chapter. There is a part in this chapter, which deals with the effectivity of the designed pot-type furnace and possibility of heating optimalization in case when indirect heating system is used.

40|$|Phase change {{materials}} (PCM) {{possess a}} great capacity of accumulation {{of energy in}} their temperature of fusion thanks to the latent heat. These materials are used in applications where {{it is necessary to}} store energy due to the temporary phase shift between the offer and demand of thermal energy. Thus, possible applications are the solar systems as well as the recovery of residual heat for its posterior use in other processes. In spite of this great potential, the practical feasibility of latent heat storage with PCM is still limited, mainly due to a rather low thermal conductivity. This low conductivity implies small heat transfer coefficients and, consequently, thermal cycles are slow and not suitable for most of the potential applications. This work investigates experimentally the heat transfer process during <b>melting</b> (<b>charge)</b> and solidification (discharge) of five small heat exchangers working as latent heat thermal storage systems. Commercial paraffin RT 35 is used as PCM filling one side of the heat exchanger and water circulates through the other side as heat transfer fluid. Average thermal power values are evaluated for various operating conditions and compared among the heat exchangers studied. When the comparison is done for average power per unit area and per average temperature gradient, results show that the double pipe heat exchanger with the PCM embedded in a graphite matrix (DPHX-PCM matrix) is the one with higher values, in the range of 700 - 800 Â W/m 2 -K, which are one order of magnitude higher than the ones presented by the second best. On the other hand, the compact heat exchanger (CompHX-PCM) is by large the one with the highest average thermal power (above 1 Â kW), as it has the highest ratio of heat transfer area to external volume.

The flow {{of molten}} metal after being poured usually is {{accompanied}} by turbulence, splashing, separation of streams near change of sections, branching off and rejoining of streams, changes in melt properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension and the solidification behavior.

Increasing the pouring temperature increases the filling area of cast Al- 18 % Si alloy for all ingates thicknesses used in this study.

In both salts, the so-called horizontal-stripe charge order is stabilized by nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions and by electron-lattice interactions. In θ -(BEDT-TTF) _ 2 RbZn(SCN) _ 4 (abbreviated as θ -RbZn), the stabilization energy due to lattice distortion is larger, so that larger quantity of energy needs to be absorbed for the <b>melting</b> of the <b>charge</b> and lattice orders. The photoinduced charge dynamics shows a complex behavior owing to a substantial number of nearly degenerate eigenstates involved. This is related to the high structural symmetry when the lattice is undistorted.

The investigated Zn- 10 wt. % Al (ZnAl 10) alloy is representative of the high-aluminium alloys, which, on account of its tendency of forming coarse-grained structures, has rather low plastic properties, including elongation. In order to improve the plastic properties, a modification treatment is usually applied.

By numerically solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we study the photoinduced dynamics in extended Peierls-Hubbard models on anisotropic triangular lattices within the Hartree-Fock approximation. The <b>melting</b> of the <b>charge</b> order needs more energy for θ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 RbZn(SCN) 4 than for α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 I 3, {{which is a}} consequence of the larger stabilization energy in θ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 RbZn(SCN) 4. After local photoexcitation in the charge ordered states, the growth of a photoinduced domain shows anisotropy. In θ-(BEDT-TTF) 2 RbZn(SCN) 4, the domain hardly expands to the direction perpendicular to the horizontal-stripes. This is because all the molecules on the hole-rich stripe are rotated in one direction and those on the hole-poor stripe in the other direction. They modulate horizontally connected transfer integrals homogeneously, stabilizing the charge order stripe by stripe. In α-(BEDT-TTF) 2 I 3, lattice distortions locally stabilize the charge order so that it is easily weakened by local photoexcitation. The photoinduced domain indeed expands in the plane.
