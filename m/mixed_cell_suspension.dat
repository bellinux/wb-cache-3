40|$|RINm 5 F cells, a line {{derived from}} a rat insulinoma, are {{frequently}} used {{as a model for}} studying pancreatic B cell structure and function. These transformed cells are known, however, to be different from native B cells in a number of biochemical respects. We have now compared the surface features of RIN cells and native B cells in two different ways: 1) Dispersed cells from islet obtained from adult rats can reassociate spontaneously in culture to form aggregates (pseudoislets) with cellular organization similar to that of intact native islets (a central B cell core surrounded by a discontinuous mantle of non-B cells). Native islet cells and RIN cells were mixed together and allowed to reaggregate. Examination by immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy showed that the aggregates contained all cell types present in the original <b>mixed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> (native B- and non-B cells, and RIN cells). The native B cells were centrally located, surrounded by zones of non-B cells, as in islets. The RIN cells, however, were restricted to the periphery and as such not recognized as native B cells. 2) R 2 D 6, a monoclonal antibody, binds selectively to a ganglioside on the surface of islet B, but not non-B, cells. The role of this ganglioside is not known. RIN cells were incubated with R 2 D 6 followed by a fluorescently labeled second antibody. Analysis by flow cytofluorometry indicated that the monoclonal antibody had bound (stained) only 3 - 15 % of the RIN cells. These R 2 D 6 positive cells were sorted from R 2 D 6 negative cells and subsequently shown to have a lower DNA content. Expression of the R 2 D 6 target ganglioside on RIN cells thus appears to be cell cycle dependent. Based on two different criteria, RINm 5 F cells do not therefore share surface features in common with native B cells. The cell cycle dependent expression of a B cell surface antigen by the RIN cells might, however, be a useful model for studying the regulation of ganglioside turnover...|$|E

Chondrocyte transplantation in particular has been successfully used to engineer new tissue masses due to the low metabolic requirements of these cells. However, the engineered cartilaginous tissue is too rigid for many soft tissue applications. We propose that hybrid tissue engineered from chondrocytes and smooth muscle cells could reflect mechanical properties intermediate between these two cell types. In this study, rat aortic smooth muscle cells and pig auricular chondrocytes were co-cultured on polyglycolic acid fiber-based matrices to address this hypothesis. <b>Mixed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> were seeded by agitating the polymer matrices and a <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> with an orbital shaker. After seeding, cell-polymer constructs were cultured in stirred bioreactors for 8 weeks. The cell density and extracellular matrix (collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycan) content of the engineered tissues were determined biochemically. After 8 weeks in culture, the hybrid tissue had a high cell density (5. 8 × 108 cells/cm 3), and elastin (519 μg/g wet tissue sample), collagen (272 μg/g wet tissue sample), and glycosaminoglycan (GAG; 10 μg/g wet tissue sample) content. Mechanical testing indicated the compressive modulus of the hybrid tissues after 8 weeks to be 40. 8 ± 4. 1 kPa and the equilibrium compressive modulus to be 8. 4 ± 0. 8 kPa.

40|$|The role of cell {{surface charge}} in {{cellular}} interactions {{has been the}} subject of conflicting reports. The major contribution to the net cell surface negativity of all mammalian cells studied is made by the sialic acid moieties of the surface glycoproteins, while ribonuclease-susceptible sites have been shown to contribute to a lesser extent on some cell types. Experi-ments were done to determine whether these anionic groups at the cell periphery affect the aggregation and sorting behaviour of embryonic chick neural retina cells when cultured alone or in combination with embryonic heart cells. The net negative surface charge density, as determined by cell electrophoretic mobility, of neuraminidase- or ribonuclease-treated cells was significantly decreased immediately after incubation with the enzymes, and the treatment with neuraminidase resulted in a reduction in the binding of colloidal iron hydroxide particles at the cell surface.

As the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is the main pathological process of glaucoma [2], many researchers have tried {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of RGC death. Although retinal explant culture and <b>mixed</b> retinal <b>cell</b> culture can represent the intraretinal microenvi-ronment and reflect intercellular interactions between RGCs and other retinal cells [3 - 5], isolate RGC culture is more helpful for investigating primary RGC responses in certain circumstances. Since Barres et al. [6] introduced the two-step immu-nopanning (TSI) method, it has been widely used to purify primary RGCs in vitro [7 - 10]. Using the first panning step, cells that react to antimacrophage antibody, which are presumed to be macrophages/microglia and endothelial cells, can be depleted from retinal <b>cell</b> <b>suspension.</b> In the second panning step, cells that have affinities to antithymo-cyte differentiation antigen 1 (Thy 1) antibody, which are presumed to be RGCs, can be selected from the remaining <b>mixed</b> <b>cells.</b> Though the purity of RGCs isolated by the TSI method has been reported to reach 99. 5 % [6], it is very complicated, and its yield varies.

40|$|In vivo {{studies of}} {{individual}} factors involved in molecular and cellular processes in particular cell types of the kidney {{are limited by}} the cellular diversity of the nephron and by the impossibility of controlling interactions between different cell types. These problems can be addressed more accurately using in vitro cultures. However, the main problem with kidney cell cultures is the selection of one particular cell type out of the heterogeneous population of cells in the kidney. Caution should therefore be taken in using cell culture systems to investigate different processes in one specific cell type, since {{the interpretation of the}} obtained results is determined by the purity of the cell population. A wide range of renal primary cell culture models have been developed [1] with different levels of cell purity depending on the isolation procedure used. Primary cell cultures are preferable to the existing renal cell lines, such as the LLC-pK 1 cells [2], because of the transformed or tumorigenic nature of the latter leading to cellular heterogeneity, loss of characteristics and acquisition of non-characteristic biochemical and physiological properties. Several research groups have used cultures obtained from expiants or <b>mixed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions,</b> sometimes combined with one or more purification steps such as isopycnic centrifugation and/or differential sieving [3 – 6]. In general, these cells were further grown in selective media in an attempt to minimize fibroblastic contamination [7, 8]. The purity of these cell populations was, however, often inadequately controlled. A second technique for obtaining primary cultures of proximal tubular cells (PTC) or distal tubular cells (DTC) is microdissection and culture of the isolated nephron segments [9]. This approach has been used successfully to culture homogeneous renal tubule cell populations, but cell numbers are limited and multiple cell types within the same segment cannot be separated. In a third approach, isolation is performed by immunodissection using cell-type specific antibodies [10, 11] and/or enzymatic activity probes [12]. This study presents {{for the first time the}} successful procedure for isolating pure populations of human PTC and heterogeneous populations of DTC (consisting of thick ascending limb cells, distal tubular cells and collecting duct cells), using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against specific plasma membrane antigens in flow cytometry and for culturing them...|$|R

The following elementary processes are taken into account: 1) lateral diffusion of HA-trimers and receptors, 2) aggregation of HA-trimers to immobilized clusters, 3) reversible formation of HA-receptor contacts, and 4) irreversible conversion of HA-receptor contacts into stable links between HA and the target membrane. The contact sites between fusing cells are modeled as superimposed square lattices. The model simulates well the statistical distribution of time delays measured for the various intermediates of fusion pore formation between cell-cell fusion complexes.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the phenomena of sponge cell recognition. When fully grown sponges {{belonging to the}} same species are brought into contact, either naturally or by an experimental process, they fuse into a single organism. In {{the absence of any}} circulatory system, the ability for cellular recognition resides in the cell surface and is expressed when cells come into contact. This characteristic of sponges and the readiness, with which the sponges can be dissociated into cellular suspension, led to the main experimental work on cellular recognition in these organisms— that is, the studies on the aggregating behavior of dissociated sponge cells. The technique of cell aggregation is very useful, as it allows the <b>mixing</b> of <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> of different kinds and proportions, and because a large number of cells can be brought simultaneously into contact. Purification and characterization of sponge cell aggregating factors was first attempted in Microciona prolifera and Haliclona occulata. Glycopeptides extracted from whole sponges with trichloroacetic acid were antigenic and that they elicited in rabbits precipitating and agglutinating antisera specific for the homologous cells. Some phenomena, involved in sponge cell recognition, were investigated during the reaggregation of the dissociated cells.

40|$|The early proliferative {{response}} previously {{demonstrated in}} rabbits {{has now been}} shown to follow the <b>mixing</b> of spleen <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> from 2 inbred strains of mice or rats. The size of the response is comparable to that seen in cells from hyperimmune animals exposed to antigen in vitro. Autoradiographs of cells from stimulated cultures showed 1 to 4 per cent {{of the total population}} had incorporated thymidine. Modifications in the conditions necessary for the culture of mice and rat spleen <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> and the measurement of thymidine incorporation are described. No responses were observed in isologous mixes. The responses obtained on mixing individual pairs of spleens from different strains showed relatively little variation. Responses were obtained in all of the 21 possible combinations between 7 inbred strains of mice. Responses were obtained when parental <b>cells</b> were <b>mixed</b> with their F 1 hybrids. Analysis of these responses showed that, in every case, parental-F 1 hybrid responses were less intense than those between the 2 parents. It was shown that there was no inherent defect in the ability of the hybrid cells to respond when mixed with an unrelated strain. The results suggested that the hybrid cells made no response to the parent cells although this was not conclusively established. This has been taken as circumstantial evidence that the response is immunological in nature. The significance of the vigor of the response and the large fraction of the immunologically competent cells that take part is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hypertrophy of the {{mesenteric}} fat around inflamed {{areas of}} the intestine is a characteristic phenomenon observed in Crohn’s disease. Aim {{of the present study}} was the characterisation of the immunological repertoire of progenitor cells derived from mesenteric fat and focussed on the recently discovered cytosolic pattern recognition receptors named Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain (NOD) -protein 1 and 2, the latter is associated with susceptibility to Crohn’s disease. At transcript level, baseline expression of NOD 1 in murine preadipocytes was similar to NOD 1 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages and more pronounced than the expression of NOD 2. In Western blot analysis expression of both NOD 1 and NOD 2 in murine preadipocytes could be demonstrated. The expression of NOD 2 specific mRNA in preadipocytes could be modulated by cytokines representing a proinflammatory milieu and by bacterial cell wall-derived compounds which can be found in mesenteric fat during chronic intestinal inflammation through bacterial translocation. Functional studies demonstrated a Nuclear Factor (NF) κB-dependent production of IL- 6 after stimulation of murine preadipocytes with the NOD 1 -specific ligand lactyl-tetra-diaminopimelic acid (LT-DAP). Transfection of eukaryotic cells represented an essential method for functional studies resulting in the construction of a novel system for electroporation. This electroporation strategy, provided by the modular ELPorator 1000 device, applies continuous combined High Voltage (HV) and Low Voltage (LV) square pulses where the electric parameter of the effective field and the duration of each pulse can be defined individually. This method allows for highly efficient transfection of DNA or siRNA into isolated primary cell populations or within <b>mixed</b> <b>cell</b> <b>suspensions</b> as well as into other cell populations that are considered difficult to transfect. The initial HV pulse contributed to the number of transfected cells, while the longer LV pulse modulated the amount of transfected molecules. NOD 1 specificity of LT-DAP was verified by NOD 1 knockdown using specific Small Interfering (si) RNA. At the molecular level, the interaction of NOD 2 with its postulated ligand MDP has not been proven in the literature to date. Thus, a test system to evaluate this interaction was established applying surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Therefore recombinant NOD 2 fused to a Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) -Tag was expressed in eukaryotic cells and immobilized on the sensor chip via EGFP-specific antibodies. Results of these studies verified an interaction of MDP with NOD 2 at the molecular level in both LD and its stimulatory inactive DD configuration. No interaction of NOD 1 -specific ligands with NOD 2 could be observed underlining the specificity of the test system established. Data of this work provide evidence that NOD 1 and NOD 2 are expressed in preadipocytes and these receptors could be activated by bacterial translocation during intestinal inflammation and the interaction of NOD 2 with MDP is shown for the first time at molecular level...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: In {{recent years}} {{bioabsorbable}} synthetic or biologic materials {{have been used}} to augment the pulmonary artery or the right ventricular outflow tract. However, each of these polymers has one or more shortcomings. None of these patch materials has been seeded with cells. Thus, we have tested a fast-absorbing biopolymer, poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid, with autologous cell seeding for patch augmentation of the pulmonary artery in a juvenile sheep model. Methods: Vascular cells were isolated from ovine peripheral veins (n = 6). Bioabsorbable porous poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid patches (porosity > 95 %) were seeded on 3 consecutive days with a <b>mixed</b> vascular <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> (21. 3 ± 1. 3 × 106 cells). Forty-five (± 2) days after the vessel harvest, 1 unseeded and 6 autologously seeded control patches were implanted into the proximal pulmonary artery. The animals received no postoperative anticoagulation. Follow-up was performed with echocardiography after 1 week and before explantation after 1, 7, and 24 weeks (2 animals each) for the seeded control patches and after 20 weeks for the nonseeded control patch. Results: All animals survived the procedure. Postoperative echocardiography of the seeded patches demonstrated a smooth surface without dilatation or stenosis. Macroscopic appearance showed a smooth internal surface with increasing tissue formation. Histology at 169 days demonstrated a near-complete resorption of the polymer and formation of organized and functional tissue. Biochemical assays revealed increasing cellular and extracellular matrix contents. The control patch showed a slight bulging, indicating a beginning dilatation. Conclusion: This experiment showed that poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid is a feasible patch material in the pulmonary circulation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 120 : 1158 - 68...|$|R

Nine dilutions of vaccine from 10 - 1 to 10 - 5 in 0. 5 log 10 steps were <b>mixed</b> with Vero <b>cell</b> <b>suspension.</b> In WHO method, the <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> was seeded in octaplicate (8 wells of each dilution) in 24 -well plate and incubated at 36 °C for 10 days, during which the cells were checked for cytopathic changes everyday and positive wells were recorded. We used 5 % serum and 1 × 105 cells for the assays. The test was repeated with six different vaccines produced in one batch. The mean potency was 10 4. 475 ± 0. 134 CCID 50 /vial for each ten-dose vial. For NIBSC method the dilutions of vaccine were added to hexaplicate (6 well per dilution) in 24 -wells plate. After 3 hours, the medium was removed and overlay was added. Then the plates were incubated at 35 °C for 10 days. After incubation period, the plaques were stained with methyl violet and counted. This assay {{was repeated three times}} and the mean of results was 5. 93 log 10 PFU/dose. Results indicate that the potency of the vaccine is in acceptable range in either method.

Viewed by phase microscopy, marginal membranes developed ragged or vacuolated appearance within one minute after exposure to ADP or epinephrine. Recovery from the change induced by ADP occurred within five minutes. These effects were inhibited by prior incubation of the cell sus pension with dibutyryl adenosine cyclic monophosphate (DBcAMP) and were not produced by adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The results suggest that megakaryocyte membranes react with agents known to effect platelets and {{lend support to the}} indications that demarcating membranes of megakaryocytes derive from the megakaryocyte plasma mem brane.

Germ cells isolated from testes or ovaries of 11. 5 - 13. 5 days post coitum (dpc) CD- 1 mouse embryos were loaded with the fluorescent supravital dye 5 - 6 carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimyl ester (CFSE) and <b>mixed</b> with a <b>cell</b> <b>suspension</b> obtained by trypsin-EDTA treatment of gonads of various ages {{and of the}} same or opposite sex.

In contrast, a smaller number (about 19 %) were in meiosis in chimeric testes. None or very few of donor male germ cells entered meiosis in testes or ovarian host tissues. Aggregation of meiotic 13. 5 dpc female germ cells with testis tissues from 13. 5 to 14. 5 dpc embryos resulted in inhibition of meiotic progression and pyknosis in most donor germ cells.
