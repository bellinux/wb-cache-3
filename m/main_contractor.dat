5|$|An {{international}} competition {{was held to}} select the <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> It was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Community, and in December 2000 Skanska Ltd {{was selected as the}} <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> Edwina Hart AM, the Minister for Finance, Local Government and Communities, approved the final project design on 18 January 2001 and by 1 March 2001, the groundbreaking ceremony took place to mark the beginning of construction.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> was Veidekke and {{construction}} cost NOK238 million. Grants were given from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate and SINTEF for energy economization. The {{work on the}} hall was concluded on 1 February 1993. It was the 27th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway.|$|E
5|$|Architects were HRTB and the <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums {{have been}} common in North America, no such stadiums of {{comparable}} size of Telenor Arena {{had previously been}} built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the building boom, concrete elements needed for construction to start meant {{that the rest of}} the construction was delayed. The cornerstone was laid on 5 September.|$|E
50|$|Four <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> {{were barred}} from {{tendering}} seven new projects involving construction of 18,000 flats under HA from March to September 2015. In August 2015, <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> installed water filters for affected households and do the replacement or cleaning of water filters regularly. On 6 November 2015, the Tender Committee from the Housing Authority Committees suspended them from submitting tenders to one year.|$|R

40|$|Subcontractors {{carry out}} {{a large portion of}} the work done in {{construction}} projects. Thus, selecting the right subcontractor essentially contributes to the project's success. We designed a choice-based conjoint experiment to examine the relative importance of four criteria in the subcontractor selection process of <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> from Singapore: price, technical know-how, quality, and cooperation. Although <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> adopt a multicriteria selection process and perceive all four criteria to be important for their choice decision, the actual choice situation reveals that price is still by far the most important selection criterion, followed by quality, cooperation, and technical know-how. <b>Main</b> <b>contractors</b> are not willing to compromise on price but accept a lower performance of a known subcontractor on the remaining criteria...|$|R
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 25 February 2002, the <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> being Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd and Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd being the roofing contractor. Carr and Angier were the theatre consultants. Other {{contractors}} included Stent (foundations), Swansea Institute of Higher Education, {{now part of}} University of Wales Trinity Saint David (glass), GH James Cyf (stonemasonry), Rimex (stainless steel), Alfred McAlpine (slate), Coed Cymru (wood), Ann Catrin Evans (door furniture), Amber Hiscott (etchings on glass walls).|$|E
5|$|Planning {{permission}} {{has been}} approved for a 200-room five star Hilton hotel opposite the new Leeds Arena site which was due to be completed around 2015, although the project is currently on hiatus following {{the collapse of the}} <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> involved. The development was relocated from Clarence Dock following the refusal of its planning permission for that site.|$|E
5|$|As 30% of the {{upgrading}} cost {{had to be}} paid by {{the community}} club, several fundraising activities were carried out for the redevelopment. These activities, which included music concerts, golf tournaments and cyclethons, raised a total of S$6 million. The old club building was demolished in 1997 and construction of the Marine Parade Community Building began the same year. SAL Construction was the project's <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> Built {{at a cost of}} S$30 million, the new building was completed in January 2000, and was open to the public on 6 March 2000. It was officially opened by Goh Chok Tong on 28 May 2000.|$|E
40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) is {{the process}} of using {{computer}} software to create object-oriented, parametric models of buildings from which useful data can be retrieved. BIM can be used either collaboratively or under a traditional procurement structure, however collaboration is required to realise the full potential of the process. Building Information Modelling represents an opportunity for <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> in Auckland to counter the productivity losses that have been experienced in the New Zealand construction industry. Despite this, the adoption of BIM technologies by <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> in Auckland appears to be much slower than in the United States or Europe where a large number of benefits have been documented as stemming from the use of the process. Further adoption of BIM in Auckland will be dictated both by real benefits and barriers and perceived benefits and barriers. By conducting seven semi-structured interviews with medium to large commercial <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> operating in Auckland this exploratory research has allowed a comparison between the benefits and barriers experienced by foreign contractors with the experiences and perceptions of medium to large <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> operating in the Auckland construction industry towards BIM. Although a number of the surveyed <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> were already using BIM technologies, the research has found that their level of engagement with the Building Information Modelling process has been relatively low. This has meant that the intensity of both the benefits and the barriers is lower than those documented in the predominantly foreign literature. All the surveyed contractors felt that the use of BIM technologies would grow within the Auckland market, but also that the drive towards this growth will not come from <b>main</b> <b>contractors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> of Hong Kong {{building}} projects tend to subcontract {{most of their}} work. However, many of the subcontractors complain {{that they are not}} being fully utilized due main contractors’ poor site coordination of temporary works and interfacing works and plant supports etc. A list of critical site coordination problems caused by <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> that had adversely influence to the time performance of subcontractors was prepared. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data to generate multiple regression equations that explain how the critical site coordination problems affected the time performance of different types of subcontractor. The survey results were validated by neural network analysis. Backward elimination method was adopted to identify the ‘most critical’ site coordination problems that enable <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> to formulate measures to enhance their site management system...|$|R
40|$|Many large {{engineering}} projects {{continue to}} face late completion dates, budget overruns and technical difficulties. This problem {{is becoming increasingly}} relevant as the boundaries of organisation are shifting through companies’ increasing usage of outsourcing. Although offering many advantages, this working model of outsourcing also poses new challenges for <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> responsible for the realisation of large engineering projects. This master thesis, conducted at luxury yacht builder Oceanco, presents a process design on subcontractor management, which enables <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> to make an informed decision on their subcontractor management approach. The process design proves to challenge current practises at Oceanco and is valued by project management professionals from several other industries. Additionally, a subcontractor management canvas was developed based on the feedback of executives at Oceanco, which provides more guidance on which subcontractor approach to follow in what situation. This canvas was received well by the organisation of Oceanco, but could not be validated for other <b>main</b> <b>contractors.</b> The potential of this canvas justifies further research in this direction {{with a variety of}} case studies of <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> operating in other markets.

5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as its <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> The Network Rail team which {{worked on}} the line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2 of the Centre was {{designed}} by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture, formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of Capita Symonds, with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design. The <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, with MJN Colston Ltd responsible for the design and installation of all the mechanical, electrical and public health services in the building. Other subcontractors on the project included URS Corporation, Davis Langdon and Hulley & Kirkwood.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{established}} by Trøndelag-based investors on 2 April 1987, having been originally intended to operate charter flights to the Mediterranean area. Ansett Australia was an early investor, but soon sold out. The company suffered with its <b>main</b> <b>contractor,</b> Sun Tours, going bankrupt in 1988, after which the airline moved to the British charter market. Air Europe's holding company bought a third of Norway Airlines in October 1989; this allowed the Norwegian company to start flying Air Europe's route between Oslo and Gatwick as a wet lease operation, in addition to several international destinations from London. Air Europe went bankrupt in March 1991, causing Norway Airlines to temporarily halt operations.|$|E

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} in Hong Kong for the <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> of local building projects to sub-let most of their works, consequently their roles have gradually transformed from a constructor to a manager of sub-contractors of the project. The outcome of most projects therefore depends heavily on the sub-contractors' performance. However, most Hong Kong based sub-contractors complain that {{they are unable to}} operate efficiently and effectively due to main contractors' poor coordination of construction information, temporary works, interfacing works and temporary power supply. A list of the most serious problems caused by <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> during the construction stage that reduce sub-contractors' performance has been produced. A questionnaire survey has been conducted to identify and analyse the frequency and potential impact of the problems. The aggregated impact on subcontractors' site work is analysed.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} for <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> of Hong Kong building projects to sublet most of their works to subcontractors. This approach has been in operation {{for a long period}} of time as a strategy to deal with long-term environmental uncertainties and to buffer the technical core of <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> against short-term contingencies. Technology transfer can foster the growth of indigenous technological capacity of the local industry. This paper presents the questionnaire survey to investigate whether the local multilayered subcontracting system can function effectively as a platform for technology transfer...|$|R
5|$|Tore Løkke was {{selected}} as the <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> Construction cost 20.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK3.3 million was paid for by the municipality and NOK17 million was paid for by LOOC. The venue was completed in the fall of 1992 and was the first freestyle skiing arena in the world to feature a common spectator area for all three event hills. The temporary structures used during the Olympics were completed in December 1993. A jibbing park was installed in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Southampton City Council {{appointed}} the design team in July 2009, naming Wilkinson Eyre as lead. A year later, Kier Southern were named as <b>main</b> <b>contractor.</b> Despite reservations over {{the appearance of}} the new pavilion, English Heritage gave their approval for the designs, and final planning permission was granted in September 2010. Work began in October. There were some obstacles to the build, contractors discovered significant corrosion to the original building's steel frame which had to be repaired. Adding the necessary security elements to cover museum exhibits in a listed building also proved challenging. Features from the original building were preserved in the design, the former prison cells were kept intact and used as toilet facilities, and a court room was preserved as an exhibition space.|$|E
5|$|The {{first meeting}} of local {{commercial}} and political interests to establish a bridge was made in 1972. By 1983, it was formalized by {{the establishment of the}} company ASSkarnsundsbrua to finance construction. The Parliament of Norway passed the plans in 1986, and construction started two years later. The <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> was Aker; and after the bridge was finished, maintenance was taken over by the Nord-Trøndelag Public Roads Administration. The bridge cost NOK200 million. The bridge was opened by King Harald V on 19 December 1991, after he had taken the last ferry across the fjord. A monument, the King's Stone, bearing the signature of the king, is located at the resting place on the Mosvik side.|$|E

50|$|Taylor were {{nominated}} subcontractors to Trentham. They {{also had a}} contract with the employer (collateral contract) whereby they warranted due performance of the subcontract works so that the <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> should not become entitled to an extension of time. The employer paid Trentham only £7,526 against an interim certificate of £22,101. The amount withheld was the balance payable to the subcontractors after deduction of the <b>main</b> <b>contractor's</b> claim against them for delay. It was held that the employer was not entitled to withhold the money as the contract between the employer and the subcontractor was res inter alios acta.|$|R

They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
5|$|On 30 August 2011, CERA added Radio Network House to {{the list}} of {{buildings}} to be demolished. On 17 July 2012, the local Canterbury newspaper The Press reported that implosion of Radio Network House had been approved by CERA. The same day, a press conference was held, where representatives of the demolition companies involved and of CERA addressed the media. The <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> for the demolition was Naylor Love, who engaged Ceres New Zealand for the implosion. Ceres in turn partnered with Controlled Demolition, Inc., an American company based in Phoenix, Maryland, that has a track record of 9,000 implosions and is considered a world leader in the field. The implosion of Radio Network House was a test case, as the technique had not been applied in New Zealand before, and there are still many more tall buildings to be demolished in Christchurch. The implosion was challenging for Controlled Demolition, Inc., as New Zealand buildings are designed to withstand earthquake loading and thus have much more reinforcing in them than the buildings they usually deal with.|$|E
5|$|The entire works was {{upgraded}} between 1956 and 1969, in five distinct phases. The {{plan was}} announced in January 1956, and was expected to cost £1 million. The first phase was {{the construction of a}} filter pressing plant, for which the <b>main</b> <b>contractor</b> was Norwest Construction Co Ltd, while the actual presses and other plant were supplied by S. H. Johnson and Co Ltd. This phase was completed in 1962, and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 May 1963. The second phase consisted of a preliminary treatment plant, a storm sewage separation plant, and metering of the flows within the plant. This was completed in 1965. The third phase was split into two parts, which initially involved the building of new primary sedimentation tanks. Once these were operational in 1969, the old sedimentation tanks were converted to become temporary storm sewage tanks. This fourth phase was called phase 3b, and was completed in 1970. The final phase was the construction of a sludge incinerator, which was completed in 1969 and meant that the pressed sewage cake {{did not have to be}} taken to Thrybergh to be dumped.|$|E

40|$|In Hong Kong, it is {{a common}} {{practice}} for <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> to divide the projects into work packages by trade and sublet to sub-contractors. The interaction between sub-contractors and <b>main</b> <b>contractors</b> is an important determinant to the success of a project. However, there is an increasing complaint from subcontractors that they cannot perform to their full capacity because of poor site-coordination by <b>main</b> <b>contractors.</b> This paper aims to identify and categorize the common site coordination problems in Hong Kong Building Projects. Thirty-eight common site-coordination problems were identified through literature and they were classified into six main categories of problems: Construction document; Site management; Site layout; Equipment support; Material support; and Preparation of site area. A questionnaire survey was conducted to analyze the frequency of occurrence (F. I.) and degree of severity (S. I.) of the problems to the projects. The aggregated importance (IMP. I.), taking into account of the frequency of occurrence and degree of severity, of problems on sub-contractors&# 039; time performance were ranked. Frequent changes of construction works were found {{to be the most important}} site coordination problem. Most of the important problems caused the delay to subcontract works were primarily related to Construction document...|$|R
