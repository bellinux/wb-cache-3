30|$|Three {{different}} FRP sheet manufacturers {{were studied}} in the tests. Niemitz et al. (2010) used sheets fabricated from a single manufacturer (FRP system M) and (McGuirk and Breña 2012) used sheets from two different manufacturers (FRP systems F and S). Unidirectional carbon fiber sheets bonded formed by wet layup were used in all cases. The published tensile strength, rupture strain, and elastic modulus of a 1 -ply cured fiber-reinforced sheet from manufacturer M are 830  MPa, 1.67  %, and 49.3 GPa, respectively. Similarly the published tensile strength, rupture strain, and modulus of a 1 -ply cured sheet from <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> are 849  MPa, 70.5  GPa, and 1.12  %; and those for manufacturer F are 875  MPa, 72.4  GPa, and 1.2  %, respectively. These values are based on cured laminate thicknesses of 0.76  mm for manufacturer M, and 1  mm for <b>manufacturers</b> <b>S</b> and F.|$|R
