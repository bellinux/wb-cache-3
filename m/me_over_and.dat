2500|$|An {{admission}} that the tackle {{was in fact}} a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined £150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained {{in an interview that he}} had no regrets about the incident: [...] "My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> my attitude is an eye for an eye," [...] and said he would probably do the same thing again.|$|E
2500|$|Sister Pascalina later {{recalled}} that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned [...] "deaf ear {{to all his}} proposals". She later wrote, [...] "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced {{the course of the}} Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right." ...|$|E

60|$|My aunt {{kept her}} eye on <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> round the coffee-machine as I did so. She was greatly interested, and asked several elucidatory questions.|$|E

6000|$|Linnet {{flew down}} a little nearer to Peter. [...] "Look me over, Peter," [...] said he with {{twinkling}} eyes. [...] "Look <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> see if you can't tell for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>me</b> <b>over</b> gravely <b>and</b> critically, {{and succeeded}} in making me feel uncomfortable. Apparently, however, the {{examination}} ended in my favour, for the frown disappeared and she closed her book.|$|R
60|$|He smiled, <b>and</b> {{looked at}} <b>me</b> <b>over</b> his cigarette, <b>and</b> I laughed at his quiet {{exposure}} of my modest pretence.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's right, Bill. You see {{you ought}} to do it, not only to please your mother, but to please God. That's what my mother has told <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is {{not much}} to tell. It is a common story--at least, I believe so. She threw <b>me</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> the day before I should have married her, married another man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Celia, Celia, {{you will}} drive me mad {{if you go}} on in this way! The girl has told <b>me,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over, that she wishes him dismissed. Why do you think she doesn't?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was entirely}} satisfactory. My mental {{arithmetic}} had done me credit. Mr Abney beamed upon <b>me.</b> <b>Over</b> tea <b>and</b> muffins we became very friendly. In {{half an hour}} I heard more {{of the theory of}} school-mastering than I had dreamed existed.|$|R

6000|$|It {{made her}} {{infinitely}} proud and {{happy to hear}} me say this, and she thanked <b>me</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> over again for that closing remark, and her voice and eyes showed that she was touched. Presently she said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The shell knocked <b>me</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and</b> didn't hurt me a bit. I was {{a little}} stunned, and some dirt was thrown over me, and when I got up on my knees I saw Jewell lying about six yards off--and his legs were all smashed about. Ugh! Pulped! ...|$|E
