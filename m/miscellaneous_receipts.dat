40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal interagency contract service programs are being used {{in a wide variety}} of situations, from those in which a single agency provides limited contracting assistance to an approach in which the provider agency's contracting officer handles all aspects of the procurement. This increased use of interagency contracts is a result of reforms and legislation passed in the 1990 s, allowing agencies to streamline the acquisition process, operate more like businesses, and offer increasing numbers of services to other agencies. Most of the contract service programs GAO reviewed reported an excess of revenues over costs in at least one year between fiscal years 1999 and 2001. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance directs agencies with governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) or franchise fund programs to account for and recover fully allocated actual costs and to report on their financial results. Agencies are to identify all direct and indirect costs and charge fees to ordering agencies based on these costs. However, some GWAC programs have not identified or accurately reported the full cost of providing interagency contract services. OMB's guidance further directs that agencies return GWAC earnings to the <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>receipts</b> account of the U. S. Treasury's General Fund. However, this guidance conflicts with the operations of agencies' revolving funds, which were established by statutes that allow retention of excess revenues. The Federal Supply Schedules program has generated hefty earnings, largely because of the rapid growth of information technology sales. Rather than adjust the fee, however, the General Services Administration has used the earnings primarily to support its stock and fleet programs. However, the significant amount of earnings means that Federal Supply Schedules program customers are being consistently overcharged for the contract services they are buying. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Congress has {{determined}} that the safe use of nuclear materials for peaceful purposes is a legitimate and important national goal. It has entrusted the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) with the primary Federal responsibility for achieving that goal. The NRC`s mission, therefore, is to regulate the Nation`s civilian use of byproduct, source, and special nuclear materials to ensure adequate protection {{of public health and}} safety, to promote the common defense and security, and to protect the environment. The NRC`s FY 1998 budget requests new budget authority of $ 481, 300, 000 to be funded by two appropriations - one is the NRC`s Salaraies and Expenses appropriation for $ 476, 500, 000, and the other is NRC`s Office of Inspector General appropriation for $ 4, 800, 000. Of the funds appropriated to the NRC`s Salaries and Expenses, $ 17, 000, 000, shall be derived from the Nuclear Waste Fund and $ 2, 000, 000 shall be derived from general funds. The proposed FY 1998 appropriation legislation would also exempt the $ 2, 000, 000 for regulatory reviews and other assistance provided to the Department of Energy from the requirement that the NRC collect 100 percent of its budget from fees. The sums appropriated to the NRC`s Salaries and Expenses and NRC`s Office of Inspector General shall be reduced by the amount of revenues received during FY 1998 from licensing fees, inspection services, and other services and collections, so as to result in a final FY 1998 appropriation for the NRC of an estimated $ 19, 000, 000 - the amount appropriated from the Nuclear Waste Fund and from general funds.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Farm Business Survey (FBS) is conducted annually to collect business information from c. 2, 400 farms in England and Wales. The FBS provides information on the financial position and physical and economic performance of farm businesses, to inform policy decisions on matters affecting farm businesses and to enable analysis of impacts of policy options. It is intended to {{serve the needs of}} farmers, farming and land management interest groups, government (both national and European), government partners, and researchers. The primary objective of survey results is to contrast the performance or other business characteristics of different groupings of farm, such as between regions or other geographical or environmental designations, farm types, farm size, age or education of farmer etc. Up to and including the 2001 / 02 survey, FBS estimates were based on matching of the sample between two adjacent years. Farm weights were still calculated to present a matched sample however. From the 2002 / 03 survey onwards, matching between adjacent years was dropped altogether, and weights are now calculated for the full sample. The typology used to determine the FBS farm type classification was revised for 2009 onwards. The FBS typology is now based on standard outputs expressed in euros, with a minimum threshold of 25, 000 euro (irrespective of the SLR) for FBS eligibility. Between 2009 and 2011, FBS farm type classification has been based on 2007 standard output (SO) coefficients. From 2012, FBS farm type classification is based on 2010 SO coefficients. The change in typology has had an effect on the distribution of farms by farm type and income averages. Further information regarding the change in typology is available from the 'FBS Documents' section on the gov. uk Farm Business Survey – technical notes and guidance webpage. The Farm Business Survey is available under Special Licence access conditions. For further details on how to apply for access to the data, see the Access section below. August 2008 : the UKDA are currently awaiting deposit of section M data for survey years 2004 / 05 to 2006 / 07. Although a peripheral analysis of 'Section O' has been published on the Defra statistics website, Defra are not yet in a position to fully release these data. Sections P and R remain unpublished and are still not available for release. Main Topics : Variables cover general and physical farm characteristics, labour, crops (previous and current harvest year, set-aside, byproducts, forage and cultivations); <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>receipts,</b> livestock (dairy and beef cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry, miscellaneous livestock), variable and fixed costs, assets, investment, liabilities, income from diversified activities (integrated and semi-integrated into the farm business), farmer and spouse off-farm hours and incomes, and subsidies...|$|E
