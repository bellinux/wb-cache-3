60|$|The {{darkness}} thickened rapidly, {{at intervals}} shutting {{down on the}} land in a perceptible flap, like the wave of a wing. The customary close of day was accelerated by a simultaneous blurring of the air. With the fall of night had come a <b>mist</b> just <b>damp</b> enough to incommode, but not sufficient to saturate them. Countrymen as they were--born, as may be said, with only an open door {{between them and the}} four seasons--they regarded the mist but as an added obscuration, and ignored its humid quality.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{certainly}} {{want something}} of the sort, Harry. I thought it was heat {{that we were going}} to suffer from, but it seems just the other way. To judge from the temperature we might be in Scotland, and this <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> chills one to the bone." ...|$|R
60|$|To ourselves, {{sleeping}} and waking there, behind the rainbow, {{there is no}} beauty in the house; only a chill <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> in every room, and, over all, a haunting fear of the hour when the gilded clouds will melt away, and let us fall--somewhat heavily, no doubt--upon the hard world underneath.|$|R
60|$|Finding {{temporary}} shelter under various doorways, {{or against the}} dank walls of the houses, Blakeney set himself resolutely to a few hours' weary waiting. A thin, drizzly rain fell with unpleasant persistence, like a <b>damp</b> <b>mist,</b> and the thin blouse which he wore soon became wet through and clung hard and chilly to his shoulders.|$|R
60|$|The sun had set now, {{and with}} the {{gathering}} dusk a <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> descended on Montmartre. From the wall opposite, where the men sat playing cards, came occasional volleys of blasphemous oaths. Bibot was feeling much more like himself. He had half forgotten the incident of the six carriers, which had occurred nearly half an hour ago.|$|R
40|$|It was low tide, a <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> {{hovering}} in a grey landscape of fallen trees sinking into a muddy swamp. It was silent: a fallen creek exposing the limbs of dead trees. The metaphor of low tide echoed an emptiness and transience I found familiar in my work. Returning {{to the gallery}} space I began working directly onto the walls making a series of gestural marks suggestive of the environment...|$|R
60|$|When Ripple {{first began}} her airy journey, all {{was dark and}} dreary; heavy clouds lay piled like hills around her, and a cold mist filled the air but the Sunbeam, like a star, lit up the way, the leaf lay warmly round her, and the tireless wind went swiftly on. Higher and higher they floated up, still darker and darker grew the air, closer the <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> gathered, while the black clouds rolled and tossed, like great waves, to and fro.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} dark, and the <b>mist</b> was very <b>damp,</b> and the wind, {{what there was}} of it, very cold, {{especially}} as in his hurry he had forgotten to bring a thick ulster, and had nothing but a covert coat and a thin oil-skin to wear. Moreover, {{he could not see}} in the least where he was going, or do more than lay his course for the Sunk Rocks by means of the boat's compass, which he consulted from time to time by the help of a bull's-eye lantern.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} very dark. A <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> {{rose from the}} river, and the marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was {{piercing}} cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes {{was in no mood}} to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, {{in a corner of the}} cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.|$|R
60|$|The coachmen always {{change with}} the horses, and are usually as dirty as the coach. The first was dressed like a very shabby English baker; the second like a Russian peasant: for he wore a loose purple camlet robe, with a fur collar, tied round his waist with a parti-coloured worsted sash; grey trousers; light blue gloves: and a cap of bearskin. It had by this time come on to rain very heavily, {{and there was a}} cold <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> besides, which {{penetrated}} to the skin. I was glad {{to take advantage of a}} stoppage and get down to stretch my legs, shake the water off my great-coat, and swallow the usual anti-temperance recipe for keeping out the cold.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a miserable}} day; chilly and raw; a <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> falling; {{and the trees}} in that {{northern}} region quite bare and wintry. Whenever the train halted, I listened for the roar; and was constantly straining my eyes in the direction where I knew the Falls must be, from seeing the river rolling on towards them; every moment expecting to behold the spray. Within {{a few minutes of}} our stopping, not before, I saw two great white clouds rising up slowly and majestically from the depths of the earth. That was all. At length we alighted: and then for the first time, I heard the mighty rush of water, and felt the ground tremble underneath my feet.|$|R
6000|$|To {{the making}} of man go all things, even to the {{instincts}} of the clinging vine. We fling our tendrils round what is the nearest castle-keep or pig-stye wall, rain and sunshine fastening them but firmer. Dying Sir Walter Scott--do you remember?--hastening home from Italy, fearful lest {{he might not be}} in time to breathe again the <b>damp</b> <b>mists</b> of the barren hills. An ancient dame I knew, they had carried her from her attic in slumland that she might be fanned by the sea breezes, and the poor old soul lay pining for what she called her [...] "home." [...] Wife, mother, widow, she had lived there till the alley's reek smelt good to her nostrils, till its riot was the voices of her people. Who shall understand us save He who fashioned us? ...|$|R
60|$|If {{the morning}} {{had been made}} to order, it couldn't have been better adapted to the purpose. They never showed a better fog in London on Lord Mayor's day, than enwrapped the town of Mudfog on that eventful occasion. It had risen slowly and surely from the green and {{stagnant}} water with the first light of morning, until it reached a little above the lamp-post tops; and there it had stopped, with a sleepy, sluggish obstinacy, which bade defiance to the sun, who had got up very blood-shot about the eyes, {{as if he had been}} at a drinking-party over-night, and was doing his day's work with the worst possible grace. The thick <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> hung over the town like a huge gauze curtain. All was dim and dismal. The church steeples had bidden a temporary adieu to the world below; and every object of lesser importance--houses, barns, hedges, trees, and barges--had all taken the veil.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not fear}} what might come after death," [...] {{went on the}} diary, [...] "but I did fear the act of death. I was so lonely, and the dim waters looked so cold; the brown {{shoulders}} of the rocks which showed now and again through the surges, so cruel. To be dashed by those cold waters upon those iron rocks till the life was slowly ground out of my body! And my father--the thought of him tormented my mind. Was he dead, or had he deserted me? The last seemed quite impossible, for it would have supposed him a coward, and I was sure that he would rather die than leave me; therefore, as I feared, the first must be true. I was afraid, and I was wretched, and I said my prayers and cried a little, while the cold struck me through the red cloak, and the <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> made me shiver.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{close-up}} of a specimen of a California redwood leaf and branch, ca. 1925. The branch contains many stems with needlelike leaves. Some of the seeds are scattered apart and some remain clustered. Several leaves and seeds have been edited out from the original image. On neutral background.; "The California Coast Redwood claims the title of 'tallest' tree on Earth at over 350 feet - technically speaking, the Sequoia of the Sierra Nevada is larger with a considerably wider but slightly shorter trunk. As well as great height the Redwoods have great age, some as old as 2, 000 years. At this age a single tree can weigh 500 tons. This majesty doesn't come without fragility however. The Redwood Tree requires plenty of rain and relies on holding clouds of <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> in the high canopy for an ample water supply. Also,the root system of these giant trees is surprisingly shallow with trees in dense groves supporting eachother with intertwining roots. Among the Redwoods {{are a number of}} other species that make up the complete ecosystem picture. Lush ferns and mosses enjoy the rainforest atmosphere, and huckleberries, sorrel and other pine trees are common. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the place through which he walked in the morning, was not calculated to raise {{the spirits of the}} young surgeon, or to dispel any feeling of anxiety or depression which the singular kind of visit he was about to make, had awakened. Striking off from the high road, his way lay across a marshy common, through irregular lanes, with here and there a ruinous and dismantled cottage fast falling to pieces with decay and neglect. A stunted tree, or pool of stagnant water, roused into a sluggish action by the heavy rain of the preceding night, skirted the path occasionally; and, now and then, a miserable patch of garden-ground, with a few old boards knocked together for a summer-house, and old palings imperfectly mended with stakes pilfered from the neighbouring hedges, bore testimony, at once to the poverty of the inhabitants, and the little scruple they entertained in appropriating the property of other people to their own use. Occasionally, a filthy-looking woman would make her appearance from the door of a dirty house, to empty the contents of some cooking utensil into the gutter in front, or to scream after a little slip-shod girl, who had contrived to stagger a few yards from the door under the weight of a sallow infant almost as big as herself; but, scarcely anything was stirring around: and so much of the prospect as could be faintly traced through the cold <b>damp</b> <b>mist</b> which hung heavily over it, presented a lonely and dreary appearance perfectly in keeping with the objects we have described.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Neither {{thinking}} nor fog conduced {{to seeing}} where I was going; {{and when my}} ankle began to give out, and I was going to turn, I ran into a hedge, which, looming through the mist, I had been taking for a fine range of distant mountains--rather my {{way of dealing with}} other objects. Being without a horse on whose neck to lay the reins, I could only coast the hedge, hoping it might lead me back to Oakstead Park, which I had abandoned in my craving for space and dread of being dogged by the Ensign. But the treacherous hedge led me nowhere but to a horsepond; and when I had struggled out of the adjacent mire, and attained a rising ground, I could only see about four yards square of bare down, all the rest being grey fog. Altogether, the scene was worth something. I heard what I thought the tinkling of a sheep bell through the cloud, which dulled the sound like cotton wool; I pursued the call, when anon, the veil began to grow thin, and revealed, looking just like a transparency, a glimpse of a little village in a valley almost under my feet, trees, river, church-spire and all, and the bell became clearer, and showed me what kind of flock it was meant for. I turned that way, and had just found a path leading down the steep, when down closed the cloud--a natural dissolving view--leaving me wondering whether it had been mirage or imagination, till presently, the curtain drew up in earnest. Out came, not merely form, but colour, as I have seen a camera clear itself--blue sky, purple hills, russet and orange woods, a great elm green picked out with yellow, a mass of brown oaks, a scarlet maple, a beech grove, skirting a brilliant water meadow, with a most reflective stream running through it, and giving occasion for a single arched bridge, and a water mill, with a wheel draperied with white foam; two swans disporting on the water (I would not declare they were not geese), a few cottony flakes of <b>mist</b> hanging over <b>damp</b> corners, the hill rising green, with the bright whitewashed cottages of this district, on the side a rich, red, sandstone-coloured church, late architecture, tower rather mouldering--all the more picturesque; churchyard, all white headstones and ochreous sheep, surmounted by a mushroom-shaped dark yew tree, railed in with intensely white rails, the whole glowing in the parting coup-de-soleil of a wet day, every tear of every leaf glistening, and everything indescribably lustrous. It is a picture that one's mental photograph ought to stamp for life, and the cheering and interest it gave, no one but you can understand. I wished for you, I know. It looks so poor in words.|$|R
