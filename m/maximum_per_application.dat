Aquatic {{exposure}} modeling for vinclozolin and 3, 5 -DCA In {{order to}} explore uncertainties {{associated with the}} total residue approach and relative concentrations of vinclozolin and 3, 5 -DCA, separate aquatic exposure modeling was conducted for vinclozolin and for 3, 5 -DCA. These efforts and results are described below. D. 1. Vinclozolin Model Inputs The appropriate chemical-specific PRZM input parameters are selected from reviewed physical, chemical and environmental fate data submitted by the registrant (Error! Reference source not found. and Error! Reference source not found.) and in accordance with EFED water model input parameter selection guidance (U. S. EPA 2002). The input parameters for relevant {{to the fate of}} vinclozolin used in PRZM and EXAMS are in Table D. 1. <b>Application</b> methods, <b>maximum</b> rates <b>per</b> <b>application</b> and <b>maximum</b> number of <b>applications</b> <b>per</b> year are based on current label directions for use of vinclozolin on turf grass (Table D. 2). The application date is not explicitly stated on the label. In order to account for differences in EECs that can be attributed to application timing, applications were simulated {{on the second day of}} each month of the year. The selection of the second day of the year was arbitrary. Table D. 1. PRZM/EXAMS input parameters relevant to the fate of vinclozolin...|$|R

40|$|The {{strength}} of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions {{may be more}} stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator–prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments {{were used to determine}} <b>maximum</b> <b>per</b> capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that <b>maximum</b> <b>per</b> capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted <b>maximum</b> <b>per</b> capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities...|$|R
