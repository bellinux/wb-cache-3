50|$|For the designer, while {{variable}} thicknesses are possible, {{a process}} called stop rotation is required. This process is limited in that only {{one side of the}} mold may be thicker than the others. After the mold is rotated and all the surfaces are sufficiently coated with the <b>melt-flow,</b> the rotation stops and the <b>melt-flow</b> is allowed to pool {{at the bottom of the}} mold cavity.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} is the <b>melt-flow</b> of materials. Certain materials, such as nylon, will require larger radii than other materials. Additionally, the stiffness {{of the set}} material may be a factor. More structural and strengthening measures may be required when a flimsy material is used.|$|E
50|$|Rotational molding excels at {{producing}} hollow parts. However, {{care must}} be taken when this is done. When the depth of the recess is greater than the width there may be problems with even heating and cooling. Additionally, enough room must be left between the parallel walls to allow for the <b>melt-flow</b> to move properly throughout the mold. Otherwise webbing may occur. A desirable parallel wall scenario would have a gap at least three times the nominal wall thickness, with five times the nominal wall thickness being optimal. Sharp corners for parallel walls must also be considered. With angles of less than 45° bridging, webbing, and voids may occur.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{usefulness of}} a coating system consisting of an underlying polyphenylenesulfide (PPS) layer and top polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) -blended PPS layer as low friction, water repellent, anti-corrosion barrier film for carbon steel steam separators in geothermal power plants. The experiments {{were designed to}} obtain information on kinetic coefficient of friction, surface free energy, hydrothermal oxidation, alteration of molecular structure, thermal stability, and corrosion protection of the coating after immersing the coated carbon steel coupons for up to 35 days in CO{sub 2 }-laden brine at 300 C. The superficial layer of the assembled coating was occupied by PTFE self-segregated from PPS during the <b>melt-flowing</b> process of this blend polymer; it conferred an outstanding slipperiness and water repellent properties because of its low friction and surface free energy. However, PTFE underwent hydrothermal oxidation in hot brine, transforming its molecular structure into an alkylated polyfluorocarboxylate salt complex linked to Na. Although such molecular transformation increased the friction and surface free energy, and also impaired the thermal stability of PTFE, the top PTFE-rich PPS layer significantly contributed to preventing the permeation of moisture and corrosive electrolytes through the coating film, so mitigating the corrosion of carbon steel...|$|R
5000|$|In plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation, higher potentials are applied. For example, in {{the plasma}} electrolytic oxidation of aluminum, at least 200 V must be applied. This locally exceeds the dielectric breakdown {{potential of the}} growing oxide film, and discharges occur. These discharges result in localized plasma reactions, with conditions of high temperature and pressure which modify the growing oxide. Processes include melting, <b>melt-flow,</b> re-solidification, sintering and densification of the growing oxide. One {{of the most significant}} effects, is that the oxide is partially converted from amorphous alumina into crystalline forms such as corundum (α-Al2O3) which is much harder. [...] As a result, mechanical properties such as wear resistance and toughness are enhanced.|$|E
50|$|Molds (or tooling) {{are either}} {{fabricated}} from welded sheet steel or cast. The fabrication method is often driven by part size and complexity; most intricate parts are likely {{made out of}} cast tooling. Molds are typically manufactured from stainless steel or aluminum. Aluminum molds are usually much thicker than an equivalent steel mold, {{as it is a}} softer metal. This thickness does not affect cycle times significantly since aluminum's thermal conductivity is many times greater than steel. Due to the need to develop a model prior to casting, cast molds tend to have additional costs associated with the manufacturing of the tooling, whereas fabricated steel or aluminum molds, particularly when used for less complex parts, are less expensive. However, some molds contain both aluminum and steel. This allows for variable thicknesses in the walls of the product. While this process is not as precise as injection molding, it does provide the designer with more options. The aluminum addition to the steel provides more heat capacity, causing the <b>melt-flow</b> to stay in a fluid state for a longer period.|$|E

Based on the theory of relaxation oscillations, a set of two coupled first-order ordinary differential equations, relating state variables—pressure and flow rate—provides sufficient degrees of freedom to describe all the relevant flow regimes in shear flow. By means of this model, the appearance of extrudate distortions can be {{expressed in terms of}} pressure and output fluctuations without the need to invoke a microscopic theory.

40|$|Injection molding, an {{important}} polymer processing technique, {{is a complex}} cyclic process, during which material properties, machine variables and process variables {{interact with each other}} in determining the final product quality. Among injection molding, filling, packing-holding, and cooling are the most important phases. In the filling phase, melt-front rate plays a particularly important role in determining the part quality. Prior researches recommend a constant melt-front rate during the mold filling for producing uniform parts. However, it was practically difficult to measure the melt-front rate online. A novel measurement device, a capacitive transducer, has been proposed and developed by Gao’s research group. It has been shown that this transducer is effective in the online and continuous measurement of <b>melt-flow</b> position in mold cavity, the detection of start and end of filling, V/P transfer point, gate freezing time, and the quality monitoring. Therefore this sensor provides a basis for the control of the in-mold melt-front rate.

Several different advanced control algorithms, including generalized predictive control (GPC), iterative learning control (ILC) and generalized 2 D model predictive iterative learning control (2 D-GPILC) are designed, and tested with different mold inserts.

The rheological properties of High-Yield Pulp (HYP) reinforced bio-based Nylon 11 (Polyamide 11) (PA 11) composite (HYP/PA 11) were investigated using a capillary rheometer.

The morphology of the extrudates and the size and distribution of domains were examined, PP/NBR blends show pseudoplastic behaviour, which is evidenced by the decrease in viscosity with increasing shear rate. The melt viscosity of these blends increased with increasing nitrile rubber concentration and shows negative deviation from the theoretically predicted values. Compatibilization of the blends with phenolic-modified polypropylene (Ph-PP) increases the melt viscosity at low concentrations of Ph-PP. The {{rheological behaviour}} of PP/BR blends was correlated with the blend morphology. Dynamic vulcanization has a decreasing effect on die swell values.

This paper studied the influences of shielding gas compositions on the transport phenomena in the metal domain during gas metal arc welding (GMAW). A comprehensive model was developed to simulate the time-dependent processes of the electrode melting; the droplet formation, detachment, transfer and impingement onto the workpiece; the weld pool dynamics and bead formation and their transient coupling with the arc plasma. The transient <b>melt-flow</b> velocity and temperature distributions in the metal shielded by pure argon and argon-helium mixtures with various mixing ratios are presented. It is predicted that the increase of helium content and the resulting arc contraction induce an upward electromagnetic force at the bottom of the droplet to sustain the droplet at the electrode tip. As a result, the more oblate droplet and the longer droplet formation time are produced. The behaviors of the predicted droplet shape and detachment frequency are in agreement with the published results.
