40|$|New mutant yeasts {{resistant}} to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and <b>mikamycin</b> were isolated. They are mitochondrial mutants, characterized by several criteria as cytoplasmically determined. Biochemical studies show that amino acid incorporation into protein in vitro by mitochondria isolated from cells resistant or sensitive to <b>mikamycin</b> or chloramphenicol is inhibited by these antibiotics. Although aerobically-grown resistant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are not affected by <b>mikamycin</b> or chloramphenicol, {{it is found that}} the mitochondrial protein-synthesizing system of anaerobically grown cells is inhibited in vivo. Cross resistance among the antibiotics chloramphenicol, <b>mikamycin,</b> erythromycin, lincomycin, carbomycin, and spiramycin is reported. All erythromycin resistant mutants, unlike the others, are {{resistant to}} erythromycin in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that some of the cytoplasmic mutations (<b>mikamycin</b> and chloramphenicol resistance) are expressed at the mitochondrial membrane, whereas others (erythromycin resistance) possibly reflect changes in mitochondrial ribosomal proteins. We further suggest that conformational changes, either in the membranes or ribosomes, are likely to account for the observed antibiotic cross resistances...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{mutations}} {{for resistance}} to various antibiotics (erythromycin, chloramphenicol, spiramycin, <b>mikamycin)</b> {{have been obtained}} in Paramecium aurelia and their properties are reviewed. Using these mitochondrial markers, the interactions between nucleus and mitochondria have been studied in two ways: by microinjection of mitochondria from one stock or species into other stocks and species of P. aurelia and by a genetic study of a nuclear mutation affecting mitochondrial multiplication. Both types of experiments show: (1) that there may exist incompatibility between a given type of mitochondria and the cell into which they are introduced and (2) that through multiplication in the host cell, mitochondrial properties can be modified. The possible basis for incompatibility and host-induced modifications is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeventy-five {{actinomycete}} isolates {{were isolated}} from different soil samples collected from different localities in Egypt. One of the actinomycete culture AZ-SH- 29 from three cultures {{was found to}} produce a wide spectrum antimicrobial agent. The actinomycete isolate AZ-SH- 29 matches with Streptomyces ramulosus in the morphological, physiological, and biochemical characters. Thus, it was given the suggested name Streptomyces ramulosus-AZ-SH- 29. The parameters controlling the biosynthetic process of the antimicrobial agent formation including; different pH values, different temperatures, different incubation period, and different carbon and nitrogen sources, were fully investigated. The active metabolite was extracted using ethyl acetate (1 : 1, v/v) at pH 7. 0. The separation of the active ingredient and its purification were performed using column chromatography (CC) technique. The physico-chemical characteristics of the purified antimicrobial agent have been investigated. This analysis indicates a suggested imperical formula of C 20 H 25 N 2 O 5. The minimum inhibition concentrations “MICs” of the purified antibiotic and antiviral test were also determined. The purified antimicrobial agent was suggestive of being belonging to Depsipeptide (<b>Mikamycin)</b> group (Vernamycin-A antibiotic) produced by Streptomyces ramulosus, AZ-SH- 29...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} oligomycin {{resistant}} mutants has been isolated following u. v. irradiation. The phenotypic and genotypic properties of these mutants, which show {{high levels of}} resistance to oligomycin and rutamycin, have been investigated and, {{on the basis of}} these results, it has been possible to divide the mutants into two main classes, class I and class II. Class I Mutants of this class show low levels of cross resistance (increases of two-to-four-fold) to various uncouplers such as TTFB, 1799 and chloro CCP, to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation like aurovertin and triethyltin, to the inhibitor of electron transport, antimycin A, and protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide, <b>mikamycin,</b> chloramphenicol and erythromycin. The mutants are apparently, however, resistant to neither DNP nor octylDNP. In a high percentage of the mutants, exposure to low temperatures (20 ºC) resulted in the loss of the primary resistance to oligomycin and rutamycin, though the secondary cross resistances were apparently unaffected. No effect of either high or low temperatures on either the fermentable or non-fermentable growth of these mutants were apparent. No alteration in the growth rate of the majority of the strains or in their appearance on electron microscopic examination was detected, though their growth yield is 15 – 20...|$|E
40|$|Phylogenetic {{differences}} between the mitochondrial protein synthesising systems of yeast and that of higher organisms have been studied using as probes a variety of antibiotics known to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. While most of the experiments were performed on mammalian mitochondria (rat liver, kidney, heart and brain) some characteristics of trout liver, chick brain, potato, sweet potato and corn root mitochondria were also investigated. It was confirmed that intact and sonicated mitochondria from several rat tissues all had a restricted antibiotic sensitivity spectrum in comparison to that of yeast mitochondria, being resistant to the 50 S acting antibiotics erythromycin, oleandomycin, vernamycin B and virideogrisein and to paromomycin, neomycin, spectinomycin and kasugamycin, which are 30 S binding antibiotics. Protein synthesis by rat liver mitochondria {{was found to be}} inhibited by chloramphenicol, carbomycin, spiramycin, <b>mikamycin</b> complex, vernamycin A, thiostrepton and sparsomycin - all of which inhibit reactions of the large subunit of bacterial ribosomes - and also by pactamycin, which affects the smaller subunit. In view of a report which appeared early in the course of these experiments that the phylogenetic difference in sensitivity to erythromycin and lincomycin results from a selective permeability barrier to these antibiotics in rat liver mitochondria, an extensive study was made of the effects of erythromycin, lincomycin and paromomycin under a variety of experimental conditions designed to overcome any permeability barrier. This included an intensive study of the access of antibiotics to the mitochondrial matrix based on the observation that high concentrations of paromomycin inhibited respiration by fragmented mitochondria but not that by intact mitochondria. When the effects of the three antibiotics on mitochondrial protein synthesis were measured under a variety of conditions (several different hypotonic swelling and digitonin treatment procedures, including conditions under which paromomycin at least could be demonstrated to have access to the mitochondrial matrix) none of the antibiotics inhibited 14 C-leucine incorporation when the antibiotic concentration was less than 250 ~g/ml and when incorporation depended on exogenously supplied ATP. Definitive proof of the access of erythromycin and lincomycin to the mitochondrial ribosome under conditions of protein synthesis was achived by showing that these two antibiotics competed with other antibiotics for binding sites on the mitochondrial ribosome. Both erythromycin and lincomycin reduced the level of inhibition of 14 c-leucine incorporation obtained with any given concentration of either carbomycin or vernamycin A without themselves inhibiting protein synthesis, demonstrating that erythromycin and lincomycin can bind to the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome in a manner which excludes simultaneous binding of carbomycin or vernamycin A. The binding of erythromycin and carbomycin was competitive and reversible, depending on the relative concentrations of the two drugs but being independent of the order in which they were added. Extension of the antibiotic sensitivity studies to other than mammalian mitochondria showed that protein synthesis by mitochondria from a variety of higher organisms was inhibited by a similarly restricted range of antibiotics. There is thus a very clear and strong case for the existence of phylogenetic {{differences between}} the mitochondria of higher organisms and the lower eukaryotes (as represented by yeast). Another aspect of mitochondrial function studied was the ability of the membrane to influence the activity of the ribosome. The possibility of ribosome-membrane interactions in mitochondria and the physical association of the mitochondrial ribosome with the membrane was raised by investigators studying mitochondriogenesis in this laboratory. Evidence identifying the majority of mitochondrial ribosomes as being membrane-bound has been obtained by studying the effects of temperature on the kinetics of 14 c-leucine incorporation. Initial studies using cytoplasmic ribosomes as a model system showed that the kinetics of protein synthesis by membrane-bound ribosomes (rough endoplasmic reticulum) gave non-linear Arrhenius plots, with a marked discontinuity at a characteristic temperature (22 °), below which a second and higher Arrhenius activation energy was found. This is not a characteristic of all ribosomes, as free ribosomes obeyed the predictions of the Arrhenius equation and gave a simple linear plot. The importance of the membrane-ribosome association in the genesis of the discontinuity was demonstrated in "reconstitution" experiments. Studies on the effects of temperature on the kinetics of mitochondrial protein synthesis revealed Arrhenius plots similar to those for rough endoplasmic reticulum, with a discontinuity at a characteristic temperature for a poikilotherm (rat liver: 23 °) and for temperature sensitive plants (sweet potato, corn: 10 - 13 °) but not for the temperature insensitive potato. These results correlate with the nature of the membrane lipids, and it is therefore concluded that the mitochondrial ribosome is in association with the inner mitochondrial membrane in a manner analogous to the association of the ribosomes and membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum...|$|E
