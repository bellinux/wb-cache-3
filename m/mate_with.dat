5|$|After mating, {{the female}} washes her vulva thoroughly. If a male {{attempts}} to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> her at this point, the female will attack him. After about 20 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.|$|E
40|$|If <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> an {{inferior}} male has high fitness costs, females {{may try to}} avoid <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> these males. Alternatively, females may accept {{an inferior}} male to ensure they have obtained at least one mate, and/or to avoid the costs of resisting these males. We hypothesized that females compensate for <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> an inferior male by remating. We tested this hypothesis by measuring remating propensity in females that had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> an old, multiply-mated male, a 9 -day-old virgin male, or a young, virgin male. Females {{were more likely to}} remate when they had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> multiply-mated males than when they had <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> a 9 -day-old or young virgin male. We discuss the observed mating behavior by females in terms of sexual selection for multiple mating...|$|R
50|$|Assortative mating {{in humans}} {{has been widely}} {{observed}} and studied, and {{can be broken down}} into two types of human assortative mating. These are genetic assortative mating, or assortative <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> <b>mate</b> choice based on genetic type and phenotypical expression, and social assortative mating, or assortative <b>mating</b> <b>with</b> <b>mate</b> choice based on social, cultural, and other societal factors.|$|R

5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the female redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{polyandry}} in the ruff {{is the highest}} known for any avian lekking species and for any shorebird. More than half of female ruffs <b>mate</b> <b>with,</b> and have clutches fertilised by, more than one male, and individual females <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> males of both main behavioural morphs more often than expected by chance. In lekking species, females can choose mates without risking the loss of support from males in nesting and rearing chicks, since the males take no part in raising the brood anyway. In the absence of this cost, if polyandry is advantageous, it {{would be expected to}} occur at a higher rate in lekking than among pair-bonded species.|$|E
50|$|Dung beetles {{who have}} {{selected}} <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> better genetics {{tend to have}} offspring that survive longer and are more able to reproduce than {{those that do not}} pick <b>mates</b> <b>with</b> genetic quality. This suggests that carefully choosing a mate is beneficial.|$|R
50|$|Females who <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> virgin {{males were}} less likely to suffer genital damage {{compared}} to those who <b>mated</b> <b>with</b> sexually experienced males. It was suggested that factors contributing to male virgins being less harmful were ejaculate size and the amount of sperm contained.|$|R

5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> more than one male when she is in heat, {{with the result that}} different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E
5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and in the water around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E

5|$|In feral sheep, rams may fight {{during the}} rut to {{determine}} which individuals may <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch. In some species males <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> newly molted females, which are too weak to be {{dangerous}} to the males. Most spiders live for only one to two years, although some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairy-wrens, {{the superb}} fairy-wren is notable for several {{peculiar}} behavioural characteristics; {{the birds are}} socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous, meaning that although they form pairs between one male and one female, each partner will <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display.|$|E

5|$|Most ants are univoltine, {{producing}} {{a new generation}} each year. During the species-specific breeding period, new reproductives, females, and winged males leave the colony in {{what is called a}} nuptial flight. The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid. Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests. Males typically take flight before the females. Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground, for example, a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge. Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow. Males will mount females in the air, but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground. Females of some species <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> just one male but in others they may <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> as many as ten or more different males, storing the sperm in their spermathecae.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are {{perfectly}} monogamous, {{meaning that they}} mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein {{one or a few}} males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|The species Gryllus bimaculatus {{exhibits}} {{the reproductive}} pattern of polyandry. This sexual selective pattern increases the overall fitness {{of the species}} and promotes genetic variation. The females select and <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> multiple viable sperm donors and exhibit a distinct preference for novel mates.|$|E

5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their reproductive status. After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> them. However, a male that attempts to <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a direct}} {{competition}} between males to win {{the attention of the}} females in salamanders and newts, with elaborate courtship displays to keep the female's attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to <b>mate</b> <b>with.</b> Some species store sperm through long breeding seasons, as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm.|$|E
5|$|While breathing, {{they hold}} just their {{nostrils}} above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so. Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, {{but have been}} known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically <b>mate</b> <b>with</b> more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating. Sirenians are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E
