Soil water characterisation was assessed by measuring soil water content and soil water potential in a draining profile of sandy and loamy soils. Mercury manometers and Neutron probe meter were connected to a 1. 2 m high metal-reinforced container filled with soil samples, to simultaneously measure soil water potential and volumetric water content, respectively. Soil water contents (SWC) were found to decrease monotonically with time, with a rapid decrease in the first 50 hrs of free drainage in both soils. Sandy soil was more prone to huge losses of water than loamy soil attributed to numerous large drainable pores in sandy soil. An appreciable difference of SWC in the upper layer (SWC = 0. 22 cm 3 /cm 3) and the bottom layer (SWC = 0. 35 cm 3 /cm 3), {{in the case of}} loamy soil was attributable to its poor drainage properties.

40|$|Investigations of the {{kinetics}} {{of molecular}} transfer across the liquid/gas interface {{and the effect}} of a molecular monolayer are of considerable interest as a model for certain biological and environmental processes. In this work, a combined scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) -Langmuir trough technique has been used to investigate the effect of the chemical character and mechanical compression of molecular monolayers on the rate of oxygen transfer across the air/water (A/W) interface. Specifically, monolayers comprising the fatty alcohol 1 -octadecanol and the phospholipid L-alpha-dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid were considered. A <b>mercury</b> hemispherical microelectrode <b>probe</b> has been used to measure interfacial kinetics in SECM, and a numerical model has been developed for mass transport in this configuration to allow quantitative analysis of experimental data. The results obtained suggest that, for both monolayers, the oxygen-transfer rate across the interface decreased compared to that across the clean interface, with the blocking effect becoming more pronounced as the surface pressure of the monolayer increased. A simple energy-barrier model was used successfully to interpret the dependence of the rate constant of oxygen transfer on the surface pressure.

The large gyroradius implies that kinetic effects are important and thus must be taken into account. We employ global ion hybrid kinetic simulations to obtain a 2 D model of Mercury’s magnetosphere. This code treats ions as particles and follows the full trajectory while electrons act as a charge neutralizing fluid. The planet is treated as the perfect conductor placed in the streaming solar wind to form a quasi steady state of the magnetosphere. By placing a virtual probe in the simulation domain we obtain time series of the plasma parameters which can be compared to the observations by the MESSENGER spacecraft.

40|$|Buffer leakage is an {{important}} parasitic loss mechanism in AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and hence various methods are employed to grow semi-insulating buffer layers. Quantification of carrier concentration in such buffers using conventional capacitance based profiling techniques is challenging due to their fully depleted nature even at zero bias voltages. We provide a simple and effective model to extract carrier concentrations in fully depleted GaN films using capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements. Extensive <b>mercury</b> <b>probe</b> C-V profiling has been performed on GaN films of differing thicknesses and doping levels in order to validate this model. Carrier concentrations as extracted from both the conventional C-V technique for partially depleted films having the same doping concentration, and Hall measurements show excellent agreement with those predicted by the proposed model thus establishing the utility of this technique.

40|$|Mercury {{resistance}} plasmids were exogenously isolated, i. e., recovered after {{transfer to}} a model recipient bacterium, from marine air-water interface, bulk water, and biofilm communities during incubation in artificial seawater without added nutrients. Ninety-five plasmids from different environments were classified by restriction endonuclease digestion, and 12 different structural plasmid groups were revealed. The plasmid types isolated from different habitats and from different sampling occasions showed little similarity to each other based on their restriction endonuclease patterns, indicating high variation and possibly a low transfer between microhabitats and/or a different composition of the microbial communities at different sites and times. With another approach in which probes derived {{from one of the}} isolated plasmids and a <b>mercury</b> resistance (mer) <b>probe</b> from Tn 501 were used, similarities between plasmids from several different groups were found. The plasmids were further tested for their incompatibility by use of the collection of inc/rep probes (B/O, com 9, FI, FII, HI 1, HI 2, I 1, L/M, N, P, Q, U, W, Y) described by Couturier et al. (M. F. Couturier, P. Bex, L. Bergquist, and W. K. Maas, Microbiol. Rev. 52 : 375 - 395, 1988). Hybridizations did not reveal any identity between the 12 plasmid groups and any of the inc/rep probes tested. The results indicate that plasmids isolated from different marine habitats have replication and/or incompatibility systems that are different from the well-characterized plasmids that are commonly used in plasmid biology. This shows the need for the use of more relevant plasmids in studies of plasmid activity in the environment and development of new inc/rep probes for their characterization...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} period of the Slichter mode (vibrational mode of the inner core of a planet) of Mercury in {{relation}} to its interior structure and assess the possibility to observe this mode with the probes MESSENGER and BepiColombo. The high mean density of Mercury compared to the other terrestrial planets is thought to imply that the core of Mercury is relatively much larger than the core of the other terrestrial planets of the solar system. Observations of periodic changes in Mercury’s spin rate have shown that at least the outer part of Mercury’s core is liquid [4] and the global magnetic field (observed by Mariner 10 in 1974 and confirmed by MESSENGER[1]), if due to a hydrodynamo, can be considered as evidence of the presence of a growing inner core. Thanks to its possibly larger inner core (due to its larger core), the Slichter modes of Mercury could be easier to detect than the Slichter modes of the Earth. Using the equation of conservation of momentum of the planet and the Newton’s second law for the inner core, Grinfeld and Wisdom [2] have developed a methodology for the determination of {{the period of}} the polar Slichter modes of a planetary interior consisting of three homogeneous layers. We generalized this approach to models with an arbitrary but finite number of layers. We constructed a large set of interior structure models of Mercury and calculated Slichter mode period of Mercury for these models. Periods obtained ranges from a few hours to more than hundred hours with increasing inner core size. Periods depend mainly {{on the size of the}} inner core (see Figure 1). We then assessed whether Slichter modes of Mercury can be detected by spacecraft. As the center of mass of Mercury remains fixed during a Slichter mode oscillation, gravity anomalies due to this mode cannot be measured from orbit. However, the Slichter modes of Mercury could be detected from orbit by measuring the motion of the mantle of Mercury. For our models with the largest inner cores, the displacement of the inner core can be as small as ten meters and still allows detection of the Slichter modes by the probe BepiColombo (see Figure 2). We studied the excitation of the Slichter mode of Mercury by an impact by a meteoroid. Assuming that the Slichter mode is the only excited mode, a meteoroid with a mass of at least 1010 kg (or a radius of at least 100 m) is required to be detected by Bepi-Colombo. However, observation of the Slichter mode of Mercury by BepiColombo would require a fortunate recent impact since the estimated magnetic damping time of the mode is well below the average time between impacts of at least this size (about 100 My, according to [3]). In order to study the Slichter modes of Mercury, we have developed models of the interior structure of Mercury. The Slichter mode period obtained ranges from a few hours to more than 100 hours and depends strongly on the properties of Mercury’s core. We have studied the possible observation of Slichter modes of <b>Mercury</b> by the <b>probes</b> MESSENGER and BepiColombo by measuring the motion of the mantle of Mercury using an altimeter. We have shown that the observation of the Slichter mode of Mercury is possible if the inner core is very large and is excited to an amplitude of the order or greater than ten meters. On average, such a collision occurs once every 100 My, which is much larger than the dissipation time of the Slichter mode, therefore requiring a recent impact. [1] Anderson, B. J., Acuña, M.

Such films can be produced using plasma-sputtering processes and permit the realization of a large set of high-performance components, such as capacitors, active devices, sensors, and protective coatings. The electrical properties of the oxide films, which have a thickness of less than 1 μm, are difficult to measure since very high resistances (on the order of gigaohms) and small capacitances (on the order of picofarads) are expected for contact areas smaller than 1 mm 2. The measurement system and the procedures described in this paper represent an alternative solution to the commercial devices, which usually employ a <b>mercury</b> <b>probe</b> for performing the contact with the specimen under characterization. Furthermore, the proposed system can be used not only to estimate the electrical properties of a single point but to evaluate the uniformity of oxide films on large specimens as well.

40|$|Two {{processes}} to repair plasma damaged porous ultra low- SiOCH dielectric were studied. One process {{is based on}} a spin on approach in combination with UV radiation. The second process uses a vapor phase reaction chamber, while the silylation reaction is thermally activated. Comparison of both processes was achieved by applying four different silylation agents. After processing of blanket wafers, the restoration performance was characterized by different analytical techniques like Fourier transformed infrared and Auger electron spectroscopy as well as contact angle and <b>mercury</b> <b>probe</b> measurements. Electrical tests on patterned wafers were carried out only for the spin on UV process. Both repair approaches show variable restoration performance, while the vapor phase process seems to be favorable. It is suggested that the reason for this advantage is related to a continuous chemical delivery and a better diffusion behavior of chemicals at elevated temperatures. Restoration of the surface free energy and partial recovery of the -value was obtained for both processes. This suggests that the supported energy, i. e. by UV or high temperature, is sufficient to activate the silylation reaction...|$|E

It is shown that the J–V behavior of our MIS structures could be precisely tuned via the monolayer thickness. The use of n-type silicon resulted in lower diode ideality factors as compared to p-type silicon.

The RIT atmospheric-pressure plasma (RITAPP) {{consists of two}} parallel-plate electrodes separated by a 1. 2 mm gap. Helium is flown through the gap, exiting the slit and impinging a substrate. 13. 56 MHz RF power is applied to one electrode, resulting in a non-thermal plasma with a gas temperature (Tg) between 50 and 150 °C. Optical emission spectroscopy {{was used to determine}} spectral radiation in the UV-Vis region of helium and helium/oxygen plasmas. Singlet and triplet helium emissions as well as numerous 0, H, and OH peaks are observed. Surface treatment of bare 2 ” (100) p-type silicon wafers was performed by short exposure to a He/O 2 plasma exposure increased surface energy, creating a hydrophilic surface. 20 -minute exposures of bare and RCA-cleaned silicon substrates to a He/O 2 plasma were analyzed using ellipsometry and <b>mercury</b> <b>probe</b> C-V measurements. Optical thickness was determined to be 3. 4 nm while C-V measurements revealed that both the plasma-grown oxide and the chemical oxides exhibited enhanced dielectric properties following treatment. Work is ongoing to expand upon oxidation experiments as well as I-V diagnostics of the plasma. In addition, investigation of low-temperature carbon nanotube growth is underway...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The {{influence}} of silicon surface modification via Si-CnH 2 n+ 1 (n= 10, 12, 16, 22) devices on p-type (100) silicon is studied by forming MIS (metal-insulator-semiconductor) diodes via a <b>mercury</b> <b>probe.</b> With {{the use of}} current density- voltage (J-V) and capacitance- voltage (C-V) measurements the relevant parameters describing the electrical behavior of these diodes are derived and compared with samples with a native oxide insulator. The insulating properties of these MIS diodes can be precisely tuned by varying the monolayer thickness. Insulating layers with n ≥ 12 show better insulating behavior than native oxide. Despite a comparable thickness of the C 16 monolayer {{as compared to the}} native oxide layer, the former showed even a tenfold decrease in leakage current. Evaluation of the average tunneling constant (β) of these monolayers reveals 0. 45 Å- 1. Evaluation of the dielectric constants (εr) gave values of 1. 7 ± 0. 3 and 2. 2 ± 0. 4 for n = 16 and 22, respectively, whereas for the fixed charge (Nf) low values of 5. 4 ⋅ 1011 and 5. 9 ⋅ 1011 cm- 2 were found for n = 16 and 22, respectively. The results suggest that Si-C linked monolayers on flat silicon may be a viable, alternative insulator for future electronic devices...|$|E
