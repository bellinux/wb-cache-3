40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} {{culverts}} {{conducted at the}} St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota, beginning in 1946, included several series of observations on commercial, corrugated metal culvert pipes, The primary purpose of these large-scale tests was to obtain pipe friction and entrance loss coefficients which would be more accurate and dependable than those currently recommended in culvert design literature. A previous paper in this series gives {{a discussion of the}} comparison with the results of parallel studies on concrete culverts. The present paper is confined to a discussion of the corrugated pipe culvert test program and an analysis {{of the results of the}} studies. Two types of corrugated metal culverts were tested, namely, the circular and the <b>pipe</b> <b>arch</b> types. In each case, threee different nominal diameter pipe sections were tested [...] 18 in., 24 in., and 36 in., respectively [...] , making a total of six corrugated metal culverts in the test program. Each pipe was 193 ft long and laid on a slope of 0. 20 per cent. For the <b>pipe</b> <b>arch</b> <b>culverts,</b> the identifying dimensions refer to the diameters of circular pipes having the same length of periphery. For example, the 36 -in. <b>pipe</b> <b>arch</b> and the 36 -in. circular culvert have equal perimeters although their heights, widths, and areas are unequal. Cross sections of the various pipes, with controlling dimensions, appear in Fig. 1. (Note that the corrugation height in each case is 1 / 2 in. and that all computations have been based on the inside section, that is on the minimum cross-sectional area.) Friction and entrance loss coefficients were established for the culverts under the usual conditions of field operation. With this objective in view, each pipe was tested for the following conditions: (a) Full flow with submerged inlet and outlet. (b) Part-full flow at uniform depth. For each flow condition, several values of head and discharge were used. In addition, five of the culverts were tested with two different entrance conditions; namely, (a) Pipe projecting 2 ft into the headwater pool. (b) Pipe entrance flush with headwall...|$|R

Up until now the focus has been the environmental improvements, mainly to enhance fish migration, and less respect has been given the technical requirements for the construction. To learn about the damages on the structures and the building process, several bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> has been studied. Information has been collected from articles and reports to study how water streams affects the construction and how to prevent damages. The Swedish Transport administrations set of regulations for how to build in water has been studied, and adapted to the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert.</b> The most severe problems for the bottomless <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> is deficient foundation, poor or non-existing riprap protection and maybe the most important; {{the absence of an}} actual design process when the span is less than two meters.

40|$|A multiarch culvert {{embankment}} is a {{new type}} of filling structure for which several precast <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> are installed continuously {{in the direction of the}} road extension. The key points in the design are to estimate the practical, optimal spacing between installed <b>arch</b> <b>culverts</b> and to clarify the interactive seismic behavior of the filling material and the culvert structure. In the current study, first, dynamic centrifuge model tests and a numerical analysis were carried out to clarify the basal earthquake behavior of the structure and verify the numerical approach. Then, the full-scale numerical analysis was performed to investigate the influence of spacing between multiarch culverts and the mechanical behavior under seismic conditions. From the results, it is confirmed that when the unit spacing is narrow, the whole rigidity of the ground and the <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> increases relatively.

Bottomless and buried invert culverts are examples of such designs and are commonly used for fish passage. Additional design guidance specific to streambed stability in buried-invert or bottomless culverts under high flow events is needed.

40|$|Fish passage {{designs for}} {{culverts}} rely mainly upon {{the comparison between}} the average flow velocity and the sustained swim speeds of fish, a method developed by studying salmonid species and their swimming patterns. This method does not recognize the role of reduced velocities near boundaries. Laboratory and field tests have been performed to test {{the use of these}} reduced velocities by several native Utah fish: leatherside chub (Lepidomeda aliciae), longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), and speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus). Laboratory flume tests were conducted using leatherside chub and longnose dace with three boundary conditions: a smooth boundary, a smooth boundary with strategically placed and sized cylinders, and a boundary consisting of natural substrate collected from the field. The key finding from these tests was that substrate that scaled with the fish length required the least energy expenditure, provided sufficient refuge to allow the fish to behave naturally, and allowed for successful passage. Field tests were performed in a southern Utah stream (Salina Creek) with speckled dace and leatherside chub. Fish were captured, marked, and recaptured at three locations: an <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> with a coarse substrate bottom, a double barrel concrete box culvert, and a stream section between the two culverts. Results showed that passage alone was not an adequate indicator of ability since not all fish attempt to pass upstream. Instead, population estimates within each of the sites were calculated to estimate use and the quality of habitat within the culverts. Population estimates were slightly higher at the <b>arch</b> <b>culvert</b> site than at the box culvert site. Velocity measurements were also taken near the boundary at each site to characterize the amount of variation within the culvert and population estimates correlated to the amount of variation found at each site. Providing fish with velocity variation by placing substrate instead of simply matching the average flow velocity to their swim speed may allow more fish to pass upstream and use the culvert as habitat rather than treating it as a barrier...|$|R

The out-of-plane {{secondary}} bifurcation buckling load-displacement equilibrium {{paths of}} the elastic circle <b>pipe</b> <b>arch</b> {{with and without}} out-of-plane brace {{at the top of}} the arch are traced using a new numerical tracing strategy. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling loads of the arch with the same sections and different rise-span ratios are obtained under the concentrated load {{at the top of the}} arch and the full span uniformly distributed load, which are compared with out-of-plane linear buckling load and in-plane primary buckling load. The calculation results show: for the same section circle <b>pipe</b> <b>arches</b> without the out-of-plane brace and under the concentrated load at the top the arch, the out-of-plane secondary buckling load is always less than the in-plane primary buckling load and the out-of-plane buckling will occur before the in-plane primary buckling. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling load of the arch with 0. 2 rise-span ratio is the biggest. The bigger the rise-span ratio is, the bigger the difference between out-of-plane and in-plane buckling load. When the arch is subjected to full span uniformly distributed load, the out-of-plane buckling will also occur before the in-plane primary buckling and the out-of-plane secondary bifurcation buckling load of the arch with 0. 4 rise-span ratio is the biggest.
