As a result he was confronted directly with the prevailing high Baroque idiom which he followed faithfully in the decorative elements but not in the depiction of the angels and saints. These are as austere as the images of the penitents, which he executed some 15 years later in Maastricht where he even omitted the high Baroque decorative elements. Compared to his contemporaries from Flanders and the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, he lacked the exuberant flourish and movement. His decorations and figure sculptures aimed to be functional within the macro-framework of the church and the <b>micro-context</b> of the confessional and the altar. The Baroque element was clearly present, but did not dominate.|$|E
5000|$|Communication {{accommodation}} theory (CAT) is {{a theory}} of communication developed by Howard Giles. It argues that, [...] "When people interact they adjust their speech, their vocal patterns and their gestures, to accommodate to others." [...] It explores the various reasons why individuals emphasize or minimize the social differences between themselves and their interlocutors through verbal and nonverbal communication. This theory {{is concerned with the}} links between language, context, and identity. It focuses on both the intergroup and interpersonal factors that lead to accommodation, as well as the ways that power, macro and <b>micro-context</b> concerns affect communication behaviors. This theory describes two main accommodation processes. [...] "Convergence" [...] refers to strategies through which individuals adapt to each other's communicative behaviors to reduce these social differences. Meanwhile, [...] "divergence" [...] refers to the instances in which individuals accentuate the speech and non-verbal differences between themselves and their interlocutors. Sometimes when individuals try to engage in convergence they can also end up over-accommodating, and despite their good intentions their convergence can be seen as condescending.|$|E

It extends prior research, which has largely been concerned with alliance-specific variables such as their initial structure and ‘best practices’. Extant research has typically underplayed broader micro-level elements, particularly those of a psycho-sociological nature. Leveraging a longitudinal case study of a major alliance in the high-tech industry we develop an alternative perspective to mainstream alliance research. We suggest that in order to evolve alliance theory must encompass elements broader than those specifically related to alliances themselves since alliances do not evolve in isolation from organizations’ idiosyncratic <b>micro-contexts</b> and managers’ behavior, but are rather significantly shaped by them.

There {{is a general}} {{consensus}} that ‘context’ matters for development outcomes, yet we have little understanding of how exactly ‘context’ affects outcomes. This paper focuses {{on the question of}} ‘context’ in social accountability initiatives by separating macro and micro contextual factors. On the macro side (country level), accountability processes need to take into account broad factors such as national histories of citizen-state engagement. On the micro side, local factors can drive the extent to which social accountability initiatives are successful, even within otherwise broadly similar national contexts. The paper outlines the basic components of accountability and proposes a ‘causal chain’ strategy to better understand the <b>micro-context.</b> This would allow existing evidence to be reorganized to assess the promise of existing and new initiatives by deconstructing the various mini-causal pathways (i. e. in the <b>micro-context)</b> and understanding the contextual conditions that make them work.

Specifically, this investigation focused on: (a) delineating the various roles which paraprofessionals play {{in early childhood}} special education services; (b) describing these early childhood settings in terms of micro-contexts; (c) identifying variations in paraprofessional roles across contexts; and (d) describing the discourse structure between paraprofessionals and special needs children across paraprofessional roles and <b>micro-contexts.</b> A constant comparative design (Stainback & Stainback, 1988) characterized this qualitative investigation. Data were collected over 22 weeks (January-June, 1991) for four mornings per week. Case studies were developed with three early childhood education paraprofessionals working with special needs children in a rural Canadian school. The results show that, first, early childhood special education environments {{are made up of}} a series of <b>micro-contexts</b> which in turn are defined by the activity and the participants. Second, paraprofessionals play a variety of roles which clustered around four classroom functions: (a) direct instruction; (b) curriculum design; (c) classroom management; and (d) child advocacy. The definition and behavioural correlates of the roles were impacted by: (a) parents; (b) teachers; (c) administration; and (d) paraprofessionals themselves. Third, paraprofessional-special needs child discourse changed across <b>micro-contexts</b> in the percentage of discourse exchange types used by both the adult and child. However, the general patterns of paraprofessional and special need child discourse were remarkably stable, suggesting both parties may be using a "school register" (Cazden, 1986). Such a register was characterized by the paraprofessionals controlling most of the discourse exchanges. However, the special needs child could recognize that different contexts within the school day required different language structures. The author concluded by suggesting that the roles of paraprofessionals be expanded to include community liaisons. Paraprofessionals are also seen as being an excellent source of child advocacy.

[...] University of Washington, 2015 The study {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to a conversation on the nature of teaching and the work of teacher education by developing a theoretical model for understanding teacher agency. Grounded theory methodology was used to study teacher agency within a collaborative action research project conducted with 17 public school teachers and one administrator in a co-taught inclusion program in a large middle school in Seattle, WA. Five dimensions of a theoretical model for understanding teacher agency were identified. (i) The macrosociological context of teacher agency and (ii) context-specific constraints and opportunities provide a crucial lens through which to understand the choices of teachers. Within their macro- and <b>micro-contexts,</b> teachers find ways to (iii) exert agency within their perceived constraints, (iv) take advantage of ambiguities and contested spaces in education to exert agency, and (v) use available structures to exert agency.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} that specifies the process of economic development as an evolutionary branching process of product innovations. Each product innovation provides a growth opportunity for an existing firm or a new firm, and for an existing city or a new city. One can then obtain both firm size and city size distributions as two aggregates resulting from a single evolutionary process. Gains from variety at the firm level (economies of scope) and the urban level (Jacobs externalities) provide the central feedback mechanism in economic development generating strong path dependencies in the spatial concentration of industries and the specialisation of cities. Gains from size are also expected, yet these are ultimately bounded by increasing wages. The contribution of our framework lies in providing a micro-foundation of economic geography {{in terms of the}} interplay between industrial dynamics and urban growth. The framework is sufficiently general to investigate systematically a number of stylised facts in economic geography, {{while at the same time}} it is sufficiently flexible to be extended such as to become applicable in more specific <b>micro-contexts.</b> A number of extensions related to the concepts of knowledge spillover and lock-in, are also discussed. evolutionary economic geography, urban growth, firm growth, Zipf, branching, innovation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to recent critical discussion of ‘agency’ in LPP research and practice. It argues that whilst scholars have widened their purview {{to consider the}} impact of individual actors on LPP in different contexts, the field has not developed or embraced theoretical and methodological frameworks which satisfactorily model or investigate the network of actor impact on LPP. This article analyses {{the current status of}} LPP at the United Nations (UN). Taking the ‘Actor-Stage Model’ (Zhao & Baldauf, 2012) as a theoretical point of departure, the paper discusses and analyses the most recent review of LPP within the UN. It becomes apparent that a network of agents is responsible for LPP development, influence and implementation within the organisation. This ‘web of influence’ is schematised using a network model which accounts for the implicit and explicit responsibility of multiple actors/’experts’ within and outside of the organisation. A sub-analysis of institutional LPP goals reveals the ‘polycentric’ and ‘relational’ nature of influence within and across multiple ’nodes’. It is argued that the network model and the concept of ‘web of influence’ is crucial in de- and re-constructing particular LPP goals and serves as a useful heuristic for those investigating or working within similar sites of inter/transnational integration as well as LPP in other macro, meso or <b>micro-contexts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore key aspects and {{problems}} of the institutionalised teaching and learning of German language and culture {{in the context of}} German Studies in British Higher Education (HE). This investigation focuses on teaching and learning experiences in one department of German Studies in the UK, which is the <b>micro-context</b> of the present study, in order to provide an in-depth insight into real-life problems, strengths and weaknesses as they occur in the practice of teaching and learning German. Following Lamb (2004) and Holliday (1994), the present study acts on the assumption that each <b>micro-context</b> does not exist in vacuo but is always embedded in a wider socio-political and education environment, namely the macro-context, which largely determines how and what is taught. The macro-analysis of the present study surveys the socio-political developments that have recently affected the sector of modern languages and specifically the discipline of German Studies in the UK. It demonstrates the impact they have had on teaching and learning German at the undergraduate level in Britain. This context is interesting inasmuch as the situation in Britain is to a large extent a paradigmatic example of the developments in German Studies in English-speaking countries. Subsequently, the present study explores learning experiences of a group of thirty-five first year students. It focuses on their previous experiences in learning German, exposure to the target language, motivation, learning strategies and difficulties encountered, when learning German at the tertiary level. Then, on the basis of interviews with five lecturers of German, teaching experience in the context under study is explored, problems and successful teaching strategies discussed.

40|$|The highly {{imagined}} and contested {{space of}} higher education is invested with an affectively loaded ‘knowledge economy optimism’. Drawing on recent work in affect and critical geography, this paper considers the e/affects of the promises of the knowledge economy on its knowledge workers. We extend previous analyses of the discursive constitution of academic subjectivity through the figuration of ‘emotional knots’ as we explore three stories of the constitution of academic subjectivities in institutional spaces. These stories were composed in a collective biography workshop, where participants constructed accounts of the physical, social, material and imaginative dimensions of subjectivities in the ‘academic-city’ {{of higher education}} spaces. Identifying moments of ‘perturbation’ in these stories, this paper considers the <b>micro-contexts</b> of ‘becoming academic’: how bodies, affects and relations become knotted in precise times and places. The figuration of ‘knots’ provides an analytical strategy for unravelling how subjects affectively invest in the promises of spaces saturated with knowledge economy discourses, and moments of impasse where these promises ring hollow. We examine the affective bargains made in order to flourish in the corporate university and identify spaces of possibility where optimistic projections of alternative futures might be formed. These stories and their analysis complicate the metanarrative of ‘knowledge economy optimism’ that is currently driving higher education reform in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Three female, and feminist, {{academics}} become participant {{researchers to}} explore their working practices seeking to make visible the ways they work to wo(manage) the masculinist environment of the University. After reviewing the literature, the paper starts by considering what ‘masculinist’ means in this context, finding that it refers to both rigidity of structure positioned as ‘impartial’ and, paradoxically, processes that enable competition and the clear identification of winners and losers; a University regime compatible with neo-liberal governance. Such values {{are at odds with}} those promoted within Early Years Education where ‘caring’ and ‘inclusion’ are fundamental, embedded in a strong ‘domestic’ tradition. The paper examines the historical practice of transferring ‘mothering’ skills into the educational institution and considers current attitudes and behaviours in relation to this synergy. Analysing their own attitudes and practices through an innovative (and time-effective) methodology, AAA/I (Asynchronous Associative Auto/Inquiry), the participant researchers consider the ways in which, through collaboration, they ameliorate University processes and working conditions to support each other and their students. Findings are discussed in relation to masculinist traditions and competitiveness, collaboration and caring, and the creation of ‘protective enclaves’, feminised <b>micro-contexts</b> within the larger masculinist domain. Considering their actions in toto, the trio reflect on the extent that their actions promote, evade or hinder a move towards greater gender equality and admit to the personal costs of continually striving to change the working environmen...|$|R

At the same time, {{studies have focused on}} <b>micro-contexts</b> such as the body, reflected in geographies of diseased and disadvantaged bodies. However, little research has combined elements of the two approaches and engaged in research on active healthy bodies and fitness. Equally the sub-discipline of sports geography provides little insight into fitness activities because this research has tended to focus on elite sports, their fans and facilities. Given these contexts, a detailed case study is presented to demonstrate the potential for geographical research on fitness. Through an observational study of a specialist gym facility, the study investigates how bodybuilding culture and place are co-produced. Indeed, the gym provides a narrative resource and a crucial setting for individual body projects and collective body culture which involve social conflicts, cohesions and hierarchies, illegal and potentially health harming activities, as well as personal comfort and therapeutic attachments. It is argued that beyond this case study, many activities crosscut health maintenance, or conversely risks to health, and the enjoyment of sports and fitness. A greater emphasis therefore at the sub-disciplinary interface of sports and health geography on hybrid 'fitness geographies' may help researchers towards a more comprehensive understanding, and coverage, of health issues in society.

40|$|Over {{the past}} thirty years or so, {{theoretical}} work in such fields as legal semiotics and law and literature has argued that the legal process is profoundly rhetorical. At the same time, a number of communication-based disciplines such as semiotics, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology have provided, particularly in interdisciplinary combination with law, a wealth of empirical evidence on, and insight into, the <b>micro-contexts</b> of language and communication in the legal process. However, while these invaluable nitty-gritty analyses provide empirical support for a rhetorical thesis, work in these areas has tended to ignore rhetoric as an explanatory principle. This article introduces an overarching rhetorical framework for the discursive construction and management of cases in contemporary Anglo-American legal processes. Taking ‘forensic’ as relating to the conduct of cases and ‘discourse’as semiosis-in-practice, I argue that the practices within which forensic discourse is embedded are not, as the received legal view would have it, aimed at revealing an impartial truth but are deeply rhetorical practices aimed at persuading decisionmakers to provide a remedy for a claimed wrong. By looking across forensic texts and contexts, I identify common elements of forensic discourse that can be found both in classical forensic orations and throughout the modern legal process and consider how these intersect with critical forces of agency and structure and the particularities of semiosis in situated context. An awareness of commonalities across forensic discourse can help sharpen our focus on the critical causes and consequences of individual and structural difference and point to consequential suggestions for reform...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the results of 48 focus group discussions carried out across 7 European study {{countries}} to shed light on the public understanding of farm animal welfare; however the account that we provide does not follow typical social-scientific conventions. We do not try to ‘capture’ public opinion on this issue, as a survey might seek to do by fixing, stabilising and ‘representing’ its subject matter, nor do we attempt to produce an entirely ‘coherent’ version of what the public understands by farm animal welfare. Instead, we adopt a performative approach (see Mol, 2002; Law, 2004; Callon et al, 2009). This enables us both to explore the ways in which lay knowledges are grounded in everyday socio-material practices (such as shopping for food, cooking and eating) and to critically reflect upon how our scholarly attempts to engage with these lay understandings actively intervene with them and help to generate new hybrid knowledges that are partly public and partly academic. More specifically, we identify three distinct acts of knowledge production that took place within the focus group discussions and we dedicate a considerable amount of time and attention to describing the <b>micro-contexts</b> in which and through which each act of knowledge production was choreographed (Cussins, 1996; Thomson, 2005). We then outline what specific versions of farm animal welfare were being enacted within these particular discussions and through these particular contexts. Whilst this method reveals certain overlaps and consistencies between the different ‘knowledge acts’ or ‘ways of knowing’ farm animal welfare, it also reveals some startling contradictions and non-coherencies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Drawing from Adorno et al’s (1950) The Authoritarian Personality, {{this paper}} seeks {{to explain why}} some workers reject {{participation}} in decision-making on principle, preferring instead to defer to managerial authority and remain silent. Approach: The paper reviews the literatures on employee voice and silence and then builds a conceptual framework {{that can be used}} to explain employee silence in relation to personality structures. Findings: It is argued that some employees have personality structures that make them more susceptible to anti-democratic thoughts. Potentially fascistic personalities, as measured by the F-scale, are expected to derive pleasure in submission to the will of management.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with measurements used in economic activity and investigates how historical markets managed transactional problems due to unreliable measurements. Existing literature has generally associated the problems of measurements in historical markets {{with the lack of}} uniformity in weights and measures. This thesis shows that metrological standardization was not sufficient to ensure reliability of measurements. Markets developed mensuration practices that enabled markets to address specific transactional issues in <b>micro-contexts.</b> This involved, in addition to the use of standardized metrology, improved governance of transactions, third party monitoring and guaranteeing, and other institutional solutions. Historical institutional arrangements were altered or replaced as a result of changing or standardizing mensuration practices. The thesis also makes a conceptual contribution in terms of understanding the process of standardization. It shows how, while standards can be inflexible and rationalized (i. e. limited in number), standardized practices can incorporate a number of such standards and be flexible in terms which standard to be used in a given context. Analytically, standardized practices are institutional objects that are determined endogenously and are formed in 'packages' that create interlinks between standards, other artefacts, rules and people. These arguments are developed by studying three detailed cases of mensuration practices in the British economy during the nineteenth-century. The case of the London Coal Trade examines how altered mensuration practices gave buyers greater assurance that the amount of coal they received was actually the amount they purchased. The case of the wire industry illustrates the struggles to define a uniform set of wire sizes that could overcome the disputes arising from incompatible and multiple ways of measuring wire sizes. The case of the wheat markets illustrates the complexity involved in developing standards of measurements such that quality could be reliably measured ex-ante. Through these case studies, the thesis shows how markets developed different mensuration practices to manage measurements in a given context. ...|$|R
40|$|U radu se prikazuju migracije Lovinčana i Svetoročana tijekom 20. stoljeća. Migracijske mobilnosti promatraju se s obzirom na odredište (vanjske i unutarnje), duljinu trajanja (privremene, sezonske, trajne) te uzroke (ekonomske i političke). Cilj rada je ukazati na utjecaj migracija na obiteljski život, te odnos iseljenika prema mjestu podrijetla. Zabilježene su povratničke migracije, uglavnom umirovljenika, ali i doseljavanje mladih stanovnika u Lovinac. This work {{presents}} the migrations {{of the inhabitants}} of the Lovinac region {{at the end of the}} 20 th century. Work has begun with ethnological fieldwork. Migratory mobility was studied in respect to the destination (external and internal), duration (temporary, seasonal, permanent) and the causes (economic and political). Empirical research, using the records of many immigrants’ real experiences revealed a new subtype of migration, examples of remigration (denoting migration of family members in two directions, with the men migrating temporarily for higher wages, and women and children moving permanently) seasonal returnees from migrations during the summer months, many years and partial temporary returnees from migration. Noted was the extraordinary importance of social capital in the selection of migratory destinations, and the importance of migrant networks and <b>micro-contexts</b> in the observation of the migrations. After presenting the causes of migration, seasonal and temporary departures, and permanent resettlement, through each of the extracts the effects of migration on family life and the relationship between immigrants by place of origins were indicated. Singled out were several integers in which they address the financial support for immigration, the contacts, visits of immigrants and their descendants of their homeland, departures of relatives of immigrants, and the interpersonal relationships of immigrants. Investigated are the practices of burials in the Lovinac region and those people arriving looking for their family roots of third and fourth generations of immigrants. Also noted are recent migrations. Since the peoples of Lovinac and Sv. Rok through the origins of the Bunjevci it shows similarities and differences in their migration to the migration of the coastal Bunjevci. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} tobacco, {{physical}} exercise, diet, and alcohol consumption on {{morbidity and mortality}} underline the importance of health promotion and prevention (HPP) at the primary health care (PHC) level. Likewise, the deficiencies when putting such policies into practice and assessing their effectiveness are also widely recognised. The objectives of this research were: a) to gain an in-depth understanding of general practitioners' (GPs) and patients' perceptions about HPP in PHC, and b) to define the areas that could be improved in future interventions. Methods Qualitative methodology focussed {{on the field of}} health services research. Information was generated on the basis of two GP-based and two patient-based discussion groups, all of which had previously participated in two interventions concerning healthy lifestyle promotion (tobacco and physical exercise). Transcripts and field notes were analysed {{on the basis of a}} sociological discourse-analysis model. The results were validated by triangulation between researchers. Results GPs and patients' discourses about HPP in PHC were different in priorities and contents. An overall explanatory framework was designed to gain a better understanding of the meaning of GP-patient interactions related to HPP, and to show the main trends that emerged from their discourses. GPs linked their perceptions of HPP to their working conditions and experience in health services. The dimensions in this case involved the orientation of interventions, the goal of actions, and the evaluation of results. For patients, habits were mainly related to ways of life particularly influenced by close contexts. Health conceptions, their role as individuals, and the orientation of their demands were the most important dimensions in patients' sphere. Conclusions HPP activities in PHC need to be understood and assessed in the context of their interaction with the conditioning trends in health services and patients' social <b>micro-contexts.</b> On the basis of the explanatory framework, three development lines are proposed: the incorporation of new methodological approaches according to the complexity of HPP in PHC; the openness of habit change policies beyond the medical services; and the effective commitments in the medium to long term by the health services themselves at the policy management level. </p...|$|R
