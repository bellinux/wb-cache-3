40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} {{the application of a}} computer-aided design and manufacturing technique of defining tumor resection, fibula cutting, and positioning by surgical templates in <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Materials and Methods: Four patients who required mandibulectomy and simultaneous reconstruction were enrolled in this study. Preoperative surgical simulation was performed. The surgical templates that defined tumor resection, fibula cutting, and positioning were designed and fabricated. Results: The surgeries were performed to the preoperative plan. All flaps survived. Superimposition of the postoperative image and the preoperative plan showed a satisfactory surgical accuracy. Conclusions: This method of defining tumor resection, fibula cutting, and positioning by surgical templates was accurate enough for <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Â© 2013 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Combination of {{advanced}} imaging, designing and manufacturing techniques has been rapidly developed {{in recent years}} for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes for medical devices. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a methodology for design and fabrication procedure of medical models using computer-aided design (CAD) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique for application in the <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Case studies of patients with mandibular defects are examined using CAD model construction including data acquisition from computerized tomography scan and data processing. Furthermore, the effect {{of advanced}} manufacturing parameters settings in FDM methodology is investigated. The models were used in assisting the surgeons in their reconstruction planning. A significant improvement regarding the success and convenience in surgery planning been reported. This paper explores the application and viability of FDM rapid prototyping technology for fabrication of complex mandibular models used for reconstructive surgery...|$|E
40|$|In {{preoperative}} {{planning for}} <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery,</b> {{it is necessary}} to determine the osteotomy lines for fibular shaping and the proper placement of fibular segments in the mandible. Although virtual surgical planning has been utilized in preoperative decision making, current software designs require manual operation and a trial-and-error process to refine the reconstruction plan. We have developed volumetric fibular transfer simulation software that can quickly design a preoperative plan based on direct volume manipulation and quantitative comparison with the patient's original mandible. We propose three quantitative shape indicators-volume ratio, contour error, and maximum projection-for symmetrical lesions of the mandible, and have implemented a parallel computation algorithm for the semiautomatic placement of fibular segments. Using this virtual planning software, we conducted a retrospective study of the computed tomography data from nine patients. We found that combining direct volume manipulation with real-time local search of placement improved the applicability of the planning system to optimize mandibular reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|The {{scientific}} literature is sparse on reports that evaluate facial asymmetry after <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> objectively. The {{aim of this}} study is to introduce and validate a new method, using three dimensional (3 D) stereophotogrammetry, that quantifies soft-tissue facial asymmetry in patients who have undergone mandibular reconstruction. To validate the new method, two observers applied the method on 3 D photographs of five patients and five controls. An inter-observer difference of 0. 04 mm (- 0. 08 to 0. 17) was found with a measurement error of 0. 13 mm. 15 3 D photographs of the mandibular reconstructed patients were compared with 24 3 D photographs of healthy controls. A significant difference (1. 19 mm) in asymmetry was found between patients and controls. It is concluded that this new measuring method is a valid, fast and clinically applicable technique to quantify soft-tissue facial asymmetry. It is concluded that facial symmetry in patients is not restored to the level of the control group with the mandibular reconstruction method applied...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the role of advanced fabrication technology across a broad spectrum of head and neck surgical procedures, including applications in endoscopic sinus surgery, skull base surgery, and maxillofacial reconstruction. The initial case studies demonstrated three applications of rapid prototyping technology are in head and neck surgery: i) a mono-material paranasal sinus phantom for endoscopy training ii) a multi-material skull base simulator and iii) 3 D patient-specific mandible templates. Digital processing of these phantoms is based on real patient or cadaveric 3 D images such as CT or MRI data. Three endoscopic sinus surgeons examined the realism of the endoscopist training phantom. One experienced endoscopic skull base surgeon conducted advanced sinus procedures on the high-fidelity multi-material skull base simulator. Ten patients partic-ipated in a prospective clinical study examining patient-specific modeling for <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Qualitative feedback to assess the realism of the endoscopy training phantom and high-fidelity multi-material phantom was acquired.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the severity and duration of postoperative pain and hyperalgesia in sheep undergoing <b>mandibular</b> <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery.</b> Stimulus-evoked sensitivity at the surgical site and an area remote from injury, the ipsilateral and con-tralateral forelimbs, was measured as objective indicators of altered pain processing in adult female sheep (n 7). Responses were recorded before surgery and one, two, three, seven and 14 days afterwards. Concentrations of the acute-phase protein haptoglobin were measured in serum as a marker of inflammation before and at one and seven days after surgery. A significant decrease in forelimb mechanical withdrawal thresholds (secondary hyperalgesia) and response thresholds to punctate stimulation of the area surrounding the surgical incision (allodynia) was detected one day after surgery and persisted for at least three days, despite intra- and postoperative analgesic treatment. Concentrations of haptoglobin were significantly increased one day post-surgery, indicating the presence of a significant acute inflammatory response, and returned to pre-surgical concentrations by seven days. These data provide a deeper insight into understanding the impact of surgery in experimental animals, and may assist in formulating more effective analgesic and antihyperalgesic treatment regimens postoperatively...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{is minimal}} {{insight into the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> after burns. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyse the prevalence, predictors, indications, techniques and medical costs of <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> after burns. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the three Dutch burn centres. Patients with acute burns, admitted from January 1998 until December 2001, were included. Data on patient and injury characteristics and <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> details were collected in a 10 -year follow-up period. Results: In 13. 0 % (n = 229 / 1768) of the patients with burns, <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> was performed during the 10 -year follow-up period. Mean number of reconstructive procedure per patient were 3. 6 (range 1 - 25). Frequently reconstructed locations were hands and head/neck.

However, <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> appears to be most effective in controlling the progression of lymphedema during the early stages when the paralyzed lymph vessels are still able to function and recover. Our experience in <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> has shown that improved long-term results are dependent on prolonged patient compliance with maintenance CDT and the prevention and treatment of infection. To better understand the role of <b>reconstructive</b> <b>surgery</b> in the management of chronic lymphedema, well-constructed clinical trials based on well-organized multicenter studies with similar protocols are mandated.
