40|$|This is a publisher’s {{version of}} an article {{published}} in Australian Journal of Audiology 1994. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] the late 1970 's, many groups have worked on developing effective signal processing for <b>multichannel</b> <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> The main aim of such schemes has been to provide the best possible speech perception for those using the device. Secondary aims of providing awareness and discrimination of environmental sounds and appreciation of music have also been considered. Early designs included some that attempted to simulate the normal cochlea. The application of such complex processing schemes was limited by the technology of the times. In some cases, researchers reverted to the use of single channel systems which could be controlled reliably with the existing technology. In other cases, as with the Australian implant, a simple multichannel processing scheme was devised that allowed a reliable implementation with available electronics. Over the next 15 years, largely due to the improvements in integrated circuit technology, the signal processors have slowly become more complex. Further psychophysical research has shown how additional information can be transferred effectively to implant users via electrical stimulation of the cochlea. This has lead to rapid improvement in the speech perception abilities of adults using <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants.</b> Some of the main developments in signal processing over the last 15 years will be discussed along with the latest speech perception results obtained with the new SPEAK processing scheme for the Australian 22 -channel <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant.</b> Initial results for SPEAK show mean scores of 70 % (equivalent to 85 - 90 % phoneme scores) for open set monosyllabic word testing for experienced adult users.

Materials and Methods: This is a prospective cross-sectional study. Twenty-three patients were enrolled. Six patients underwent surgery by cochleostomy and 17 had it through the RW approach. Results: Mean charge units (MCU) for high frequency sounds: patients submitted to the RW approach had a mean value of 190. 4 (± 29. 2) while cochleostomy patients averaged 187. 8 (± 32. 7); p = 0. 71.

[...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Learning and Educational Development, 1999 This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} children between 8 and 11. 11 years of age with severe to profound hearing loss who use hearing aids or <b>multichannel</b> <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> perceive intonation at the phonetic and phonologic levels of spoken language. The sample included 7 children who use conventional hearing aids, 4 children who have Nucleus 22 <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants,</b> and 3 children who have Nucleus 24 <b>cochlear</b> <b>implants</b> programmed with the SPEAK processing strategy. Subtests of the Auditory Perception Test for the Hearing Impaired (APT/HI) and the Imitative Test of Speech Pattern Contrast Perception (IMSPAC) were used to determine perception of intonation contours at the phonetic level. At the phonological level, data relating to the identification of various intonation contours within a sentence and identification of four sentence categories (declarative, interrogative, imperative, and conditional) were obtained using tests described by Engen, Engen, Clarkson, and Blackwell (1983). Individual participants demonstrated wide variability in performance in the four tests. However, a comparison of the group results revealed that the participants using hearing aids achieved higher scores on the measures of perception of intonation at the phonetic level of speech. In contrast, the performance of the group of <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> users was higher on the two tests of perception of intonation at the phonological level of speech. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} ability to perceive intonation differs for hearing aid and <b>cochlear</b> <b>implant</b> users.

For children who use hearing aids, degree of hearing loss affects performance.
