25|$|<b>Mesuximide</b> {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introduction}} of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 ± 2mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of <b>mesuximide)</b> is 1.95 ± 0.19mmol/L for α1G, 1.82 ± 0.16mmol/L for α1I, and 3.0 ± 0.3mmol/L for α1H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.|$|E
50|$|Acetophenone is {{used for}} the {{synthesis}} of many pharmaceuticals, for example: pyrrobutamine, dextropropoxyphene, trihexyphenidyl, pridinol, aspaminol, Cycrimine, Biperiden, Procyclidine, acifran, Amixetrine, <b>Mesuximide,</b> and Benmoxin.Allegedly also for phenylpropanolamine (note: in this case it is actually propiophenone not PhAc).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mesuximide</b> (or methsuximide, methosuximide) is a {{succinimide}} anticonvulsant medication. It is {{sold as a}} racemate by Pfizer {{under the}} tradenames Petinutin (Switzerland) and Celontin (United States). The therapeutic efficacy of methosuximide {{is largely due to}} its pharmacologically active metabolite, N-desmethylmethosuximide, which has a longer half-life and attains much higher plasma levels than its parent.|$|E
