When the isolate was grown on Eugon agar, exposure to the methyl ester killed 99. 9 % of the inoculum, but the surviving cells grew logarithmically. On the other hand, cells grown on media containing propylparaben were less susceptible when subsequently exposed to emulsions containing methylparaben.

40|$|When a {{commercial}} substrate {{was used in}} the determination of serum amylase activities of patients with acute pancreatitis, results much higher than those re-ported by the manufacturer with similar patients were found. A failure to quantitate all of the reducing groups liberated during incubation may account for the lower results. A modified saccharogenic method has been developed, which, by increasing the ratios of starch to enzyme and copper to reducing sugars, considerably extends the range of the determination. Unequivocally elevated serum and urine amylase values can be measured without repetition of {{all or part of the}} test and with good precision. lECENT STUDIES of saccharogenic amylase methods (1, 2) stress the importance of using sufficient substrate to maintain maximum reac-tion velocity during incubation. This paper presents evidence that commonly used spectrophotometric copper reduction methods for the determination of reducing groups in postincubation mixtures have been misapplied, leading to factitiously low amylase values. A modi-fied saccharogenic method, which permits analysis of most pathologic human sera or urines without repetition of either incubation or copper reduction steps and without sacrifice of precision in the normal range, is described.

40|$|Ketoprofen and {{piketoprofen}} are non-steroi-dal antiinflamatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{from the}} group of the aryl-propionic acid derivatives. They are widely used in topical presentations {{in the management of}} musculoskeletal rheuma-tisms and traumatisms. The advantage of this form of administration is, besides its commo-dity, the infrequent development of systemic adverse effects. There have been reports of cases of contact dermatitis and photodermatitis, the latter particularly in countries of the Medite-rranean area or in countries with a greater sun-light exposure 1 - 10. We present the case of a young girl who atten-ded our Paediatric Allergy outpatient clinic des-cribing the development of three marked local reactions after the use of dermatologic gels con-taining these NSAIDs in their formulations. CLINICAL OBSERVATION The patient was a 14 -year-old girl, whose only relevant personal antecedent was the presence of atopic dermatitis some years earlier.

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} applications of organic non-linear optical materials {{in the areas of}} optical processing and communication, the investigation of the crystal growth of new organic NLO materials has been an active field for the last 20 years. For such uses it is necessary to produce single crystals of high quality and perfection, free of strain and defects. When crystals are grown from the solution and the melt, solvent and the decomposition component in the melt can introduce impurities and imperfection to the as-grown crystals. For crystals grown from vapour phase, {{in the absence of the}} solvent, this cannot occur and the method promises to yield single crystals of higher quality. Despite this attraction, little attention has been paid to the vapour phase growth of organic NLO crystals. It was with this in mind that the following investigation was carried out. Using <b>Methyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> (p-MHB), a potential organic NLO material, a comparison investigation was made of its crystal growth from both the vapour phase and solution; this included an examination of morphological assessment, structural perfection, surface morphology and growth kinetics of the as-grown crystals and the mass transport properties in the growth ampoule. Collation of this data allows the definition of the best conditions for vapour phase growth to produce specimens of high quality and purity.

40|$|Chronic {{treatment}} of rats with lithium chloride was examined {{in order to}} determine its effect on hypothalamic monoamine and metabolite content, basal thyrotropin (TSH) secretion and thyroid function. The hypothalamic concentrations of noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the lithium treated rats remained unaltered when compared to control levels. NA turnover and the NA metabolite, 3 -methoxy- 4 -hydroxyphenylglycol (total MHPG), were significantly lower (p < 0. 01), whereas both serotonin (5 -HT) and its metabolite, 5 -hydroxyindole- 3 -acetic acid (5 -HIAA), were significantly higher (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 02, respectively) in the lithium treated rat hypothalami than in controls. Chronic lithium treatment significantly elevated basal TSH levels (p < 0. 05). This effect was antagonized by <b>methyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> (methylparaben, p < 0. 01), which did not itself affect basal TSH levels. Free serum T 3 and T 4 levels were not significantly affected by chronic lithium treatment, although T 4 tended to be slightly lower than control levels. The monoamine changes observed in the hypothalamus of lithium treated rats did not appear to account for the elevated TSH levels observed in these rats since NA activity which is generally regarded as stimulatory was decreased and 5 -HT which has an inhibitory effect on TSH secretion, was increased. The elevated TSH levels may have been due to a reduced negative feedback inhibition of TSH release by the mildly reduced circulating T 4 levels caused by chronic lithium treatment. A further possibility is that the pituitary cGMP (and hence TSH) response to TRH may have been enhanced by chronic lithium treatment and methylparaben may have antagonized this effect.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Presentation date: 1968 - 02 - 14 A {{study was}} made to {{determine}} biological relationships between the garden symphylan, Scutigerella immaculata (Newport), and an entomogenous fungus, Entomophthora coronata (Costantin), which attacks it under certain conditions. Until this fungus was found to infect this pest, no organism which seemed to offer promise of control had been discovered. Symphylan populations were exposed to E. coronata and the pathology followed. When new syrnphylans were added to an infected culture as the diseased individuals died, an epizootic condition developed to {{a point at which}} symphylans were infected and killed in less than two days. E. coronata survived in contaminated containers for as much as five months without susceptible hosts as evidenced by infection of reintroduced symphylans. Wax moth larvae, Galleria, and European house crickets showed high mortality when injected with spores suspended in physiological saline solution. Wax moth larvae and mealworms, Tenebrio, were infected when they were dusted with spores and incubated at 15 °C temperature in high humidity. Penetration of the cuticle by germ tubes from attached spores is the usual pathway of infection. Temperature ranges for both organisms correspond closely. Both become active a few degrees above freezing and reach an optimum between 20 ° and 30 °C. Lethal temperature for both is somewhat below 37 °C. Eight sulfonamides and an equal number of antibiotics were tested against the fungus. None showed inhibitory effects. Fungal inhibiting agents Mycostatin, <b>methyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate,</b> sorbic acid, and formalin were destructive at rates used in insect rearing media.

40|$|Mechanisms of <b>methyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate</b> (methyl paraben) {{action in}} {{allergic}} reactions were investigated {{by measuring the}} intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) and histamine release in rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMCs). In {{the presence or absence}} of extracellular Ca 2 +, methyl paraben (0. 1 – 10 mM) increased [Ca 2 +]i, in a concentration-dependent manner. Under both the conditions, methyl paraben alone did not evoke histamine release. In RPMCs pretreated with a protein kinase C (PKC) activator (phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) 3 and 10 nM), methyl paraben (0. 3 – 3 mM) induced histamine release. However, a high concentration (10 mM) of the agent did not increase the histamine release. U 73122 (0. 1 and 0. 5 μM), an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC), significantly inhibited the methyl paraben-induced histamine release in PMA-pretreated RPMCs. U 73343 (0. 5 μM), an inactive analogue of U 73122, did not inhibit the histamine release caused by methyl paraben. In Ca 2 +-free solution, PLC inhibitors (U 73122 0. 1 and 0. 5 μM, D 609 1 – 10 μM) inhibited the methyl paraben-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i, whereas U 73343 (0. 5 μM) did not. Xestospongin C (2 – 20 μM) and 2 aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (30 and 100 μM), blockers of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptor, inhibited the methyl paraben-induced increase in [Ca 2 +]i in Ca 2 +-free solution. In conclusion, methyl paraben causes an increase in [Ca 2 +]i, which may be due to release of Ca 2 + from storage sites by IP 3 via activation of PLC in RPMCs. In addition, methyl paraben possibly has some inhibitory effects on histamine release via unknown mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|The uptake of each {{of eleven}} {{structurally}} related solutes from pH 1 donor solution by an invariant liquid membrane formulation was investigated. The presence of polyamino surfactants in liquid membrane formulation significantly altered the partition of solutes between aqueous phase and oil phase. Benzoic acid and salicylic acid followed monoexponentiai kinetics while the uptake of other solutes followed biexponential processes, except p-aminobenzoic acid which was not transported at all. Both benzoic acid and salicylic acid were removed with a much faster rate compared to other solutes. Approximately, 90 % of these solutes were removed in two and half minutes from the donor solution. It is proposed {{that the presence of}} a phenolic group allowed salicylic acid to be transported with a significantly high rate as it can form intramolecular hydrogen bonding which increases its solubility in non-polar solvents. This is supported by the fact that meta and para-hydroxybenzoic acids were removed at a much slower rate. As expected, p-amino benzoic acid was not transported through liquid membrane from an acidic donor solution probably because of the ionized amino group. In presence of <b>methyl</b> <b>p-hydroxybenzoate,</b> ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate, acetaminophen and salicylamide rupture of the liquid membrane was apparent. This is possibly due to the formation of alcohols in the internal aqueous phase when these esters react with the encapsulated buffer. From the data obtained, it appears that the apparent leakage follows zero order kinetics. A new and more sophisticated kinetic model is proposed in an attempt to rationalize the basic mechanisms behind the solute uptake by the liquid membranes. The data for benzoic acid, salicylic acid and acetylsalicylic acid were analyzed by this model. Benzoic acid was not fit by this model. The lack of success to fit the data for benzoic acid is probably due to the dimerization of benzoic acid in the liquid membrane. For salicylic acid, which followed monoexponential kinetics, micro-rate constant k 1 is significantly higher than k 2 and k 3 while k 1 is significantly smaller than k 2 and k 3 for acetylsalicylic acid which followed biexponential kinetics. Hence, it is possible that depending en the magnitude of these micro-rate constants the uptake process may follow either mono or biexponential kinetics...|$|E
