25|$|Dr. David Griesinger and Steve Barbar {{developed}} LARES in 1988 {{while working}} at Lexicon, originally located in Waltham, Massachusetts. Lexicon had become respected for its digital reverberation products used for professional sound recording and concert sound reinforcement. The name LARES is an acronym of Lexicon Acoustic Reinforcement and Enhancement System. In 1989, Griesinger and Barbar, {{at the request of}} acousticians Neil Muncy and Robert Tanner, installed the first production LARES system in the Elgin Theatre in Toronto. This initial system used two microphones placed at the balcony's front edge to pick up sound from the stage. The microphone signals were treated electronically, and the resulting signals were sent to 116 loudspeakers positioned in the ceiling and under the balcony. Griesinger presented a technical paper on the concept, process and results to the Audio Engineering Society. A primary component of the electronic treatment was the addition of enough digital delay to make the enhanced loudspeaker output wave arrive at its target seating area at the same time or soon after the direct sound from the stage. Reverberation was digitally synthesized and added to the signal, and patented time variant signal processing was employed to overcome coloration from acoustic feedback between the <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> Two LARES mainframes were used, one for the 60 underbalcony speakers and one for the 56 loudspeakers in the main ceiling.|$|E

50|$|Audio {{feedback}} (also {{known as}} acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) {{is a special}} kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between an audio input (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a loudly-amplified loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the <b>microphone</b> is amplified <b>and</b> passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the <b>microphone,</b> amplifier, <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker,</b> <b>and</b> the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.|$|R

50|$|The {{concepts}} of main lobe and sidelobes {{also apply to}} acoustics and optics, and are {{used to describe the}} radiation pattern of optical systems like telescopes, and acoustic transducers like <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Transducers (i.e., <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>{{loudspeakers}})</b> {{can also}} ring. Mechanical ringing {{is more of}} a problem with loudspeakers as the moving masses are larger and less easily damped, but unless extreme they are difficult to audibly identify.|$|E

40|$|We {{designed}} a custom made manikin head for acoustical studies of spatial hearing. Its {{shape and dimensions}} mostly follow the telecommunication norms for headset testing. The differences from the norms are given by its purpose in simulations of acoustic environments outside and inside head. These simulations {{will be used for}} studies of normal and impaired binaural hearing. The head is manufactured from a composite material (artificial wood). The cavities inside are fitted with <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>and</b> enable measurements of sound propagation inside and outside of the head. We discuss a manufacturing procedure in detail together with step-by-step production instructions...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "humbucking coil" [...] {{was invented}} in 1934 by Electro-Voice, an American {{professional}} audio company based in South Bend, Indiana that Al Kahn and Lou Burroughs incorporated in 1930 {{for the purpose of}} manufacturing portable public address equipment, including <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{an audio}} system {{containing}} both <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> {{the total amount}} of gain in the system can exceed 100 dB. This is usually broken up into a number of smaller steps, called gain stages where the signal is amplified or attenuated as needed before reaching the loudspeaker.|$|E
50|$|In {{electronics}} this stimulus {{would be}} an input signal. In the audible range it is usually referred to in connection with electronic amplifiers, <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> Radio spectrum frequency response can refer to measurements of coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, video switching equipment, wireless communications devices, and antenna systems. Infrasonic frequency response measurements include earthquakes and electroencephalography (brain waves).|$|E
30|$|To {{investigate}} the performance for different reverberation times, we used simulated RIRs that were generated {{with the image}} method [40],[41]. The same relative <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> positions were used, but inside a simulated rectangular room of size l= 4.6 m×w= 5.1 m×h= 2.5 m. Reverberation times of RT 60 ={ 0, 100, 250, and 560 ms} with direct-to-reverberant ratios of DRR={∞, 9.1, 2.5, and − 3.6 dB} were simulated.|$|R
5000|$|A {{speakerphone}} is {{a telephone}} with a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> provided separately {{from those in}} the handset. This device allows multiple persons to participate in a conversation. The loudspeaker broadcasts the voice or voices of those {{on the other end of}} the telephone line, while the microphone captures all voices of those using the speakerphone. The term speakerphone is also sometimes used for loudspeaker, as in [...] "put it on speakerphone".|$|R
50|$|Another {{innovation}} that {{year was the}} installation of a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> on Centre Court to broadcast the calls of the umpire. A special footfault judge was introduced for the centre court and court no.1.

Only matches on Centre Court were covered in the first year, with Teddy Wakelam providing commentary for the BBC.|$|R

50|$|Acoustic {{enhancement}} systems use microphones, amplifiers, and loudspeakers interconnected {{with some}} form of processing. The number, type, and placement of <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> varies according to both the application, {{as well as the}} physics limitations that are imposed by the inherent operating principles associated with each manufacturer's equipment. In most instances, however, these systems employ at least one array of loudspeakers that are distributed throughout the venue.|$|E
50|$|Although stage, {{lighting}} and other production aspects of opera houses often {{make use of}} the latest technology, traditional opera houses have not used sound reinforcement systems with <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> to amplify the singers, since trained opera singers are normally able to project their unamplified voices in the hall. Since the 1990s, however, many opera houses have begun using a subtle form of sound reinforcement called acoustic enhancement (see below).|$|E
40|$|Virtual reality {{systems are}} {{largely based on}} {{computer}} graphics and vision technologies. However, sound also {{plays an important role}} in human’s interaction with the surrounding environment, especially for the visually impaired people. In this paper, we will develop the theory of recording and reproducing real-world surround auditory scenes in high orders using specially designed <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> arrays. It is complementary to vision-based technologies in creating mixed and augmented realities. Design examples and simulations are presented. ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{telephones}} have {{an integrated}} speakerphone function {{which can be}} activated by pushing a single button. This button transfers the sound input and output from the handset to the ambient <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> Devices designed specifically for speakerphone use often have multiple microphone inputs arranged radially around the device to maximize sound input, such as may occur around a conference table. The most sophisticated units allow the connection of additional satellite microphones that can be placed {{some distance from the}} main unit.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to these instruments, a suspended larger-than-life-size, [...] "bird-man" [...] doll (named Miron), an oversized pair of scissors, and three small tables for the music boxes are required, together with <b>microphones,</b> amplifiers, <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{live sound}} mixing, GBF is {{dependent}} {{on a wide variety}} of conditions: the pickup pattern (polar pattern) of the microphone, the frequency response of the microphone and of the rest of the sound system, the number of active <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> the acoustic conditions of the environment including reverberation and echo, and the relative positions of the microphones, the loudspeakers, the sound sources and the audience. Each doubling of the number of open microphones (NOM) reduces the PAG by 3 dB.|$|E
50|$|Wave field {{synthesis}} is {{a spatial}} audio rendering technique that synthesizes wave fronts by using Huygens-Fresnel principle. First the original sound is recorded by microphone arrays and then loudspeaker arrays {{are used to}} reproduce the sound in the listening area. The arrays are placed along the boundaries of their own area. <b>Microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> {{are the same as}} the arrays with regard to their respective area. The different part this technique has is that it allows multiple listeners to move in the listening area and still hear the same sound from all directions. This is the unique thing that the binaural and transaural techniques can't achieve. Generally, the sound reproduction systems using wave field synthesis place the loudspeakers in a line or around the listener in a 2D space. And similar systems are also proposed to reproduce a sound field in a 3D space. However, since these systems are very expensive and the loudspeakers are visible in the listener’s field of vision, {{it is very difficult to}} construct an audio-visual system using these systems. So papers on how to reduce the number of <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> have been written. One of them achieve their goal by considering the auditory capability of the listeners.|$|E
50|$|Around 1932, {{the plant}} {{focused on the}} {{production}} of acoustical-electrical transducers, <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> and their first prototype tuned radio frequency receiver was produced that year. In 1934 the plant designed and manufactured a 30-watt dynamic loudspeaker, and the first batch of 100 was installed in Moscow squares. A 10-watt horn loudspeaker followed the next year, which would remain in production until 1945. 1936 saw {{the release of a}} dynamic microphone and the T35 radio receiver. The T37 radio receiver, released two years later, won second prize at the 1938 Technology of Communication exhibition.|$|E

50|$|While {{technology}} and methods used in public speaking have traditionally featured simple oratory structure, new speaking technologies {{have been created}} {{in the past few}} decades that have transformed traditional speaking. New advances in technology have made way for more sophisticated communication for speakers and public orators. Lecterns hold papers while speakers talk. A speaker can project his or her voice with the aid of a public address system or a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> when speaking in front of a large audience. Public speakers may also use audience response systems, allowing listeners to interact with the speech as it happens.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{electronic}} design elements {{combine to}} affect perceived sound quality, making the global [...] "analog mixer vs. digital mixer" [...] question difficult to answer. Experienced live sound professionals {{agree that the}} selection {{and quality of the}} <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> (with their innate higher potential for creating distortion) are a much greater source of coloration of sound than the choice of mixer. The mixing style and experience of the person mixing may be more important than the make and model of audio console. Analog and digital mixers both have been associated with high-quality concert performances and studio recordings.|$|E
50|$|From 1924-1927 Ballantine {{carried out}} {{independent}} studies of radio propagation in White Haven, Pennsylvania, then was briefly research {{director at the}} Radio Frequency Laboratories, and in 1929 collaborated with F. M. Huntoon in studying the effects of high pressure on bacteria. From 1929-1934 he was President of the Boonton Research Laboratories investigating errors in microphones due to diffraction and cavity resonance, and developing new devices including an electrostethoscope, automatic optical recorder for frequency-response measurements, and logarithmic voltmeter. In 1934 he founded Ballantine Laboratories, which he led until his death. There he developed improved techniques for measuring the performance of <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> and most notably, the first throat microphone for aircraft pilots.|$|E
50|$|Ringing out is {{a process}} in audio {{engineering}} used to prevent audio feedback between on-stage <b>microphones</b> <b>and</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> and to maximize volume before feedback occurs. Depending on the acoustics of a venue, certain frequencies may be resonant, and will be more prone to feedback. To ring out a room, a sound technician will raise the gain or fader controls on a mixing desk to induce an audio system to feedback. Once feedback occurs, the technician uses an equalizer, usually a graphic equalizer to reduce the gain on the appropriate band (or frequency). The frequency of the feedback can be identified using a spectrum analyzer. This is repeated until feedback is sufficiently reduced without compromising {{the quality of the}} sound.|$|E

50|$|Lecture halls {{differ from}} {{other types of}} {{learning}} spaces, seminar rooms in particular, in that they allow for little versatility in use, although they are no less flexible than, for example, chemistry laboratories. Experimentation, group work, and other contemporary educational methods are not practicable in a lecture hall. On the other hand, lecture halls are excellent for focusing {{the attention of a}} large group on a single point, either an instructor or an audio-visual presentation, and modern lecture halls often feature audio-visual equipment.
