A few of the Occii pursued political careers in this period, but most are known only from inscriptions.|$|R

Ibuse <b>speaks</b> of this school as following Western ideals, according to The First Half of My Life he says the school emphasized Dutch learning and French military exercises.|$|R

According to Riggs' 1949 autobiography as of that writing, Budge owned a laundry in New York with Sidney Wood {{as well as}} a bar in Oakland. A gentleman on and off the court, he was <b>much</b> in demand <b>for</b> <b>speaking</b> engagements and endorsed various lines of sporting goods. With the advent of the Open era in tennis, in 1968 he returned to play at Wimbledon in the Veteran's doubles. In 1973, at the age of 58, he and former champion Frank Sedgman teamed up to win the Veteran's doubles championship at Wimbledon before an appreciative crowd.|$|R

6000|$|But, {{strange to}} say, {{although}} he affected to believe so firmly {{in his own}} style of art and hold Ida's in such cheap regard, {{it was a little}} painting of the latter's that he valued most, and which was oftenest put upon his easel for purposes of solitary admiration. It was one of those very impressionist productions that faded away in the distance, and full of soft grey tints, such as his soul loathed. There was a tree with a blot of brown colour on it, and altogether (though {{as a matter of fact}} a clever thing enough) from his point of view of art it was utterly [...] "anathema." [...] This little picture in oils faintly shadowed out himself sitting at his easel, working in the soft grey of the autumn evening, and Ida had painted it and given it to him, and that was why he admired it so <b>much.</b> <b>For</b> to <b>speak</b> the truth, our friend the Colonel was going, going fast--sinking out of sight of his former self into the depths of the love that possessed his soul.|$|R

He will not be extreme to mark what you do amiss, but will help you to mend it, if you desire to mend; setting you straight when you go wrong, and helping you up when you fall, if only your spirit is struggling after what is right.|$|R
60|$|He gently {{relieved}} Rachel {{from the}} now lifeless weight, and they knelt {{on for some}} moments in complete stillness, except that Alick's breath became more laboured, and his shuddering and shivering {{could no longer be}} repressed. Rachel was excessively terrified to perceive that his whole frame was trembling like an aspen leaf. He rose, however, bent to kiss his sister's brow, and steadying himself by the furniture, made for the door. The others followed him, and in a few rapid words Rachel was assured that her fears were ungrounded, it was only an attack of his old Indian fever, which was apt to recur on any shock, but was by no means alarming, though for the present it must be given way to. Indeed, his teeth were chattering too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him to <b>speak</b> intelligibly, when he tried to tell Rachel to rest and not think of him.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a strange}} state of things, with all those {{different}} pairs of confidential friends. Both Marian and Walter were the stay and support of Caroline and Lionel; yet, though acting in concert, and perfectly agreed, not saying a word in confidence {{to each other on}} either head. Neither did Walter speak of Caroline to Lionel, nor Lionel, though <b>much</b> interested <b>for</b> her, <b>speak</b> to her of his affairs or her own. Clara indeed bestowed her communications on every one, but she got nothing in return that was satisfactory. Marian was the central point with all except Walter, but the fulness of her heart was bestowed elsewhere. And, alas! none saw so little of those young hearts as the parents, who had never earned their confidence; so that when they turn to them, it was from duty, as to rulers, not as to counsellors and friends.|$|R

60|$|We {{went into}} all the schools of the college, and made {{ourselves}} fully aware {{that the amount of}} learning imparted was far above our comprehension. It always occurs to me, in looking through the new schools of the present day, that I ought to be thankful to persons who know so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> condescending to <b>speak</b> to me at all in plain English. I said a word to the gentleman who was with me about horses, seeing a lot of lads going to their riding lesson. But he was down upon me, and crushed me instantly beneath the weight of my own ignorance. He walked me up to the image of a horse, which he took to pieces, bit by bit, taking off skin, muscle, flesh, nerves, and bones, till the animal was a heap of atoms, and assured me that the anatomy of the horse throughout was one of the necessary studies of the place. We afterward went to see the riding. The horses themselves were poor enough. This was accounted for by the fact that such of them as had been found fit for military service had been taken {{for the use of the}} army.|$|R

40|$|In the Philippines, {{students}} start learning English as a Second Language (ESL) {{as early}} as kin-dergarten. By the time they enter college, they have had wide expo-sure to traditional grammar-based approaches to language instruction. At the University of the Philippines Los Baños, English 1 is a prescribed general education course for fresh-men. Classes of 25 to 38 students meet for three hours per week to study, among other things, sentence structure and sentence transforma-tions, paraphrasing and summarizing, and paragraph and composition writ-ing; grammar and vocabulary enrich-ment are integrated in the course. In general, the students find the les-sons boring, perhaps {{because they have been}} studying the same mate-rial for so many years. The lessons are mechanical and quite predict-able—the teacher presents rules, gives exercises for students to work on, and administers tests to assess learning. As a result, the English teachers do most of the talking while the students listen, take notes, or give one-word or one-sentence responses. This should not be the case. According to Martin (2000), English-language instructors should be careful about monopolizing a class with too <b>much</b> teacher-talk— <b>for</b> <b>speaking</b> and writing activities, more than 15  percent of the time is probably excessive. Teacher-centered lessons featuring lectures on sentence structure and how to write effective paragraphs are bound to create pas-sive students who do not {{take an active role in}} class. Clearly, English classes need to be more interactive to keep students interested in the lessons. After ten years of teaching I have learned that English need not be a boring subject; on the contrary, it can be fun if teach-ers supplement the formal lessons with alternative methods and tech-niques. For example, I regularly use games to review and practice the lan-guage skills that the class is currently studying. In this article I will show how teachers can easily adapt avail-able games and develop new ones to add some fun and excitement to the learning process. In addition, I wil...|$|R
