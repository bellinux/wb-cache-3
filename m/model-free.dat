Many of these rely on machine learning to detect non-additive effects that might be missed by statistical approaches such as linear regression. For example, multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was designed specifically for nonparametric and <b>model-free</b> detection of combinations of genetic variants that are predictive of a phenotype such as disease status in human populations.

25|$|Instead of {{attempting}} a <b>model-free</b> inversion of the DSC profile {{to extract the}} underlying probability density function, they assumed a specific free energy functional with either one or two minima (similar to the Landau theory of phase transitions) thus enabling the extraction of free energy barrier heights. This model {{is the first of}} its kind in physical biochemistry that enables the determination of barrier heights from equilibrium experiments. Analysis of the DSC profile of BBL with this model resulted in zero barrier height, i.e. downhill folding, confirming the earlier result from the statistical mechanical model. When the variable-barrier model was applied to a set of proteins for which both the rate and DSC data are available, a very high correlation of 0.95 was obtained between the rates and barrier heights. Many of the proteins examined had small barriers (<20 kJ/mol) with baseline crossing evident for proteins that fold faster than 1 ms. This is in contrast to the traditional assumption that the free energy barrier between the folded and unfolded states are large.|$|E

Particularly, VIX undervalues (overvalues) volatility when market return {{is expected to be}} negatively (positively) skewed. Alternatively, they develop a <b>model-free</b> generalized volatility index (GVIX). With no diffusion assumption, GVIX is formulated directly from the definition of log-return variance, and VIX is a special case of the GVIX. Empirically, VIX generally understates the true volatility, and the estimation errors considerably enlarge during volatile markets. In addition, the spread between GVIX and VIX (GV-Spread) follows a mean-reverting process.|$|E

They employed classical model-based and machine learning <b>model-free</b> methods to discriminate between different patient and control groups.

Technically it uses deep learning on a convolutional neural network, with a novel form of Q-learning, a form of <b>model-free</b> reinforcement learning. [...] They test the system on video games, notably early arcade games, such as Space Invaders or Breakout.

5000|$|Line-collimation {{instruments}} {{restrict the}} beam only in one dimension (rather than two as for point collimation) {{so that the}} beam cross-section is a long but narrow line. The illuminated sample volume is much larger compared to point-collimation and the scattered intensity at the same flux density is proportionally larger. Thus measuring times with line-collimation SAXS instruments are much shorter compared to point-collimation and {{are in the range}} of minutes. A disadvantage is that the recorded pattern is essentially an integrated superposition (a self-convolution) of many adjacent pinhole patterns. The resulting smearing can be easily removed using <b>model-free</b> algorithms or deconvolution methods based on Fourier transformation, but only if the system is isotropic. Line collimation is of great benefit for any isotropic nanostructured materials, e.g. proteins, surfactants, particle dispersion and emulsions.|$|E
50|$|Her {{experimental}} program applies {{solid state}} NMR spectroscopy to {{problems that are}} intractable by other structural methods. A long-term study {{has focused on the}} mechanism by which the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin executes ion transfers that convert light energy to electrochemical form. A more recent study on the floatation organelles of aquatic micro-organisms has revealed that an amyloid pattern of protein assembly underlies their strength and interfacial stability. Other studies have elucidated the structures of amorphous polymers that form under prebiotic conditions. In the course of solving some of the practical problems involved in this work, she has also developed some methods that have been adopted by other spectroscopists. This includes spinning sideband analysis to extract local anisotropy information, and spectroscopy by the integration of frequency and time domain information (SIFT) to carryout rapid, <b>model-free</b> processing of non-uniformly sampled spin evolution.|$|E
50|$|Q-learning is a <b>model-free</b> {{reinforcement}} learning technique. Specifically, Q-learning {{can be used}} to find an optimal action-selection policy for any given (finite) Markov decision process (MDP). It works by learning an action-value function that ultimately gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state and following the optimal policy thereafter. A policy is a rule that the agent follows in selecting actions, given the state it is in. When such an action-value function is learned, the optimal policy can be constructed by simply selecting the action with the highest value in each state. One of the strengths of Q-learning is that it is able to compare the expected utility of the available actions without requiring a model of the environment. Additionally, Q-learning can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring any adaptations. It has been proven that for any finite MDP, Q-learning eventually finds an optimal policy, {{in the sense that the}} expected value of the total reward return over all successive steps, starting from the current state, is the maximum achievable.|$|E

However, we have recently succeeded, through sequential and non-sequential pyrolysis followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in determining something of the composition of this material.

50|$|Baselines {{frequently}} used in two-state fits {{correspond to the}} fluctuations in the folded or unfolded well. They are purely empirical as {{there is little or}} no information on how the folded or unfolded states' property changes with temperature/chemical denaturant. This assumes even more importance in case of DSC experiments as the changes in heat capacity correspond to both fluctuations in the protein ensemble and exposure of hydrophobic residues upon unfolding. The DSC profiles of many small fast-folding proteins are broad, with steep pre-transition slopes. Interestingly, two-state fits to these profiles result in crossing of baselines indicating that the two-state assumption is no longer valid. This was recognized by Munoz and Sanchez-Ruiz, resulting in the development of the variable-barrier model.Instead of attempting a <b>model-free</b> inversion of the DSC profile to extract the underlying probability density function, they assumed a specific free energy functional with either one or two minima (similar to the Landau theory of phase transitions) thus enabling the extraction of free energy barrier heights.

We designed a multistep decision task in which model-based and <b>model-free</b> influences on human choice behavior could be distinguished.

It is as yet unknown, however, whether such an imbalance reflects a predisposing vulnerability or results as a consequence of repeated and/or excessive alcohol exposure. We, therefore, examined the association of alcohol consumption with model-based goal-directed and <b>model-free</b> habitual control in 188 18 -year-old social drinkers in a two-step sequential decision-making task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging before prolonged alcohol misuse could have led to severe neurobiological adaptations. Behaviorally, participants showed a mixture of <b>model-free</b> and model-based decision-making as observed previously. Measures of impulsivity were positively related to alcohol consumption. In contrast, neither <b>model-free</b> nor model-based decision weights nor the trade-off between them were associated with alcohol consumption. There were also no significant associations between alcohol consumption and neural correlates of <b>model-free</b> or model-based decision quantities in either ventral striatum or ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Exploratory whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses with a lenient threshold revealed early onset of drinking to be associated with an enhanced representation of <b>model-free</b> reward prediction errors in the posterior putamen. These results suggest that an imbalance between model-based goal-directed and <b>model-free</b> habitual control might rather not be a trait marker of alcohol intake per se...|$|E
