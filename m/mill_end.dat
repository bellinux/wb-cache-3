40|$|Abstract. <b>End</b> <b>mills</b> {{with small}} {{diameter}} {{have found their}} wide application {{with the development of}} high-speed cutting. It becomes more and more important to develop effective methods to monitor and control the milling process with small <b>end</b> <b>mills.</b> In this paper, a measuring system of projection image for small <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> is introduced, and the application of the projection image to monitor the behavior of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> is discussed. It is found that for static state of the <b>end</b> <b>mill,</b> the measurement accuracy can be easily controlled within 1 µm. When the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> rotates, it is not so difficult to control the accuracy within 3 µm. By using of the change in image width, the radial wear of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> can be predicted.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyse the {{grinding}} processes and develop a search system of database for cutting tools. Design/methodology/approach: A tool grinding software with open architecture was used to analyse the grinding processes of square <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> tapered square <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> ball nose <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> tapered ball nose <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> radius <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> tapered radius <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> straight flute reamers, helical flute reamers, flat drills, twist drills, and step drills. According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius <b>end</b> <b>mill,</b> tapered radius <b>end</b> <b>mill,</b> twist drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles. Therefore, it is difficult to encode by formal rules. Practical implications: The most commercial tool grinding software is the modular-based design and uses tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. However, it is very difficult for users to design new cutting tools. Utilizing the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools, and the search system of the database provides more flexible options to develop new cutting tools. Originality/value: The database and search system of cutting tools were presented in this paper. We can save time for production line change, tool design, and tool grinding by employing this kind of system. It also gives more convenience. That is, company’s productivity and benefit can be improved...|$|R
