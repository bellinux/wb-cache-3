50|$|The most {{effective}} ameliorative action was the hydrological intervention {{of opening the}} new lake mouth and channel to the sea through the barrier beach at Satapura. This improved the spatial and temporal salinity gradients of the lake to maintain the unique characteristics of an estuarine eco-system. This intervention was undertaken after detailed scientific studies, including 3-dimensional mathematical modeling and hydraulics studies on a <b>model</b> <b>prototype,</b> were {{carried out by the}} Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune and National Institute of Oceanography, Goa. In September 2000, the desiltation of the channel connecting the lake to the sea and opening of a new mouth to restore the natural flows of water and salinity levels was carried out. These actions resulted in a notable increase in the lake's fish yield and a reduction of freshwater weeds. The new mouth reduced the length of the outflow channel by 18 km. Opening of the new mouth provided a favorable increased salinity regime throughout the lake with less fluctuations and improved water clarity.|$|E

30|$|Conclusion This {{original}} lung <b>model</b> <b>prototype</b> is {{the first}} to our knowledge to combine complete active inspiratory activity and passive expiratory activity. First recordings show the feasibility of the concept and validate the acquisition system.

This validation will give the originality of this work by allowing a closer simulation of the natural functioning of the human respiratory system.|$|E

40|$|This study proposes an {{alternative}} cellular automata (CA) model, which relaxes the traditional CA regular square grid and synchronous growth, {{and is designed}} for representations of land-use change in rural – urban fringe settings. The model uses high-resolution spatial data {{in the form of}} irregularly sized and shaped land parcels, and incorporates synchronous and asynchronous development in order to model more realistically land-use change at the land parcel scale. The model allows urban planners and other stakeholders to evaluate how different subdivision designs will influence development under varying population growth rates and buyer preferences.

The composite beam is used as composite footbridge <b>model</b> <b>prototype</b> which is assumed. For the dynamic test, hammer excitation is used to excite the beam at fixed locations. The modal parameters are extracted from the time response using a time domain analysis, i. e. the stochastic subspace identification technique. Finite element models for different boundary conditions are constructed using the commercial finite element software package ANSYS for natural frequencies of the beam to support and verify the dynamic measurements. The result obtained from analytical solution, dynamic tests and the FEM are presented and analysed. Oluseun Adediran, please contact the author email seunadediran@gmail. com...|$|E
