5|$|After {{the events}} in The Sleeping Dragon, George Stobbart is running a bail bonds office in New York with his partner Virgil. George meets Anna Maria, a girl with an old <b>manuscript</b> who wants his help to decode it. A group of mobsters after the <b>manuscript</b> ransack Anna Maria's hotel room, as well as George's bail bonds office, and steal the <b>manuscript.</b> George discovers that the mobsters are led by Fingers Martino, who runs an old meat packing factory. George sneaks into the factory and overhears a {{conversation}} between Fingers and Mr. Spallacci, who has obtained the <b>manuscript.</b> George manages to covertly take back the <b>manuscript,</b> which he examines with Anna Maria. George figures out that the fortified city on it must be Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} two {{complete}} manuscripts, {{a number}} of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. British Library MS Cotton Titus A.i, usually known as the Gmanuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B <b>manuscript,</b> dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in <b>manuscript</b> G.

5|$|Edward-Rhys Harry reconstructed Parry's {{setting of}} the Te Deum taken from the text of The Book of Common Prayer.

Harry uncovered the <b>manuscript</b> while researching choral traditions at the library. He worked a year at transcribing the original Parry <b>manuscript.</b> The London Welsh Chorale gave the work its world première performance under Harry at StGiles Cripplegate, Barbican, London on 14 July 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{only other}} 11th-century {{cartulary}} surviving from England is the Oswald cartulary, also compiled at Worcester. Historian M. T. Clanchy {{has suggested that}} the form English cartularies took may have originated at Worcester, although fellow historian Robin Fleming has argued that Christ Church Canterbury's surviving cartulary is also an 11th-century compilation. Who owned the <b>manuscript</b> after it left Worcester Cathedral Priory, presumably with the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1540s, is unknown, but the <b>manuscript</b> was in the possession of Robert Cotton by 1612, when it is recorded as being loaned by Cotton to Arthur Agarde. There are annotations in the <b>manuscript</b> by John Joscelyn, who was secretary to Matthew Parker (d. 1575), the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, but whether Parker owned the <b>manuscript</b> is uncertain. The <b>manuscript</b> thus became part of the Cotton library, which passed into public ownership in 1702 on the death of Cotton's grandson on the basis of an act of Parliament of 1701. The <b>manuscript</b> itself is now part of the British Library's holdings.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts {{relate to each other}} cannot be made. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B <b>manuscript.</b> A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either <b>manuscript</b> E or an earlier version of that <b>manuscript.</b> Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make <b>manuscript</b> F.|$|E
5|$|The work survives in two {{complete}} manuscripts (MS), that of Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.1, usually {{known as}} the E manuscript; {{and one in the}} possession of Ely Cathedral Chapter, usually {{known as the}} F <b>manuscript.</b> The E <b>manuscript</b> dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different scribal hands. The F <b>manuscript</b> dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands. The E <b>manuscript</b> was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by Roger Gale in 1738. The F <b>manuscript</b> has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only <b>manuscript</b> at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.|$|E
5|$|According to the Bannatyne <b>manuscript,</b> the Fairy Flag {{was also}} unfurled during the Battle of Glendale, which the <b>manuscript</b> states {{to have been}} fought in about 1490. At one point during this conflict, both the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, and the MacLeods of Lewis {{were on the verge}} of giving way to the invading MacDonalds. Just at this moment, the mother of Alasdair Crotach, chief of the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan, ordered the Fairy Flag to be unfurled. The result was that both MacLeod clans renewed the battle with redoubled fury and, despite immense losses, {{eventually}} won the battle. Among the MacLeod dead was the flag bearer, Paul Dubh, who carried the Fairy Flag throughout the conflict until his death. The Bannatyne <b>manuscript</b> relates that Paul Dubh was honourably buried in a deep stone coffin, with a metal grate — much like the account given in the c.1800 <b>manuscript.</b> The writer of the Bannatyne <b>manuscript</b> states that each successive flag bearer was buried within this tomb, and that the writer's own grandfather saw the old ceremony performed for the last time, in the 18th century. The Bannatyne <b>manuscript</b> states that the tomb is located in the north-east corner of the chancel at St Clements Church, in Rodel. R.C. MacLeod noted that there was no trace of such a coffin or tomb; although, he suggested that it could have been buried or possibly built within a wall.|$|E
