5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> {{occurred}} at the bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift span of the bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
40|$|This study {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between <b>major</b> and minor <b>accidents,</b> and <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> involving a moving vehicle, and behavioural and emotional factors in children, aged 4 - 15 years, using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and adjusting for demographic, socio-economic and family type factors. Data from a large representative national sample of about 6000 children were analysed using simple and multiple logistic regression. The analysis shows that the prevalence of SDQ scales, such as hyperactivity and conduct disorder were significantly higher in boys, lower social classes and step- and single-parent families. After adjusting for the demographic, socio-economic and family type factors, children who scored borderline or high for hyperactivity were almost two {{times more likely to}} report having <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> Children who scored high for hyperactivity and emotional symptoms were one and a half times more likely to report having minor <b>accidents.</b> For <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> involving moving vehicles, the relationships with the behavioural and emotional factors were generally stronger than for <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> in general. Hyperactivity, in particular, was significantly associated with the occurrence of <b>major</b> and minor <b>accidents,</b> and <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> involving moving vehicles. The behavioural risk factors were significantly more common in the lower social classes, families receiving benefits and step- and single-parent families. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of human society is placing ever increasing demands on their production. This action brings the company not only positive but also negative impacts. Along with the {{development of}} industrial production, people have to face the risks posed their activity brings. The accidents, which occurred in the recent past, they still have a negative impact not only on humans but also on the environment and the economy. In this paper, we address the issue of <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> <b>Major</b> <b>accidents</b> are meant only accidents caused induced by human activities. The paper presents the best known <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> {{since the beginning of the}} 20 th century. They have come in the European Union to modify the legislation that is valid for the all EU Member States. In the Czech Republic, these rules are enshrined in Act No. 59 / 2009 Coll., on the prevention of <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> For human society is a necessary protection against the effects arising from <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> One of the possibilities is the insurance of <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> Since in <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> frequently occurs very high damage is therefore utilized modelling and simulation of extreme values. One of the options that can be used is modelling using the quantile function. The paper recalled model and process simulation of extreme values. It is possible to estimate the values of the damage amounts thanks to the help of the simulation of the quantile function, and it is also possible to estimate the maximum limit of the interval of damage. This knowledge can be used in deciding on the appropriate type of non-proportional reinsurance and also for the management of catastrophic risk insurance...|$|R

5|$|Pilgrim {{numbers have}} greatly {{increased}} in recent years, {{which has led}} to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at slaughterhouses appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E
5|$|One {{member of}} the Lord Nelson class was {{involved}} in {{what could have been}} a <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> on 23 January 1930. This entailed the leading driving wheels jumping off the track, though the locomotive ran for many yards before they re-railed themselves over a point. No. 860 Lord Hawke was derailed at , Hampshire on 14 August 1940 due to enemy action. a bomb fell on the track ahead of the train, which was unable to stop in time. No. 852 received a direct hit from an enemy bomb on 18 April 1941, and was so severely damaged that it was not returned to service until June 1942. No. 854 suffered a firebox failure due to lack of water 23 April 1945, killing the fireman and injuring the driver. No. 851 Sir Walter Raleigh was involved in a serious derailment at Byfleet in December 1946, due to the poor condition of the permanent way. On 26 November 1947, No. 860 Lord Hawke was hauling a passenger train that was run into by another at , Hampshire due to a signalman's error. Two people were killed. No. 30854 Howard of Effingham was hauling a passenger train that overran signals and was derailed by trap points at , Hampshire on 20 July 1952.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the gondola made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and gondola are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the gondola made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating gondola. The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the gondola. Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the <b>major</b> <b>accidents</b> in terms of legal {{regulation}} {{in the area of}} prevention, control and liquidation of consequences of <b>major</b> <b>accidents.</b> The first part defines the term "accident", and gives examples of the most serious accidents in the world.

5|$|With {{a payroll}} of 6,632 at March 1990, the airline had {{a fleet of}} three Airbus A310-200s, three Boeing 707-320Cs, eight Boeing 737-200s and two DC-10-30s. A large {{domestic}} network serving the 19 Nigerian states was operated, as well as routes to East and West Africa; intercontinental flights from Lagos to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London, New York and Rome, from Kano to Amsterdam, Jeddah, London and Rome, and from Port Harcourt to London were also undertaken. The carrier suffered a <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> on 11 July 1991, when all 261 people on board a Douglas DC-8-61, registration C-GMXQ, crashed near Jeddah. In 1992, Nigeria Airways had three Boeing 707s impounded in Europe, {{and the number of}} flights experienced a 32% reduction following the termination of services to Conakry, Freetown and Robertsfield (Monrovia). Privatisation was first considered in 1993 with a proposal to split Nigeria Airways in two companies, one bearing the same name and operating domestic routes and a new one named Air Nigeria, which would undertake the international operations. In July 1994, an Airbus was impounded at London Heathrow Airport owing to a debt worth ₤100,000. On 21 December of the same year, a Boeing 707, registration 5N-ABK, crashed near Hadejia on a freighter flight from Jeddah, killing three of a crew of five. Further staff reductions continued throughout {{the first half of the}} 1990s, and at September 1995 the airline had 4,500 employees. In 1997 the UK Civil Aviation Authority banned the airline from operating into its territory citing safety concerns; in return, the Nigerian government barred British Airways from operating in the country. The service was restored in 1998 when the carrier began codesharing with British Airways, deploying a leased Boeng 747-200 that wore a Nigeria Airways livery and was operated on the Lagos–London Heathrow route with mixed English and Nigerian crews. By the late 1990s, the Nigerian government decided the carrier would be privatised by selling 40% and 20% to foreign and local investors, respectively, and keeping the rest of the shares. In 1999, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) was commissioned by the Nigerian government to assist in the process of restructuring and privatisation of the airline. Among three options, one of them was to partner with a large European airline; Air France, British Airways, German-based Lufthansa, Swissair and the British carrier Virgin were all considered. Another alternative was to liquidate the carrier.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Amon, now {{driving for}} the Matra factory team, once again scored a {{pre-season}} victory, {{this time at}} the Argentine Grand Prix. Once the Formula One season had begun, he managed to convert a third-place start at the Spanish GP into a third-place podium finish and scored a couple of fifth places in the South African and French GPs. Apart from these results, however, his run of poor F1 returns continued. He had a <b>major</b> <b>accident</b> at the Nürburgring and it sidelined him for the next race at the Österreichring.
