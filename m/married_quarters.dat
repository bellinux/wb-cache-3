5|$|In 1924, the Air Ministry officially {{separated}} the two sites administratively, {{so that the}} depot site and accommodation site (RAF Blenheim Crescent) were considered two separate RAF stations. Between 1920 and 1939, the original accommodation buildings {{in the north of}} the site were replaced by new <b>married</b> <b>quarters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere on the Camp, the Army began {{replacing}} the wartime Nissen huts with more permanent structures. New barracks opened in 1955, and the Headquarters of the Army in Scotland arrived {{the same year}} from Edinburgh Castle. Further land was purchased from Lord Rosebery and <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> were built close to the river. In 1966, a purpose-built office block, by architects Bowhill Gibson and Laing, was constructed within the walled garden, and named Annandale Block in honour of the builder of Craigiehall. Craigiehall Camp was also {{the site of a}} Cold War Anti-Aircraft Operations Room, built in the 1950s. The two-storey, reinforced concrete structure was listed in 2016 as the best surviving example of its type in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was born}} on 19 June 1903 in Dover. His parents, William—a {{corporal}} in the Royal Garrison Artillery—and Marion Hammond (née Crisp), lived in the <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> at Dover Castle where Walter was born. They had wed the previous December. Hammond spent his early years in Dover, often playing cricket. When he was five years old, his father was posted to Hong Kong {{to serve on the}} China Station and promoted to sergeant. The family remained there until 1911, followed by a posting to Malta until 1914. Hammond later recalled playing cricket in Malta using improvised equipment, including a soldier's old bat which he believed taught him to strike the ball powerfully.|$|E

5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{buildings of}} RAF Handforth are the government pay offices {{adjacent to the}} Total Fitness gym on Dairyhouse Lane. These buildings were the Headquarters of the depot and have survived in military/MoD use to this day. The depot had satellite sites within Cheadle Hulme, these being Site Number 5, general storage (beneath the Eden Park road housing development which, until the housing development began still maintained the internal road layout and building foundations) and site number 6 (motor transport storage area) which is now covered by part of the Hursthead housing estate. Three large (150ft × 250ft) steel built, vehicle storage sheds stood at the junction of Malmesbury Road and Lyncombe Close/Tintern Road. The last of these sheds survived well into the 1980s and was latterly used by the local council as a rubbish dump. This stood between Tollard Close and Tintern Road. The houses on May Avenue were built by the RAF as <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> and exist to this day.|$|E
25|$|The 1930s {{started with}} the {{building}} of the RASC Lines on the edge of Louisburg Barracks. This brought about the demolition in 1937 of the old wooden huts at both Quebec and St Lucia barracks, with new brick built 100-man barracks in their place. After these buildings were also demolished in 1973, the site was redeveloped as today's <b>married</b> <b>quarters.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{museum is}} located in the {{military}} gaol which was built in 1847. The building has undergone few changes from when it was built despite its multiple uses, including as a girls reformatory, a <b>married</b> <b>quarter,</b> a store and offices.|$|R
25|$|As of 2012 a {{majority}} of the accommodation blocks have been demolished. The hangars and offices are used as an industrial estate housing many businesses. The flight line is fenced off and used for storage of mainly ex-military equipment awaiting resale. The <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> are private housing, forming the new village of Brookenby. There is also a memorial to 460 Squadron (RAAF) consisting of a memorial plaque and benches around the former ident square.|$|E
25|$|The {{routine of}} the Fort governed {{the lives of}} its occupants. New {{recruits}} were given rigorous training by experienced non-commissioned officers, but given few privileges until they had fully joined their regiment. Married recruits were normally not accepted – indeed soldiers had to notify their commanding officer and, at times, gain his approval to marry. Prior to World War I, 'the married establishment', that is those who were entitled to <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> and rations, was severely restricted.|$|E
25|$|Royal Air Force Station Binbrook or RAF Binbrook is {{a former}} Royal Air Force station, now closed, located near Binbrook, Lincolnshire, England. The old {{domestic}} site (<b>married</b> <b>quarters)</b> has been renamed to become the village of Brookenby. RAF Binbrook was primarily used by Bomber Command.

25|$|Aldershot Military Town {{is located}} between Aldershot and North Camp near Farnborough. It is a {{garrison}} town {{that serves as}} the location for the military presence in the area. It houses Aldershot Garrison's <b>married</b> <b>quarters,</b> barracks, Army playing fields and other sporting facilities. The military town includes some local landmarks, such as the Aldershot Observatory, Aldershot Military Cemetery, the Royal Garrison Church and other churches.

25|$|In 1906, {{a junior}} school {{was built in}} Station Road, Bordon and an infant school in Lamerton Road. The infant school was only used in the {{afternoon}} for schooling, being used for military instruction in the morning. Prior to the Education Act 1944, these were controlled by the military, after which they came {{under the control of}} Hampshire County Council Local Education Authority. In 1965, a new junior school opened in Budds Lane {{on the site of the}} former <b>married</b> <b>quarters,</b> while the infants moved to the former junior school. The old infants school was demolished in 1966. In 1979, a new infants school opened in Budds Lane, and the old school leased to the local authority, named Barbados House after the earlier barracks on the site. The building today houses the Phoenix Theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the fort underwent substantial changes around this time. The casemates, which were now vulnerable to the more powerful artillery that had been developed since they were built, were covered almost up to roof level by an earthen glacis. Their interiors were also partly infilled with rubble, as was the defensive ditch {{in front of the}} casemates, providing additional protection against enemy fire as it helped to camouflage the structure. Two light quick-firing guns with ammunition lockers were installed on the fort's roof to guard against small, fast-moving threats such as torpedo boats. The rest of the fort remained intact but was now used as a barracks for the wing batteries. Three of the truncated casemates were converted into <b>married</b> <b>quarters,</b> one became officers' quarters and the final three were used by the men. An additional set of detached quarters for a Warrant Officer and a small detachment of Royal Engineers was constructed to the south-east of the fort, along with barrack stores.|$|E
50|$|In 1978 two NCOs (non-commissioned officers) {{from the}} Royal Military Police Mounted Troop in Aldershot, were {{detached}} {{to form the}} new detachment. They were housed in a former <b>married</b> <b>quarter</b> opposite the NAAFI shop within the camp's perimeter and the horses were stabled at what was originally the camp's Commanding Officer's Residence.|$|R
50|$|The RAF {{left the}} station in 1964, but the aerodrome was reopened in 1966 as a civil airport. The {{airfield}} was named Teesside International Airport in the 1960s, and was renamed Durham Tees Valley Airport in 2004. In the late 1980s the entire <b>Married</b> <b>Quarter</b> estate was sold to a Roger Byron-Collins company and was renamed The Virginia Estate.|$|R

500|$|An 1883 Sanitary Order in Council {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} health risks defined Flat Bastion Road {{as one of the}} boundaries of the [...] "streets, ramps, roads, lanes, passages, alleys, stairs and public places" [...] within which the new regulations would apply. The Army Medical Department reported in 1889 that several cases of diphtheria had occurred in the <b>married</b> <b>quarters</b> on Flat Bastion Road. It turned out that the rainwater pipes from the roof were cracked. The pipes were connected directly to the sewer, and sewer gas was escaping into the rooms.|$|E
500|$|The road angles {{along the}} west side of the Rock of Gibraltar to the Flat Bastion, a fortification. [...] <b>Married</b> <b>quarters</b> were built along the road. In the nineteenth century there were {{outbreaks}} of yellow fever in the 1820s and of diphtheria in the 1880s among the residents, apparently due to faulty sewers. Developments included, in the 1830s a school for poor children which remained in use as a school into the early twentieth century and a club where masked balls were held. [...] In modern times the bastion's magazine has been refurbished for civilian use, the barracks have been converted into affordable housing, and parking has become an issue.|$|E
500|$|When Tracy struck Darwin, the RAN had a {{total of}} 351 {{personnel}} based in the city, along with four {{the small number of}} men limited the capability of the RAN to render immediate assistance to the citizens of Darwin.
