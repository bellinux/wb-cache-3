500|$|After {{moving to}} Los Angeles in 1960, Ike Turner's estranged wife, Lorraine Turner, left her and Ike's sons, Ike Jr. (born October 3, 1958) and Michael (born 1960), {{to be raised}} by Ike and Tina. During Ike and Lorraine's divorce trial, Ike sent the four boys to live with Tina at her home. In 1985, Ike accused Tina of bad parenting, even alleging she had sent Michael to a mental hospital. Tina denied his claims, telling Australian {{magazine}} TV Week, [...] "he gave <b>me</b> <b>those</b> children and not a penny to look after them with." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Boys in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture {{entitled}} Anniyan. It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project Robot revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his [...] "dream project" [...] and disclosed {{that it would be}} a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, [...] "The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long before I started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with <b>me.</b> <b>Those</b> were the seeds. I make films based on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Except in {{reviews of}} work by contemporaries, early {{examples}} of which appear in Authors Dead and Living (1926), Lucas adopted the historical and biographical approach to criticism and examined the views of earlier critics, whose dogmatism he was swift to rebut. He increasingly linked his studies to developments in Psychology, notably in Literature and Psychology (1951). [...] "The real 'unwritten laws'," [...] he observed, [...] "seem to <b>me</b> <b>those</b> of human psychology." [...] Centrally, he discussed the writer's psychology as revealed through style. [...] "Even science has invented no pickle for embalming a man like style," [...] he noted.|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, {{other members}} of both groups appear to have {{remained}} on good terms since the initial controversy. Regarding the perceived conflict, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stated [...] "There was never any fight between us, that {{was a bunch of}} bullshit created by the media. I mean I think they're a good band. Maybe there was some things said between Anthony and the singer , but it all means nothing to <b>me.</b> <b>Those</b> guys in the band are nice people and there's no fight." [...] At a 2014 show in Brooklyn, the band also notably covered a portion of the Chuck Mosley-era song [...] "We Care a Lot".|$|E
2500|$|Church {{leaders have}} {{encouraged}} their flock {{to take advantage}} of government assistance in the form of welfare and the WIC (woman-infant-child) programs. [...] Since the government recognizes only one woman as the legal wife of a man, the rest of his wives are considered single mothers and are eligible to receive government assistance. The more wives and children one has, the more welfare checks and food stamps one can receive. By 2003, for example, more than $6 million in public funds were being channeled into the community of Colorado City, Arizona. In his book Under the Banner of Heaven (p.15), Jon Krakauer writes that, [...] "Fundamentalists call defrauding the government 'bleeding the beast' and regard it as a virtuous act." [...] Carolyn Campbell ("Inside Polygamy in the '90s,", 102) adds, [...] "The attitude of some polygamists is 'the government is untrustworthy and corrupt, and I'm above it, but give <b>me</b> <b>those</b> food stamps and free medical care.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Terry {{divorced}} {{his wife}} of 19 years, Cindy, and married his former church assistant, Andrea Sue Kollmorgen. Kollmorgen, born c. 1976, was approximately 25 {{at the time of}} their nuptials; As a consequence of the divorce, the home on [...] where he had lived with Cindy and their four children was to be sold. His decision to divorce in 2000 to marry Kollmorgen was unfavorably contrasted by some in the press to his own judgment expressed in his 1995 book, The Judgment of God: [...] "Families are destroyed as a father vents his mid-life crisis by abandoning his wife for a 'younger, prettier model.' [...] " [...] His sentiments against divorce had been so strong that when his own parents divorced, [...] "Randall refused to let his children speak with their grandfather for three years," [...] according to interviews with the family done by the Washington Post. As a result of Terry's divorce from Cindy Dean, the pastor of the Landmark Church of Binghamton, New York, [...] "unceremoniously tossed him out" [...] although Terry had been a member there for 15 years. That church had previously censured him for abandoning his wife and the two children still at home in preparation for divorce, and for a [...] "pattern of repeated and sinful relationships and conversations with both single and married women." [...] After the censure and expulsion, Terry joined the Charismatic Episcopal Church, a denomination established in 1992. After a period of study commencing in 2005, Terry formally converted to Roman Catholicism in 2006, taking the confirmation name [...] "David Mark." [...] After his conversion, he disavowed the first marriage and divorce, saying, [...] "There were tragic problems that were inherent to the marriage. According to Catholic doctrine as it has been taught to <b>me,</b> <b>those</b> problems made it an invalid sacrament." ...|$|E
