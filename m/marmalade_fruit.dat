40|$|The serum gastrin {{responses}} and the integrated gastrin responses to eating three meals of very different composition were {{studied in the}} same normal subjects on different days. Two meals, a milk meal of 500 ml, and a breakfast of eggs, toast, butter, <b>marmalade,</b> <b>fruit</b> juice and coffee, were eaten at breakfast time. The serum gastrin responses to these meals were compared and contrasted with the concentrations observed when the subjects fasted over the same time of day. A steak meal was eaten at lunch time. There {{were no significant differences}} between the mean serum gastrin concentrations to the three meals but each meal produced a significant increase in serum gastrin above fasting levels. When the prefeeding gastrin concentration was subtracted from the gastrin responses then the integrated responses to the steak meal were greater than those to either of the breakfast meals. Considerable variability in response to any one meal was observed within the group of subjects, but those subjects who produced high serum gastrin concentrations to one meal did so to the others. Conversely, at low response to one meal was reflected in low responses to the other two meals. Fasting serum gastrin concentration was correlated with the age of the subject. Repeatability of the response to one meal was tested in two subjects who ate the same meal on four separate occasions showing their responses to be repeatable...|$|E

40|$|Jams, jellies and {{preserves}} are {{foods with}} many textures, flavors, and colors. They all consist of fruits preserved mostly {{by means of}} sugar and they are thickened or jellied to some extent. Fruit jelly is a semi-solid mixture of fruit juice and sugar that is clear and firm enough to hold its shape. Jam also will hold its shape, but it is less firm than jelly. Jam is made from crushed or chopped fruits and sugar. Jams made from a mixture of fruits are usually called conserves, especially when they include citrus fruits, nuts, raisins, or coconut. Preserves are made of small, whole fruits, or uniform-size pieces of fruits in a clear, thick, slightly jellied syrup. <b>Marmalades</b> are soft <b>fruit</b> jellies with small pieces of fruit or citrus peel evenly suspended in a transparent jelly.

Studied the gelation process of jelly masses. Investigated rheological characteristics of jelly mass with fruit and pureed fruits of chokeberry. Determined that the effective viscosity of marmalade mass decreases with increasing shear rate, with adding fructose. The greater the content of fructose in the formulations, the less the viscosity change with increasing shear rate. Replacing sugar with fructose allows to get jelly masses with lower viscosity. Determined values of plastic strength of jelly masses. It was found that replacement of sugar to fructose reduces the plastic strength, {{but in spite of}} this strength is sufficient to maintain a good jelly structure. Defined organoleptic and physical-chemical indicators of marmalade quality. In formulation was saddled pureed fruits of chokeberry, which significantly increase the nutritional value of products. Presented an innovative production line of fruit-jelly marmalade with a vacuum syringe of continuous action, delivering high performance with minimal cost of products, simplifies the manufacturing process because drying step is eliminated, shortened processes of curing and cooling.

40|$|Levulose (D-fructose, fruit sugar), C 6 H 12 O 6 {{is a white}} {{crystalline}} ketohexose. This sugar has distinctive properties {{which make}} it of commercial interest. It is more costly than ordinary table sugar (sucrose). Levulose {{is characterized by a}} high degree of sweetness (6), great solubility (20), and medical usefulness when administered intravenously. Joslin (21) and Root and Baker (32) found levulose to be of great value in the treatment of diabetes. According to Daniel (8), it is assimilated and oxidized more quickly than sucrose, supplying the necessary energy requirements for the human system. Additional uses of levulose have been reported by McGlumphy and Eichinger (27), which include its application to improve the quality and the flavor of jams, jellies, <b>marmalades,</b> canned <b>fruits,</b> carbonated beverages, and corn sugar. Plants of the family compositae contain large amounts of levulose polymers, but the dahlia, chicory, and Jerusalem artichoke are the most promising sources because of the high levulose content and the ease of production (13). The tubers of Jerusalem artichoke were used in this study because they offer an inexpensive and prolific source from which levulose can be extracted. Since most of the levulose units in the artichoke tubers are linked together to form inulin or carbohydrate intermediate compounds between inulin and levulose, it is necessary to hydrolyze the material in order to free the levulose. Several investigators have reported the use of acid compounds. Anderson and Greaves (1) used H 2 SO 4 for hydrolysis, while Yamasaki (41) used HC 1 for the same purpose. Kleiderer and Englis (23) obtained complete hydrolysis of inulin by use of CO 2 and SO 2 at a pressure of 1000 pounds per square inch at 150 o C. for 60 minutes. As fare as can be determined from the literature, little work was done prior to 1953 using radioactive material to study peaceful uses of atomic energy. Since that time, a law was passed by the United States Congress authorizing the use of radioactive material for peaceful purposes, thereby making it possible to use atomic energy for this study. Since previous work has shown that gamma rays can convert starch to simple sugar (33), it was therefore, assumed that the inulin and other carbohydrate intermediates of Jerusalem artichoke upon hydrolysis by beta or gamma rays might yield fructose (35). The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of beta and gamma rays on inulin and other carbohydrate intermediate compounds present in the Jerusalem artichoke tubers and to compare the results with those obtained by hydrolysis with radiation plus hydrochloric acid...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of food additives and recent dietary surveys {{carried out in}} Denmark have earlier been used to estimate the intake of sweeteners and nitrite in relation to ADI values. The ubiquitous use of the preservatives benzoic and sorbic acid {{raises the question of}} the magnitude of the intake of these preservatives in relation to ADI values, which is explored in the present investigation. The content of benzoic and sorbic acid in all food groups, where they are allowed, has been monitored in Denmark 17 times from 2001 to 2006 with a total of 1526 samples. Transgressions of maximum limits, illegal use or declaration faults have been found in about 3 % of the samples. From repeated investigations on fat based foods (salads and dressings), <b>marmalade</b> and stewed <b>fruit</b> it can be concluded that the amounts used by the industry have been relatively stable through the whole period, although limited data for marmalade show some variation. Most foods in the categories soft drinks, dressing, fat based salads, pickled herrings and marmalade contain benzoic and sorbic acid, and sliced bread contain in some cases also sorbic acid. The median daily intake and intake distribution of benzoic and sorbic acid have been calculated with data from the Danish National Survey of Dietary Habits and Physical Activity (age: 4 - 75 years) conducted in 2000 - 04 with 5785 participants. The median intakes of both benzoic acid and sorbic acid are well below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) values of 0 - 5 mg/kg bw/day and 0 - 25 mg/kg bw/day for benzoic and sorbic acid respectively. However, the 90 th percentile based on the average of the samples with a content of benzoic acid is higher than the ADI value {{for both men and women}} with the highest value of 16 mg/kg bw/day for both boys and girls in the age group 4 - 6 year old [...] Based on the average of all the samples the 95 th percentile is over the ADI value for men up to 34 years and for women up to 24 years and the 90 th percentile for men up to 18 years and for women up to 10 years. Soft drinks, salads and dressing are the main contributors to the benzoic acid intake. The sorbic acid intake based on the average of all samples is well below the ADI value. However, for the intake based on the average of samples with content the 95 th percentile exceeds the ADI. This is caused by the dominating contribution to the intake of sorbic acid from sliced bread, but since only 7 out of 42 samples have added sorbic acid, the calculation based on the average of samples with content will exaggerate the intake. With the built in safety factor of 100 in the ADI values and judging from the literature the high intakes of benzoic acid should not cause any concern for ill effects. However, there must be reason to reconsider the maximum limits especially for benzoic acid in soft drinks, dressing and salads and for sorbic acid in sliced bread...|$|R
