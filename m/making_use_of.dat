40|$|We {{study the}} Green’s {{function}} for the linearized Boltzmann equation. For the short-time period, the Green’s function {{is dominated by}} the particle-like waves; and for large-time, by the fluid-like waves exhibiting the weak Huygens principle. The fluidlike waves are constructed by the spectral analysis and complex analytic techniques, <b>making</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the rotational symmetry of the equation in the space variables. The particle-like waves are constructed by a Picard iteration, <b>making</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> the exchange of regularity in the microscopic velocity with the regularity in the space variables through a Mixture Lemma. We obtain the pointwise estimates in the space and time variables of the Green’s function through a long-short waves and particle-wave decompositions...|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} {{development of}} vector spaces {{is due to}} the construction of function spaces by Lebesgue. This was later formalized by Banach and Hilbert, around 1920. At that time, algebra and the new field of functional analysis began to interact, notably with key concepts such as spaces of p-integrable functions and Hilbert spaces. Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started <b>making</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> this concept.|$|E

In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} vivipary. Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, <b>making</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
