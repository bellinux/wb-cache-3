5|$|Because an ASIC is (by definition) {{specific}} {{to a given}} application, it can be fully optimized for that application. As a result, for a given application, an ASIC tends to outperform a general-purpose computer. However, ASICs are created by UV photolithography. This process requires a mask set, which can be extremely expensive. A mask set can cost over a million US dollars. (The smaller the transistors required for the chip, the more expensive the mask will be.) Meanwhile, performance increases in general-purpose computing over time (as described by Moore's law) tend to wipe out these gains in {{only one or two}} chip generations. High initial cost, and the tendency to be overtaken by Moore's-law-driven general-purpose computing, has rendered ASICs unfeasible for most parallel computing applications. However, some have been built. One example is the PFLOPS RIKEN MDGRAPE-3 machine which uses custom ASICs for <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>simulation.</b>|$|E

25|$|A <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>simulation</b> {{requires}} {{the definition of}} a potential function, or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact.

2500|$|Geometry {{optimization}} {{is fundamentally}} different from a <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>simulation.</b> The latter simulates the motion of molecules with respect to time, subject to temperature, chemical forces, initial velocities, Brownian motion of a solvent, and so on, via the application of Newton's laws of Motion. This means that the trajectories of the atoms which get computed, have some physical meaning. Geometry optimization, by contrast, does not produced a [...] "trajectory" [...] with any physical meaning – it is concerned with minimization of the forces acting on each atom {{in a collection of}} atoms, and the pathway via which it achieves this lacks meaning.

2500|$|Design of a <b>molecular</b> <b>dynamics</b> <b>simulation</b> should {{account for}} the {{available}} computational power. Simulation size (n=number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be {{long enough to be}} relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the kinetics of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep. Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA [...] use data from simulations spanning nanoseconds (10−9 s) to microseconds (10−6 s). To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.|$|E
