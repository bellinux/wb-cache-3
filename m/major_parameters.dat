50|$|Thermodynamic {{power cycles}} {{are the basis}} for the {{operation}} of heat engines, which supply most of the world's electric power and run the vast majority of motor vehicles. Power cycles can be organized into two categories: real cycles and ideal cycles. Cycles encountered in real world devices (real cycles) are difficult to analyze {{because of the presence of}} complicating effects (friction), and the absence of sufficient time for the establishment of equilibrium conditions. For the purpose of analysis and design, idealized models (ideal cycles) are created; these ideal models allow engineers to study the effects of <b>major</b> <b>parameters</b> that dominate the cycle without having to spend significant time working out intricate details present in the real cycle model.|$|E

50|$|The {{breakthrough}} for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto {{and co-workers}} idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with the separation device located {{external to the}} reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on coarse bubble aeration to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude {{lower than that of}} the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the <b>major</b> <b>parameters</b> in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{several types of}} traffic behavior, that can have {{significant}} impact on network performance, were discovered: long-range dependence, self-similarity and, more recently, multifractality.There are two <b>major</b> <b>parameters</b> generated by network traffic models: packet length distributions and packet inter-arrival distributions. Other parameters, such as routes, distribution of destinations, etc., are of less importance. Simulations that use traces generated by network traffic models usually examine a single node in the network, such as a router or switch; factors that depend on specific network topologies or routing information are specific to those topologies and simulations. The problem of packet size distribution is fairly well-understood today. Existing models of packet sizes {{have proven to be}} valid and simple. Most packet size models do not consider the problem of order in packet sizes. For example, a TCP datagram in one direction is likely to be followed by a tiny ACK in the other direction about half of one Round-Trip Time (RTT) later. The problem of packet inter-arrival distribution is much more difficult. Understanding of network traffic has evolved significantly over the years, leading to a series of evolutions in network traffic models.|$|E
