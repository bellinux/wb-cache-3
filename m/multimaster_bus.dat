50|$|The {{hardware}} {{was again}} a multiprocessor structure with 16 processors sharing a common memory but this latter one {{was not a}} separate PCB but, rather than this, it was distributed among the 16 PCBs to avoid single points of failure. The interconnection of PCBs was a shared <b>multimaster</b> <b>bus</b> of 40Mbit/s capacity as designed and manufactured by the company DIMAT, S.A.. It also included a series channel for maintenance, monitoring, reprogramming and reinitialization of the different modules by a terminal connected to them. The software was developed by ENHER {{in collaboration with the}} company DIMAT, S.A.. The routing algorithm continue to be the same but the distance function was changed to a less dynamic one. A flow control procedure based on metering the congestion and backwards indication to the source was introduced.|$|E
