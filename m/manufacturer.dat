40|$|In {{this paper}} we use Colombian {{manufacturing}} data on exports and external financing {{for the period}} 1998 − 2006 to estimate the credit elasticity of exports. We use bank-firm linked data to construct a supply side instrument for a <b>manufacturer’s</b> demand of credit, which we use to address the reverse causality between a <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue and its demand for credit. We find that access to credit produces a significant increase on a <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue explained by {{the positive effect of}} credit on an exporter’s market reach - number of destinations -. Across <b>manufacturers</b> the effect of credit on a <b>manufacturer’s</b> export revenue varies by size. While medium sized <b>manufacturers</b> use credit to increase their market reach, market penetration and product mix, large <b>manufacturers</b> only use credit to increase their market reach. Small <b>manufacturers</b> do not seem to benefit from bank credit. ...|$|R
