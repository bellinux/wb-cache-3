While he had the complete support of <b>mint</b> <b>directors</b> Moore and Patterson, he was also held in high esteem by the common mint workers and Philadelphia's scientific elite.

50|$|In spring 2016 {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the Netherlands after an episode of the television program Keuringsdienst van Waarde showed that euro coins from the Netherlands and other countries are produced by the South Korean company Poongsan. This company is also a known producer of cluster munitions. Cluster munitions are banned internationally by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM), because of their indiscriminate and long-term effects on civilians. The CCM prohibits the use, produce, retain or transfer cluster munitions as well as assistance with these acts. After parliamentary questions were posed, the Dutch government stated that the Royal Dutch Mint had ordered around 40 million 'coin blanks' between 2011 and 2016, and that Poongsan was {{on a list of}} vetted suppliers of the European Commission's <b>Mint</b> <b>Directors</b> Working Group. Since then, both the Royal Dutch Mint and the Norwegian Mint have excluded Poongsan as a coin blank supplier due to its involvement in cluster munitions. In the European Parliament, questions were also raised about Poongsan's presence on the vetted list of coin blank suppliers of the European Commission's <b>Mint</b> <b>Directors</b> Working Group. However, the Commission claimed responsibility on this issue lies with the member states of the Union.|$|E
