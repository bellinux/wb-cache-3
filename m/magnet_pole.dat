50|$|For the large-diameter {{magnetic}} bearing system {{required in the}} ESE, stiffness and radial growth after spin-up are problems that would be encountered. Radial growth of sufficient magnitude would result in stability problems, and a <b>magnet</b> <b>pole</b> positioning system {{would be required to}} maintain the appropriate clearances for the operation of the system. This positioning system would require high-speed sensing and positioning. A passive magnetic laminate and its mounting hardware would require high structural integrity to resist the extremely high inertial forces and would most likely drive an increase in weight.|$|E
50|$|As {{the magnet}} moves {{with respect to}} the coil, the {{magnetic}} flux linkage of the coil changes. This induces an EMF in the coil, which in turn causes a current to flow. One or more times per revolution, just as the <b>magnet</b> <b>pole</b> moves away from the coil and the magnetic flux begins to decrease, a cam opens the contact breaker and interrupts the current. This causes the electromagnetic field in the primary coil to collapse rapidly. As the field collapses rapidly there is a large voltage induced (as described by Faraday's Law) across the primary coil.|$|E

This is an accelerator in which the particles are accelerated in a ring of constant radius. An immediate advantage over cyclotrons is that the magnetic field need only be present over the actual region of the particle orbits, which is much narrower than that of the ring.

50|$|There {{are three}} types of power {{handling}} in loudspeaker drivers, including woofers: thermal (heat), electrical (both covered above), and mechanical. The mechanical power handling limit is reached when cone excursion extends to its maximum limit. Thermal power handling limits may be reached when fairly high power levels are fed to a woofer for too long, even if not exceeding mechanical limits at any time. Most of the energy applied to the voice coil is converted to heat, not sound; all of the heat is ultimately passed to the pole piece, {{the rest of the}} magnet structure, and the frame. From the woofer structure, the heat is eventually dissipated into the surrounding air. Some drivers include provisions for better cooling (e.g., vented <b>magnet</b> <b>pole</b> pieces, dedicated heat conduction structures) to reduce increased coil/magnet/frame temperatures during operation, especially high power level conditions. If too much power is applied to the voice coil as compared to its ability to shed heat, it will eventually exceed a maximum safe temperature. Adhesives can melt, the voice coil former can melt or distort, or the insulation separating the voice coil windings can fail. Each of these events will damage the woofer, perhaps beyond usability.|$|E

Hypothetical effects of the SMF orientation and the presence of ions in the sample are also unclear.

We found that the relative position of the <b>magnet</b> <b>poles</b> affected the magnetic field orientation, strength, and the spatial magnetic gradients established throughout the sample. Thus, the SMF strength ranged from 107 to 359 mT when unlike <b>magnet</b> <b>poles</b> faced each other whereas it ranged from 0 to 241 mT when like <b>magnet</b> <b>poles</b> were next to each other. At both conditions, we did not detect any effect of the SMFs on the time at which nucleation occurred, the extent of supercooling, and the phase transition and total freezing times in both pure water and 0. 9 % NaCl solutions. More experiments, under well-characterized SMFs, should be performed to definitively evaluate the ability of SMFs in improving food freezing.
