5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E

25|$|Alexander Kazembek's father, Hadji Kasim Kazem-Bey, was a {{prominent}} Azeri Muslim cleric and {{a native of the}} city of Derbent (then part of the Quba Khanate, Qajar Persia, later part of Russia), whose father (Alexander Kazembek's paternal grandfather) Nazir Muhammad khan was paymaster general of the Derbent Khanate. On his way back from a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad Qasim Kazim-bey visited Rasht (present-day Gilan province, Iran) and <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Sharafnisa, daughter of the local governor Bagher-khan. The two married and settled in Rasht, where Kazembek was born. In 1811, his father was appointed qadhi in Derbent, and the family moved there. Kazembek completed his studies in Islam and, already fluent in Azeri and Persian, also excelled in Russian, Turkish and Arabic. At the age of 17, he wrote his first book named Topics in Grammar of the Arabic Language (originally in Arabic). His father wanted him to become a Muslim scholar and was going to send him away to Persia and Arabia to master Islamic studies. However, in 1820, Muhammad Qasim Kazim-bey was charged with espionage on behalf of Persia, deprived of his religious title and exiled to Astrakhan along with his wife.|$|E
25|$|Wild Cat Exchanged for Crown Prince (狸貓換太子): Bao Zheng <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{claiming}} to be {{the mother of the}} reigning Emperor Renzong. Dozens of years prior, she had been Consort Li, an imperial concubine of Emperor Zhenzong's, before falling out of favour for supposedly giving birth to a bloody dead wild cat. In reality, the jealous Consort Liu had plotted with eunuch Guo Huai (郭槐) to secretly swap Li's infant with a skinned wildcat minutes after the birth and ordered palace maid Kou Zhu to kill the baby. However, Kou gave the baby to chief eunuch Chen Lin (陳琳), who secretly brought the child to the Eighth Prince, a younger brother of Emperor Zhenzong. Kou was later tortured to death by Guo when Consort Liu began to suspect that the infant had survived. The child was raised by the Eighth Prince as his own son and was subsequently selected to succeed Emperor Zhenzong, who had died heirless. Due to the passage of time, gathering evidence was a challenge. With the help of a woman dressed as Kou's ghost, Bao dressed himself as Yama, lord of Hell, to play on both Guo's fear of the supernatural and guilt, thereby extracting his confession. When the verdict was out, the emperor was reluctant to accept Consort Li. Bao then admonished the emperor and ordered that he be beaten for lack of filial piety. The emperor's Dragon Robe was beaten instead. Emperor Renzong eventually accepted his mother and elevated her as the new empress dowager.|$|E

500|$|At age 17, she {{returned}} from Northwestern [...] "in disgrace" [...] after failing {{out of school}} and unable to tell her family why. But she was compelled to continue her search for information. She found some in the novels available at the time: Nightwood, The Well of Loneliness, and Extraordinary Women. Soon thereafter, her father discovered The Well of Loneliness in a pile of other things in her bedroom. He was so appalled at what he found that he instructed her to burn the book, but did so in a letter as he was unable to speak to her about it face to face. Still eager to learn more about homosexuality, Gittings took a night course in abnormal psychology where she <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> with whom she had a brief affair, her first. At age 18, she left home to be on her own and moved to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{undertook}} {{a significant amount}} of background research in preparation for writing Moonraker; he asked his fellow correspondent on The Sunday Times, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force—the Werewolves—and German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book Men of Genius, which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb-sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming [...] "wanted to make Moonraker his most ambitious and personal novel yet." [...] Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|That night, {{the media}} and the {{delegation}} were returned to the airfield for accommodations following Jones' refusal to allow them to stay the night. The rest of the group remained. The next morning, Ryan, Speier, and Dwyer all continued their interviews, and in the morning <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who secretly expressed her wish to leave Jonestown with her family and another family. Around 11:00 A.M. local time, {{the media and}} the delegation returned and took part in interviewing Peoples Temple members. [...] Around 3:00p.m., 14 Temple defectors, and Larry Layton posing as a defector, boarded a truck and were taken to the airstrip, with Ryan wishing to stay another night to assist any others that wished to leave. Shortly thereafter, a failed knife attack on Congressman Ryan occurred while he was arbitrating a family dispute on leaving. Against Ryan's protests, Deputy Chief of Mission Dwyer ordered Ryan to leave, but he promised to return later to address the dispute.|$|E

They met when Kelly was interviewed on her Sunday Arts ABC radio program. Kelly wrote [...] "You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine" [...] for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished. Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, {{as well as with the}} Stardust Five. She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions including clarinet on six tracks of his A – Z Recordings boxed set. In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, [...] "I got lucky, I <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who said: 'It's me or it'. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' every day for a long time. Less now". The couple had separated during the making of Kelly's biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film.|$|E
500|$|Although {{book editor}} and {{university}} instructor James Michener could have avoided military service in World War II as a birthright Quaker, he {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Navy in October 1942. [...] He was not sent to the South Pacific theater until April 1944, when {{he was assigned to}} write a history of the Navy in the Pacific and was allowed to travel widely. [...] He survived a plane crash in New Caledonia; the near-death experience motivated him to write fiction, and he began listening to the stories told by soldiers. One journey took him to the Treasury Islands, where he discovered an unpleasant village, called Bali-ha'i, populated by [...] "scrawny residents and only one pig". [...] Struck by the name, Michener wrote it down and soon began to record, on a battered typewriter, his version of the tales. On a plantation on the island of Espiritu Santo, he <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Bloody Mary; she was small, almost toothless, her face stained with red betel juice. [...] Punctuated with profanity learned from GIs, she complained endlessly to Michener about the French colonial government, which refused to allow her and other Tonkinese to return to their native Vietnam, lest the plantations be depopulated. [...] She told him also of her plans to oppose colonialism in French Indochina. These stories, collected into Tales of the South Pacific, won Michener the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.|$|E

2500|$|Post-Crisis, Freeze was revamped using {{a similar}} backstory {{to the one}} created by Paul Dini for Batman: The Animated Series. Dr. Victor Fries, Ph.D. (surname {{pronounced}} [...] "freeze") was a brilliant cryogenicist. As a child, he was fascinated with cryonics, so he began his [...] "hobby" [...] of freezing animals. His parents, horrified by his fascination, sent him to a strict boarding school, where he was miserable and felt detached from humanity. In college, he <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Nora, whom {{he fell in love}} with and ultimately married.|$|E

The DEA surveillance team determined that Gates had <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> at a Holiday Inn room registered to Susan Gates and that the couple had gotten into a car together driving toward the Chicago area.

2500|$|The {{story goes}} on to say that in England he <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> (Susanna Valeria) [...] "so abundant, so favored by Venus that nothing else would do but that he have her to wife." [...] At this point the story skips over a small matter, {{intentionally}} or not, that might well explain Thomas' future apparent inability to settle in one place, even as a renowned and successful scholar. The dedication of his edition of Rosinus' Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum to King James I, a Protestant (the king of the King James Bible), even though he, Dempster, was a Catholic, had won him an invitation to the English court; and in 1615 he went to London. There James I appointed him historiographer royal.|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 2006, five female {{graduates}} of the United States Naval Academy had a press conference promoted by the Allen campaign to assail a Washingtonian article Webb wrote in 1979.

In the article, entitled [...] "Women Can't Fight", Webb described his personal experiences in the Vietnam War as a U.S. Marine infantry officer, and explained why he believed combat was an inappropriate environment for women. Webb also wrote {{that he had never}} <b>met</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> [...] "whom [...] would trust to provide those men with combat leadership". The article also characterized the Naval Academy dormitory situation as [...] "a horny woman's dream", due to the ratio of men to women being 13⅓ to 1 at the time.|$|E
