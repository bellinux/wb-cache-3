500|$|Hepburn stayed active {{throughout}} the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as [...] "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [...] ". First she traveled to Spain to film {{a version of}} Euripides' The Trojan Women (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When asked why she had taken the role, she responded {{that she wanted to}} broaden her range and try everything while she still had time. The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics Circle named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress that year. In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels with <b>My</b> <b>Aunt,</b> but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith. Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of <b>my</b> <b>aunt,</b> Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that you are doing what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E

2500|$|Archie also {{complains}} {{that there is}} never corned beef or rye bread on Wolfe's table, and he sometimes ducks out to eat a corned beef sandwich at a nearby diner. Yet a young woman gives Wolfe a lesson in preparing corned beef hash in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death". Another contradiction is found in Plot It Yourself when Archie goes to a diner to eat [...] "fried chicken like <b>my</b> <b>Aunt</b> Margie used {{to make it back}} in Ohio," [...] since Fritz does not fry chicken. But in The Golden Spiders, Fritz prepares fried chicken for Wolfe, Archie, Saul, Orrie, and Fred.|$|E

"My {{mother and}} Aunt {{were aware of}} the earlier 'Clum' {{manuscript}} covering the Tombstone years, and for that reason were willing to burn that portion of their manuscript at Mrs. [...] Earp's request. <b>My</b> <b>aunt</b> had written that portion." [...] Laing was not a historian or writer and had not cataloged the material. She had not seen the so-called Clum manuscript and relied on Boyer's word as to its authenticity. [...] Although the exact contents of stack of materials Laing gave Boyer are unknown, Jeanne Cason Laing and other members of her family insisted that Josephine had started a manuscript with John Clum.|$|E

Anyway, she ‘forgives’ me for you. But my uncle doesn’t. he’s sort of taken this personally...it’s as though I’ve rejected him...he was more hurt than mad. Honestly hurt….he wants me to marry someone like him—someone who looks like him. A black man." [...] (Kindred, p. 111) ...|$|E

[...] He first visited Israel when he was 16: [...] "I worked on a kibbutz in the Negev and <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> lived in Beersheba. [...] It was actually a very politicising experience. When I did my bar mitzvah I saw myself as a Zionist and I think after I went there I felt it less. [...] I was more interested in the kibbutz and what I liked about it was the pioneering spirit, the sense of community and radicalism of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{his mother}} was in the hospital, Ellison brought in a mobile {{recording}} rig and set microphones around her room to gather audio samples, such as a respirator and vital-sign monitors.

On the process of recording his mother's respirator, Ellison said: [...] "I {{know it was a}} weird thing to do. I'm not the type to go out recording things like that. But I didn't want to forget that space." [...] When asked where the title came from, he said: [...] "that's the term <b>my</b> <b>aunt</b> gave my mother. It means mother as well." [...] He also used other samples, such as video game sounds.|$|E
