Departing teams {{included}} franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio.|$|E

The inside of a surveillance van used in a few scenes were shot at a set {{right next to the}} Grid set; using a set would be <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> for the filming crew. A military school in Belgravia was used to film two separate locations; the Home Office and Lindemann's office. Other scenes at the Home Office were filmed in a separate building in Roehampton.|$|E

30|$|This article {{presents}} findings from 6  days randomly selected, three from a natural environment and three from the play {{space in the}} kindergarten. This was done {{to reduce the amount}} of data and to make it <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable.</b> The context and the process of each observation were described accurately. Field notes were used, where the date, time, place, actors, activity, objects, acts, events, purpose and feelings were described. The video observations were transcribed by the researcher.|$|R
5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and it is unknown how this was achieved.|$|E
5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them <b>more</b> <b>manageable.</b> The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index the unit is assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E
5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> economic environment.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than one}} large central plant, {{that has to}} be fed a large amount of feedstock, such as a {{refinery}} that can unload a tanker shipment of petroleum if located next to an ocean, the discipline of process miniaturization envisions the distribution of the process technology to areas where the feedstock is not readily transportable in large quantities to a large centralized processing plant. The miniaturized process technology may simply involve transformation of solid biomass materials from multiple distributed microprocesses into <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> fluids. The fluids can then be transported or distributed to larger-scale intelligent processing nodes using conventional fluid transport technology.|$|R

25|$|This {{definition}} can {{be understood}} in two directions, both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics. On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group G: often, the group operation in G is abstractly given, but via ρ, it corresponds to the multiplication of matrices, which is very explicit. On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies {{the study of the}} object in question. For example, if G is finite, it is known that V above decomposes into irreducible parts. These parts in turn are much <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> than the whole V (via Schur's lemma).|$|R
30|$|Rethinking {{globally}} of {{the possible}} indications {{to the adoption of}} this technique and its advantages compared to reconstructive microsurgery, the use of zygoma-implant-supported prosthesis may be suitable for patients whose systemic conditions are poor. The duration of surgery and of the postoperative recovery would be remarkably shortened avoiding the complications related to the harvesting of a free flap. Closely related to this aspect, the cost-benefit ratio is definitely more convenient. This technique proves itself to be <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> also in non-compliant patients or in patients with limited prognosis or high risk of recurrence, allowing the clinician a more effective inspection of the resected site during follow-up consults.|$|R

25|$|Newer {{proposals}} for quality models such as Squale and Quamoco propagate a direct {{integration of the}} definition of quality attributes and measurement. By breaking down quality attributes or even defining additional layers, the complex, abstract quality attributes (such as reliability or maintainability) become <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> and measurable. Those quality models have been applied in industrial contexts but have not received widespread adoption.|$|E
25|$|In {{concrete}} situations, it is {{very difficult}} or impossible to handle morphisms in the derived category directly. Therefore, one looks for a <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> category which is equivalent to the derived category. Classically, there are two (dual) approaches to this: projective and injective resolutions. In both cases, the restriction of the above canonical functor to an appropriate subcategory will be an equivalence of categories.|$|E

Therefore, it must be further reduced to provide a <b>more</b> computationally <b>manageable</b> feature. In [14] the authors proposed using merely the cycle frequency profile of the SOF. However, in our previous work of [13] it was demonstrated that with a minimal increase in computational complexity, both the frequency profile {{as well as the}} cycle frequency profile can be used, creating a pseudo-three-dimensional image of the SOF which performs at a significantly higher degree of reliability for classification. The resulting feature used for classification is then defined as the cycle frequency profile: [...]...|$|R

Therefore, text mining systems supporting curators of biodatabases {{should be able to}} process full text articles. Beside the technical problems arising from full text parsing, the representation of the annotated full text is an important issue. Journal articles are mostly electronically available in PDF or HTML format. Also with <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> XML formats, readers {{would like to have a}} visualisation of annotations and semantic enrichment directly in the PDF or HTML.

40|$|In most Australian {{engineering}} {{schools and}} faculties, engineering {{programs are not}} ordered and deliberately structured entities. The University of Tasmania offers undergraduate engineering in twolocations, Hobart's School of Engineering offers eight specialisations and Launceston's National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics (NCMEH) at The Australian Maritime College (AMC) offers three specialisations. Preparing for EA accreditation, the Hobart and Launceston groups co-operated tomake sense of four seemingly disparate elements of engineering curriculum: the TLOs for Engineering, unit learning outcomes (ULOs), unit assessment tasks and the EA's Stage 1 Competency Standard. Inthis paper we describe processes for redeveloping, linkage and auditing of three curriculum elements to build a <b>more</b> cohesive, <b>manageable</b> curriculum structure to meet EA, QA and student expectations...|$|R
25|$|ECT {{became popular}} in the US in the 1940s. At the time, {{psychiatric}} hospitals were overrun with patients whom doctors were desperate to treat and cure. Whereas lobotomies would reduce a patient to a <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> submissive state, ECT helped to improve mood in those with severe depression. A survey of psychiatric practice in the late 1980s found that an estimated 100,000 people received ECT annually, with wide variation between metropolitan statistical areas.|$|E

25|$|For almost 400 years, {{hundreds}} of counties, cities, and towns were {{formed in the}} Colony of Virginia and later the Commonwealth of Virginia.

This two-phase process was conducted in order to establish legal claims to maximum territory. As areas were settled, the large territories were subdivided for a variety of reasons.|$|E
50|$|Internet {{operating}} system, or Internet OS, is a {{term used}} {{in the computer industry}} to refer to any type of operating system designed to run all of its applications and services through an Internet client, generally a web browser. The advantages of such an OS would be that it would run on a thin client, allowing cheaper, <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> computer systems; it would require all applications to be designed on cross-platform, open standards; and would not tie a user's applications, documents, and preferences to a single computer, but rather place them on the cloud. The Internet OS has also been promoted as the perfect type of platform for software as a service.|$|R
50|$|In any {{manifestation of}} spastic CP, clonus of the {{affected}} limb(s) may intermittently result, as well as muscle spasms, each of which results from the pain and/or stress of the tightness experienced, indicating especially hard-working and/or exhausted musculature. The spasticity itself can and usually does also lead to very early onset of muscle-stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. As compared to other types of CP, however, and especially as compared to hypotonic CP or more general paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically <b>more</b> easily <b>manageable</b> by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopaedic and neurological fronts throughout life.|$|R
50|$|More legacy-free PCs were {{introduced}} around 2000 after {{the prevalence of}} USB and broadband internet made many of the older ports and devices obsolete.

To save on special effects costs, Wilson's script described an ape society more primitive than that {{which appeared in the}} novel. The new script changed much of the plot and dialogue, but retained the Cold War themes and Serling's ending. John Chambers created the innovative makeup effects.|$|E
25|$|Affine {{transformations of}} the plane are useful for {{studying}} equidissections, including translations, uniform and non-uniform scaling, reflections, rotations, shears, and other similarities and linear maps. Since an affine transformation preserves straight lines and ratios of areas, it sends equidissections to equidissections. This means that one is free to apply any affine transformation to a polygon that might give it a <b>more</b> <b>manageable</b> form. For example, {{it is common to}} choose coordinates such that three of the vertices of a polygon are (0, 1), (0, 0), and (1, 0).|$|E
