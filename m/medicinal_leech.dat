25|$|Historically the European <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech,</b> another {{invertebrate}} parasite, {{has been}} used in medicine to remove blood from patients. They have three jaws (tripartite) that look like little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics, they suck out blood, consuming up to ten times their body weight in a single meal.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. B., {{for some}} years past, has been subject to neuralgia, which has often {{threatened}} to terminate fatally; but this can be regarded only as the mediate cause of his decease. The proximate cause was one of especial singularity. In an excursion to the Ragged Mountains, a few days since, a slight cold and fever were contracted, attended with great determination of blood to the head. To relieve this, Dr. Templeton resorted to topical bleeding. Leeches were applied to the temples. In a fearfully brief period the patient died, when it appeared that in the jar containing the leeches, had been introduced, by accident, one of the venomous vermicular sangsues which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds. This creature fastened itself upon a small artery in the right temple. Its close resemblance to the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech</b> caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late.|$|E

60|$|The {{dependency}} of one organic {{being on}} another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between beings remote {{in the scale}} of nature. This is likewise sometimes the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle {{with each other for}} existence, {{as in the case of}} locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle will almost invariably be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in number and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the <b>medicinal</b> <b>leech.</b> It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock (crossing being prevented) could be kept up for half-a-dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, in the same manner as beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not annually preserved in due proportion.|$|E

40|$|After a short {{introduction}} to the classification of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches,</b> their historical use in phlebotomy (blood-letting) and contemporary use in neurobiology and medicine are summarised. Over-collecting of wild Hirudo medicinalis in Europe led to reduced populations {{and the need to}} import other species, especially the closely related Hirudo verbana from Turkey and, more recently, the Caribbean and Asian leech, Hirudinaria manillensis. The limited information on the quantitative ecology of European <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> is summarised next. They require warm-water ponds with a range of suitable hosts, especially amphibians, to survive and prosper. <b>Medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> can persist with a low minimum viable population size, which may be typical of rare freshwater invertebrates in isolated habitats, especially species limited by high temperature requirements and specialised food sources. Phylogenetic relationships, using molecular methodology, show that {{there are at least two}} independent lineages of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> with Hirudo medicinalis, H. verbana and Hirudinaria manillensis being closely related.

Our goal was to develop a device to augment blood removal during the passive-bleeding phase of leech therapy {{with the use of a}} porcine model of venous congestion. Results indicated that the use of the device resulted in significant increases in blood retrieval relative to reports of passive bleeding alone (141 %, 156 %, and 155 % in 1, 2, and 3 hours, respectively).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Meningococcal septicemia {{remains one}} of the most common {{infectious}} causes of admission to a pediatric intensive care unit. Numerous treatment strategies aimed at the thromboembolic complications inducing purpura fulminans and limb/digital ischemia have been attempted, with variable results. The successful use of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> for pneumococcal purpura fulminans has been described, and we present a similar case of meningococcal purpura fulminans. PATIENT AND INTERVENTION: A 5 -wk-old female infant with meningococcal meningitis and septicemia and progressive purpura fulminans of the left hand was treated with <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches.</b> <b>Medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> were applied to the left dorsal hand on a daily basis for 4 consecutive days. RESULT: The swelling and limited functionality visibly improved after 48 hrs, and by 120 hrs, perfusion in the distal phalanges of the thumb and middle finger was evident. Reperfusion of the distal phalanges was not fully sustained, and at 6 wks the plastic surgery department debrided the distal phalanges of her left hand, excluding the thumb. She fully recovered from the meningococcal septicemic shock; the functionality of her left thumb was preserved, and she has limited functionality of her left hand. CONCLUSION: The unique combination of salivary products in leech therapy has theoretical benefits and requires future study.

50|$|The general {{morphology}} of <b>medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> {{follows that}} of most other leeches. Fully mature adults can be up to 20 cm in length, and are green, brown, or greenish-brown with a darker tone on the dorsal side and a lighter ventral side. The dorsal side also has a thin red stripe. These organisms have two suckers, one at each end, called the anterior and posterior suckers. The posterior is used mainly for leverage, whereas the anterior sucker, consisting of the jaw and teeth, is where the feeding takes place. <b>Medicinal</b> <b>leeches</b> have three jaws (tripartite) that look like little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin, they suck out blood whilst injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics.
