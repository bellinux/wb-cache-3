After the departure of Nicholas Sarkozy from the Ministry of Finance in June 2004, Patrick Devedjian and François Loos, at the Ministry of Industry, continued to promote and extended Pierre Delval’s initiative, {{with the support of}} Jean-François Copé, Minister for the Budget and for the Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes, an essential cog in the organisational machinery.From that time onwards, Pierre Delval argued for the setting up of a dedicated, consistent and standardised system, which would make it possible for the arsenal of repressive <b>measures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> and for proof of serious fraud - or even of the will to harm the livelihood of others - to be established before the courts, where it is required.

The selected section starts at river-km 71, 338 and ends at river-km 74, 443. The selected part of the watercourse runs through the town of Koryčany. This thesis examines the selected section of Kyjovka split into two subsections. That allows for detailed presentation of several proposed appropriate <b>measures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> at critical spots in the selected subsections. The calculation of the watercourse model and its capacity with the water level progresses for selected N(y. o.) flow rates were processed in HEC-RAS 5. 0. 1. program. Proposed flood protection measures are incorporated in the drawings...|$|E
40|$|There are, currently, 3 {{established}} clinical techniques rou-tinely {{employed to}} determine the risk of ulceration in the dia-betic foot. These are assessment of the circulation, the ner-vous control of sensation, and foot sensitivity to loading. Macrovascular measurements are used to assess sufficiency of the arterial supply to the foot. Evaluation of somatic neu-ropathy provides an indication of loss of plantar sensation. Skin pressure measurements indicate abnormalities in plan-tar loading. This combined approach is effective in allowing preventative <b>measures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> prior to the onset of ul-ceration. In contrast, clinical measurement of microvascular function in the diabetic foot is uncommon. Indeed, there re-mains uncertainty regarding the importance of micro-vascular complications {{in the development of}} foot ulcers. This is in part due to the difficulty ofmaking in vivomeasure...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the evolution of}} the geographic environment imposed by sea-level changes in selected sites of the Aegean Sea region during the Upper Holocene. The changes are due, mainly, to paroxysmic phases of the actual neotectonic evolution and to differential-in time and space-block movements, and emerged or submerged coasts. The reconstitution of these coasts is presented and, in some cases, natural harbor morphology is revealed. The use and evolution of these sites is discussed. Other sites concern coastal or inland ancient settlements or constructions affected by submersion by the sea, by the rise of the groundwater table, or by uplift movements. A general discussion on engineering <b>measures</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> for protection of the antiquities affected by these geographic changes closes the presentation. © 1994 Springer-Verlag...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A {{review of}} 33 studies {{identifies}} the factors of prior stroke, older age, urinary and bowel incontinence, and visuo-spatial deficits as adverse prognostic indicators of function. No relationship is shown between sex, hemisphere of stroke, and functional outcome. Functional admission score {{is a strong}} predictor of discharge functional status, but its relationship with improvement in function is unclear. Findings regarding the prognostic value of severity of paralysis and onset-admission delay are ambiguous. Comparison among studies is hindered by differences In patient samples, timing of assessments, criteria by which outcome is measured and measuring instrument used. Future studies should measure function at set tunes post-stroke, use functional scales whose reliability and validity is well established, and be conduct-ed in several treatment centres {{to ensure that the}} sample is representative of the population to which the predictor <b>measure</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied.</b> Stroke Vol 17, No 4, 1986 STROKE as a leading cause of disability necessitates the expenditure of considerable resources for the reha-bilitation of its victims. As a result, identifying factors that predict functional recovery after stroke has bee...|$|R
30|$|The “hypothetical scenario” {{simulated}} {{the effect}} of reintroducing the tax brackets that were valid before the flat-tax reform in 2004. Five tax brackets with rates of 10, 20, 28, 35, and 38 % were defined as in 2003; their thresholds <b>were</b> updated according <b>to</b> {{the growth of the}} average nominal wage between 2003 and 2012. As this elementary setup of tax rate regime would result in a decline in tax revenues, a further hypothetical <b>measure</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> make the fiscal effect of the reform comparable to the 2013 scenario. Specifically, the basic tax allowance is reduced by two thirds.|$|R
