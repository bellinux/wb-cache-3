The fort was of national and state military importance through 1821, used as a US Army command headquarters, and a supply depot for campaigns in the War of 1812 and later. Economically, it was important as a trading post or factory to regulate the Creek Nation's trade in deerskins. In addition, it served as a headquarters and <b>mustering</b> <b>area</b> for the Georgia state militia, so was a point of contact among the Creek Nation, the US, {{and the state of}} Georgia military and political representatives.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of April 22-23, British and Australian {{artillery}} shelled German <b>mustering</b> <b>areas.</b> At dawn the infantry was standing ready but no attack eventuated, most of the activity on this day was in air as planes from both sides criss-crossed the battlefield, bombing, strafing and engaging in dogfights. It was during one of these dogfights that the German [...] "Red Baron" [...] was shot down over Australian lines, north of Villers-Bretonneux at Corbie. The strongest evidence points to Australian sergeant, Cedric Popkin of the 24th Machine-Gun Company, 4th Division as firing the actual bullet that killed Baron Manfred von Richthofen.|$|R

5000|$|The {{settlement}} of Swift Current {{was established in}} 1883, after the CPR surveyed a railway line as far as Swift Current Creek. In 1882, initial grading and track preparation commenced, with the first settlers arriving {{in the spring of}} 1883. During the early part of its settlement, the economy was based almost exclusively on serving the new railway buildings and employees. There was also a significant ranching operation known as the [...] "76" [...] ranches. It included 10 ranches raising sheep and cattle and stretched from Swift Current to Calgary. The ranch located at Swift Current dealt with sheep. At one point there were upwards of 20,000 sheep grazing on the present day Kinetic Grounds. The head shepherd was John Oman, originally from Scotland. He donated land to build Oman School in 1913. Other early industries included gathering bison bones for use in fertilizer manufacturing, the making of bone china and sugar refining. Métis residents also ran a successful Red River ox cart [...] "freighting" [...] business to Battleford until the late 1880s. During the Riel Rebellion of 1885, Swift Current became a major military base and troop <b>mustering</b> <b>area</b> due to its proximity to Battleford but this was only for a short time. On February 4, 1904, the hamlet became a village and then a town on March 15, 1907, when a census indicated a population of 550. Swift Current became incorporated as a city on January 15, 1914, with Frank E. West being the mayor at the time.|$|R
25|$|In 1899 {{the station}} manager, Mr T. Cahill and his stockmen were {{attacked}} by Aborigines {{while they were in}} camp while out mustering. The men had been <b>mustering</b> in an <b>area</b> where a man known as Paddy the Lasher had been murdered two years earlier, and once they had made camp and were sitting down to a meal several spears were thrown at them, hitting none of the men. The party made to defend themselves and the attackers scattered. Later the same year the homestead was burned to the ground also blamed on Aborigines who had been pretty troublesome on the station lately. The first person to cycle around Australia, Arthur Charles Jeston Richardson, was to stop at the station during his ride to find the burnt out building, he later came across the mustering party to give them the bad news.|$|R
40|$|While {{there is}} a rapid growth of {{wireless}} sensor networks <b>mustered</b> in different <b>areas</b> such as military, agriculture, weather forecasting etc., an equal attention has also been paid on their security concern. A dangerous attack against these networks is Sybil attack in which one malicious node creates and propagates multiple fake identifiers. This attack mainly influences routing protocols and operations such as voting, data aggregation and reputation evaluation. In this {{paper we propose a}} distributed and efficient algorithm based on broadcasting two-hop messages to detect Sybil nodes in wireless sensor networks. In the proposed algorithm, by sending two-hop messages, each node finds its two-hop neighbors and the common neighbors between itself and each of its two-hop neighbors. The number of common neighbors is a good indicator to detect Sybil nodes. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms similar existing algorithms with respect to true and false detection rates...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate over}} a Civic Square for Hobart has been alive ever since Governor Macquarie {{instructed}} Surveyor Meehan {{to lay out}} the grid of streets in 1811. Part of Macquarie's grand plan was the creation of a large public space at the foot of Elizabeth Street on the Sullivans Cove side of Macquarie Street. This he named Georges Square in honour of the King. It was to serve variously as <b>muster</b> <b>area</b> for the convicts, parade ground for the troops and centre of the town around which all important public buildings were planned. Although the Macquarie Plan was never really fulfilled that square is present in part today as Franklin Square yet the debate over a civic square continues, having reached its height in the 1980 s when designs were submitted for a maritime flavoured public space and commercial development. These plans were also never to get much further than the drawing board. So why has the issue of a civic square remained so difficult to resolve and so controversial? This study contends that most ideas for such a square have been devoid of any considerations of the social and cultural context that is needed to have them accepted by the local people and all too often have been of a physical style or typology which is not characteristic of Hobart and therefore not easily assimilated into the city fabric. As the twentieth century draws to a close, the rapid social changes brought about by technology raise the question of the role and worth of civic spaces in the contemporary city. The relevance of such public spaces must be determined before any proposals take physical shape. At the same time recent theories of urban design have rediscovered the importance and characteristics of public space, determining that space is the primary element of the city not buildings and that the buildings are used to create the spaces. Through a process of examining the historical development of public space in Hobart, and the roles and characteristics of spaces in history and their relevance today, the study concludes that far from public space being irrelevant in today's city, it is increasingly needed to act as 'social glue'. However, in accordance with the need to apply meaning to the physical space, an analysis of the city covering amongst other things functional zones, movement patterns, landforms, climate and ambience, and cultural institutions and associations is carried out. From this analysis a key space emerges as that which offers the opportunity to extend the public realm while linking existing spaces, improving the problematic City to Cove link, providing a much needed adjunct to a major civic building and offering a new site for an isolated civic function which has historical links with the site. The space is created through repairing the city fabric by a planned intervention on the site {{at the back of the}} Hobart Town Hall and the Elizabeth Street edge of Franklin Square, and then reworking the section of Elizabeth Street as a series of connected spaces. The proposal suggests a new wing to the Town Hall abutting the Carnegie Building and running along Davey Street which would be an ideal new home for a public library function. The essence of the study is not to search for a physical site where a grand space can be created, but to recognise that Hobart has a number of smaller spaces which serve a variety of functions and a huge informal waterfront area which can be used for occasional events. What is required appears to be an intimate space which serves a multitude of functions related to city government and ·information exchange, and which links the existing spaces and major sections of the city together. The recommendations cover not only the basic characteristics of the key physical space but also management and detailed design considerations which are an integral part of making the space a 'place' which will be 'owned' by the public and used to enhance the social life of the city and its sense of cityhood. The opportunity exists to complete the new Civic Square to coincide with the bicentenary of the founding of Hobart on this site in February 2004...|$|R
