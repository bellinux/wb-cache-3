25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E

60|$|This old {{neighbor}} went to {{the train}} with us, {{knowing full well that}} he and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would <b>never</b> meet again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother! Oh, it is terrible!... He is not <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I <b>never</b> loved him. I couldn't.... But, mother, {{you must}} have loved him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{mother did}} often," [...] she said, [...] "my <b>father</b> <b>never.</b> I thought {{it made my}} mother sorrowful to speak of our prayers and duties, but <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>never</b> opened his mouth on such matters, before or since her death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not retract my word, Malcolm; but I am bound, by {{an early}} promise to <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>never</b> {{to enter the}} doors of a gaming-house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{but it is}} not, Reuben. Havena I {{heard you}} say, that your {{grandfather}} (that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> likes to hear about) did some gude langsyne to the forbear of this MacCallummore, when he was Lord of Lorn?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> quarrelled with a phrase, however {{frequently}} repeated, {{provided it}} seemed to him distinct and expressive; and Addison himself could not have found expressions so satisfactory to him as, [...] "Yours received, and duly honoured the bills enclosed, as per margin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} once more," [...] said Ranse, slowly. [...] "As I am a Truesdell {{and as you}} are <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I'll <b>never</b> marry a Curtis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Celia, [...] "I'll not be marrying {{you next}} week. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> would <b>never</b> let me marry a grocer's clerk. But I'll marry you to-night, Tommy, {{if you say}} so." ...|$|R
60|$|Jac. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was <b>never</b> so matched {{for talking}} {{in all his}} life before; he who loves to hear nothing but himself: Pr'ythee, Beatrix, stay behind, and see what this impudent Englishman would have.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{she used}} to pretend she did not believe you would. But I knew better. I knew that when she said, over and over again, 'Is <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> coming for me?' she was {{thinking}} of somebody else. And are you come to take her away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, Bickley, as usual, {{you did not}} believe? Because you did not see him, {{therefore}} the Lord Oro, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>never</b> spoke with Humphrey. As though the Lord Oro could not pass you without your knowledge, or, perchance, send thoughts clothed in his own shape to work his errand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{good many}} things that you don't dream of. You are not {{treating}} me rightly, and you know it. You don't give me decent clothing to wear, and I {{have to work harder}} than any one in the office. I am sure <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> intended such a future for his son." ...|$|E
60|$|ENID. Why {{are you so}} bitter against <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> He has <b>never</b> done {{anything}} to you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, no. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> will <b>never</b> ride {{enough to}} do him good, unless {{he wants to do}} me good. People are all {{surprised}} to see him looking so well; the country lanes make him quite blooming.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to know}} more. But I believe I'm good at reading character. It is a gift I inherited. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was <b>never</b> mistaken about a man, and he {{has made}} use of a good many." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{stopped for}} a moment. [...] "Aunt Eveline, there are my mother's pearls and diamonds, which I think I should have had. I {{did not like to}} ask for them, but I always {{understood}} they were to come to me when I was married. I don't quite understand why <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> mentioned them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{your husband}} does spoil that child, Bessy!" [...] said Mrs. Glegg, {{in a loud}} [...] "aside," [...] to Mrs. Tulliver. [...] "It'll be the ruin of her, if you don't take care. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> brought his {{children}} up so, else we should ha' been a different sort o' family to what we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Clavier {{sat still}} {{for at least}} a minute, and then obeying an impulse told her tale. Her voice was also a little {{strained}} as she said, “Clavier was bad—bad all through—and he left me before he died in Melbourne; but though <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> knew it I was married to him all the time. I found the—‘Madame’—a disadvantage.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis my Rectoress {{who sets}} me on, sir," [...] was Herbert's merry answer, looking at her. [...] "Now, Lady Rose, you'll {{keep me in}} countenance! <b>My</b> <b>father</b> has <b>never</b> heard you sing Coming through the Rye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Child, {{you have}} {{followed}} me far," [...] said the Queen, [...] "and {{now you are}} rewarded, for you have looked {{on my face and}} I have refreshed you; and the Sun, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> will <b>never</b> more hurt you for my sake." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{knew the}} reason now why <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had <b>never</b> confided {{the truth to}} anyone, his own family included. My mother had evidently confessed all to her sister under the seal of secrecy, and there the dreadful {{disclosure}} had been arrested.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> married. He {{loved her}} all the time. I've got a lovely poem home that she wrote to him. It's just wonderful, and it sings like music. Well, long, long {{afterward}} her husband died, and then she and my father made their love marriage. They didn't get married until 1882, and she was pretty well along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On twenty acres--no, ten; {{and paid}} for 'em, an' all improvements, an' {{supported}} herself, four hired men, a Swede woman an' daughter, an' her own nephew. It gets me. Ten acres! Why, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> talked less'n one hundred an' sixty acres. Even your brother Tom still talks in quarter sections.--An' {{she was only a}} woman, too. We was lucky in meetin' her." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were all}} under the pope's ban, outlaws with a price upon the head of each, hunted and harried from State to State by the papal emissaries, so that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> more dared set foot in Mondolfo, or, indeed, within the State of Piacenza, which had been rudely punished for the insubordination it had {{permitted}} to be reared upon its soil.|$|E
5000|$|Sharon {{eventually}} married Osbourne and had {{no contact}} with her father for 20 years. In 2001 she told The Guardian newspaper: [...] "The best lesson I ever had was watching him fuck his business up. He taught me everything not to do. <b>My</b> <b>father's</b> <b>never</b> even seen any of my three kids and, as far as I'm concerned, he never will." [...] Later the same year, under Ozzy's insistence, Sharon and Arden finally reconciled, with Arden making a walk-on role in the successful reality TV show The Osbournes in 2002. He also met his grandchildren Jack and Kelly for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The very same," [...] said Hepzibah. [...] "It was Alice Pyncheon's harpsichord. When I was {{learning}} music, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would <b>never</b> let me open it. So, as I could only play on my teacher's instrument, I have forgotten all my music long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, ay," [...] said Leonard, [...] "but I trow I have as {{much right}} to serve at the Prince's table as dainty Master Eustace. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> had <b>never</b> put me under Sir Reginald's charge, had he deemed I should be kept here among the serving-men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little girl," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are very}} young. Let {{me tell you}} this. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> did a kind action in his life for its own sake. He never befriended any one for any other motive than that some day or other he meant to exact some return for it. Your time hasn't come yet, {{but there will be}} {{something}} some day which will help you to understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me there. If you go upon arguments, {{they are}} never wanting, when a man has no {{constancy}} of mind. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> changed, and he preached plain moral sermons without arguments, and was a good man--few better. When you get me a good man made out of arguments, I will get you a good dinner with reading you the cookery-book. That's my opinion, and I think anybody's stomach will bear me out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank God; <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>never</b> {{mentioned}} to him anything {{he heard about}} his son, or his suspicions, therefore he {{has no reason to}} believe that the fellow is not still in the convict prison at Sydney. We shall keep it from him now, whatever happens; but it would, for his sake, be best that this shock should prove too much for him. He has had a very hard time of it altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{evidence}}--I {{have evidence}} {{to get you}} back a good share of the estate, which <b>my</b> <b>father</b> will <b>never</b> miss. And I will do it," [...] he cries, suddenly bold, [...] "I will do it for three thousand pounds down when you receive it." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{also ran}} a {{consultancy}} business, Magazine Investment and Management. Cromie described {{his relationship with}} Kerry [...] "they got on well without being especially close. He disputes reports that portray their relationship in any other way. 'I had animosity with <b>my</b> <b>father</b> – <b>never</b> with <b>my</b> brother'".|$|R
25|$|Morgan {{told the}} Sunday Times that ‘From {{the age of}} 13, I wanted to play cricket for England. I’ve never felt any shame in saying this is what I wanted to do. And the people at home {{involved}} in cricket, they were like, “Fair play, it’s going to be unbelievable if you make it”. So I’ve never had any shame about this and <b>my</b> <b>father’s</b> <b>never</b> had any shame about it.’ England {{is one of the}} ten full members of the International Cricket Council, while Ireland is an associate member. Only full member nations can play a full schedule of international cricket, including Test matches.|$|R
