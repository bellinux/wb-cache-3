Smoking indoors was banned from 1975, and a new quay was built in Levanger and opened on 1 July 1976. Local disagreement about the location of a new quay on Ytterøy delayed construction, and it did not open until 1981. In 1974, planning for a new ferry on the Ytterøy service started, although the order was not placed until June 1979. The new ferry, Ytterøy, cost NOK10.5 million, had space for 30 cars and was bi-directional. It was put into service in February 1981. Innherredsferja II was kept as a reserve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} respond to recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> users, three frequency bands are currently used for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> systems. We herein propose a three-frequency-band antenna that is useful for <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> base stations. We first developed a two-band antenna called the Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (DMTLA) that consists of two simplified MTLA of different lengths. By attaching a parasitic element to the DMTLA based on the multi-band technique using parallel transmission line loading, we realize the three-band Double Modified Transmission Line Antenna (3 -B DMTLA) for the base station antenna of a <b>mobile</b> <b>telephone</b> system.
