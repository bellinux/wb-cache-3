Many consumer level tripod heads use the bare head mount to attach the camera, but higher end models often include a camera mounting system that is pre-attached to the head mount.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{generally}} accepted that, {{while the women}} identified themselves {{as part of the}} larger Long Kesh dirty protest because they all claimed membership in the IRA and worked for the Irish Republican cause, they were instead a direct reaction to the sexist abuse suffered in prison. To this effect, many feminists found themselves supporting the Armagh women in their protest, especially convinced by a letter smuggled out from the prisoners {{on the issue of the}} feminist nature of the protest: [...] It is a feminist issue in so far as we are women, even though [...] we are treated like criminals. It is a feminist issue when the [...] network of this jail is completely geared to male domination. [...] The governor, the assistant governor, and the doctor are all males. [...] We are subject to physical and mental abuse from the <b>male</b> <b>screws</b> [...] guards who patrol our wing daily, continually peeping into our cells. If this is not a feminist issue, then we feel that the word feminist needs to be redefined to suit these people who feel that [...] "feminist" [...] applies to a certain section of women rather than encompassing women everywhere, regardless of politically held views.|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} {{contains two}} parallel rows of contacts within a shielded case having a characteristic D-shape {{similar to that}} used in D-subminiature connectors. The contacts are not pins, but small flat bands of metal, called ribbon contacts. The connectors are manufactured in many capacities, including 14-, 24-, 36-, 50-, 64-, and 100- pin varieties. They may be mounted on boards, panels, or may terminate cables. Wires are attached by means of solder, crimping or insulation displacement. Female connectors have bail locks for a sturdy connection to the <b>male</b> connector. <b>Screws</b> may also be employed to secure connections.|$|R

40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the <b>male</b> <b>screw</b> and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the <b>male</b> <b>screw,</b> rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing thread pieces it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter. Such wires are available at the factories of the Russian Federation and are represented in AllUnion State Standard 2475 - 88 for the standard thread (metric, trapeziform and others), and they are not available for the RS pieces special thread. It was proposed for the RS pieces male thread pitch diameter control to use the standard wires, the diameter of which is the next larger to the necessary preferred diameter of the RS piece controlled thread. The article presents the preferred diameters of the wires for the RS thread pieces control with employed pitch of the special thread. The dependencies for sizing up of the RS pieces <b>male</b> <b>screw</b> and roller pitch diameter dimension control is deduced by utilizing the wires of unspecified diameter, including preferred diameter. In view of the RS potential it is required to set up in Russia the production of wires with preferred diameters for the RS pieces male thread control. In the long term while reexamination of the All-Union state standard 2475 - 88 it is required to enlarge the range of smooth wires with new ones intended for RS advanced concepts pieces male thread pitch diameter control...|$|E
50|$|A sex bolt is a mating {{fastener}} combining {{a fastener}} (nut) with a fastener (screw). The sex bolt {{consists of a}} female (internally) threaded barrel (nut) and a <b>male</b> (externally) threaded <b>screw.</b> Both the barrel and screw have heads designed to clamp (bind) material between {{the head of the}} barrel {{and the head of the}} screw, or to bridge the gap between two parts.|$|R
50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the <b>male</b> externally threaded <b>screw</b> shaft extending from that. The threaded-head type {{can be used to}} panel-mount one connector and provide a means to attach the mating connector to the first connector.|$|R
40|$|There {{are very}} few methods {{available}} {{for the assessment of}} cold exposure and they rely more or less on complex equations for calculating heat balance; therefore, {{there is a need for}} new practical methods for the identification and control of cold hazards in workplaces. In the first study, the aim was to test a checklist which enables cold risk assessment based on observations in the workplace. The checklist has seven main sections of cold related risk factors: ‘cold air’, ‘wind/air movements’, ‘contact with cold surfaces’, ‘exposure to water/ liquids/moisture’, ‘protective clothing against cold’, ‘protection of hands/feet/head from cold’ and ‘the use of personal protective equipment’. A total of 82 evaluation sheets were obtained from the field testing (24 from Sweden and 58 from Finland). The subjects found the observational checklist to be a usable tool for cold risk assessment in terms of the time needed to perform the risk assessment procedure, the interference of the method with the observed work, the adequacy of the instructions and the facility of the checklist. In the second study, the aim was to test the checklist at workplaces in a country representing a different approach to safety culture than the one prevailing in Scandinavian countries. A secondary objective was to test whether there was a learning effect reflected in the results recorded in the evaluation sheets when filled in after conducting the cold risk assessment procedure for the first, second and third time. A total of 277 evaluation sheets were obtained from 116 observers from two sawmills in north-western Russia. The observers, similarly to the ones in Finland and Sweden, found the observational checklist to be a usable tool for cold risk assessment in terms of the time needed to perform the risk assessment procedure; the instructions provided for the checklist and to the summary table; the facility of the checklist and summary table and the suitability of the checklist (in regards to the structure and content) in identify cold- related risk factors. According to the Nordic observers, a workers’ representative responsible for industrial safety and the workers themselves should carry out the assessment procedure at the workplace. On the contrary, the Russian observers mentioned workers only in 7. 5 % of the evaluation sheets, giving priority to a safety engineer (mentioned in 50. 5 % of evaluation sheets) and a foreman (mentioned in 22. 6 % of evaluation sheets). No statistically significant effects of learning were found when three groups of answers (after the first, second and third time) were compared (N= 73). In the third study, the objective was to validate the checklist for the identification of cold-related problems under laboratory conditions in terms of whether the checklist generated results were in accordance with the subjects’ physiological measurements and self-reported observations of their thermal state. Eight <b>male</b> subjects were <b>screwing</b> bolts with both gloves and bare hands and stepping in 0 C, walking at 3. 5 km/hour and 4. 9 km/hour in - 10 C and at 3 km/hour in - 25 C and standing still at + 4 C in the climatic chamber. In conclusion, the number of subjects who assessed the particular cold related risk factor by means of the checklist in conformity to their reported thermal sensations and measured skin temperatures varied most often from five to eight subjects. In some rare cases, only one, two or three subjects gave evaluations that were in agreement. In particular, this was the case for risk factors concerning the presence of light work and protection of extremities against cold, when several work tasks were performed under the same experiment. In the fourth study, the aim was to identify cold-related risk factors that people face in their work environment and to investigate whether the region where the checklist was filled in, the type of work (indoor versus outdoor work), ambient temperatures and the sector that the company represented had any influence on the ratings that these factors received. Cold-related risk factors were assessed in 14 companies representing various work activities in construction, stevedoring and storage, tourism, sawmills, fish processing, forestry and road building industries in four countries: Finland, Norway, Sweden and north-western Russia. An observational checklist for the assessment of 13 cold-related risk factors was applied and 164 checklists were filled in by 80 selected observers in the Nordic countries and 277 checklists were completed by 116 selected observers in north-western Russia. The observers consisted of worksite managers, occupational health and safety (OH&S) representatives, occupational nurses and the workers themselves. The majority of the cold-related risk factors were rated differently by Nordic and Russian observers in term of either the chosen severity of the problem (‘no problem’, ‘slight problem’ or ‘considerable problem’) or the frequencies of ratings along these categories. Five factors (‘cold air’, ‘wind/ air movements’, ‘contact with cold surfaces’, ‘water/ liquids/ damp’ and ‘highly varying workload’) were most often rated as slightly problematic and two factors (‘protective clothing against cold’ and ‘light work’) as causing no problems by both groups. The remaining six factors (‘protection of extremities against cold’, ‘use of PPE’, ‘long-term cold exposure’, ‘varying thermal environments’, ‘slipperiness’ and ‘insufficient lighting’) were rated differently by Nordic and Russian observers, and the latter indicated less favourable situations at the observed workplaces. Only a few factors had different ratings if various variables (nature of work, ambient temperatures and sector of economic activities) were taken into account. In the fifth study, the aim was to validate the Edholm scale and the ISO 8996 standard by comparing the metabolic rates estimated for both methods with the actual measured metabolic rate (M_Meas) in six manual material handling tasks simulated under laboratory conditions. The metabolic rate was calculated from the oxygen consumption VO 2 (19 participants) according to Standard No. ISO 8996. Additionally, the subjects estimated perceived exertion using the Borg scale. The metabolic rates derived from the Edholm scale (M_Edh) overestimated five of six activities by 34 - 50 % (significance level. 05). The metabolic rates derived from ISO 8996 (M_ISO) overestimated all activities by 7 - 38 % (significance level. 05). Godkänd; 2005; 20061002 (ysko...|$|R
