25|$|The AB-13 {{was a small}} single-bay biplane {{of mixed}} construction. It had wooden {{stressed-skin}} wings with plywood skinning that folded to allow easy storage aboard ship, while combat flaps were fitted as the aircraft was required to have sufficient maneuverability for air combat {{as well as its}} normal observation missions. The fuselage was of metal construction, with the pilot sitting in an open cockpit, but the observer's position being enclosed. Both float and wheeled undercarriages were designed, with the seaplane having a single <b>main</b> <b>float,</b> while the landplane version had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Power was provided by a single Nakajima Hikari radial engine.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, Besson {{created the}} MB.410 by {{replacing}} the twin floats of the MB.35 {{with a single}} <b>main</b> <b>float</b> and two outrigger floats just inboard of the wingtips. The engine was cowled and fuselage streamlining was improved. The prototype was destroyed in a fatal accident during testing.|$|E

50|$|While only {{intended}} to seat the pilot, a bunk was {{provided in the}} aft fuselage for rescue or personnel transfer. Two 0.5 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns were fitted in the wings, and two underwing hardpoints allowed carriage of 250 lb (113 kg) bombs or, on the right wing, surface-scan radar. The <b>main</b> <b>float,</b> designed to incorporate a bomb bay, suffered substantial leaks when used in that fashion, and was modified to carry an auxiliary fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|The MB.26 was a W-strut wing braced sesquiplane, {{the upper}} wing was {{attached}} {{at the top}} of the fuselage and the lower was below the fuselage. It had one <b>main</b> <b>float</b> under the lower wing and two stabilizing floats on the wingtips. This HB.2 variant was followed by a modified C.2 configuration to turn it into a two-seat fighter seaplane. The C.2 had a new round-sided fuselage, the HB.2 had a slab-sided fuselage, and a new tailplane. Neither variant was ordered or entered production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{primary use}} of The Rose Palace {{has always been}} for the {{construction}} of floats for the Tournament of Roses Parade, which is held every New Year's Day in the city of Pasadena. The Rose Palace was one of three [...] "float barns" [...] built for float construction in the mid-1900s. Parade float construction primarily takes place from October through the end of December of each year. The venue is currently occupied by The Phoenix Decorating Company, one of the <b>main</b> <b>float</b> construction companies for the parade.|$|E

50|$|The Avro Type H, Type 501, and Type 503 were {{a family}} of early British {{military}} seaplanes. They were a development of the Avro 500 design and were originally conceived of as amphibious, the prototype being fitted with a single large <b>main</b> <b>float</b> (equipped with wheels) under the fuselage, and two outrigger floats under the wings. Tests were conducted on Windermere in January 1913. It was later converted to a twin-float configuration and bought by the British Admiralty. It now, however, proved too heavy and was converted again - this time to a landplane.|$|E
5000|$|The P.10 was a single-bay biplane {{which was}} {{designed}} to be catapult launched from Italian Navy battleships and cruisers. It had a single <b>main</b> <b>float</b> supplemented by small floats, one on each wingtip. The P.10 was powered by a [...] licence-built Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine. The aircraft had three open cockpits, one forward of the wings for the pilot, further aft was a cockpit for a gunner, {{just in front of the}} tailplane was the third cockpit for the observer. A landplane variant, the P.10bis, had a fixed landing gear.|$|E
50|$|Kawanishi {{designed}} a single-engined low-wing monoplane, {{powered by a}} 1,460 hp (1,090 kW) Mitsubishi MK4D Kasei 14 14-cylinder radial driving two Contra-rotating two-bladed propellers, the first installation of contra-rotating propellers produced in Japan, while a laminar flow airfoil section was chosen to reduce drag. It had a single <b>main</b> <b>float</b> under the fuselage and two stabilising floats under the wing. The stabilising floats were designed to retract into the wing, while the central float {{was designed to be}} jettisoned in case of emergency, giving a sufficient increase in speed (estimated as approximately 50 knots (90 km/h)) to escape enemy fighters.|$|E
25|$|The Fairey Campania was a British ship-borne, {{patrol and}} {{reconnaissance}} aircraft of the First World War and Russian Civil War.

5000|$|The B-20 was {{an attempt}} to combine the best {{features}} of both the flying boat and the floatplane. While on the water, the B-20 was essentially a floatplane, using a large float under the fuselage for buoyancy, and two smaller floats near the wingtips for stability. In flight, the <b>main</b> <b>float</b> retracted upwards towards the fuselage, fitting into a [...] "notch" [...] to become streamlined {{as a part of the}} fuselage. The wing floats folded outwards to become the wingtips. This configuration gave the correct wing incidence for takeoff and for flight and in the latter a much reduced drag compared to the deep hulls of flying boats.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} the single was {{directed}} by Samuel Bayer, known for his work with Nirvana and Green Day. The music video was released on September 26, 2006 in the UK and Canada, and was released on September 27, 2006 in the U.S. It was heavily played on MTV. It features the Patient (the main character of the album, played by Lukas Haas) dressed in a hospital gown, and being taken by death {{in the form of}} a [...] "Black Parade". On the <b>main</b> <b>float</b> stands My Chemical Romance playing [...] "Welcome to the Black Parade". Behind the float are dozens of masked figures.|$|E
50|$|The Yamagasa (or Yamakasa) {{are very}} large floats, {{and are the}} focal point of the festival. There are four regions of Tobata which participate: Higashi, Nishi, Tenraiji and Nakabaru. Each region has a large Yamagasa for men and a small one for boys, making eight <b>main</b> <b>floats</b> in total.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was a flat-sided girder structure; {{the crew}} occupied tandem cockpits, with the pilot at the rear. [...] The 200hp (150kW) Salmson 2M7 water-cooled radial engine was placed {{just in front}} of the forward cockpit, close to the wing leading edge, with tall radiators on either side of the fuselage. [...] It drove a two-bladed propeller via a long drive shaft within a markedly tapered nose. [...] The Special had a pair of strut mounted <b>main</b> <b>floats,</b> supplemented with small wingtip and tail <b>floats.</b> [...] The <b>main</b> <b>floats</b> were 16ft 6 in (5.03 m) long, 2ft 10 in (0.86 m) in the beam and 2ft 4 in (1.18 m) deep, spaced 8ft 6 in (2.59 m) apart. [...] Each float had two sprung connections to its struttage.|$|R

50|$|The AB-7 was a single-bay biplane of {{wood and}} metal construction, fitted with a single <b>main</b> <b>float</b> that could be {{replaced}} be a wheeled undercarriage for operations from land. Its wings folded to the rear to allow easier storage aboard ship. The pilot sat in an open cockpit while the observer's cockpit was part-enclosed {{to protect him from}} the environment. The Aichi design was evaluated against competing aircraft from Kawanishi, the E8K, a low-winged monoplane similar to the Aichi AM-7, and Nakajima, the biplane E8N. While the E8A had similar performance to the E8N, the Nakajima biplane had superior manoevrability and handling, and was preferred to both the Nakajima and Kawanishi offerings, with over 700 E8Ns built.|$|E
5000|$|The JF-1 {{that was}} first ordered, {{had the same}} Pratt & Whitney R-1830-62 engine as the XJF-1 prototype. The US Navy ordered 27 JF-1s with the first Ducks {{delivered}} beginning in May 1934 to Norfolk NAS. These early production series had provisions for mounting a machine gun at the rear seat facing aft, a single bomb rack mounted under each wing, capable of carrying a 100 lb (45.4 kg) bomb or depth charge on each. The <b>main</b> <b>float</b> was also a Grumman design (Grumman Model [...] "A") and like the prototype, it included retractable main landing gear, making the Duck a true amphibian. Ducks served as general/utility amphibians for photographic, target-towing, scouting and rescue work.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, the United States Navy had a {{requirement}} to replace its Vought O3U Corsair {{as the standard}} aircraft catapult launched observation aircraft aboard US Navy ships, and in June of that year it placed an order for a single example of a design from Douglas Aircraft Company, the XO2D-1, together with aircraft from Curtiss (the XO3C-1) and Vought (the XO5U-1). Douglas's design was a single engined biplane with single-bay wings of sesquiplane configuration that folded for shipboard storage.It was of all-metal construction, and housed the crew of two in tandem under an enclosed canopy. It was powered by a Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engine, and to allow easy operation from land, was fitted with a tailwheel undercarriage whose twin mainwheels retracted into the single <b>main</b> <b>float.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Ro-go Ko-gata was a three-bay biplane of {{wood and}} fabric construction, with twin <b>main</b> <b>floats</b> and wings that folded {{backwards}} for storage. [...] Its crew of two sat in separate, closely spaced cockpits. [...] Initial production aircraft were powered by 200hp (149kW) Salmson engines, {{but the majority of}} production aircraft were fitted with 200–220hp (149–164kW) Mitsubishi-built Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 engines.|$|R

5000|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 11 December 1937, Dollar Steamship Lines' ocean liner [...] ran aground in a typhoon on Kasho-to, east of Formosa. Alden and Barker, then at Manila and Olongapo Naval Station respectively, were ordered to proceed {{immediately}} to assist. Due to the urgency of the situation, Alden sailed without her captain, Lieutenant Commander Stanley M. Haight, and several officers and men. A Grumman J2F Duck amphibious aircraft from the Asiatic Fleet's utility unit brought Haight out to Alden, rendezvoused with the ship and landed nearby. Sea conditions, however, precluded a boat's coming alongside the aircraft, for fear of damaging the plane's <b>main</b> <b>float.</b> Commander Haight seized the initiative and swam to one of his ship's 26 ft motor whaleboats to be brought aboard his ship to resume command.|$|E
5000|$|In 1911 Denhault {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} the flying boat, an aircraft whose fuselage formed the <b>main</b> <b>float</b> of the aircraft. Previous aircraft intended to fly from water had all used an arrangement of floats mounted below the aircraft in place of wheels. [...] The hull was triangular in cross section, with the apex at the top. To provide hydrodynamic lift, the hull was fitted with an angled plate mounted below the nose. It was powered by a [...] Gnome Omega driving a pusher propeller mounted below the upper wing. To allow for maneuvering on the ground, an undercarriage was fitted, with two wheels attached. Denhaut took particular advantage of this aspect of the design by taking off from the ground when he made the initial tests. This project was financed by Jacques Donnet, and the craft was later named after him.|$|E
50|$|The first Type IV {{had a pair}} of floats, about 7.8 m and 3.1 m apart, single stepped, round topped in {{cross-section}} and with hard chine but almost flat bottoms. These were mounted on an axle just forward of the wing leading edge, supported at its centre by a V-strut from the lower fuselage longerons and at its extremities by struts at about 45° to the same points. Under the trailing edge a W-form strut linked the longerons and floats, allowing passage for bombs released from the central fuselage underside. Vertical legs transmitted landing forces to the lower wing just inboard of the folding line. The floats were made of spruce and ply covered; on the planing bottoms the ply was 8 mm thick. A second example, the IVbis, had a single central <b>main</b> <b>float,</b> suitable for catapult launching, and a small, stabilizing float under each wing.|$|E
