50|$|The FRE {{also notes}} that <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> may be {{permissive}} or mandatory.

If it is mandatory, then the court must take <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the fact proffered.

40|$|This Article {{presents}} {{a theory of}} <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> for the information age. It argues that the ease of accessing factual data on the Internet allows judges and litigants to expand the use of <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in ways that raise significant concerns about admissibility, reliability, and fair process. State and federal courts are already applying the surprisingly pliant <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> rules to bring websites ranging from Google Maps to Wikipedia into the courtroom, and these decisions will only increase in frequency in coming years. This rapidly emerging judicial phenomenon is notable for its ad hoc and conclusory nature—attributes that {{have the potential to}} undermine the integrity of the factfinding process. The theory proposed here, which is the first attempt to conceptualize <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in the information age, remedies these potential failings by setting forth both an analytical framework for decision, as well as a process for how courts should memorialize rulings on the propriety of taking <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of Internet sources to allow meaningful review...|$|R
50|$|One special {{category}} {{of information in}} this area includes things of which the court may take <b>judicial</b> <b>notice.</b> This category covers matters that are so well known that the court may deem them proved without the introduction of any evidence. For example, if a defendant {{is alleged to have}} illegally transported goods across a state line by driving them from Boston to Los Angeles, the court may take <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> {{of the fact that it}} is impossible to drive from Boston to Los Angeles without crossing a number of state lines. In a civil case, where the court takes <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the fact, that fact is deemed conclusively proved. In a criminal case, however, the defense may always submit evidence to rebut a point for which <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> has been taken.|$|R

40|$|On June 16, 2006, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda {{issued a}} {{decision}} in Prosecutor v. Karemera taking <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> {{of the fact that}} genocide occurred in Rwanda in 1994. This decision startled many court observers. While no internationally respected commentator would today question whether the Rwanda genocide took place, should such an event be judicially noticed without evidence? This paper examines that question, arguing that the ICTR Appeals Chamber’s expansive use of <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in Karemera was both illogical and unwise. Genocide, whether as an historical fact or legal charge, fails to meet the “common knowledge” standard of <b>judicial</b> <b>notice.</b> Further, taking such notice hinders the creation of an historical record and risks violating the rights of defendants. This paper proposes a solution: acknowledging genocide as a “previously adjudicated fact” under Rule 94 (B). This article—the first to critique Karemera—reviews the jurisprudence of <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in the tribunals, examines the modern concept of genocide, critiques the ICTR’s reasoning and proposes a practical solution that may be relevant to future international courts. This paper is particularly relevant to scholars and practitioners of international criminal law, and may be of interest to scholars of genocide and conflict studies...|$|R
50|$|FRE 201(f) {{establishes}} {{that the}} effect of the court taking <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> is different in civil and criminal trials. In a civil trial, the fact taken notice of is thereby conclusively proved. In a criminal case, the defendant has the right to contest every fact that might tend to incriminate him. Therefore, the court taking <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> would simply allow the jury to make the finding that the court took notice of, but would not require this outcome, and would not prevent the defense from presenting evidence to rebut the noticed fact.|$|R

50|$|<b>Judicial</b> <b>notice</b> is a {{rule in the}} law of {{evidence}} that allows a fact to be introduced into evidence if the truth of that fact is so notorious or well known, or so authoritatively attested, that it cannot reasonably be doubted.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the state of}} federal and Québec law as regards <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of statutory instruments. The position in respect of federal instruments is first surveyed by reference to {{the provisions of the}} Canada Evidence Act and Canadian and British cases on the subject ; mention is then made of the now superseded Regulations Act of 1950 and the questions of interpretation that arose from it; and finally the impact of s. 23 of the Statutory Instruments Act of 1971 is evaluated {{in the light of the}} Supreme Court ruling in R. v. The « Evgenia Chandris ». The position in Québec law appears to be somewhat more confused. While the rule that regulations should be a matter for <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> seems well secured by s. 105 of the Summary Proceedings Act, this obviously only settles the point as regards penal proceedings under provincial statutes. In civil litigation, in the absence of any clear statement that regulations are to be judicially noticed, caution would seem to advise litigants to specifically plead and evidence the existence of regulations they intend to rely on. The author concludes by calling on the Québec Legislature to state explicitly the rule that regulations are a matter for <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> in any kind of proceedings...|$|R

40|$|In Maine v.

Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the court established that the listing decision was based upon the best scientific data available and clearly supported by the administrative record. The court granted defendant 2 ̆ 7 s motion and, accordingly, the listing decision was upheld. This case presented to the federal court the decision whether to dismiss the Plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 motions for lack of standing or, alternatively, to determine whether listing the DPS of Gulf of Maine Atlantic salmon was accurate and lawful under the Endangered Species Act. Although the Maine court chose to dismiss the Maine business associations 2 ̆ 7 motion, the court took <b>judicial</b> <b>notice</b> of the facts necessary to establish standing by the State of Maine, noting {{the importance of the}} issues to be determined in this case.
