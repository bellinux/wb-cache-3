50|$|In low doses, methamphetamine {{can cause}} an {{elevated}} mood and increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals. At higher doses, it can induce psychosis, rhabdomyolysis, and cerebral hemorrhage. Methamphetamine {{is known to}} have a high potential for abuse and addiction. Recreational use of methamphetamine may result in psychosis or lead to post-withdrawal syndrome, a withdrawal syndrome that can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period. Unlike amphetamine and cocaine, methamphetamine is neurotoxic to humans, damaging both dopamine and serotonin neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Entirely opposite to the long-term use of amphetamine, there is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Liver {{dysfunction}} {{and failure}} are severe complications of sepsis {{and result in}} poor outcome and increased mortality. The underlying pathologic mechanisms of hepatocyte dysfunction and necrosis during sepsis are only incompletely understood. Here, we investigated whether procalcitonin, a biomarker of sepsis, modulates liver cell function and viability. Materials and Methods. Employing a previously characterized and patented biosensor system evaluating hepatocyte toxicity in vitro, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG 2 /C 3 A) were exposed to 0. 01 – 50 [*]ng/mL procalcitonin for 2 × 72 [*]h and evaluated for proliferation, necrosis, <b>metabolic</b> activity, cellular <b>integrity,</b> microalbumin synthesis, and detoxification capacity. Acetaminophen served as positive control. For further standardization, procalcitonin effects were confirmed in a cellular toxicology assay panel employing L 929 fibroblasts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA/Tukey’s test. Results. Already at concentrations as low as 0. 25 [*]ng/mL, procalcitonin induced HepG 2 /C 3 A necrosis (P< 0. 05) and reduced <b>metabolic</b> activity, cellular <b>integrity,</b> synthesis, and detoxification capacity (all P< 0. 001). Comparable effects were obtained employing L 929 fibroblasts. Conclusion. We provide evidence for procalcitonin to directly impair function and viability of human hepatocytes and exert general cytotoxicity in vitro. Therapeutical targeting of procalcitonin could thus display a novel approach to reduce incidence of liver dysfunction and failure during sepsis and lower morbidity and mortality of septic patients...|$|R

The present studies were designed to evaluate the possibility that these agents are protective, in part, by preserving cellular <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity.</b> The renal cortex was repetitively biopsied {{during the course of this}} study, and high-pressure liquid chromatography was used to analyze the tissue content of adenine nucleotides (expressed in nanomoles per gram of wet tissue). The adenine nucleotide charge ratio (CR) and total adenine nucleotide (TAN) content were calculated as indices of cellular <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity.</b> In addition to the above-established protective agents, phenoxybenzamine was used to evaluate a direct toxic effect of norepinephrine on renal tissue. Inulin clearance at 3 hours post infusion (ex-pressed as a percent of control) was 7 % with norepinephrine alone and, in the protected groups, 36 % with bradykinin, 61 % with furosemide, 51 % with mannitol, and 100 % with phenoxybenzamine. There was no change in CR or TAN with phenoxybenzamine. In contrast, during norepinephrine administration CR fell significantly in all other groups.

As a result, they have emerged as a powerful tool for macromolecular delivery-based therapies. In this study, catalytically active bacterial Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (LepFNR) and Heme oxygenase (LepHO) fused to the HIV TAT-derived protein transduction peptide (TAT) were efficiently transduced to neuroblastoma SHSY- 5 Y cells.

Also, human socio-economic status is a covariate factor connecting psychometric test-performance (a measure of cognitive ability), educational achievement, lifetime health, and survival. The complimentary hypothesis, that mechanisms in physiology can explain some covariance between the same traits, is disputed. Possible mechanisms involve <b>metabolic</b> biology affecting <b>integrity</b> {{and stability of}} physiological systems during development and ageing.

Controlling for social environment, age, and learning motivation in each bee, we establish that learning in Pavlovian conditioning to an odour is positively correlated with individual survival time in hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induces oxidative metabolic damage, and provides a measure of metabolic stress resistance that is often related to overall lifespan in laboratory animals.

40|$|Some gene deletions or {{mutations}} {{have little}} effect on metabolism and metabolic adaptation because of redundancy and/or compensation in metabolic pathways. The mechanisms for redundancy and/or compensation in metabolic adaptation in mammalian cells are unidentified. Here, we show that in mouse muscle and myogenic cells, compensatory regulation of the histone deacetylase (HDAC 5) transcriptional repressor maintains <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity.</b> HDAC 5 phosphorylation regulated the expression of diverse metabolic genes and glucose metabolism in mouse C 2 C 12 myogenic cells. However, loss of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a HDAC 5 kinase, in muscle did not affect HDAC 5 phosphorylation in mouse skeletal muscle during exercise, but resulted in a compensatory increase (32. 6 %) in the activation of protein kinase D (PKD), an alternate HDAC 5 kinase. Constitutive PKD activation in mouse C 2 C 12 myogenic cells regulated metabolic genes and glucose metabolism. Although aspects of this response were HDAC 5 phosphorylation dependent, blocking HDAC 5 phosphorylation when PKD was active engaged an alternative compensatory adaptive mechanism, which involved post-transcriptional reductions in HDAC 5 mRNA (− 93. 1 %) and protein. This enhanced {{the expression of a}} specific subset of metabolic genes and mitochondrial metabolism.

30|$|The {{germination}} condition {{influenced by}} orientation of seed is {{also related to}} the effect it creates on physiological processes during germination. In seeds of some plant species with higher weight in which extra energy is required to elongate hypocotyls, positioning the micropyle upright reduces germination as explained earlier. In addition to the abovementioned reasons, physiological processes controlled by plant growth hormone have a role. In such situation, the flow of auxin produced in the root tip has limited flow to reach to part of the root with required extent to influence the growth positively (Bhat 2011). This abnormal chemical process results to poor morphological development and influence germination condition, among others.

This would suggest that sucrose is preferentially absorbed by the minor vein net. Analysis of Vmax data indicates a reduction in the ability of isolated minor veins to accumulate substrate, implicating a symplastic rather than apoplastic route for intercellular transport.

This is likely to affect plant diversity and performance, owing to the relationship between temperature and seed germination, and temperature and plant vigour. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the potential effects of elevated temperatures on seed germination and subsequent seedling vigour in a recalcitrant-seeded (desiccation sensitive) tropical African forest species, Trichilia emetica. Freshly harvested T. emetica seeds were grown at ambient (24 ± 2 / 14 ± 2 °C) and elevated (29 ± 2 / 20 ± 2 °C) midday/night temperatures and monitored for germinability, respiratory activity, reactive oxygen species (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) production, total antioxidant activity and ultrastructural integrity. Seedlings subsequently produced were subjected to various growth measurements to compare vigour between those grown at ambient and elevated temperatures. The results suggest that exposure to elevated temperatures (~ 5 to 6 °C above ambient) did not disrupt <b>metabolic</b> and ultrastructural <b>integrity</b> in T. emetica embryonic axes and consequently did not compromise seed germination and subsequent seedling production.

We therefore assessed endothelial barrier integrity and viability as function of preservation temperature and perfusion solution, and hypothesized that endothelial cell preservation at subnormothermic conditions using metabolism-supporting solutions constitute optimal preservation conditions. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were preserved at 4 - 37 °C for up to 20 h using Ringer's lactate, histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate solution, University of Wisconsin (UW) solution, Polysol, or endothelial cell growth medium (ECGM).

At temperatures above 20 °C, the cells' metabolic demands outweighed the preservation solutions' supporting capacity. Only UW maintained HUVEC viability up to 20 °C. Despite high intracellular ATP content, none of the solutions were capable of sufficiently preserving HUVEC above 20 °C except for ECGM.

In this work we aimed at developing an integrated strategy allowing for long-term culture and cryopreservation of brain cell neurospheres with high viability and reduced recovery time postthawing. Microencapsulation in clinical-grade, ultrahigh viscous, highly purified alginate uniformly cross-linked with Ba 2 + was evaluated as the main strategy to avoid the commonly observed loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions with consequent aggregate's fragmentation and decrease in cell viability that occurs postthawing.

Oritavancin did not affect Pseudomonas aeruginosa phagocytosis, lysosomal <b>integrity,</b> or <b>metabolic</b> activity in cells incubated for 3 h with extracellular concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 μg/ml. At extracellular concentrations of ≥ 25 μg/ml, oritavancin reduced latex bead phagocytosis by approximately 50 % and doubled ROS production in J 774 macrophages only. This may result {{from the fact that}} the cellular accumulation of oritavancin was 15 times higher in J 774 cells than in activated THP- 1 cells at 3 h. Human pharmacokinetic studies estimate that the concentration of oritavancin in alveolar macrophages could reach approximately 560 μg/ml after administration of a cumulative dose of 4 g, which is below the cellular concentration needed in the present study to impair latex bead phagocytosis (1, 180 μg/ml) or to stimulate ROS production (15, 000 μg/ml) by J 774 cells.

These innovative nanoparticulate systems aim to increase drugs’ bioavailability at the ocular surface. For the successful development of these systems, the evaluation of mucoahesiveness (the interaction between the ocular delivery system and mucins present on the eye) is of utmost importance. In this context, the aim of the present work was to investigate the mucoadhesivity of a novel nanoparticle eye drop formulation containing an antibiotic (ceftazidime) intended to treat eye infections. Eye drop formulations comprised a polymer (hydroxypropyl) methyl cellulose (HPMC) 0. 75 % (w/v) in an isotonic solution incorporating chitosan/sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) -hyaluronic acid-based nanoparticles containing ceftazidime. The viscosity of the nanoparticles, and the gels incorporating the nanoparticles were characterized in contact with mucin at different mass ratios, allowing the calculation of the rheological synergism parameter (∆η). Results showed that at different nanoparticle eye formulation:mucin weight ratios, a minimum in viscosity occurred which resulted in a negative rheological synergism. Additionally, the results highlighted the mucoadhesivity of the novel ocular formulation and its ability to interact with the ocular surface, thus increasing the drug residence time in the eye. Moreover, the in vitro release and permeation studies showed a prolonged drug release profile from the chitosan/TPP-hyaluronic acid nanoparticles gel formulation. Furthermore, the gel formulations were not cytotoxic on ARPE- 19 and HEK 293 T cell lines, evaluated by the <b>metabolic</b> and membrane <b>integrity</b> tests. The formulation was stable and the drug active, as shown by microbiological studies. In conclusion, chitosan/TPP-hyaluronic acid nanoparticle eye drop formulations are a promising platform for ocular drug delivery with enhanced mucoadhesive properties...|$|R
40|$|Sphingolipids are {{structural}} {{components of}} cell membranes that have signaling roles to regulate many activities, including mitochondrial function and cell death. Sphingolipid metabolism is integrated with numerous metabolic networks, and dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism {{is associated with}} disease. Here, we describe a monogenic yeast model for sphingolipid accumulation. A csg 2 Δ mutant cannot readily metabolize and accumulates the complex sphingolipid inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC). In these cells, aberrant activation of Ras GTPase is IPC-dependent, and accompanied by increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced mitochondrial mass. Survival or death of csg 2 Δ cells depends on nutritional status. Abnormal Ras activation in csg 2 Δ cells is associated with impaired Snf 1 /AMPK protein kinase, a key regulator of energy homeostasis. csg 2 Δ cells are rescued from ROS production and death by overexpression of mitochondrial catalase Cta 1, abrogation of Ras hyperactivity or genetic activation of Snf 1 /AMPK. These results suggest that sphingolipid dysregulation compromises <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity</b> via Ras and Snf 1 /AMPK pathways...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{metabolites}} {{may influence}} the <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity</b> of intestinal epithelial cells and induce mucosal immune responses. Therefore, we investigated {{the effects of the}} microbial metabolites butyrate, iso-valerate, and ammonium on Caco- 2 cells and macrophages. Barrier functioning was determined by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and basolateral recoveries of metabolites. The barrier function of Caco- 2 cells remained intact after exposures. Basolateral recoveries ranged from 6. 2 % to 15. 2 %. Tumour necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 10 were measured to determine immune reactions. The Caco- 2 cells did not secrete both cytokines. Physiological concentrations of butyrate and iso-valerate stimulated the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-α and suppressed the secretion of interleukin- 10 by macrophages that are not protected by an epithelial barrier. In contrast, ammonium concentrations as high as those produced by microbiotas of IBD patients suppressed the release of both cytokines when the barrier function is impaired. © 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

40|$|Arsenic (As) {{is a human}} carcinogen. Our prior work {{showed that}} chronic (> 18 weeks) low level (500 nM) {{arsenite}} (As 3 �) exposure induced malignant transformation in a rat liver epithelial cell line (TRL 1215). In these cells, metallothionein (MT) is hyper-expressible, a trait often linked to metal tolerance. Thus, this study examined whether the adverse effects of arsenicals and other metals were altered in these chronic arsenite-exposed (CAsE) cells. CAsE cells, which had been continuously exposed to 500 nM arsenite for 18 to 20 weeks, and control cells, were exposed to As 3 �, arsenate (As 5 �), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), antimony (Sb 3 �), cadmium (Cd 2 �), cisplatin (cis-Pt), and nickel (Ni 2 �) for 24 h and cell viability was determined by <b>metabolic</b> <b>integrity.</b> The lethal concentration for 50 % of exposed cells (LC 50) for As 3 � was 140 �M in CAsE cells as compared to 26 �M in control cells, a 5. 4 -fold increase in tolerance. CAsE cells were also very tolerant to the acut...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe kidneys are the dose-limiting organs in some {{radionuclide}} therapy regimens. However, the biological impact of internal exposure from radionuclides {{is still not}} fully understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effects of dose rate and time after i. v. injection of 177 LuCl 3 on changes in transcriptional patterns in mouse kidney tissue. MethodsTo investigate the effect of dose rate, female Balb/c nude mice were i. v. injected with 11, 5. 6, 1. 6, 0. 8, 0. 30, and 0 MBq of 177 LuCl 3, and killed at 3, 6, 24, 48, 168, and 24 hours after injection, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of time after onset of exposure was analysed using mice injected with 0. 26, 2. 4, and 8. 2 MBq of 177 LuCl 3, and killed at 45, 90, and 140 days after injection. Global transcription patterns of irradiated kidney cortex and medulla were assessed and enriched biological processes were determined from the regulated gene sets using Gene Ontology terms. ResultsThe average dose rates investigated were 1. 6, 0. 84, 0. 23, 0. 11 and 0. 028 mGy/min, with an absorbed dose of 0. 3 Gy. At 45, 90 and 140 days, the absorbed doses were estimated to 0. 3, 3, and 10 Gy. In general, the number of differentially regulated transcripts increased with time after injection, and decreased with absorbed dose for both kidney cortex and medulla. Differentially regulated transcripts were predominantly involved in metabolic and stress response-related processes dependent on dose rate, as well as transcripts associated with <b>metabolic</b> and cellular <b>integrity</b> at later time points. ConclusionThe observed transcriptional response in kidney tissue was diverse due to difference in absorbed dose, dose rate and time after exposure. Nevertheless, several transcripts were significantly regulated in all groups despite differences in exposure parameters, which may indicate potential biomarkers for exposure of kidney tissue...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many nanomedical {{studies have}} been focused on {{magnetic}} nanoparticles (MNPs) because MNPs possess attractive properties for potential uses in imaging, drug delivery, and theranostics. MNPs must have optimized size as well as functionalized surface for such applications. However, careful cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessments to ensure the biocompatibility and biosafety of MNPs are essential. In this study, Fe 3 O 4 MNPs of different sizes (approximately 10 and 100 – 150 nm) were prepared with different functional groups, hydroxyl (–OH) and amine (–NH 2) groups, by coating their surfaces with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), 3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) or TEOS/APTMS. Differential cellular responses to those surface-functionalized MNPs were investigated in normal fibroblasts vs. fibrosarcoma cells. Following the characterization of MNP properties according to size, surface charge and functional groups, cellular responses to MNPs in normal fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells were determined by quantifying <b>metabolic</b> activity, membrane <b>integrity,</b> and DNA stability. While all MNPs induced just about 5 % or less cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in fibrosarcoma cells at lower than 500 μg/mL, APTMS-coated MNPs resulted in greater than 10 % toxicity against normal cells. Particularly, the genotoxicity of MNPs was dependent on their dose, size and surface charge, showing that positively charged (APTMS- or TEOS/APTMS-coated) MNPs induced appreciable DNA aberrations irrespective of cell type. Resultantly, smaller and positively charged (APTMS-coated) MNPs led to more severe toxicity in normal cells than their cancer counterparts. Although {{it was difficult to}} fully differentiate cellular responses to various MNPs between normal fibroblasts and their cancer counterparts, normal cells were shown to be more vulnerable to internalized MNPs than cancer cells. Our results suggest that functional groups and sizes of MNPs are critical determinants of degrees of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, and potential mechanisms of toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Social-environmental {{influences}} {{can affect}} animal cognition and health. Also, human socio-economic status is a covariate factor connecting psychometric test-performance (a measure of cognitive ability), educational achievement, lifetime health, and survival. The complimentary hypothesis, that mechanisms in physiology can explain some covariance between the same traits, is disputed. Possible mechanisms involve <b>metabolic</b> biology affecting <b>integrity</b> {{and stability of}} physiological systems during development and ageing. Knowledge of these relationships is incomplete, and underlying processes are challenging to reveal in people. Model animals, however, can provide insights into connections between metabolic biology and physiological stability that may aid efforts to reduce human health and longevity disparities. We document {{a positive correlation between}} a measure of associative learning performance and the metabolic stress resilience of honeybees. This relationship is independent of social factors, and may provide basic insights into how central nervous system (CNS) function and metabolic biology can be associated. Controlling for social environment, age, and learning motivation in each bee, we establish that learning in Pavlovian conditioning to an odour is positively correlated with individual survival time in hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induces oxidative metabolic damage, and provides a measure of metabolic stress resistance that is often related to overall lifespan in laboratory animals. The positive relationship between Pavlovian learning ability and stress resilience in the bee is not equally established in other model organisms so far, and contrasts with a genetic cost of improved associative learning found in Drosophila melanogaster. Similarities in the performances of different animals need not reflect common functional principles. A correlation of honeybee Pavlovian learning and metabolic stress resilience, thereby, is not evidence of a shared biology that will give insight about systems integrity in people. Yet, the means to resolve difficult research questions often come from findings in distant areas of science while the model systems that turn out to be valuable are sometimes the least predictable. Our results add to recent findings indicating that honeybees can become instrumental to understanding how metabolic biology influences life outcomes...|$|R
