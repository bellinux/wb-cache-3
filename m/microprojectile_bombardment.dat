Particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos. Some genetic material will stay in the cells and transform them. This method also allows transformation of plant plastids.

5000|$|Transformation via Agrobacterium {{has been}} {{successfully}} practiced in dicots, i.e. broadleaf plants, such as soybeans and tomatoes, for many years. Recently it has been adapted and is now effective in monocots like grasses, including corn and rice. In general, the Agrobacterium method is considered preferable to the gene gun, because of a greater frequency of single-site insertions of the foreign DNA, which allows for easier monitoring. In this method, the tumor inducing (Ti) region {{is removed from the}} T-DNA (transfer DNA) and replaced with the desired gene and a marker, which is then inserted into the organism. This may involve direct inoculation of the tissue with a culture of transformed Agrobacterium, or inoculation following treatment with micro-projectile bombardment, which wounds the tissue. [...] Wounding of the target tissue causes the release of phenolic compounds by the plant, which induces invasion of the tissue by Agrobacterium. Because of this, <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment</b> often increases the efficiency of infection with Agrobacterium. The marker is used to find the organism which has successfully taken up the desired gene. Tissues of the organism are then transferred to a medium containing an antibiotic or herbicide, depending on which marker was used. The Agrobacterium present is also killed by the antibiotic. Only tissues expressing the marker will survive and possess the gene of interest. Thus, subsequent steps in the process will only use these surviving plants. In order to obtain whole plants from these tissues, they are grown under controlled environmental conditions in tissue culture. This is a process of a series of media, each containing nutrients and hormones. Once the plants are grown and produce seed, the process of evaluating the progeny begins. This process entails selection of the seeds with the desired traits and then retesting and growing {{to make sure that the}} entire process has been completed successfully with the desired results.|$|E

40|$|Celiac disease, an {{autoimmune}} response {{triggered by the}} consumption of seed storage proteins of cereals, affects an estimated 1 % of the human population. In the case of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), one of the world’s most consumed cereals, alcohol-soluble proteins, the gliadins, {{have been identified as}} the allergy-eliciting agents. Previous studies have shown that removal of gliadins may be a feasible method of producing non-toxic wheat food preparations. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} explore a transgenic-based method using a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene regulation, RNA interference (RNAi), to decrease the levels of wheat gliadins thereby decreasing the amount of the allergy-eliciting activity in its flour. The aim of this project was addressed in two phases. The first involved the optimization of a biolistics-based wheat transformation system and the isolation of transgenic lines. The second phase involved phenotypic evaluations of transgenic lines to determine the effectiveness of RNAi on decreasing gliadin levels and related seed storage proteins. For the first phase of this project, optimization of wheat transformation parameters using the BioRad PDS- 1000 /He biolistics gene gun with the Hepta adapter was accomplished by testing the effect of microprojectile size, amount of <b>microprojectiles,</b> and the <b>bombardment</b> pressure on transformation success. Additionally, the utility of a transiently expressed reporter coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in predicting the rate of transformation success two days post-bombardment was examined. The pMCG 161 |irGLI (pGLI) binary vector containing the bar gene (conferring glufosinate resistance) and a gliadin inverted repeat (RNAi component) was co-bombarded with the pAHC 17 |sGFP-SK (pGFP) vector containing a GFP reporter gene in a 1 : 1 mass ratio. Using a factorial design, the size of the microprojectile was statistically significant (p = 0. 001) in transformation success. A significantly higher (> 6 x) success rate using particles with a diameter of 0. 6 -µm over the use of 1. 0 -µm microprojectiles was noted. The interaction between <b>bombardment</b> pressure and <b>microprojectile</b> size was also significant with pressures of 1350 and 1100 PSI being superior to 1550 PSI when 0. 6 -µm microprojectiles were used. Using a bombardment pressure of 1350 PSI and 0. 6 -µm particles, the best transformation rate of 2. 5 % was achieved. The amount of microprojectiles per microcarrier (0. 14 or 0. 5 mg) did not significantly affect transformation success. Scoring transient GFP expression two days post-bombardment was not found to be a useful predictor of transformation success. For the second phase of this project, regenerated plants were evaluated for expression of the bar gene selectable marker (that conferred resistance to the glufosinate herbicide) and gliadin protein composition using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Of the 11, 962 immature embryos bombarded with pGLI and pGFP, 189 independently transformed lines were recovered with 102 lines showing resistance to glufosinate, a sign of an actively expressed bar gene introduced with pGLI. Protein analysis on 117 transformants (69 T 1 and 48 T 2 individuals derived from 13 initial T 0 transgenics) did not reveal qualitative differences in gliadin levels or composition between transgenics and the untransformed control suggesting that the RNAi component of pGLI had failed to induce silencing...|$|R

As a result, the constructs should have been capable of replication-dependent expression of luciferase. The constructs were tested using <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment</b> and plant transformation experiments. Unfortunately the constructs did not appear to function in the manner intended. The design of each construct has been fully discussed and we conclude that further analysis of transgenic plants lines is required.;The application of TMV-based replication and replicase constructs for studies of Tm- 1 and N gene mediated resistance has been considered.

Varietal differences for tissue developmental stage specific patterns of reporter gene expression have been observed. We observed transient expression patterns of reporter genes (GUS) driven by four different promoters (ubiquitin rice, ubiquitin corn, ubiquitin- 3 potato and CaMV 35 S) in calli, root and leaf tissue of turfgrass. The ubiquitin rice promoter driving GUS produced {{the highest number of}} GUS spots compared to three other promoters both in young and mature leaves. We analyzed GUS expression at the two different developmental stages of the leaves, young leaf vs. fully mature leaf. Dramatically higher GUS expression was observed in mature leaves compared to young leaves following <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment.</b> From these observations we can say that transient expression of a reporter gene (GUS in this case) does change considerably with the developmental stage of the creeping bentgrass plant. Fully expanded mature leaves were found to be much more efficient in GUS expression than young leaves. We have successfully inhibited in vitro endogenous nucleolytic activity in turfgrass cells by different nuclease inhibitors (0. 6 % heparin, aurintricarboxylic acid, polyethylene glycol and spermidine).

The sample plate distances affected the distribution pattern of the particles and the cells expressing the GUS reporter gene were noted to be aggregated in short distances whereas longer distance shots yielded better distribution of transformed cells. For both leaf explants and callus structures the rupture disk pressure of 1350 psi was observed to yield the highest gene expression results and the sample plate distance of 12 cm for the leaf explants and 9 cm for the callus were found to increase the penetration success of the gold particles.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel and reproducible system for recovery of fertile transgenic maize (Zea mays L.) plants. The transformation was performed using <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment</b> of cultured shoot apices of maize with a plasmid carrying two linked genes, the Streptomyces hygroscopicus phosphinothricin acetyltransferase gene (bar) and the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene, either alone or in combination with another plasmid containing the 5 [prime] region of the rice actin 1 gene fused to the Escherichia coli [beta]-glucuronidase gene (gus). Bombarded shoot apices were subsequently multiplied and selected under 3 to 5 mg/L glufosinate ammonium. Co-transformation frequency was 100 % (146 / 146) for linked genes and 80 % (41 / 51) for unlinked genes. Co-expression frequency of the bar and gus genes was 57 % (29 / 51). The co-integration, co-inheritance, and co-expression of bar, the potato proteinase inhibitor II gene, and gus in transgenic R 0, R 1, and R 2 plants were confirmed. Localized expression of the actin 1 -GUS protein in the R 0 and R 1 plants was extensively analyzed by histochemical and fluorometric assays...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} isolated S-locus promoter sequences to direct organ-specific gene expression, we used <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment</b> to introduce chimeric S-allele/beta-glucuronidase genes into different tissues of Petunia hybrida for transient expression. Histochemical staining showed that S-locus/beta-glucuronidase fusions were expressed in pistil, ovary, and petal tissue. No expression of the chimeric genes was detected in leaves or in mature pollen, either by histochemical staining or by fluorescence assays. RNA blot hybridization confirmed that low levels of S-locus mRNA accumulate in petals and ovaries in vivo. Analysis of the expression pattern of S-locus promoter deletions showed that sequences {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the TATA box were sufficient to confer qualitatively correct organ-specific expression of beta-glucuronidase. To further investigate the potential for S-ribonuclease expression in pollen, we used the polymerase chain reaction to amplify RNA accumulated in developing anthers. These assays demonstrated that mRNA for the S-ribonuclease accumulates to low levels in developing anthers several days prior to corolla opening and pollen anthesis. We discuss these results in light of current models of self-incompatibility...|$|E
40|$|The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is a pest of rice in {{tropical}} regions. Its direct feeding results in loss in yield and plant death ("hopper bum"). Several compounds that stimulate insect attraction {{have been detected}} in rice plants colonised by N. lugens, including 1, 2 -dimethoxybenzene or veratrole. Electro-physiological studies and highresolution gas chromatography have identified veratrole as an attractant of N. lugens. Veratrole {{is a product of}} salicylic acid, a derivative of the phenyl propanoid pathway. Salicylic acid is decarboxylated to catechol, a step which is encoded by salicylate hydroxylase. Catechol is subsequently methylated to veratrole, which is released as a volatile compound from rice leaves. Mature scutellum-derived rice calli from (Oryza sativa) cv. Taipei 309 were transformed, using <b>microprojectile</b> <b>bombardment,</b> with pROB 5 containing the hpt gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic hygromycin and pSLJ 7307 carrying the nahG gene derived from Pseudomonas putida and coding for the enzyme salicylate hydroxylase. Following selection on hygromycin-containing medium, 17 independent transgenic rice plants were regenerated from > 3600 bombarded calli, with a transformation frequency of 0. 47...|$|E
