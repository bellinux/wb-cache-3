50|$|Apple <b>mistelle</b> is a cider {{obtained}} from a must kept fresh, that is unfermented, to which alcohol is added.|$|E
50|$|An aromatised wine (also spelled aromatized) is a {{fortified}} wine or <b>mistelle</b> {{that has been}} flavoured with herbs, spices, fruit or other natural flavourings.|$|E
25|$|The <b>mistelles</b> or dessert {{wines are}} grape juices whose {{fermentation}} has been prevented by fortification with alcohol. Although {{the absence of}} fermentation can lead to discussion of their qualification as wine, it is nevertheless an alcoholic grape product. The Pineau des Charentes, the floc de Gascogne, and the macvin du Jura are three AOC French <b>mistelles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brothers Pallade and Simon Violet, {{itinerant}} drapers from Thuir (France), {{decided to}} take advantage of the wine fever in the region to develop an apéritif wine flavored with cinchona. They mixed dry wines and <b>mistelles</b> and initially marketed the resulting product as a health drink or tonic. This was because the local apéritif producers were displeased about competition with their established brands. Rebranding the brothers' aperitif as a health drink got around this problem, and Byrrh was sold in pharmacies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Mistelle</b> (mistella; mistelle; Spanish, Portuguese, Galician and mistela, from Latin / [...] "mix") is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} ingredient in fortified wines, particularly Vermouth, Marsala and Sherry, though it is used mainly {{as a base for}} apéritifs such as the French Pineau des Charentes. It is produced by adding alcohol to non-fermented or partially fermented grape juice. The addition of alcohol stops the fermentation and, as a consequence <b>Mistelle</b> is sweeter than fully fermented grape juice in which the sugars turn to alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Considered a <b>mistelle,</b> it is {{generally}} consumed as an apéritif, or as an accompaniment to melon or blue cheese. It is also popular {{with a variety of}} desserts, including any chocolate or apple-based dishes.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{fortified}} wine (<b>mistelle</b> or vin de liqueur), made from either fresh, unfermented grape juice or {{a blend of}} lightly fermented grape must, to which a Cognac eau-de-vie is added and then matured.|$|E
50|$|Floc de Gascogne is a <b>mistelle,</b> a vin de liqueur (a {{fortified}} sweet wine) made of 1/3 of armagnac and 2/3 {{of fresh}} grape juice {{both from the}} wine area Armagnac / Côtes de Gascogne. Both of these must be produced by the same vineyard.|$|E
50|$|The brandy-producing region Armagnac is {{situated}} within Gascony {{and the wine}} region of South West France, {{and some of its}} grapes are used to make Vin de Pays under the designation Vin de Pays de Côtes de Gascogne or mixed with Armagnac to produce the <b>mistelle</b> Floc de Gascogne.|$|E
5000|$|Byrrh is an aromatised wine-based apéritif made of red wine, <b>mistelle,</b> and quinine. Created in 1866 and a {{trademark}} since 1873, it was popular as a French apéritif. With its marketing and {{reputation as a}} [...] "hygienic drink", Byrrh sold well in the early 20th century. It was even exported, despite the similarity of its name to [...] "beer", complicating sales in English- and German-language speaking regions.|$|E
50|$|Ratafia is a {{term used}} for two types of sweet {{alcoholic}} beverage, either a fortified wine or a fruit-based beverage. The latter type is a liqueur or cordial flavoured with lemon peel, herbs in various amounts (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, mint, rosemary, anise, etc.) typically combined with sugar. It may also be prepared with peach or cherry kernels, bitter almonds, or other fruits, as many different varieties are made. The same name is given to a flavouring essence resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit. The former type {{is a type of}} <b>mistelle,</b> a mixture of marc brandy and the unfermented juice of the grape, and it is the type of Ratafia produced in France.|$|E
5000|$|The process {{used today}} is {{virtually}} unchanged since the 1850s. Noilly Prat is made exclusively from white grape varieties {{grown in the}} Marseillan area, principally Picpoul de Pinet and Clairette. These produce light, fruity wines which are matured in massive Canadian oak casks inside the original storerooms. The wine stays in these casks for 8 months, maturing and absorbing the flavour of the wood, before being transferred to smaller oak barrels which are taken outside and left for a year. Here {{they are exposed to}} the sun, wind, and low winter temperatures, while the wine is slowly changing. The result is a wine that is dry, full-bodied and amber coloured, similar to Madeira or Sherry. During the year outside, 6 to 8% of the volume is lost to evaporation, the [...] "angels' share".Brought back inside and left to rest for a few months, the wines are then blended together into oak casks. A small quantity of <b>Mistelle</b> (grape juice and alcohol) is added to the wines in order to soften them, along with a dash of fruit essence to accentuate their flavour.|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{traditional}} cake making in the Terra Alta (Catalonien) area linked to festivities, {{and in particular the}} pastries usually made. In this area the pastries are known as cócs, a word common to Terra Alta and the neighbouring districts of Ribera d&# 39;Ebre and the Priorat. Locally produced <b>mistelle,</b> sweet or rancid wine is served with the pastries. Nowadays, the bakeries and cake makers in the area&# 39;s towns and villages also produce traditionally crafted products, that used only to be homemade. The article, resulting from the final degree project produced by the author for her Humanities degree at the UOC, offers a privileged look at the richness of the Terra Alta in terms of its gastronomic history, customs and its high regard for its cakes. The author, who has previous experience in the field, places the specific aspects of Terra Alta cake making {{in the context of the}} Mediterranean cultures with common roots dating back to the ancient and medieval worlds and which still have an easily identifiable "family feel", whilst looking, from an ethnographic point of view, at what she calls the "world of wheat" in the area, (the dough for bread, the craft of the baker, the ovens and other tools, and the associated traditions, among other things). In short, she rescues a living part of the local day-to-day activities and places it under the microscope of food history, whilst providing information that may well be of interest for study from other points of view...|$|E
