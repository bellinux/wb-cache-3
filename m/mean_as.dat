25|$|Since each {{observation}} has expectation λ so {{does this}} sample mean. Therefore, the maximum likelihood estimate is an unbiased estimator of λ. It {{is also an}} efficient estimator, i.e. its estimation variance achieves the Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB). Hence it is minimum-variance unbiased. Also it can be proved that the sum (and hence the sample <b>mean</b> <b>as</b> it is a one-to-one function of the sum) is a complete and sufficient statistic for λ.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of a criterion that can be evaluated to determine when the solution with the minimum error has been achieved. Laplace tried to specify a mathematical form of the probability density for the errors and define a method of estimation that minimizes the error of estimation. For this purpose, Laplace used a symmetric two-sided exponential distribution we now call Laplace distribution to model the error distribution, and used the sum of absolute deviation as error of estimation. He felt these to be the simplest assumptions he could make, and {{he had hoped to}} obtain the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>as</b> the best estimate. Instead, his estimator was the posterior median.|$|E

25|$|In 1809 Carl Friedrich Gauss {{published}} his method of calculating {{the orbits of}} celestial bodies. In that work {{he claimed to have}} been in possession of the method of least squares since 1795. This naturally led to a priority dispute with Legendre. However, to Gauss's credit, he went beyond Legendre and succeeded in connecting the method of least squares with the principles of probability and to the normal distribution. He had managed to complete Laplace's program of specifying a mathematical form of the probability density for the observations, depending on a finite number of unknown parameters, and define a method of estimation that minimizes the error of estimation. Gauss showed that arithmetic mean is indeed the best estimate of the location parameter by changing both the probability density and the method of estimation. He then turned the problem around by asking what form the density should have and what method of estimation should be used to get the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>as</b> estimate of the location parameter. In this attempt, he invented the normal distribution.|$|E

Although Raquel accepts, she tells Des that she loves him, not Curly and decides to break off the engagement. The following year, Curly's boss Leo Firman (John Elmes) attempts to rape Raquel. She manages to escape and tells Curly, who attacks Leo. Raquel gives evidence of sexual harassment against him and Leo is fired. She and Curly grow closer in the aftermath. Though Raquel sleeps with Des again, he makes it clear that it was just a one-night stand, and Raquel accepts that she will never <b>mean</b> <b>as</b> much to Des as he does to her. Later that day, Raquel proposes to Curly. They have a quick registry office wedding, and it is not until their honeymoon that Raquel admits what happened with Des. Curly forgives her, and their married life is initially happy. It does not last, however, and within a year Raquel leaves Curly to accept an aromatherapy job in Kuala Lumpur.|$|E

500|$|A {{characteristic}} {{value of the}} maximum potential intensity, , is [...] However, this quantity varies significantly across space and time, particularly within the seasonal cycle, spanning a range of [...] This variability is primarily due to variability in the surface enthalpy disequilibrium ( [...] ) {{as well as in}} the thermodynamic structure of the troposphere, which are controlled by the large-scale dynamics of the tropical climate. These processes are modulated by factors including the sea surface temperature (and underlying ocean dynamics), background near-surface wind speed, and the vertical structure of atmospheric radiative heating. The nature of this modulation is complex, particularly on climate time-scales (decades or longer). [...] On shorter time-scales, variability in the maximum potential intensity is commonly linked to sea surface temperature perturbations from the tropical <b>mean,</b> <b>as</b> regions with relatively warm water have thermodynamic states much more capable of sustaining a tropical cyclone than regions with relatively cold water.
