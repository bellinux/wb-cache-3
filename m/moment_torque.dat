50|$|The {{resultant}} moment {{of a couple}} is called a torque. This {{is not to be}} confused with the term torque as it is used in physics, where it is merely a synonym of moment. Instead, torque is a special case of <b>moment.</b> <b>Torque</b> has special properties that moment does not have, in particular the property of being independent of reference point, as described below.|$|E
5000|$|The {{moment of}} a force is only defined {{with respect to}} a certain point P (it {{is said to be the}} [...] "moment about P"), and in general when P is changed, the moment changes. However, the <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> of a couple is {{independent}} of the reference point P: Any point will give the same moment. In other words, a torque vector, unlike any other moment vector, is a [...] "free vector".|$|E
5000|$|Torque-free {{precession}} {{implies that}} no external <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> {{is applied to}} the body. In torque-free precession, the angular momentum is a constant, but the angular velocity vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying moment of inertia, or more precisely, a time-varying inertia matrix. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate coordinate axes (e.g. , , [...] ). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the component of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis moment of inertia.|$|E

5000|$|Rollovers {{can also}} {{occur when the}} vehicle is knocked into a {{stationary}} object such as a curb. In these so-called [...] "trip events", a vehicle hit from the side but kept from moving laterally by a curb would produce a moment about {{the center of gravity}} sufficient to produce a rollover. To counteract this, rollover stability systems have begun to incorporate an active suspension system in rollover protection. To accomplish this, the onboard computer uses data from the Inertial measurement unit (IMU) to determine when a vehicle is in a rollover condition independent of yaw rate and vehicle speed. When the computer determines that the vehicle is at risk of rollover, it calculates the direction of roll and activates the active suspension system. The force produced in the suspension creates a <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> opposite to that created by the lateral force, and keeps the vehicle safe.|$|E
50|$|The {{subsequent}} {{investigation on}} {{the loss of}} Captain, {{in the form of}} a court-martial, under Sir James Hope, took place on board HMS Duke of Wellington, in Portsmouth Harbour. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the righting <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS Monarch, the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a righting moment of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum righting moment occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. Monarch's righting moment increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the Captain floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized. An inclining test had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship's stability characteristics to be calculated. Captain set sail on the ship's final voyage before the results of the trial were published.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Composites {{have become}} {{valuable}} construction {{materials in the}} aerospace, defense, automobile, and civil industries due to their superior mechanical properties. However, there are {{significant differences between the}} machining of metals and alloys and that of composites, because composites are anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Drilling with a conventional twist drill is characterized by a relatively large thrust force due to a negative rake and negligibly small cutting speed at the chisel edge. Such a large thrust force causes defects and damages the composites, leading to poor hole quality, and reduced in-service life under fatigue loads. Although significant efforts have been made to realize the thrust force of twist drill, there are few papers reporting the effect of peripheral drilling <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> on delamination in drilling composite materials. In this paper, an attempt is made to develop the critical thrust of the twist drill with peripheral drilling moment using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and energy conservation.

In this model, the fully nonlinear dynamical equations governing the time-varying solid-body ship motion under the forces arising from ship wave interactions are solved with given initial conditions. The net force and <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> on the ship body are directly calculated via integration of the hydrodynamic pressure over the wetted surface and the buoyancy effect from the underwater volume of the actual ship hull with a hybrid finite-difference/finite-element method. Neither empirical nor free parametrization is introduced in this model, i. e. no a priori experimental data are needed for modelling. This model is benchmarked with many experiments of various ship hulls for heave, roll and pitch motion. In addition to the benchmark cases, numerical experiments are also carried out for strongly nonlinear ship motion with a fixed heading. These new cases demonstrate clearly the importance of nonlinearities in ship motion modelling...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of nonlinearities in material constitutive relations {{has long been}} appreciated in the continuum mechanics of macroscopic rods. Although the <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> response to bending is almost universally linear for small deflection angles, many rod systems exhibit a high-curvature softening. The signature behavior of these rod systems is a kinking transition in which the bending is localized. Recent DNA cyclization experiments by Cloutier and Widom have offered evidence that the linear-elastic bending theory fails to describe the high-curvature mechanics of DNA. Motivated by this recent experimental work, we develop a simple and exact theory of the statistical mechanics of linear-elastic polymer chains that can undergo a kinking transition. We characterize the kinking behavior with a single parameter and show that the resulting theory reproduces both the low-curvature linear-elastic behavior which is already well described by the Wormlike Chain model, {{as well as the}} high-curvature softening observed in recent cyclization experiments.

40|$|In this work, the {{so-called}} Eshelbian or configurational mechanics of quasicrystals is presented. Quasicrystals are {{considered as a}} prototype of novel materials. Material balance laws for quasicrystalline materials with dislocations are derived {{in the framework of}} generalized incompatible elasticity theory of quasicrystals. Translations, scaling transformations as well as rotations are examined; the latter presents particular interest due to the quasicrystalline structure. This derivation provides important quantities of the Eshelbian mechanics, as the Eshelby stress tensor, the scaling flux vector, the angular momentum tensor, the configurational forces (Peach-Koehler force, Cherepanov force, inhomogeneity force or Eshelby force), the configurational work and the configurational vector moments for dislocations in quasicrystals. The corresponding $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for dislocation loops and straight dislocations in quasicrystals are derived and discussed. Moreover, the explicit formulas of the $J$-, $M$-, and $L$-integrals for parallel screw dislocations in one-dimensional hexagonal quasicrystals are obtained.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of sloshing-dynamics-modulated fluid systems driven by orbital accelerations including gravity gradient and jitter accelerations has been studied. Partly liquid-filled rotating Dewars applicable to a full-scale Gravity Probe-B Spacecraft container {{with and without}} baffle are considered. Results show that a slosh wave excited along the liquid-vapor interface induced by jitter-acceleration-dominated orbital accelerations provides a torsional moment with an up-and-down movement of bubble oscillations in the rotating Dewar. The fluctuations of fluid forces and fluid <b>moment</b> (<b>torque)</b> exerted on the Dewar wall of the container caused by slosh-wave excitation driven by orbital accelerations are also investigated. Since the viscous force across a liquid-solid interface and the surface-tension force across a liquid-vapor or liquid-solid interface can greatly contribute to the damping effect of slosh-wave excitation, a rotating Dewar with a baffle provides more areas of liquid-solid, and liquid-vapor, and solid-vapor interfaces than does a rotating Dewar without a baffle.

40|$|Background: Currently, a {{suitable}} and reliable noninvasive method to evaluate rotational stability in vivo in anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees, particularly during sports movements, does not exist. We speculated {{that if there}} is a rotational instability, the patient would avoid reaching a high pivoting moment during pivoting activities as a defense mechanism, and that the ground reaction moment, as registered by dynamometric platforms, would be reduced. On the basis of this hypothesis, we developed a study using kinetic analysis to evaluate rotational stability under dynamic loading. Methods: Thirty recreationally active athletes, including fifteen healthy subjects and fifteen with an anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, were recruited for this study. Patients performed jumping with pivoting with internal tibial rotation and external tibial rotation on the dynamometric platform with both the healthy and the injured limb. The quantitative results were graphically plotted, and the following parameters were evaluated: loading moment, pivoting <b>moment,</b> <b>torque</b> amplitude, loading slope, pivoting slope, percentage of pivoting with load, loading impulse, pivoting impulse, and maxi-mum body rotation angle. Results: There were no significant differences between the dominant and nondominant knees in the control group during the jumping with pivoting and external tibial rotation test with regard to the pivotingmoment (p = 0. 805), pivoting slope (p= 0. 716), pivoting impulse 2 (p = 0. 858), and pivoting impulse 3 (p = 0. 873).

40|$|Posterior {{pedicle screw}} and rod {{fixation}} has become {{standard in the}} treatment of oncological resections requiring stabilization, deformity correction and unstable thoracolumbar fractures. Given the high mechanical stress at the points of highest instability, some clinicians have utilized dual rods on each side to augment the construct. The added advantage of this type of construct has not been previously evaluated in-vitro. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the biomechanical advantage of a dual rod construct in the thoracolumbar spine, using a burst fracture cadaveric model. Methods: Seven fresh human cadaveric (T 9 -L 3) spines were tested in normal conditions, after an iatrogenic T 12 burst fracture, and successively after laminectomy and standard two rod pedicle screw stabilization (two level above and two below) and two different dual rod overlapping constructs. Pure <b>moment</b> <b>torque</b> was applied quasistatically, while 3 D motion was measured optoelectronically. Thoracolumbar range of motion was measured during flexion, extension, left / right lateral bending, and left / right axial rotation. Results: All constructs significantly stabilized the simulated burst fracture in all modes of testing. There was no statistically significant difference, however, in the ability to restrict motion between the 3 different constructs, either from T 10 -L 2, or across the fracture segment of T 11 -L 1. Conclusions: There does not appear to be a biomechanical advantage to using dual rods over standard single rods for immediate fixation in an unstable segment.

This paper is the first in a three part series that will examine how a variety of biomechanical principles and concepts have direct relevance to the prescription of resistance training for the general and athletic populations as well as for musculoskeletal injury rehabilitation. In this paper, we start by defining the terms <b>moment</b> (<b>torque),</b> moment arms, compressive, tensile and shear forces as well as joint stress (pressure). We then demonstrate how an understanding of moments and moment arms is integral to the exercise professionals’ ability to develop a systematic progression of variations of common exercises.

We then highlight the primary results of several selected studies which have compared the resistance moment arms and joint moments, forces or stresses that are encountered during selected variations of common lower body resistance training exercises. We hope that exercise professionals will benefit from this knowledge of applied resistance training biomechanics and be better able to systematically progress exercise difficulty and to modify joint loading as a result.
