40|$|Elliptic curve {{cryptography}} (ECC) is {{an ideal}} choice for low-resource applications because it provides {{the same level of}} security with smaller key sizes than other existing public key encryption schemes. For low-resource applications, designing efficient functional units for elliptic curve computations over binary fields results in an effective platform for an embedded co-processor. This paper proposes such a co-processor designed for area-constrained devices by utilizing state of the art binary Edwards curve equations over <b>mixed</b> <b>point</b> addition and doubling. The binary Edwards curve offers the security advantage that it is complete and is, therefore, immune to the exceptional points attack. In conjunction with Montgomery Ladder, such a curve is naturally immune to most types of simple power and timing attacks. The recently presented formulas for <b>mixed</b> <b>point</b> addition in [1] were found to be invalid, but were corrected such that the speed and register usage were maintained. We utilize corrected <b>mixed</b> <b>point</b> addition and doubling formulas to achieve a secure, but still fast implementation of a point multiplication on binary Edwards curves. Our synthesis results over NIST recommended fields for ECC indicate that the proposed co-processor requires about 50 % fewer clock cycles for point multiplication and occupies a similar silicon area when compared to the most recent in literature...|$|R

A correlation to predict the <b>mixing</b> <b>point</b> pressure was developed and showed good agreement with the experimental data. With this correlation, it is possible to predict the occurrence of the critical condition for the air flow at the exit of its port. In a second group of results, the influence of geometrical and operational parameters on the pressure distribution inside the mixing duct was analyzed. The main result found was that for air liquid ratio between 0. 1 and 0. 2, this pressure distribution can be taken as linear. This information about air liquid ratio and the correlation to predict the occurrence of chocked flow at the exit of the air port may give useful guidelines for atomizer designers. Finally, using a two-phase map, the flow pattern inside Y-jet atomizers was found to be a transition between the annular flow and the wispy-annular flow. FAPES...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is {{given for the}} perturbation of the order and composition of lipid bilayers near an intrinsic membrane protein. Two cases are examined: the protein influences the lipid order (i. e., "fluidity"), and the protein associates with one component of a lipid mixture preferentially. The order perturbation is studied {{as a function of}} temperature and lateral pressure by using Landau [...] de Gennes theory and a variational procedure. It is concluded that, for a given lateral pressure, the greatest amount of boundary lipid is present at the lipid phase-transition temperature. A critical point for the phase transition occurs, near which the amount of boundary lipid increases dramatically. The composition perturbation is modeled in a binary lipid mixture by using a simple regular solution theory. The perturbation is found not to extent much beyond the directly bound layer of lipids unless the solution is near a critical <b>mixing</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E

30|$|The term “plunge point” is {{used for}} both “{{plunging}} waves” and “plunging rivers”. According to the Glossary of Coastal Terminology (1998), a plunging wave {{is defined as the}} point at which the wave curls over and falls. According to Assireu et al. (2011), for plunging rivers, the plunge point is the main <b>mixing</b> <b>point</b> between river and epilimnetic reservoir. In other words, the point at which sediment-laden river flow plunges down into a standing body of water, be it a lake, a reservoir, or a sea. Plunging occurs very close to the shoreline in shallow water (Fig. 3 b). In the Yellow River in China, for example, the plunge point occurs at 5  m of depth in the Bohai Bay (Wright et al. 1986). When a river flow crosses the plunge point at the river mouth, it transforms into a river plume of various densities, which include hyperpycnal plumes (Fig. 2 c). At the plunge point, the river flow moves from a momentum-dominated type to a buoyancy-dominated type and marks the transition of an inflow to an underflow (Dallimore et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|Examination of the {{influence}} of dissolved gases {{on the state of the}} liquid surface during high-pressure liquid-monopropellant combustion through the use of a strand burning experiment. Liquid surface temperatures were measured, using fine-wire thermocouples, during the strand combustion of ethyl nitrate, normal propyl nitrate, and propylene glycol dinitrate at pressures up to 81 atm. These measurements were compared with the predictions of a variable-property gas-phase analysis assuming an infinite activation energy for the decomposition reaction. The state of the liquid surface was estimated using a conventional low-pressure phase equilibrium model, as well as a high-pressure version that considered the presence of dissolved combustion-product gases in the liquid phase. The high-pressure model was found to give a superior prediction of measured liquid surface temperatures. Computed total pressures required for the surface to reach its critical <b>mixing</b> <b>point</b> during strand combustion were found to be in the range from 2. 15 to 4. 62 times the critical pressure of the pure propellant.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the mixing of {{different}} raw materials, i. e. the uniformity of the mixture, is a key issue that will determine the morphology and the specific product properties of the resulting compound [1, 2]. Numerical simulation of flow in extruder components provides a new insight, both qualitative and quantitative, into those features. 3 -D transient numerical simulations of twin screw extruder (TSE) configurations are presented. A special method, the mesh superposition technique (MST), has been introduced to provide a convenient way to model intermeshing TSEs without involving any remeshing complexity [3]. It has been validated in previous work for isothermal cases [4].
