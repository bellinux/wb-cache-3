As both these substances are metabolised and excreted as glycine conjugates there would possibly be competition for this conjugation pathway. Five male volunteers were exposed on separate occasions to <b>m-xylene</b> by inhalation (100 ppm), aspirin (1500 mg) by mouth, and <b>m-xylene</b> and aspirin together under controlled conditions in an exposure chamber. Urine and blood samples were collected and analysed for <b>m-xylene,</b> aspirin, and their metabolites.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} differences in excretion of toluene and <b>m-xylene.</b> After intraperitoneal injection of toluene or <b>m-xylene</b> (5 mmole per kg body weight) to Wistar female rats, urine and expired air were collected regularly. The concentrations of toluene and <b>m-xylene</b> in expired air were determined spectrophotometrically. Their urinary metabolites hippuric acid and m-methylhippuric acid were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results were: 1. The excretion rates in expired air for 10 hours after the administration of toluene and <b>m-xylene</b> were 37. 7 % and 13. 1 % respectively. After the injection of toluene, the excretion rate per hour of the vapor in expired air increased rapidly, and reached a maximum (6. 1 %) in 2 hours, then decreased in a half-life of 4. 87 hours. The maximum excretion rate of <b>m-xylene</b> per hour was 1. 6 % in 3 or 4 hours; thereafter, the excretion rate decreased more slowly than in the case of toluene. 2. The total excretion rate in urine for 48 hours after administration was 29. 0 % for toluene and 43. 5 % for <b>m-xylene.</b> Urinary excretion of <b>m-xylene</b> is apparently higher than that of toluene, in contrast to expiratory excretion. Following the administration of toluene, about 14 % had been eliminated as hippuric acid in the 0 - 10 and 10 - 24 hours' urine. The concentration of hippuric acid had returned to normal in the 24 - 48 hours' urine. m-Methylhippuric acid in the 0 - 10 hours' urine was 13. 7 % of m-xylene; in the 10 - 24 hours' urine it was 22. 3 %; moreover, 7. 5 % was found even in the 24 - 48 hours' urine. From these results, it is estimated that the velocity of urinary excretion of <b>m-xylene</b> is less than that of toluene. 3. The total excretion rate of toluene in urine and expired air was 51. 9 % and that of <b>m-xylene</b> was 26. 9 %, for 10 hours after the administration. Furthermore, the excretion rate of both 10 hours' expired air and 48 hours' urine, was 66. 7 % for toluene and 56. 6 % for <b>m-xylene.</b> 4. The ratio of 48 hours' urinary excretion to 10 hours' expiratory excretion was 0. 77 for toluene and 3. 58 for <b>m-xylene.</b> These results indicate that toluene was excreted more in expired air than in urine whereas <b>m-xylene</b> was mainly excreted in urine...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine whether}} previous subacute treatment with ethanol could modify the kinetics of <b>m-xylene</b> in humans. A group of six volunteers was exposed twice to either 100 or 400 ppm of <b>m-xylene</b> during two hours (between 0800 and 1000). Ethanol was given orally {{in the early evening}} on each of two consecutive days before exposures (total ethanol intake of 137 g). Such ethanol pretreatment affected the kinetics of <b>m-xylene</b> but only at the high exposure (400 ppm). The modifications were: (1) decreased concentration of <b>m-xylene</b> in blood and alveolar air during and after exposure; (2) increased urinary excretion of m-methylhippuric acid at the end of exposure. Ethanol treatment also enhanced the elimination of antipyrine in saliva. Overall, this study showed that the effect of enzyme induction on the metabolism of <b>m-xylene,</b> after ethanol ingestion, depends on the exposure concentration and is not likely to occur as long as the exposure concentrations remain under the current maximum allowable concentration (100 ppm) in the workplace...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to adsorb <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene was studied experimentally. Thus, the {{adsorption}} isotherms of two volatile organic compounds, toluene and <b>m-xylene,</b> on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX were measured at 298, 308, 318, and 333 K using a vacuum microbalance system. The toluene and the <b>m-xylene</b> were chosen because {{they belong to}} the same chemical family. The experimental data obtained were correlated with different existing adsorption isotherm models such as the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, the Hill-De Boer model and the Sips model. The Langmuir model is well adapted to the description of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene adsorption on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Sips model is also found to be well adapted to describe the adsorption of toluene on to NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, and the Hill-De Boer model were not satisfactory. The adsorption affinity of <b>m-xylene</b> on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites is sufficiently greater than the affinity of toluene. The adsorption affinity of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene decreased in the following order NaY>NaX>BaX>KY>BaY. These results demonstrate the high capacity of NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to remove vapors of <b>m-xylene</b> and toluene at very low concentrations. However, in the volumetric method, the accuracy of the data depends on the precision with which the equilibrium pressure is measured. Besides, the existence of dead volume, the value of which is never known with high precision, is a source of error. That is why, the gravimetric method remains the most accurate method for measuring gas-solid equilibrium data for pure gases...|$|E

40|$|Seven {{different}} sources of inocula that included sediments, contaminated soils, groundwater, process effluent, and sludge {{were used to}} establish enrichment cultures of denitrifying bacteria on benzene, toluene, and xylenes {{in the absence of}} molecular oxygen. All of the enrichment cultures demonstrated complete depletion of toluene and partial depletion of o-xylene within 3 months of incubation. The depletion of o-xylene was correlated to and dependent on the metabolism of toluene. No losses of benzene, p-xylene, or <b>m-xylene</b> were observed in these initial enrichment cultures. However, <b>m-xylene</b> was degraded by a subculture that was incubated on <b>m-xylene</b> alone. Complete carbon, nitrogen, and electron balances were determined for the degradation of toluene and <b>m-xylene.</b> These balances showed that these compounds were mineralized with greater than 50 % conversion to CO 2 and significant assimilation into biomass. Additionally, the oxidation of these compounds was shown to be dependent on nitrate reduction and denitrification.

Characterization of strains with mutations in structural genes of this pathway demonstrates that the inducers of the enzymes responsible for further degradation of m-toluate include <b>m-xylene,</b> m-methylbenzyl alcohol, and m-toluate, whereas the inducers of the enzymes responsible for oxidation of <b>m-xylene</b> to m-toluate include <b>m-xylene</b> and m-methylbenzyl alcohol but not m-toluate. A regulatory mutant is described in which <b>m-xylene</b> and m-methylbenzyl alcohol no longer induce any of the pathway enzymes, but m-toluate is still able to induce the enzymes responsible for its own degradation.

The effect of reaction conditions on the variation of isomerization to disproportionation products ratio (I/D), distribution of trimethylbenzene (TMB) isomers (1, 3, 5 -to- 1, 2, 3 -) and values of pxylene/ o-xylene (P/O) ratios are reported.

In the presence of succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) and nitrate, (3 -methylbenzyl) succinate was oxidized to E-(3 -methylphenyl) itaconate (or a closely related isomer) and 3 -methylbenzoate. Kinetic studies conducted with permeabilized cells and whole-cell suspensions of m-xylene-grown Azoarcus sp. strain T demonstrated that the specific rate of in vitro (3 -methylbenzyl) succinate formation accounts for at least 15 % of the specific rate of in vivo <b>m-xylene</b> consumption.
