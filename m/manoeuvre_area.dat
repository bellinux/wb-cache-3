He wanted to be closer to the German government's procurement process for military sale. However, Gustav was not skilled at the politics and payoffs necessary when dealing with the Bavarian war ministry and Prussian Army. Unable to navigate these politics while leaving his pride and integrity intact deeply troubled Gustav.Shortly after 1914, Otto established another company named AGO Flugzeugwerke at Berlin's Johannisthal Air Field. The initials AGO stood for either Actien-Gesellschaft Otto or Aerowerke Gustav Otto- {{there seems to be some}} ambiguity- but the company mostly licence-built Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik designs,(as did Pfalz Flugzeugwerke) during the early years of World War I. The designs by Gustav Otto were initially successful, but Otto was continually experiencing problems related to cost-effective production, as well as generating profits. At the start of the war, Otto-Flugzeugwerke was supplying the German Air Force, but the production problems ended up being so great that the government agencies urged the company to solve the issues. [...] The stress of wartime seemed to prove too great a burden for Gustov who suffered health issues which led to financial problems with the company. In 1915 he was admitted to a Munich mental hospital for treatment of depression. As he was being treated, the company languished to the edge of bankruptcy. Eventually, Otto was forced to resign from the business and was offered a buyout that would compensate him for the business as well as his medical bills. The assets were finally taken over by a consortium which incorporated them into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke on 19 February 1916. Gustav Otto no longer had a stake in this company. He turned his attention instead to Otto-Werke Flugzeug- und Maschinenfabrik GmbH, which was founded on 1 February 1916, just before Otto-Flugzeugwerke was taken over by the consortium. This new company was unconnected with the newly established company.|$|E

40|$|The harbor of Surgidero de Batabano is a harbor {{that lies}} in the Gulf of Batabano in the South-Western part of Cuba. It serves as a {{connection}} between the main land of Cuba and the islands 'Isla de la Juventud' and Cayo Largo. The Batabano harbor suffers from sediment accretion. The accretion of sediment is harmful to port operations, since the depth of the quays and approach channel decreases gradually and ships are no longer able to enter the harbor. Since 1959 maintenance dredging is required every 4 years inside the <b>manoeuvre</b> <b>area</b> of the harbor, along the quay and inside the approach channel, {{in order to keep the}} harbor available for shipment. This is a costly operation. The Cuban harbor authority, APN (Autoridad Portuaria Nacional), want this problem to be solved. When considering the problems described above, the goal of this project is defined by the following: 'To reduce the frequency of dredging of accreted sediment in the harbor of Surgidero de Batabano, while keeping in mind costs, future plans, impact on the environment as well as local facilities'. Furthermore it is very important to calculate the amount of sediment accreting in the harbor and its origins. This information is useful when considering the solutions for the problems. During the analysis of the project, the project site has been investigated by literature and a site visit. The boundary conditions have been determined and the technical demand have been specified. The desires of the APN have been taken into account as well. Using all information obtained in the project analysis, the sediment transport processes inducing the accretion of sediment in the harbor have been analysed. Using theory, calculations and computer simulations, it was discovered that a combination of alongshore and cross-shore sediment transport governing the accretion in the harbor: - Alongshore transport of sediment along the coast, mainly from East to West, generated by normal wave conditions from an East/South-East direction. Sediment transported by this alongshore current, will be deposited in between the breakwaters; - Cross-shore transport of sediment perpendicular to the coast, where both sediment from deeper waters as well as accreted alongshore sediment in front of the harbor is transported by normal and extreme conditions. With the source of sediment known, several preliminary designs were created. Using a Multi Criteria Analyses, cost estimation and risk evaluation 4 preliminary designs were selected to be designed in further detail; extension of the existing Eastern breakwater, extension of the Western breakwater, a combination of these two and the current solution (remain dredging every 4 years). The main reasons for selecting these designs are: efficiency against accretion one the one hand and the wishes of the APN on the other hand. In order to obtain an optimal solution, the above mentioned designs were varied in layout. From these 9 layout options the 4 best options were selected as final designs to be further elaborated. These were a Western breakwater (attached and detached), an Eastern breakwater and a combination of a Western- and an Eastern breakwater. Using theory, calculations and computer simulations, the effectiveness against accretion in the harbor was estimated. Every design was evaluated using an Multi Criteria Analyses (MCA). The costs of each design has been determined. Using both costs and the MCA the best design was selected. The design to be recommended, is the combination of an extension of the existing Eastern breakwater and the expansion of the Western breakwater. Though this is not the cheapest option nor the most effective against accretion of sediment, the combination of these factors give the best overall results for a life span of 50 years. Another great advantage of this design, is the fact it can be built in two phases: first the Eastern and last the Western breakwater. In this was APN will be able to spread the costs of the construction of the design over a longer time. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
