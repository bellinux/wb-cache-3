25|$|In modern times, pottery {{from the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance often retains a {{distinct}} gold- or copper-colored <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter.</b> This luster {{is caused by}} a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a glazing, which contains silver and copper nanoparticles dispersed homogeneously in the glassy matrix of the ceramic glaze. These nanoparticles are created by the artisans by adding copper and silver salts and oxides together with vinegar, ochre, and clay on the surface of previously-glazed pottery. The technique originated in the Muslim world. As Muslims were not allowed to use gold in artistic representations, they sought a way to create a similar effect without using real gold. The solution they found was using luster.|$|E
60|$|Its {{motion was}} so swift, complex, and perfect {{that at first}} I did not {{see it as a}} machine, in spite of its <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter.</b> The fighting-machines were coordinated and {{animated}} to an extraordinary pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon, scarcely realise that living quality.|$|E
60|$|It was noon of the 10th of August, 1838. The {{monotonous}} {{coast line}} between Monterey and San Diego had set its hard outlines against the steady {{glare of the}} Californian sky and the <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter</b> of the Pacific Ocean. The weary succession of rounded, dome-like hills obliterated all sense of distance; the rare whaling vessel or still rarer trader, drifting past, saw no change in these rusty undulations, barren of distinguishing peak or headland, and bald of wooded crest or timbered ravine. The withered ranks of wild oats gave a dull procession of uniform color to the hills, unbroken by any relief of shadow in their smooth, round curves. As {{far as the eye}} could reach, sea and shore met in one bleak monotony, flecked by no passing cloud, stirred by no sign of life or motion. Even sound was absent; the Angelus, rung from the invisible Mission tower far inland, was driven back again by the steady northwest trades, that for half the year had swept the coast line and left it abraded of all umbrage and color.|$|E
5000|$|Kinginrin (金銀鱗) is a koi with <b>metallic</b> (<b>glittering,</b> metal-flake-appearing) scales. The name {{translates}} into English as [...] "gold and silver scales"; {{it is often}} abbreviated to Ginrin. Ginrin versions of almost all other varieties of koi occur, and they are fashionable. Their sparkling, glittering scales contrast to the smooth, even, metallic skin and scales seen in the Ogon varieties. Recently, these characteristics have been combined to create the new ginrin Ogon varieties.|$|R

50|$|Gel inks usually contain {{pigments}}, while liquid inks {{are limited}} to dyestuffs, as pigments will sink down in liquid ink (sedimentation). The thickness and suspending power of gels allows the use of pigments in gelled ink, which yields {{a greater variety of}} brighter colors than is possible in liquid ink. Gels also allow for the use of heavier pigments with <b>metallic</b> or <b>glitter</b> effects, or opaque pastel pigments that can be seen on dark surfaces.|$|R
6000|$|There is an airy grace {{about the}} best pieces of Washington Irving, which has no {{parallel}} amongst English writers, however closely modelled may be his style upon that of the Addisonian age. There is much original power, which will perhaps be better appreciated at a future day, about Fenimore Cooper's delineations of the physical and spiritual border-land, between white and red, between civilization and savagery. There is dramatic power of a high order about Mr. Hawthorne, though mixed with a certain morbidness and bad taste, which debar him from ever attaining to the first rank. There is an originality of position about Mr. Emerson, in his resolute setting up of King Self against King Mob, which, coupled with a singular <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter</b> of style, and plenty of shrewd New England mother-wit, have made up together {{one of the best}} counterfeits of genius that has been seen for many a day; so good, indeed, that most men are taken by it for the first quarter of an hour at the least. But for real unmistakable genius,--for that glorious fulness of power which knocks a man down at a blow for sheer admiration, and then makes him rush into the arms of the knocker-down, and swear eternal friendship with him for sheer delight; the [...] "Biglow Papers" [...] stand alone.|$|E
60|$|Abner Nott's enthusiasm {{was shared}} by his daughter, but with more imagination, and an {{intelligence}} stimulated by the scant literature of her father's emigrant wagon and the few books found on the cabin shelves. But to her the strange shell she inhabited suggested more of the great world than the rude, chaotic civilization she saw from the cabin windows or met in the persons of her father's lodgers. Shut up for days in this quaint tenement, she had seen it change from the enchanted playground of her childish fancy to the theater of her active maidenhood, but without losing her ideal romance in it. She had translated its history in her own way, read its quaint nautical hieroglyphics after her own fashion, and possessed herself of its secrets. She had in fancy made voyages in it to foreign lands, had heard the accents of a softer tongue on its decks, and on summer nights, {{from the roof of}} the quarter-deck, had seen mellower constellations take the place of the hard <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter</b> of the Californian skies. Sometimes, in her isolation, the long, cylindrical vault she inhabited seemed, like some vast sea-shell, to become musical with the murmurings of the distant sea. So completely had it taken the place of the usual instincts of feminine youth that she had forgotten she was pretty, or that her dresses were old in fashion and scant in quantity. After the first surprise of admiration her father's lodgers ceased to follow the abstracted nymph except with their eyes,--partly respecting her spiritual shyness, partly respecting the jealous supervision of the paternal Nott. She seldom penetrated the crowded center of the growing city; her rare excursions were confined to the old ranch at Petaluma, whence she brought flowers and plants, and even extemporized a hanging-garden on the quarter-deck.|$|E
6000|$|One of my {{earliest}} experiences of seeing and losing relates to a humming-bird--a veritable [...] "jewel of ornithology." [...] I {{was only a}} boy at the time, but already pretty well acquainted with the birds of the district I lived in, near La Plata River, and among them were three species of the hummingbird. One spring day I saw a fourth--a wonderful little thing, only half {{as big as the}} smallest of the other three--the well-known Phaithornis splendens--and scarcely larger than a bumble-bee. I was within three feet of it as it sucked at the flowers, suspended motionless in the air, the wings appearing formless and mist-like from their rapid vibratory motion, {{but the rest of the}} upper plumage was seen distinctly as anything can be seen. The head and neck and upper part of the back were emerald green, with the <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter</b> usually seen in the burnished scale-like feathers of these small birds; the lower half of the back was velvet-black; the tail and tail-coverts white as snow. On two other occasions, at intervals of a few days, I saw this brilliant little stranger, always very near, and tried without success to capture it, after which, it disappeared from the plantation. Four years later I saw it once again not far from the same place. It was late in summer, and I was out walking on the level plain where the ground was carpeted with short grass, and nothing else grew there except a solitary stunted cardoou thistle-bush with one flower on its central stem above the grey-green artichoke-like leaves. The disc of the great thorny blossom was as broad as that of a sunflower, purple in colour, delicately frosted with white; on this flat disc several insects were feeding--flies, fireflies, and small wasps--and I paused for a few minutes in my walk to watch them. Suddenly a small misty object flew swiftly downwards past my face, and paused motionless in the air an inch or two above the rim of the flower. Once more my lost humming-bird, which I remembered so well! The exquisitely graceful form, half circled by the misty moth-like wings, the glittering green and velvet-black mantle, and snow-white tail spread open like a fan--there it hung like a beautiful bird-shaped gem suspended by an invisible gossamer thread. One--two--three moments passed, while I gazed, trembling with rapturous excitement, and then, before I had time to collect my faculties and make a forlorn attempt to capture it with my hat, away it flew, gliding so swiftly on the air that form and colour were instantly lost, and in appearance it was only an obscure grey line traced rapidly along the, low sky and fading quickly out ol sight. And that was the last I ever saw of it.|$|E

50|$|In gemology, aventurescence (sometimes called aventurization) is {{an optical}} {{reflectance}} effect seen in certain gems. The effect {{amounts to a}} <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter,</b> arising from minute, preferentially oriented mineral platelets within the material. These platelets are so numerous that they also influence the material's body colour. In aventurine quartz chrome-bearing fuchsite produces a green stone, and various iron oxides produce a red stone.|$|E
50|$|Perfectly colorless and {{transparent}} glassy material found at Bakersville, North Carolina has occasionally been faceted as a gemstone. Another variety more frequently {{used as a}} gemstone is the aventurine-feldspar or sun-stone found as reddish cleavage masses in gneiss at Tvedestrand in southern Norway; this presents a brilliant red to golden <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter,</b> due {{to the presence of}} numerous small scales of hematite oriented within the feldspar structure.|$|E
50|$|Although {{nanoparticles}} {{are associated}} with modern science, they have a long history. Nanoparticles were used by artisans {{as far back as}} Rome in the fourth century in the famous Lycurgus cup made of dichroic glass as well as the ninth century in Mesopotamia for creating a glittering effect on the surface of pots. In modern times, pottery from the Middle Ages and Renaissance often retains a distinct gold- or copper-colored <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter.</b> This luster is caused by a metallic film that was applied to the transparent surface of a glazing. The luster can still be visible if the film has resisted atmospheric oxidation and other weathering.|$|E
5000|$|This is why, in art, a <b>metallic</b> {{paint that}} <b>glitters</b> in an {{approximation}} of real gold would be used; a solid color {{like that of}} the cell displayed in the adjacent box does not aesthetically [...] "read" [...] as gold. Especially in sacral art in Christian churches, real gold (as gold leaf) was used for rendering gold in paintings, e.g. for the halo of saints. Gold can also be woven into sheets of silk to give an East Asian traditional look.|$|R
50|$|A {{metallic}} {{color is}} a color {{that appears to}} be that of a polished metal. The visual sensation usually associated with metals is its metallic shine. This cannot be reproduced by a simple solid color, because the shiny effect is due to the material's brightness varying with the surface angle to the light source. In addition, there is no mechanism for showing metallic or fluorescent colors on a computer without resorting to rendering software which simulates the action of light on a shiny surface. Consequently in art and in heraldry one would normally use a <b>metallic</b> paint that <b>glitters</b> like a real metal.|$|R
5000|$|A rollerball pen {{dispenses}} a water-based liquid or gel ink {{through a}} ball tip {{similar to that}} of a ballpoint pen. The less-viscous ink is more easily absorbed by paper than oil-based ink, and the pen moves more easily across a writing surface. The rollerball pen was initially designed to combine the convenience of a ballpoint pen with the smooth [...] "wet ink" [...] effect of a fountain pen. Gel inks are available in a range of colors, including <b>metallic</b> paint colors, <b>glitter</b> effects, neon, blurred effects, saturated colors, pastel tones, vibrant shades, shady colors, invisible ink, see-through effect, shiny colors, and glow-in-the-dark effects.|$|R

5000|$|A commercially {{acquired}} [...] "melt and pour" [...] soap base {{is melted}} {{in a pan}} or commercial melting vessel, using direct heat, or in a water jacket melting pot, (large double boiler or [...] "bain marie"), and re-solidifies as it cools. Domestically, a microwave oven {{can be used for}} melting small quantities of the base. Additions can be added at the still-hot liquid stage, such as fragrance, fragrant essential oils, moisturizing agents, colorants, or exfoliating agents, e.g. poppy seeds, coffee grounds or pumice, along with coloured micas, <b>metallic</b> <b>glitter,</b> honey and flower heads. The liquified concoction can be poured into individual molds, tray molds, or blocks. Molds are made of metal or, more commonly, from reinforced silicone rubber, allowing artisans to make their own molds using a two-part mold kit. Upon cooling, the soap can be removed from the molds as individual soaps, or as blocks for slicing into bars. Layers of different colors, or transparent layers, can be built up, or pre-cast embeddable soap shapes, called embeds, can be set into the soap during moulding to produce novel patterns. Melt and pour bases can be transparent or opaque, and are sometimes enriched with products like goat's milk or shea butter to add value. The small-scale process lends itself to bespoke manufacture; a single soap bar can be individually manufactured if desired.|$|E

However, the metallic finish of such paints was added using fine aluminum powder and pigment rather than actual gold.|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of the grating projection method of a surface shape measurement method without contact, several attempts are proposed and verified. A whole-space tabulation method (WSTM) is demonstrated to measure a translucent <b>glittering</b> <b>metallic</b> mesh of a parabolic antenna for a radio astronomy satellite. A transparence method of the grating projection method is proposed to measure a glossy polymer film often used in space structures. An extrapolation method is proposed to measure a larger object than the reference planes. A pre-calibration can be used to adjust the measured value to the real values. The extrapolation method and the pre-calibration are demonstrated to measure a displacement of a wing of a developing airplane under loading. 特集 : 航空宇宙機システム研究センターにおける開発研究 2 : 5. オオワシII飛行にむけて並びに関連技術の研究開発（関連研究開発分野...|$|R

On, past Llandegai and all its rose-clad cottages; past yellow quarrymen walking out to their work, who stare as they pass at his haggard face, drenched clothes, and streaming hair.

6000|$|Neither her {{language}} nor her action had the slightest effect in inclining him to grant her request. The influence that instantly stopped him, {{on the way}} to his carriage, was the silent influence of her face. The startling contrast between the corpse-like pallor of her complexion and the overpowering life and light, the <b>glittering</b> <b>metallic</b> brightness in her large black eyes, held him literally spell-bound. She was dressed in dark colours, with perfect taste; she was of middle height, and (apparently) of middle age--say a year or two over thirty. Her lower features--the nose, mouth, and chin--possessed the fineness and delicacy of form which is oftener seen among women of foreign races than among women of English birth. She was unquestionably a handsome person--with the one serious drawback of her ghastly complexion, and with the less noticeable defect of a total want of tenderness in the expression of her eyes. Apart from his first emotion of surprise, the feeling she produced in the Doctor may be described as an overpowering feeling of professional curiosity. The case might prove to be something entirely new in his professional experience. 'It looks like it,' he thought; 'and it's worth waiting for.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{thing the}} Time Traveller {{held in his}} hand was a <b>glittering</b> <b>metallic</b> framework, {{scarcely}} larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He {{took one of the}} small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set {{it in front of the}} fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions.|$|R

6000|$|Gradually, {{the faint}} light that had {{filtered}} through the brush and débris before the tunnel faded quite away, and a damp charnel-house chill struck through the limbs of the two refugees, and made them shiver; {{the flow of water}} from the dripping walls seemed to have increased; Gabriel's experienced eye had already noted that the earthquake had apparently opened seams in the gully and closed up one of the leads. He carefully laid his burden down again, and crept to the opening. The distant hum of voices and occupation had ceased, the sun was setting; in a few moments, calculating on the brief twilight of the Mountain region, it would be dark, and they might with safety leave their hiding-place. As he was returning, he noticed a slant beam of light, hitherto unobserved, crossing the tunnel from an old drift. Examining it more closely, Gabriel was amazed to find that during the earthquake a [...] "cave" [...] had taken place in the drift, possibly precipitated by the shock, disclosing the more surprising fact {{that there had been a}} previous slight but positive excavation on the hill side, above the tunnel, that antedated any record of One Horse Gulch known to Gabriel. He was perfectly familiar with every foot of the hill side, and the existence of this ancient prospecting [...] "hole" [...] had never been even suspected by him. While he was still gazing at the opening, his foot struck against some <b>glittering</b> <b>metallic</b> substance. He stooped and picked up a small tin can, not larger than a sardine box, hermetically sealed and soldered, in which some inscription had been traced, but which the darkness of the tunnel prevented his deciphering. In the faint hope that it might contain something of benefit to his companion, Gabriel returned to the opening, and even ventured to step beyond its shadow. But all attempts to read the inscription were in vain. He opened the box with a sharp stone; it contained, to his great disappointment, only a memorandum book and some papers. He swept them into the pocket of his blouse, and re-entered the tunnel. He had not been absent altogether more than five minutes, but when he reached the place where he had left Jack, he was gone! ...|$|R
