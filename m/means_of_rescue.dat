60|$|Captain Shandon, urged on by his wife, who seldom meddled in {{business}} matters, had stipulated that John Finucane, Esquire, of the Upper Temple, should be appointed sub-editor of forthcoming Pall Mall Gazette, and this post was accordingly conferred upon Mr. Finucane by the spirited {{proprietor of the}} Journal. Indeed he deserved any kindness {{at the hands of}} Shandon, so fondly attached was he, as we have said, to the Captain and his family, and so eager to do him a service. It was in Finucane's chambers that Shandon in former days used to hide when danger was near and bailiffs abroad: until at length his hiding-place was known, and the sheriff's officers came as regularly to wait for the Captain on Finucane's staircase as at his own door. It was to Finucane's chambers that poor Mrs. Shandon came often and often to explain her troubles and griefs, and devise <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescue</b> for her adored Captain. Many a meal did Finucane furnish for her and the child there. It was an honour to his little rooms to be visited by such a lady; and as she went down the staircase with her veil over her face, Fin would lean over the balustrade looking after her, to see that no Temple Lovelace assailed her upon the road, perhaps hoping that some rogue might be induced to waylay her, so that he, Fin, might have the pleasure of rushing to her rescue, and breaking the rascal's bones. It was a sincere pleasure to Mrs. Shandon when the arrangements were made by which her kind honest champion was appointed her husband's aide-de-camp in the newspaper.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, such things need not be, {{and will not}} be, if this company, which is a drop of the life-blood of the great {{compassionate}} public heart, will only accept the <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescue</b> and prevention which it is mine to offer. Within {{a quarter of a}} mile of this place where I speak, stands a courtly old house, where once, no doubt, blooming children were born, and grew up to be men and women, and married, and brought their own blooming children back to patter up the old oak staircase which stood but the other day, and to wonder at the old oak carvings on the chimney-pieces. In the airy wards into which the old state drawing-rooms and family bedchambers of that house are now converted are such little patients that the attendant nurses look like reclaimed giantesses, and the kind medical practitioner like an amiable Christian ogre. Grouped about the little low tables in the centre of the rooms are such tiny convalescents that they seem to be playing at having been ill. On the doll's beds are such diminutive creatures that each poor sufferer is supplied with its tray of toys; and, looking round, you may see how the little tired, flushed cheek has toppled over half the brute creation on its way into the ark; or how one little dimpled arm has mowed down (as I saw myself) the whole tin soldiery of Europe. On the walls of these rooms are graceful, pleasant, bright, childish pictures. At the bed's heads, are pictures of the figure which is the universal embodiment of all mercy and compassion, the figure of Him who was once a child himself, and a poor one. Besides these little creatures on the beds, you may learn in that place that the number of small Out- patients brought to that house for relief is no fewer than ten thousand in the compass of one single year. In the room in which these are received, you may see against the wall a box, on which it is written, that it has been calculated, that if every grateful mother who brings a child there will drop a penny into it, the Hospital funds may possibly be increased in a year by so large a sum as forty pounds. And you may read in the Hospital Report, with a glow of pleasure, that these poor women are so respondent as to have made, even in a toiling year of difficulty and high prices, this estimated forty, fifty pounds. In the printed papers of this same Hospital, you may read with what a generous earnestness the highest and wisest members of the medical profession testify to the great need of it; to the immense difficulty of treating children in the same hospitals with grown-up people, by reason of their different ailments and requirements, to the vast amount of pain that will be assuaged, and of life that will be saved, through this Hospital; not only among the poor, observe, but among the prosperous too, by reason of the increased knowledge of children's illnesses, which cannot fail to arise from a more systematic mode of studying them. Lastly, gentlemen, and I am sorry to say, worst of all--(for I must present no rose-coloured picture of this place to you--I must not deceive you;) lastly, the visitor to this Children's Hospital, reckoning up the number of its beds, will find himself perforce obliged to stop at very little over thirty; and will learn, with sorrow and surprise, that even that small number, so forlornly, so miserably diminutive, compared with this vast London, cannot possibly be maintained, unless the Hospital be made better known; I limit myself to saying better known, because I will not believe that in a Christian community of fathers and mothers, and brothers and sisters, it can fail, being better known, to be well and richly endowed.|$|E

Manic lovers value finding a partner through chance without {{prior knowledge of}} financial, educational, or personality dispositions. Insufficient expression of the love of mania by one's partner can cause one to perceive the partner as aloof, materialistic and detached.

The LMA does not protect the airway and is preferably replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube. There are reports of cases where an Eschmann tracheal tube introducer (ETTI) was successfully used to bridge between a standard LMA and an endotracheal tube. This project was designed to determine whether an Eschmann stylet can reliably be passed through an LMA into the trachea as a <b>means</b> <b>of</b> <b>rescue</b> intubation. Methods: Nineteen emergency medicine residents and attending physicians, who were participants in a cadaveric airway course, placed and inflated a size 4 LMA (The Laryngeal Mask Company Ltd., San Diego, CA) on each of six unembalmed human cadavers in the usual fashion. They then attempted to pass a lubricated, 15 Fr, reusable, coude-tipped ETTI (Portex, Smiths Medical, Keene, NH)) through the airspace/handle of the inflated LMA. The LMA was then deflated and removed while the ETTI was held in place. Investigators then determined {{the location of the}} ETTI by laryngoscopy.

The design was a retrospective multicenter case-control study. MethodsSeventy-seven infrapopliteal vein bypasses required an adjuvant AV fistula among 1813 patients operated on for critical leg ischemia in 3 vascular centers between 1996 and 2003. The mean age was 74 years (range, 39 - 90 years). A total of 70 % of the patients had diabetes, and 24 % had undergone previous vascular surgery. In 25 % of the bypasses, the distal anastomosis was in a crural artery, in 55 % it was in the dorsal pedal artery, and in 20 % it was in a plantar artery. An adjuvant AV fistula was reconstructed in all cases because of poor intraoperative arterial status, intraoperative angiography, or low intraoperative flow. A control group was retrieved that matched the study group according to the recipient artery and runoff score. ResultsThe primary and secondary patency were 61 % and 75 %, respectively, at 1 year in the AV fistula group and 57 % and 71 % in the control group. The 3 -year patency rates were 49 % and 62 % for the AV fistula group and 46 % and 71 % for the control group, respectively. There was a 76 % leg-salvage rate at 3 years in the study group, compared with 87 % in the control group. There were no major complications related to the AV fistula. Intraoperative flow was increased from a median of 20 mL/min to 115 mL/min by the AV fistula (P =. 003). The graft flow was significantly higher in the AV fistula group than in the control group (P =. 001). ConclusionsThe adjuvant AV fistula increased graft flow significantly in a poor-outflow venous bypass. In this extreme patient group, acceptable patency and leg salvage was achieved without adverse effects. Despite this, the AV fistula did not improve the outcome...|$|E
