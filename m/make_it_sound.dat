5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} {{starting}} this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E
25|$|Dimon {{was born}} in New York City, to {{children}} of Greek immigrants Theodore and Themis (née Kalos) Dimon. One of three sons, he is of Greek descent and Greek Orthodox and attended The Browning School in his youth. His paternal grandfather was a Greek immigrant who changed the family name from Papademetriou to Dimon to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more French, {{and worked as a}} banker in Smyrna and Athens. He has an older brother, Peter, and a fraternal twin brother, Ted. Dimon's father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at Shearson.|$|E
5000|$|The final {{change is}} {{lowering}} and backing of , the [...] "short i" [...] vowel, as in bit. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more like , although the sounds remain distinct.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{that ought}} to attract {{attention}} wherever we go," [...] said Andrew when the job was finished. [...] "The word company <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> big, and we can call ourselves a company as well as not." ...|$|R
50|$|This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> {{as though}} the {{punishment}} {{was more of a}} prolonged ducking than anything intended to inflict serious injury or trauma. Indeed, a footnote in one source suggests that it may have evolved from the medieval punishment of ducking.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the new site as a whole required some of the existing Grade II structure of the hospital to be demolished. This was allowed on the account that these parts were not of significant architectural or historical interest to justify preserving. However, the south boundary wall (a registered ancient monument) had to undergo some renovation work to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> again. The old artesian well was considered an important Victorian artifact and was left intact. This required {{the foundations of the}} new unit to be built a little further to the south than originally intended.|$|E
25|$|Zhong Hui {{had long}} harboured the {{intention}} of rebelling against Wei. When he saw that Deng Ai behaved in an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people's handwriting. After getting his hands on a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima's suspicions towards Deng. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui's ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai's camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao's letter of authorisation to order Deng's soldiers to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested {{and placed in a}} prison cart.|$|E
500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> real and to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm glad it worked out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Feuerräder" [...] ("Wheels of Fire" [...] - 1994 {{original}} live demo, {{with the}} instruments directly recorded and remixed. This <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a studio demo. It is released on the single [...] "Engel (Fan edition)" [...] {{and it also}} appeared on the 2007 bootleg [...] "Kein Engel".) ...|$|R
50|$|When {{instructed}} by Opener Voice begins mid-sentence, reminiscent of Krapp's taped diary entries. When told to stop {{he does in}} the same way. Cutting off the voice <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like Voice is pre-recorded and Opener is simply switching on and off, like Macgillycuddy in Rough for Radio I, but this isn't the case.|$|R
50|$|Swedish is characterised by {{a strong}} word stress and phrase prosody that {{differs from that of}} English. When Swedish prosody is used in English speech, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more melodic, and this is even more {{apparent}} when Swedish stress patterns are used on English words. This {{is one of the most}} apparent causes of Swenglish.|$|R
500|$|Glasvegas {{reworked}} {{the song}} for the 2011 tribute album AHK-toong BAY-bi Covered. [...] "Doing this, I was fantasising I was Bono, shades and all," [...] remarked singer James Allan. [...] "I was singing the line, 'Don't let the bastards drag you down,' feeling determined rather than angry. Before we started, Rab [...] said, 'What {{are you thinking about}} this U2 cover?' I said, 'Ach, it'll be easy: just <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> bigger than U2'." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dame Tu Amor" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. Josh Kun of Salon {{noted that the}} remix version, found on the triple box-set Anthology, has [...] "enough brass and string to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a Bacharach-penned ranchero." [...] Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News called the recording an [...] "infectious cumbia [...]" [...] The recording has been released in several compilation albums including, Anthology (1998), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 1 (2003), Y Sus Inicios, Vol. 2 (2004) and Classic Series, Vol. 1 (2006).|$|E
500|$|... "God Save the Tsar!" [...] {{was used}} until the February Revolution, when the Russian monarchy was overthrown. Upon the overthrow, in March 1917, the [...] "Worker's Marseillaise", Pyotr Lavrov's {{modification}} of the French anthem [...] "La Marseillaise", {{was used as an}} unofficial anthem by the Russian Provisional Government. The modifications Lavrov made to [...] "La Marseillaise" [...] included a change in meter from 2/2 to 4/4 and music harmonization to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more Russian. It was used at governmental meetings, welcoming ceremonies for diplomats and state funerals.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating [...] "Although {{the title of}} this CD <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if tenor-saxophonist Joe Lovano was {{performing}} veteran jazz classics on this date, {{all but one of the}} ten songs played by his quintet are actually Lovano originals... Lovano is consistently creative during the modern mainstream music".|$|R
50|$|While {{the piece}} {{will work on}} a {{standard}} pipe organ, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> much better on a reed organ (either a European harmonium or an American pump organ), as {{the rise and fall}} of the air pressure from the player's working the treadles meshes with the music. The constant pressure of a pipe organ <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> rather dull, although a skilled player may approximate the effect by a judicious use of the swell pedal.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{features}} {{elements from}} various music genres, such as garage rock, punk rock, southern rock, power pop, blues and rockabilly. The recording utilizes a raw lo-fi <b>sound,</b> which <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like [...] "it was recorded on a telephone". The album also juxtaposes hooks and choruses with highly dissonant guitars and screaming, which {{were compared to}} those of Black Francis of Pixies.|$|R
500|$|For the single's B-side, Lomax {{recorded}} his composition [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You". Produced by Harrison, {{the song was}} also recorded between 24 and 26 June. According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an [...] "ad hoc power trio" [...] of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and [...] "a couple of overdubs", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated. Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like the call of an elephant.|$|E
500|$|The {{score was}} {{recorded}} with a forty-piece orchestra. Jones formatted the orchestra {{to generate a}} bigger sound than normally heard on television soundtracks to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more like Goldsmith's The Motion Picture score. Keyboards were {{used to make the}} cellos more prominent, and other changes included an increase in the mid-range of the string section. The soundtrack to [...] "Where No One Has Gone Before" [...] was released (as part of The Ron Jones Project box set of Star Trek: The Next Generation scores) in a limited run of 5,000 copies in 2010 by Film Score Monthly.|$|E
500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like your garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on a lousy stereo, it will sound good anywhere".|$|E
5000|$|When the {{newcomers}} joined incumbents Kassebaum and Mikulski in January 1993, headline-writers described the occurrence as [...] "The Year of the Woman." [...] In response, Senator Mikulski said, [...] "Calling 1992 the Year of the Woman <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like the Year of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus. We're not a fad, a fancy, or a year." ...|$|R
50|$|The song key is E major, {{showing up}} embellished chords with jazzy {{sprinkled}} dissonances. The verse is a syncopated replicate {{of the first}} melodic section adding two extra beats, a technique {{similar to that used}} later by McCartney in “Two of Us”. Though the bridge is in the key of F major, {{the manner in which it}} abruptly sets in and exits <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more out-of-the-way than it really is.|$|R
5000|$|Strunk and White's The Elements of Style {{provides}} {{another kind}} of example, a misplaced modifier (another participle):I saw the trailer peeking through the window.Presumably, this means the speaker was peeking through the window, but {{the placement of the}} clause [...] "peeking through the window" [...] <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as though the trailer were doing so. The sentence can be recast as, [...] "Peeking through the window, I saw the trailer." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2012, {{longtime}} Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich {{said of the}} song: [...] "We {{tried to}} record it countless times, but it never worked. The irony is you have that shitty live version [...] To Thom's credit, he needs to feel a song has validation, {{that it has a}} reason to exist as a recording. We could do 'True Love Waits' and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like John Mayer. Nobody wants to do that." [...] In 2016, more than 21 years after its debut, [...] "True Love Waits" [...] was finally released as the last track on Radiohead's ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool, rearranged as a minimal piano ballad.|$|E
500|$|While touring on the Clash of the Titans tour {{to promote}} the 1990 studio album Seasons in the Abyss, {{separate}} sections of the Decade of Aggression album were recorded on October 14, 1990, March 8, 1991, and July 13, 1991, however, AllMusic said that Rick Rubin's production [...] "seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like this is all one gig." [...] Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence, it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album. It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22, 1991.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics {{speak of}} a love connection, where the protagonist makes bad decisions; [...] "I never was smart with love, I let the bad ones in and the good ones go". In the chorus, Robyn sings [...] "I'm gonna love you like I've never been hurt before/I'm gonna love you like I'm indestructible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music noted that Robyn sings [...] "tough and knowing" [...] and [...] "pessimistically optimistic" [...] lines, but manages to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> romantic for the listener. Emma Gaedekke of Billboard commented on the lyrical content, saying, [...] "Robyn's heartfelt vocal turn {{prevents}} the backing music from overwhelming her story of a love connection found at the tail-end of heartbreak." ...|$|E
5000|$|It {{is often}} thought that Botticelli's {{drawings}} were commissioned by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, an important {{patron of the}} artist. The early 16th-century writer known as the Anonimo Magliabecchiano says that Botticelli painted a Dante on parchment for Lorenzo, but <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> {{as if this was}} a completed work. Alternatively the drawings we have may have been a different set for Botticelli's own use and pleasure, which is the conclusion of Ronald Lightbown.|$|R
5000|$|... "As someone who’s {{worked with}} cold-metal Helvetica, I can vouch {{for the fact}} that it’s never looked better...My sole {{criticism}} of the face is its ungainly name, which I’m regrettably certain will limit its visibility and hence its uptake. [...] "Neue Haas Grotesk" [...] <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a second cousin of Akzidenz Grotesk that’s just stumbled in from the hinterlands. But no, it is the rightful heir to the Helvetica throne. It should carry the Helvetica name.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album was favorable. Mark Deming's retrospective review gushed, [...] "While rarely flashy, even a casual listen offers all the proof you might need that Los Lobos were a band of world-class musicians, with David Hidalgo's guitar work especially impressive throughout." [...] Robert Christgau praised the group's originality: [...] "Their debut LP <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if they invented the style. Who did the original of that one, you wonder, {{only to discover that}} you're listening to the original." ...|$|R
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II {{was listed}} at #64 in IGN's list of [...] "Top 100 NES Games". Reviewer Sam Claiborn {{said that the}} game was more {{expansive}} than its predecessor and that it featured many of the good graphics, gameplay, and usage of Middle English. He also noted that [...] "Fabio's bare-breasted likeness smoldering on IronSword's cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike". Website GamesRadar praised the game's music, especially the title theme; Brett Elston said it set a serious tone for the game, saying [...] "its heavy, droning beats mix with a fantasy-minded melody that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a funeral dirge in the Shire".|$|E
500|$|Hot Chip often {{record their}} {{music in a}} bedroom. However, the band took a {{different}} approach in recording Made in the Dark to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "not quite so homemade". Recording {{took place in a}} variety of locations, including in-studio and live venues, to make [...] "different acoustic spaces to be obvious to the listener". Lead vocalist Alexis Taylor said there was tension between the band's members, as the band did not want to continue creating music in the same way, but also did not want to [...] "throw away a songwriting and production partnership that has worked before." [...] Taylor and vocalist Joe Goddard worked on some of the songs together. Several songs were overdubbed with parts {{of the rest of the}} band playing.|$|E
500|$|I was {{surprised}} I got that call 'cause of our {{differences in the}} audiences we hit, but I'm always up for challenges and trying something new ... She described what her album is about and then she sent me some CDs of what type of stuff's been inspiring her to make the record, and {{it happened to be}} a lot of stuff that I grew up on in the early '70s, 'cause I'm 40. Aretha Franklin, Etta James, Marvin Gaye, Esther Williams, all kinds of different things. Once I saw that's the vibe she wanted, I still had to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like the way my beats thump and stuff but still give her the atmosphere she's trying to bring out on the singing side.|$|E
5000|$|Karlsson has said: [...] "We {{always start}} with the song. We use guitar, piano, and bass lines we don't keep {{to figure out which}} clothes we're going to put on each melody and lyric. I think that's {{different}} than a lot of others in the dance scene. They have a beat they love and then force a top line on top of it. I feel like that <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like a remix. I'd rather do it our way, it's more fun too." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later in January 2006, Senator Norm Coleman's {{chief of}} staff, Erich Mische, {{verified}} that Coleman's staffers had edited his page [...] "to correct inaccuracies and delete information." [...] Mische stated: [...] "What's to stop someone from writing in that Norm Coleman was 7 feet 10 inches, with green hair and one eye smack dab {{in the middle}} of his head? That's about as silly as this gets ... When you put 'edia' in there, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if this is a benign, objective piece of information." ...|$|R
5000|$|The All About Jazz {{review by}} Mark Sullivan said that [...] "However unorthodox all this cross-translation seems, Tander <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> {{completely}} natural. Her intimate, lyrical voice is equally {{at home in}} both languages, as well as singing wordless vocalise and improvising. Gustavson still plays the piano as his main instrument, but has augmented it with discreet electronics and occasional synthesizer bass, while Vespestad provides percussive textures or timekeeping as required. So the group is a true trio, not just a vocalist with accompanists." ...|$|R
