40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) It is well {{established}} that dental hygienists are commonly affected by <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, due {{to the complexity of}} this occupational health issue, an understanding of the progression of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> and strategies for prevention are far from being understood. The aim of this thesis is to establish the prevalence and correlates of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> among the previously understudied demographic of dental hygienists and dental hygiene students, and to also investigate the effect of loupes as an intervention for this problem. To meet this aim, three research projects were undertaken. A systematic review of the evidence confirmed that <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> are reported by dental hygienists at consistently high rates; however, a lack of longitudinal studies and standardised research techniques limited any conclusions about the progression of disease or successful interventions. A longitudinal cohort study followed dental hygiene students across the three years of their education and training, to determine whether <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> begin even before their careers begin. Dental hygiene students reported <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> at rates similar to practising hygienists. A cross sectional study of Australian dental hygienists identified that both work-related tasks and psychosocial factors influence the reporting of <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders,</b> and that equipment such as loupes may have a protective effect. An intervention study investigated the effect of loupes on <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> among a sample of dental hygienists; both positive and negative outcomes for physical measures were noted. Overall, the findings in this thesis provide evidence that <b>musculoskeletal</b> <b>disorders</b> begin during dental hygiene training, are prevalent in a relatively young and recently established group of practicing dental hygienists, and are influenced by a multitude of factors. Furthermore, it appears that loupes might not be a panacea for optimal musculoskeletal health, at least in dental hygienists. Recommendations for future studies in this field are provided...|$|R
