We have also investigated densities of metallic clusters due to termolecular associations of metallic ions with neutral molecules. It {{should be noted}} that direct <b>meteoric</b> <b>ionization</b> is the only ionization source considered here. The ionization by solar radiation or photoelectrons at the peak altitude of the meteoroid/micrometeoroid ablation is low and its influence on the concentration of electrons and metallic ions is approximately negligible.|$|E
40|$|Small interplanetary grains bombard Mars, {{like all}} the solar system planets, and, {{like all the}} planets with atmospheres, {{meteoric}} ion and atom layers form in the upper atmosphere. We have developed a comprehensive one-dimensional model of the Martian <b>meteoric</b> <b>ionization</b> layer including a full chemical scheme. A persistent layer of magnesium ions should exist around an altitude of 70 km. Unlike the terrestrial case, where the metallic ions are formed via charge-exchange with the ambient ions, Mg(+) in the Martian atmosphere is produced by photoionization. Nevertheless, the predicted metal layer peak densities for Earth and Mars are similar. Diffusion solutions, such as those presented here, should be a good approximation of the metallic ions in regions where the magnetic field is negligible and may provide {{a significant contribution to}} the nightside ionosphere. The low ultraviolet absorption of the Martian atmosphere may make Mars an excellent laboratory in which to study meteoric ablation. Resonance lines not seen in the spectra of terrestrial meteors may be visible to a surface observatory in the Martian highlands...|$|E
30|$|We have {{predicted}} two broad meteoric layers in the nighttime ionosphere of Mars at altitude range 90 – 110  km and 60 – 90  km due to ablation of micrometeoroids and meteoroids respectively, when comet C/ 2013 A 1 crossed {{the orbit of}} Mars on 19 October, 2014. The mass densities of 15 metallic ions are also predicted {{in the vicinity of}} ionization peaks. These ions are produced by direct <b>meteoric</b> <b>ionization</b> and lost by dissociative recombination. The production rates are calculated using the equations of motion, ablation, and energy. The ion mass densities are estimated by coupled continuity equations controlled by steady state condition. The magnitude of the meteoric layers depends on the concentration of metals and incoming velocities, viz., 10  km/s, 18  km/s and 30  km/s of meteoroids and micrometeoroids, We have obtained that the concentrations of ions and electron strongly depend on the variations of the incoming velocities. It is also found that ion and electron densities can be increased by several orders of magnitude in the middle ionosphere of Mars during the meteor showers. Our estimated results can be confirmed in future by plasma probes onboard MAVEN and Mangalyaan.|$|E
40|$|Our current {{knowledge}} of the Solar System, with a particular emphasis on the systems of interplanetary objects, is reviewed, and the theory of meteors and the reflection of radio waves from <b>meteoric</b> <b>ionization</b> is then discussed. A description of the meteor radar is given and a method of calibrating the antenna beam is developed. The main project comprises two parts: (a) A general survey of the radar echorate for 20 major and minor meteor streams and the sporadic meteor background, conducted from Grahamstown over the period 1986 April to 1988 January, is described. Definite shower activity was observed {{for all of the}} major and some of the minor showers. (b) Based on a scheme proposed by previous workers (Morton & Jones), a method of recovering meteor radiant distributions from the distribution of echo directions is developed. We devise a technique of compensating for possible distortions of the resulting radiant maps, which may arise due to the arisotropic antenna beam. This involves a system of echo-weighting. Radiant maps which showed considerably less distortion than those of the above workers were obtained without the weighting procedure. It is concluded that, although the method in its present form introduces spurious features into the maps, the principle is sound and should eventually be refined to produce the desired compensatio...|$|E
40|$|A {{summary of}} the present {{understanding}} of the behaviour of <b>meteoric</b> <b>ionization</b> is given and cooling times for meteoric particles are calculated. While the cooling time for neutral atoms and positive ions is short compared to echo life-times, that for electrons is not and thermalization effects may be observed above 100 km. The effect of winds and sky noise on diffusion coefficient measurements has been investigated {{and it appears that}} the scatter in measurements predicted accounts for that observed in practice. A magnetic effect on meteor train diffusion has been observed in underdense meteors by using a backscatter radar, with a 40 kW pulsed transmitter operating at 26. 36 MHz. Echo heights were measured with a spaced interferometer. The observed magnetic effect is consistent with that expected from the formation of electron and ion ellipses of ionization. Other results recorded when anisotropic, ambipolar diffusion is more likely do not show this effect. Previous observations, limited to overdense meteors, are shown to be consistent with theoretical predictions and the expected magnetic effects on diffusion for general train orientations are discussed. Phase variations caused by Fresnel diffraction as meteor trains are formed have been studied and shown to be a cause of systematic decreases in echo heights (during the lifetime of an echo) measured with spaced antennas. An experiment to verify this is suggested. A chemical model developed to take into account ionization loss may account for anomalously high D values below 90 km observed in previous data. High D values measured in this work cannot be explained by this simple model...|$|E
