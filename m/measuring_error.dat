50|$|Differential {{nonlinearity}} (acronym DNL) {{is a term}} {{describing the}} deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. Differential non-linearity {{is a measure of}} the worst case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1⁄2 LSB differential non-linearity. Differential non-linearity may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A differential non-linearity greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non-monotonic transfer function in a DAC. It is also known as a missing code.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the reliability and the <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> (by means of the smallest detectable error) of 11 angular and 4 linear measurements commonly used for cephalometric analysis. METHODS: Twenty-five digital lateral cephalograms were randomly selected and traced with Viewbox software (version 3. 1. 1. 13, dHAL Software, Kifissia, Greece). This was repeated 3 times by 2 observers during 3 sessions. There was at least 1 week between each session. Differences were analyzed with a repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA). Intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities were calculated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) based on absolute agreement. Measurement error was determined by means of the smallest detectable difference. RESULTS: The intraobserver agreement of the measurements was good (ICC > 0. 82). SNA, SNB, ANB, and ANS-Me had the smallest intraobserver errors for both observers (> 1. 86 mm or degrees). Except for SN-FH (ICC = 0. 76), interobserver agreement was good (ICC > 0. 87). CONCLUSIONS: Determining the appropriate <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> of cephalometric measurements by means of the smallest detectable difference is necessary to find the true difference between the start and the end of active treatment. Depending on the magnitude of clinical significance, the <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> was possibly clinically significant for all variables tested and, therefore, questions the use of these variables to detect the true treatment effect...|$|E

40|$|To convert computer-detected vessel {{dimensions}} in digitized angiograms from pixels into millimeters, the coronary catheter {{is commonly used}} as a calibration object. The absolute size of the vessel is then inferred from {{the ratio of the}} known to detected size of the catheter. However, the reliability of this inference is significantly affected by different angiographic magnifications of the vessel and catheter. The error in converting the vessel's size is dependent on the fractional positions of the catheter and vessel along their illuminating x-ray beams. We studied in 207 daily biplane angiograms the general magnitude of the <b>measuring</b> <b>error,</b> as well as its fractional parts with regard to the artery being studied (LAD n== 5, RCA n= 53, LCX n= 59) and the selected angiographic projection (RAO 30 °, LAO 60 °). ResultsThe position difference between the vessel and catheter causes a <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> of more than 5 % in one third of the analyses. The resulting error in the vessel measurements (mean±std) is:Angiographic projection:RAO 30 °LAO 60 °lesion diameter error [mm]: 0. 12 ± 0. 050. 12 ± 0. 04 normal diameter error [mm]: 0. 21 ± 0. 070. 21 ± 0. 06 The <b>measuring</b> <b>error</b> for the LAD coronary artery is in LAO 60 ° projection 45 %, for the RCA in RAO 30 ° projection 65 % and for the LCX coronary artery in LAO 30 ° projection 22 % lower, than in the opposite projections. ConclusionsSince the position caused errors might be superimposed by detection errors, the total <b>measuring</b> <b>error,</b> using the coronary catheter for conversion to absolute vessel sizes, might increase markedly. Improvement of the measuring accuracy might be achieved by: (i) Selection of an angiographic projection with minimum displacement of the artery from the catheter, (ii) error balancing by empty/filled catheters. Catheterization laboratories equipped for biplane angiography should apply biplane angiographic correction procedures for position errors or use analytic calibration, which calculates the angiographic magnification of a vessel directly...|$|E
