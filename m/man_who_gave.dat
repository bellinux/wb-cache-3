5|$|In the Rhineland, Custine {{continued}} the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy {{taxes on the}} nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine an honest <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> his country good service. With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> the name Lon Celespe. Police, prosecutors and federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E

When the monitored bills begin showing up in New York City, the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> him the bill.

He also was one of the founders of Zenshuji, a Soto Zen temple located in Los Angeles, California. Suzuki's father and Kitano had a tense history between them. Sogaku had trained with Kitano in his early Zen training and felt that he was such a high priest due to familial status and connections. Shunryu did not see this in Kitano, however.

25|$|The May 1951 {{law also}} {{enlarged}} the electorate from 61,958 to 333,693. Some dead people were even counted as electors {{due to the}} mishandling of election cards. The Cotonou newspaper L'Etoile du Dahomey noted a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> an unlimited number of cards {{as long as they}} promised to vote for Maga's main opponent, accountant and deputy Sourou-Migan Apithy. Altogether, however, only 44% of the population voted on election day. Apithy was reelected a deputy with 53,463 votes out of 147,350 cast, while Maga captured the second seat with 49,329 and third candidate Emile Derlin Zinsou received a mere 18,410 ballots. Several smaller parties hosted several other candidates, which received the rest of the votes. Only 0.5 percent of Maga's votes came from the coastal region, while 98 percent came from northern towns and villages. The 1951 election has been cited as when regionalist parties arose, {{and it was the first}} whose pamphlets mentioned ethnicity.|$|E

Jerry calls George to get advice from Wilkinson, the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> the stock tip in the first place, but no one can find him. George rings him back and tells Jerry that Wilkinson is in the hospital.

In the 19th century, the creek and its watershed were a center for logging and related industries, including 53 sawmills, grist mills, leather tanneries, coal and iron mines. A 1903 newspaper article claimed [...] "No other stream in the country had so many mills in so small a territory". For transportation, a plank road ran along much of the creek for decades, and two [...] "paper railroads" [...] were planned, but never built.|$|E

500|$|The {{monument}} {{was completed}} swiftly once the location was agreed; {{the total cost}} was £2,700 (1927), of which 10% was Lutyens' fee. The design and the proposed location {{continued to be a}} source of controversy in the local community. Some residents felt that the memorial would not be in keeping with the city's existing architecture, but Bignold felt sure that he had the backing of the ex-service community. He noted that the Guildhall was in a central location and as one of Norwich's most famous buildings was a significant attraction for visitors, and thus that siting the memorial there would display Norwich's pride in its contribution to the war. In response to criticisms of the design, he wrote that [...] "the form of any war memorial depends entirely on the sum of money available for its construction. Knowing this sum, we consulted Sir Edwin Lutyens as to the best means of expending it. [...] We felt that all reasonable persons would be satisfied by the expert opinion of the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> London its Cenotaph".|$|E

500|$|Two other {{participants}} were profoundly affected. Firstly, Knicks center Darrall Imhoff was branded as {{the player who}} let Chamberlain score 100 on him, although he only played 20 of 48minutes and {{was not on the}} court when it happened. On the other hand, the game immortalized little-used Warriors reserve player Joe Ruklick as the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> Chamberlain the 100-point assist. Decades later, The New York Times interviewed Ruklick and found out that he refers to himself as [...] "a walking footnote" [...] of one of basketball's greatest moments. The game also produced the famous picture of Chamberlain sitting on a bench, holding up a paper with a scribbled [...] "100". The photograph was actually a matter of improvisation: when Warriors PR manager Harvey Pollack entered the Warriors locker room, he took a paper and scribbled the number on it, and Associated Press photographer Paul Vathis who was there at the game (not for professional reasons, but rather because he wanted to give his son a treat) took the now-famous photo. Cherry calls it the [...] "ultimate picture" [...] of Wilt Chamberlain.|$|E

Gray takes the package and walks outside. Shadows guide him to an old castle, where he sees the shadows dancing and wandering on their own. Gray also sees an elderly woman (later identified as Marguerite Chopin) and encounters another old man (later identified as the village doctor). Gray leaves the castle and walks to a manor. Looking through one of the windows, Gray sees the Lord of the manor, the same <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> him the package earlier. The man is suddenly murdered by gunshot. Gray is let into the house by servants, who rush to the aid of the fallen man but it is too late to save him. The servants ask Gray to stay the night.

They follow her, and find her unconscious on the ground with fresh bite wounds. They have her carried inside. Gray remembers the parcel and opens it. Inside is a book about horrific demons called Vampyrs.|$|E
500|$|Guy of Lusignan and Raynald {{were among}} the prisoners who were brought before Saladin. Saladin handed a cup of iced rose water to Guy. After {{drinking}} from the cup, the king handed it to Raynald. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (who was present) recorded that Raynald drank from the cup. Since customary law prescribed that a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>gave</b> food or drink to a prisoner could not murder him, Saladin stated that it was Guy who had given the cup to Raynald. Saladin called Raynald to his tent. He accused him of many crimes (including brigandage and blasphemy), offering him to choose between conversion to Islam or death, according to Imad ad-Din and Ibn al-Athir. After Raynald flatly refused to convert, Saladin took a sword and struck Raynald with it. Raynald {{fell to the ground}} and Saladin beheaded him for the honour of Islam. The reliability of the reports of Saladin's offer to Raynald is subject to a scholarly debate, because the Muslim authors who recorded them may have only wanted to improve Saladin's image. Ernoul's chronicle and the Estoire de Eracles recounted the events ending with Raynald's execution in almost the same language as the Muslim authors. However, according to Ernoul's chronicle, Raynald refused to drink from the cup that Guy of Lusignan handed to him. [...] According to Ernoul, Raynald's head was struck off by Saladin's mamluks and it was brought to Damascus to be [...] "dragged along the ground to show the Saracens, whom the prince had wronged, that vengeance had been exacted". Baha ad-Din also wrote that Raynald's fate shocked Guy of Lusignan, but Saladin soon comforted him, stating that [...] "A king does not kill a king, but that man's perfidy and insolence went too far".|$|E
