5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (<b>marbling)</b> and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. <b>Marbling,</b> together with tenderness and flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between <b>marbling</b> and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher <b>marbling</b> specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher <b>marbling</b> British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
5|$|Crossbreeding {{increases}} {{production efficiency}} because of hybrid vigour, and allows complementary traits of {{parents to be}} combined to produce progeny better suited to different environments or markets. Crossbreeding {{through the use of}} Limousin terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds allows the complementary traits of higher <b>marbling</b> and fat cover provided by the British breed cows, and required or preferred by some markets, to be combined with the higher yield and feed conversion efficiency of Limousin sires.|$|E

5000|$|In India, {{there are}} many games with <b>marbles.</b> One simple game with <b>marbles</b> is called [...] "Cara" [...] in which every player puts one or more <b>marbles</b> {{in a long line}} of <b>marbles</b> with each <b>marble</b> being one {{centimeter}} or slightly more, apart from each other. After this, each player throws another <b>marble</b> as far as possible from the line, perpendicularly. In this game, the player whose <b>marble</b> is farthest from the line of <b>marbles</b> gets the first chance to hit the <b>marble's</b> line and subsequent players who get to hit the line have their distance from the line in decreasing order. Any player who hits and displaces a <b>marble</b> in the line of <b>marbles</b> gets to take that and all <b>marbles</b> to the right of it. Usually, <b>marbles</b> in the line are smaller <b>marbles</b> and the players have bigger <b>marbles</b> for hitting the line of smaller marbles.This game needs the playground to be flat and hard and with no loose soil for effecting games of [...] "Cara". The distances of the <b>marbles</b> thrown determine order of players who get to hit the line are anywhere from 10 to 30 meters and may depend on player's desire to hit the <b>marble</b> line first and how much risk they will take so that they would be at some distance and yet be able to hit the line of <b>marbles</b> and get more than 2 <b>marbles.</b> Players have to roll their <b>marbles</b> from a distance to hit the line of <b>marbles.</b> Each player gets to hit the line of <b>marbles</b> only once assuming there are <b>marbles</b> left in the line and every player gets a turn in a order. In a line of twenty <b>marbles,</b> its reasonable to get at least 5 to 20 <b>marbles</b> depending on how skillful somebody is at hitting the line of <b>marbles.</b> When all <b>marbles</b> are taken by players as above the game is restarted with players putting their <b>marbles</b> in the line and trying to win as many <b>marbles</b> as possible.If some <b>marbles</b> are left in the line after each player takes a chance, the players again throw their <b>marbles</b> perpendicularly to this line and start to roll their <b>marble</b> to hit the line according to the above rules. This process is repeated until all <b>marbles</b> are taken in the game.|$|R

It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow <b>marbling,</b> and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, and lays 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E
5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of <b>marbling</b> score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg heavier than the British breeds, and 190kg heavier than the other continental European breeds).|$|E

25|$|Brenna {{belonged to}} an old Ticino family that had split into two branches, stonemasons (Brenno) and {{painters}} (Brenni) not later than {{the last quarter of}} the 17th century. Stonemasons and <b>marbling</b> experts Karl Antonio and Francesco Brenno worked in the 1680s in Salzburg. Karl Enrico Brenno (Brennus) carved elaborate tombs in Denmark and Hamburg, but was better known for his <b>marbling</b> artwork at Fredensborg, Christiansborg and Klausholm palaces. Giovanni Battista Brenno, stucco expert, worked in Bavaria. The other branch produced three brothers Brenni (born in the 1730s), fresco painters. Vincenzo Brenna, son of Francesco, was born in 1747 in Florence (19th-century sources list him as a native of Rome, perhaps due to his signature Del cavalier Brenna Romano). It is not clear whether Vincenzo Brenna belonged to Brenno or Brenni branch.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 the Monuments Historiques {{division}} of the French Ministry of Culture began an 18.5 million dollar program of works at the cathedral, described as a restoration project.

25|$|The latest {{restoration}} works commenced in 2000 on {{the entire}} iconostasis. At the same time, {{in cooperation with the}} restorers, a thorough investigation was initiated in ecclesiastical and diocesan archives and libraries to settle some of the controversial details relating to the history of the icon screen. In 1799, the parish commissioned the most notable master of the period, Miklós Jankovits, to carve the iconostasis frames. Jankovits who had Greek ancestors ran a highly ranked religious art workshop in Eger. He undertook the job for 2,000 Rhenish guilders, promising to complete the work within two years. Certain sources add that a local wood-carver, László Lengyel, assisted Jankovits with his work. In 1808, following the erection of the carved frameworks of the iconostasis, Mátyás Hittner and János Szűts started <b>marbling</b> and gilding the frames, and painting the icons themselves. Hittner and Szűts, both from the town of Miskolc, planned the work over a period of three years and estimated the cost would reach 12,000 guilders. However, the costs soon started to increase. The parish and the town blamed the painters for raising the prices. In response, Hittner and Szűts first complained about the increase in the price of the gold before blaming each other for negligent work. The parish withheld payment until a final price was agreed. Years passed without a solution, leading Hittner to leave Hajdúdorog and look for another job. The town and the parish finally made an agreement with Szűts, who had by then moved with his family from Miskolc to Hajdúdorog. He finished the last icons in 1816 but refused to hand over the last three—the icons of the Calvary scene—over to the church, until he was paid. The restorers tried to separate Hittner's icons from the ones Szűts painted, but it proved to be impossible. The icons of the lower tiers can be associated with Hittner, and the upper ones are probably Szűts' work.|$|E
