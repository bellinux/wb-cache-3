Muskett saw the episode as among the <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> she worked on.|$|E
5|$|Improving to 22 goals, 67 {{assists and}} 89 points in 57 games in 2008–09, Ellis led all OHL defencemen and {{finished}} second in team scoring to Taylor Hall. He ranked first {{in the league in}} assists, seventh in points and second in plus-minus rating (+52). As a result, Ellis was named to the OHL First All-Star Team and awarded the Max Kaminsky Trophy, beating fellow nominees P. K. Subban and Cameron Gaunce as the League's top defenceman. The distinction made him a finalist for CHL Defenceman of the Year, but he lost to Jonathon Blum of the Western Hockey League (WHL)'s Vancouver Giants. Ellis was additionally voted the smartest player, hardest shot and best offensive defenceman in the Western Conference in an annual poll of OHL coaches. Ellis later cited the smartest player selection as his <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> recognition to that date.|$|E

25|$|Card {{counting}} is <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> {{near the}} end of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards every time a deck has been played.|$|E

He was duly appointed Chief Justice of the Transvaal Colony in 1902 by Lord Milner soon after it came under British control.

40|$|What are {{the factors}} {{affecting}} university researchers in {{their decision to}} choose one type of funding source over the other?

The team included the homage after frequently seeing artwork for Day of the Tentacle {{during the two}} games' productions. In describing what he considered [...] "the <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> moment" [...] of his career, Grossman stated that the game's writing and use of spoken and subtitled dialog assisted a learning-disabled child in learning how to read. Telltale Games CEO Dan Connors commented in 2009 that an episodic game based on Day of the Tentacle would be [...] "feasible". However, he cautioned that such an endeavor would hinge on the sales of the Monkey Island titles released that year.|$|E

500|$|The Voyage Home opened theatrically in North America on Thanksgiving weekend, November 26, 1986.

Winter recalled that the marketing {{did not seem to}} make a difference. The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film shown in the Soviet Union, screened by the World Wildlife Fund on June 26, 1987, in Moscow to celebrate a ban on whaling. Attending the screening with Nimoy, Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences; he said [...] "the single <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> moment of my Star Trek life" [...] was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy's line, [...] "The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe.

500|$|As {{commanding}} officer, McCain {{relied upon}} a relatively unorthodox leadership style {{based upon the}} force of his personality. [...] He removed personnel he thought ineffective, and sought to improve morale and productivity by establishing an informal rapport with enlisted men. Dealing with limited post-Vietnam defense budgets and parts shortages, he was forceful in demanding that respect be given the female officers just beginning to arrive into the unit. [...] McCain's leadership abilities were credited with improving the unit's aircraft readiness; for the first time, all fifty of its aircraft were able to fly. Although some operational metrics declined during the period, the pilot safety improved to the point of having zero accidents. The squadron was awarded its first-ever Meritorious Unit Commendation, while McCain received a Meritorious Service Medal. McCain later stated that being commanding officer of VA-174 was the <b>most</b> <b>rewarding</b> assignment of his naval career. When his stint ended in July 1977, the change of command ceremony was attended by his father {{and the rest of his}} family, as well as some of his fellow POWs; speaker Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr. said that John had joined Jack and Slew McCain in a place of honor in Navy tradition, a tribute that deeply moved McCain.|$|E
