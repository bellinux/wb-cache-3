50|$|Martempering {{is similar}} to austempering, in that the steel is {{quenched}} in a bath of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in martempering, {{the goal is to}} create martensite rather than bainite. The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite start temperature. The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any bainite can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the <b>martempered</b> steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not. Modern files are often <b>martempered.</b>|$|E
40|$|SUS 440 is a {{high-carbon}} stainless steel, and its martensite matrix {{has high}} heat resistance, high corrosion resistance, and high pressure resistance. It {{has been widely}} used in mechanical parts and critical materials. However, the SUS 440 <b>martempered</b> matrix has reliability problems in thin plate applications and thus research uses different austempering heat treatments (tempering temperature: 200 °C– 400 °C) to obtain a matrix containing bainite, retained austenite, martensite, and the M 7 C 3 phase to investigate {{the relationships between the}} resulting microstructure and tensile mechanical properties. Experimental data showed that the austempering conditions of the specimen affected the volume fraction of phases and distribution of carbides. After austenitizing heat treatment (1080 °C for 30 min), the austempering of the SUS 440 thin plates was carried out at a salt-bath temperature 300 °C for 120 min and water quenching was then used to obtain the bainite matrix with fine carbides, with the resulting material having a higher tensile fracture strength and average hardness (HRA 76) makes it suitable for use as a high-strength thin plate for industrial applications...|$|E
