40|$|Drying {{of solid}} {{particles}} is generally {{divided into three}} periods: a short initial heating period, a constant drying rate period, and a falling drying rate period. Drying in a fixed under various drying conditions was experimentally studied. The main goals of the measurements were to calculate the heat transfer coefficient {{based on the measured}} values, and to evaluate the validity of the constant drying rate period. The exact duration of the constant drying period concerning the entire bed is short. The calculated heat transfer coefficients seem to be somewhat reasonable.

It is known that the physico-chemical properties of proteinaceous and polysaccharide molecules {{are closely related to}} the mechanism of foam stability. Three types of “American pale ale” style beer were prepared using different mashing protocols. The foam stability of the beers was assessed using the Derek Rudin standard method. Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF 4) in combination with ultraviolet (UV), multiangle light scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors was used to separate the macromolecules present in the beers and the <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> (<b>M)</b> and <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> distributions (MD) were determined. Macromolecular components were identified by enzymatic treatments with β-glucanase and proteinase K. The MD of β-glucan ranged from 106 to 108 g/mol.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1830s, Michael Faraday laid the {{foundations}} of electrochemistry and solid-state ionics by discovering the motion of ions in liquid and solid electrolytes. Earlier, around 1800, Alessandro Volta used a liquid electrolyte in his voltaic pile, the first electrochemical battery, but failed to realize that ions {{are involved in the}} process. Meanwhile, in his work on decomposition of solutions by electric current, Faraday used not only the ideas of ion, cation, anion, electrode, anode, cathode, electrolyte and electrolysis, but even the present-day terms for them. Faraday associated electric current in an electrolyte with the motion of ions, and discovered that ions can exchange their charges with an electrode while they were transformed into elements by electrolysis. He quantified those processes by two laws of electrolysis. The first law (1832) stated that the mass of a product at the electrode, Δm, increases linearly with the amount of charge passed through the electrolyte, Δq. The second law (1833) established the proportionality between Δm and the “electrochemical equivalent” and defined the Faraday constant F as F = (Δq/Δm)(M/z), where <b>M</b> is the <b>molar</b> <b>mass</b> and z is the charge of the ion.|$|R
