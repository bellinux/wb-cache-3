50|$|Because ERP is {{calculated}} as antenna gain (in a given direction) {{as compared with}} the maximum directivity of a half-wave dipole antenna, it creates a mathematically virtual effective dipole antenna oriented {{in the direction of the}} receiver. In other words, a notional receiver in a given direction from the transmitter would receive the same power if the source were replaced with an ideal dipole oriented with maximum directivity and <b>matched</b> <b>polarization</b> towards the receiver and with an antenna input power equal to the ERP. The receiver would not be able to determine a difference. Maximum directivity of an ideal half-wave dipole is a constant, i.e., 0 dBd = 2.15 dBi. Therefore, ERP is always 2.15 dB less than EIRP. The ideal dipole antenna could be further replaced by an isotropic radiator (a purely mathematical device which cannot exist in the real world), and the receiver cannot know the difference so long as the input power is increased by 2.15 dB.|$|E

The antenna element and differential low noise amplifier described here were originally designed to cover the former SKA-low band (70 - 450 MHz) but it is now aimed to cover the re-defined SKA-low band (50 - 350 MHz) and furthermore the antenna is capable of performing up to 650 MHz with the current design. The design is focused on maximum sensitivity in a wide field of view (+/- 45 deg from zenith) and low cross-polarization ratios. Furthermore, the size and cost of the element has to be kept to a minimum as millions of these antennas will need to be deployed for the full SKA in very compact configurations.
