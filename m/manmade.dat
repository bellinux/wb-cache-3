5|$|The name Bret was not retired, as its {{landfall}} {{occurred in}} unusually sparsely populated Kenedy County and hence did much less damage to <b>manmade</b> structures than normal for a hurricane of that intensity.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Kariba Dam was of enormous {{value to the}} development of both Rhodesia and the Zambian Copperbelt, and {{led to the creation of}} what was at the time the largest <b>manmade</b> lake in Africa south of the Sahara.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{can suffer}} serious effects from toxic {{chemicals}} in their environments. These include various synthetic chemicals, such as insecticides and fertilizers, {{as well as}} a variety of naturally occurring chemicals from plants, such as ethanol resulting from the fermentation of organic materials. Bee intoxication can result from exposure to ethanol from fermented nectar, ripe fruits, and <b>manmade</b> and natural chemicals in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Contrails are a <b>manmade</b> type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or <b>manmade</b> ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is {{more than the sum of}} its parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} (Zalophus californianus) is a coastal eared seal native to western North America. It {{is one of}} six species of sea lion. Its natural habitat ranges from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico, including the Gulf of California. Sea lions are sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and have a thicker neck and protruding crest. They mainly haul-out on sandy or rocky beaches, but they also frequent <b>manmade</b> environments such as marinas and wharves. Sea lions feed {{on a number of}} species of fish and squid, and are preyed on by orcas and white sharks.|$|E
5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the <b>manmade</b> Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{significant}} diversity of salmonids present in the bay. Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; in the Bay Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and <b>manmade</b> impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast coho salmon population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations {{on the west coast}} of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.|$|E
5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and <b>Manmade</b> Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and lung damage. He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} {{predominantly}} coastal, schooling in inshore waters {{to a depth}} of 80 m, often in large embayments with mangroves or over coral reefs. Like a number of carangids, juvenile yellowtail scad are known to congregate around floating objects, including jellyfish medusae, as well as <b>manmade</b> structures. In Kaneohe Bay, jellyfish medusae disappeared from the bay, causing the fish to switch from natural objects to <b>manmade</b> ones, causing concern for recruitment of the species in the future.|$|E
25|$|Category2: Areas of {{comparatively}} more interest, {{but still}} {{unlikely to be}} significant to the search. Some of these are possibly <b>manmade</b> objects, such as objects with the dimensions of shipping containers.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} <b>manmade</b> features, {{at least one}} pre-historic site {{is known to have}} existed in the townland, with what is {{considered}} as having been an ancient fortified enclosure listed on the Northern Ireland Environment Agency's Monuments and Buildings Record.|$|E
25|$|The residencies, {{which had}} been burnt down in 1856, were not rebuilt, they were moved to a <b>manmade</b> island further up the river named Shamian. Shamian Island was entirely {{cut off from the}} local population, {{accessible}} only over two guarded bridges.|$|E
25|$|The term conduit in {{this context}} is defined as any tunnel, canal, pipeline, aqueduct, flume, ditch, or similar <b>manmade</b> water {{conveyance}} that is operated for the distribution of water for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumption and not primarily for the generation of electricity.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Park {{also has}} many <b>manmade</b> attractions. Recreational {{facilities}} are especially {{abundant in the}} park, having long coexisted, albeit uneasily, with the aesthetic and more natural park features preferred by those looking to the park as an enclave of nature in the city.|$|E
25|$|Oleg Cassini {{received}} the James Herriot Award (All Creatures Great and Small) as the Man of the Year from the Humane Society of the United States {{for his work}} and care for animals. He created collections of <b>manmade</b> fashion fur, the 'evolutionary furs'.|$|E
25|$|Aquifer {{depletion}} is {{a problem}} in some areas, and is especially critical in northern Africa, for example the Great <b>Manmade</b> River project of Libya. However, new methods of groundwater management such as artificial recharge and injection of surface waters during seasonal wet periods has extended the life of many freshwater aquifers, especially in the United States.|$|E
25|$|B'nai B'rith {{has responded}} to natural and <b>manmade</b> {{disasters}} since 1865, when it assisted victims of a cholera epidemic {{in what was then}} Palestine. B'nai B'rith later raised funds and distributed them to those affected by the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the Galveston, Texas, flood of 1900 and the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Grijalva, there are other flows {{of water in the}} area in and around the canyon, many of which are seasonal. These consist of streams, some of which form waterfalls on the canyon’s sides, and underground movements which have created caves and karst formations. The last important water formation in the area is the <b>manmade</b> reservoir of the Chicoasén Dam.|$|E
25|$|A bird strike—sometimes called birdstrike, bird {{ingestion}} (for an engine), bird hit, or bird aircraft strike hazard (BASH)—is {{a collision}} between an airborne animal (usually a bird or bat) and a <b>manmade</b> vehicle, especially an aircraft. The term {{is also used}} for bird deaths resulting from collisions with structures such as power lines, towers and wind turbines (see Bird-skyscraper collisions and Towerkill).|$|E
25|$|The oldest <b>manmade</b> {{landmark}} {{in the park}} is an 1816 naval cannon located near Brockton Point. The Nine O’Clock Gun, {{as it is known}} today, was fired {{for the first time in}} 1898, a tradition that has continued for more than 100 years. The cannon was originally detonated with a stick of dynamite, but is now activated automatically with an electronic trigger.|$|E
25|$|Erosion is {{a natural}} {{phenomenon}} which can be aggravated by <b>manmade</b> situations increasing risks produced by landslides, flood, avalanches, mudfloods…etc. Erosion impact are usually severe on dry areas, {{due to lack of}} vegetation. In Colombia, areas such as Cúcuta, Villa de Leyva, Tatacoa desert in Huila, Chicamocha canyon, La Guajira, Valle de Tenza, Valle Medio del Patía are especially vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{building}} dams in Nepal {{is controversial}} for several reasons. First, {{the region is}} seismically active. Dam failures caused by earthquakes could cause tremendous death and destruction downstream, particularly on the densely populated Gangetic Plain. Second, global warming {{has led to the}} formation of glacial lakes dammed by unstable moraines. Sudden failures of these moraines can cause floods with cascading failures of <b>manmade</b> structures downstream.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other large}} urban parks, Stanley Park {{is not the}} {{creation}} of a landscape architect, but rather the evolution of a forest and urban space over many years. Most of the <b>manmade</b> structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S. Rawlings. Additional attractions, such as a polar bear exhibit, aquarium, and miniature train, were added in the post-war period.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere. Most widely analysed {{are those that}} remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with {{carbon capture and storage}} and carbon dioxide air capture, or to the soil as in the case with biochar. The IPCC has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale <b>manmade</b> negative emissions to avoid serious climate change.|$|E
25|$|However, some pacifists, {{such as the}} Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and autarchist Robert LeFevre, {{consider}} the state a form of warfare. In addition, for doctrinal reason that a <b>manmade</b> government is inferior to divine governance and law, many pacifist-identified religions/religious sects also refrain from political activity altogether, including the Anabaptists, Jehovah's Witnesses and Mandaeans. This means that such groups refuse to participate in government office or serve under an oath to a government.|$|E
25|$|Although most <b>manmade</b> {{structures}} were demolished before {{the creation of}} the lake, divers recently discovered the remains of a lodge which was left intact until the lake rose; it is now below 300 feet of water. Mount Carmel Baptist Church Cemetery was a setting for a scene in the film Deliverance (1972), starring Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight, produced before the lake was flooded. The site is now covered by 130 feet of water in the lake.|$|E
25|$|From 1977 onward, {{per capita}} income in the country rose to more than US $11,000, the fifth-highest in Africa, while the Human Development Index became the highest in Africa and {{greater than that of}} Saudi Arabia. This was {{achieved}} without borrowing any foreign loans, keeping Libya debt-free. The Great <b>Manmade</b> River was also built to allow free access to fresh water across large parts of the country. In addition, financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs.|$|E
25|$|Art {{therapy has}} been used in a variety of {{traumatic}} experiences, including disaster relief and crisis intervention. Art therapists have worked with children, adolescents and adults after natural and <b>manmade</b> disasters, encouraging them to make art in response to their experiences. Some suggested strategies for working with victims of disaster include: assessing for distress or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), normalizing feelings, modeling coping skills, promoting relaxation skills, establishing a social support network, and increasing a sense of security and stability.|$|E
25|$|Traditional <b>manmade</b> {{threats to}} macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for {{construction}} and fuel, and hunting. These threats have declined due {{to social and}} economic changes in Japan since World War II, but other threats have emerged. The replacement of natural forest with lumber plantations {{is the most serious}} threat. As human prosperity has grown, macaques have lost their fear of humans and have increased their presence in both rural and urban areas, with one macaque recorded living in central Tokyo for several months.|$|E
25|$|When {{satellites}} {{reach the}} end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th <b>manmade</b> satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of August 2009.|$|E
25|$|When, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, the Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab) {{was started}} up at the University of Chicago, in February 1942, Fermi and Anderson, along with Walter Henry Zinn from Columbia, became leaders in the design and {{construction}} of Chicago Pile-1 (CP-1), which achieved the first <b>manmade</b> nuclear chain reaction on December 2, 1942. Thereafter, Anderson led the construction of CP-2 at Argonne National Laboratory in 1943. He was also a key consultant to DuPont in the design and construction of the Hanford reactors, which generated fissionable plutonium for the U.S. nuclear arsenal.|$|E
25|$|Disney's Polynesian Village Resort is {{situated}} on the southern shore of the <b>manmade</b> Seven Seas Lagoon, south of Magic Kingdom and adjacent to other Walt Disney World complexes, with the Transportation and Ticket Center {{to the east and}} Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa to the west. The resort is on the Magic Kingdom monorail loop, providing transportation to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot (via transfer), and is part of the route for Disney's Magic Kingdom Resorts Water Launch service. Other Walt Disney World Resort theme parks and attractions are served by Disney Transport buses.|$|E
25|$|An {{explosion}} and resulting {{oil and gas}} fires destroyed Piper Alpha on 6 July 1988, killing 167 people, including two crewmen of a rescue vessel; 61 workers escaped and survived. Thirty bodies were never recovered. The total insured loss was about £1.7 billion ($3.4 billion), {{making it one of}} the costliest <b>manmade</b> catastrophes ever. At the time of the disaster, the platform accounted for approximately ten per cent of North Sea oil and gas production, and the accident is the worst offshore oil disaster in terms of lives lost and industry impact.|$|E
25|$|The Beihai Tunnels are <b>manmade</b> granite tunnels. Both tunnels were {{remarkable}} for their time, {{and they took}} great effort to construct. The tunnel in Nangan was built in 1968. The completion of Beihai Tunnel took the effort of thousands of men. The 700 metre tunnel has a width of 10 metres and a height of 16 metres. It was completed in 820 days with shovels, spades and explosives; the tunnel also took {{the life of a}} platoon of soldiers. The tunnel was considered a military location and was not opened to the public until 1990.|$|E
25|$|Since uplift {{and erosion}} {{are more or}} less in {{equilibrium}} in the Himalaya, at least where the climate is humid, rapid uplift must be balanced out by annual increments of millions tonnes of sediments washing down from the mountains; then on the plains settling out of suspension on vast alluvial fans over which rivers meander and change course at least every few decades, causing some experts to question whether <b>manmade</b> embankments can contain the problem of flooding. Traditional Mithila culture along the lower Koshi in Nepal and Bihar celebrated the river as the giver of life for its fertile alluvial soil, yet also the taker of life through its catastrophic floods.|$|E
