The measurements of wind stress vector span several strong wind events. Significant angles between the wind stress vector and the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> are seen. Simultaneous measurements of the directional wave field were made with a surface scanning Doppler sonar. The {{data suggest that the}} wind stress direction is influenced by the direction of the surface waves, especially for stronger winds. Overall, the stress vector lies between the mean wind and the mean wave directions. At the higher wind speeds (over 8. 6 m/s), there is non-zero correlation between the variations in wave directions and stress directions as well. Finally, the stress and wave component directions have similar frequency dependence over the frequency band where wave energy is non-negligible, suggesting a dynamic link. 1...|$|E

Only forecasts {{within the first}} 24 h in coincidence with satellite overpasses are used. Two years of data, from 1 October 2000 to 31 October 2002, have been considered, allowing for an adequate statistical assessment under different wind conditions. This {{has been carried out}} by analyzing the fields of the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vectors,</b> <b>wind</b> speed bias, correlation, difference standard deviation, steadiness, gustiness, and <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> direction difference, in order to investigate spatial variability. Statistics have been computed on a seasonal basis. A comparison of satellite and forecast winds with measurements from three buoys was also performed. Some critical areas of the Mediterranean Sea where wind forecast quality is lower than average have been identified. Such areas correspond to semienclosed basins surrounded by important orography and to small regions at the lee side of the main islands. In open-sea regions the model underestimates wind strength from about 0. 5 m s 1 in spring and summer to 1. 0 m s 1 in winter, as evidenced by the existing biases against scatterometer data. Also, a wind direction bias (scatterometer minus model) generally between 5 ° and 15 ° exists. A survey of the identified and likely sources of forecast error is performed, indicating that orography representation plays an important role. Numerical damping is identified as a likely factor reducing forecast wind strength. The need for a correction scheme is envisaged to provide more accurate forcing for numerical sea state forecasting models, wind energy evaluation, and latent and/or sensible heat exchanges...|$|R

It is shown that a daily variation of <b>vector</b> <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> extends throughout the considered layer, with more southerly wind direction in the daytime term. However, the local effects, which are very pronounced in the daily variation of speed and direction of the slope and valley winds, are confined to a shallow surface layer. The upper level daily wind variation is attached to the influence of mesoscale mountain circulation in the Alpine region, which, by the entrainment processes, contributes to the low steadiness of the boundary layer winds. These processes cannot be followed directly in the monthly <b>mean</b> vertical <b>wind</b> structure, since the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> represent the frequencies of particular wind speed and direction in the individual months and seasons. These frequencies, however reflect the changes in large scale atmospheric circulation and its anomalies, which are responsible for both mesoscale mountain circulation and the behaviour of local boundary layer wind structure. Due to the known variation of the large scale flow pattern and their influence on anomalous monthly <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> hodographs, one could expect that the selected 10 -years data sampling in not sufficient representative for the long-term, climatological, wind structure in the lower troposphere of Zagreb.

The main contribution of this work is an efficient and, to my knowledge, new method for generating the nominal state and control histories taking into account an estimate of the mean wind velocity and direction. The method requires the solution of algebraic (mostly linear) equations to generate a 'universal nominal', and feedforward and feedback gains.

40|$|A Lagrangian {{stochastic}} particle model {{driven by}} observed winds from a net-work of 13 sonic anemometers {{is used to}} simulate the transport of contaminates due to meandering of the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> and diffusion by turbulence. The turbulence and the meandering motions are extracted from the observed velocity variances us-ing a variable averaging window width. Such partitioning enables determination of the separate contributions from turbulence and meandering to the total dispersion. The turbulence is described by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo process based on the Langevin equation using the observed turbulence variances. The meandering motions, not the turbulence, are primarily responsible for the 1 -h averaged horizontal dispersion {{as measured by the}} travel time dependence of the particle position variances. As a result, the 1 -h averaged horizontal concentration patterns are often characterized by streaks and multi-modal distributions. Time series of concentration at a fixed location are highly nonstationary even when the 1 -h averaged spatial distribution is close to Gaussian. The results show that the contribution of meandering to the time-averaged horizontal dispersion is dominant under all atmospheric conditions: weak and strong winds, and unstable and stable stratification...|$|E

The data were obtained from historical radiosonde observations from up to 250 stations within the region of interest for the period between 1954 and 2013. An alternative method based on vector statistics was employed in this study which characterises the mean by a vector and the variance by a tensor. Unlike the conventional approach of using scalar wind speeds, this vector-tensor approach allows the directional properties of the variance to be studied. A suite of statistics to describe the geometric properties of the variance tensor was also developed. These characterise {{the size of the}} variance, its degree of anisotropy, and the alignment of the preferred direction (if anisotropy is present) with the direction of the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector.</b> Through analysis of these statistics, several salient trends were observed for the middle troposphere.

Global TC rainfall structure, in terms of azimuthal distribution and asymmetries relative to storm motion, has been previously described using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager rainfall estimates. The mean TC rainfall distribution and the wavenumber- 1 asymmetry vary with storm intensity and geographical location among the six oceanic basins. This study uses a similar approach to investigate the relationship between the structure of TC rainfall and the environ-mental flow by computing the rainfall asymmetry relative to the vertical wind shear. The environmental vertical wind shear is defined as the difference between the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> of the 200 - and 850 -hPa levels over an outer region extending from the radius of 200 – 800 km around the storm center. The wave-number- 1 maximum rainfall asymmetry is downshear left (right) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. The rainfall asymmetry decreases (increases) with storm intensity (shear strength). The rainfall asymmetry maximum is predominantly downshear left for shear values 7. 5 m s 1. Large asymmetries are usually observed away from the TC centers.

This study uses wind information recorded in ships’ logbooks in order to statistically reconstruct summer and winter season precipitation at four southern African weather stations from 1796 to 1854. The reconstruction was obtained by first relating gridded 8 °[*]×[*] 8 ° NCEP-DOE reanalysis seasonal <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> in the adjacent oceans to station precipitation. Over a 30 -year calibration period (1979 – 2008), significant correlations between wind and precipitation at Cape Town, Mthatha and Royal National Park showed particular correspondence with those areas with the greatest concentration of logbook observations. Principal component regression was used to assess the potential of the dominant patterns of variability in the <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> as predictors to reconstruct precipitation. Cross-validation in the calibration period gave confidence that precipitation could be reconstructed at several stations across South Africa, meaning the regression relationships derived in the calibration period could be applied to the gridded seasonal mean logbook data to produce reconstructions of precipitation from 1796 to 1854. The reconstructions show a degree of correspondence with other regional data sets. For instance, the decade beginning in 1810 was the wettest of the period at Mthatha and Royal National Park, while the 1820 s were the driest. At Cape Town, the 1820 s were the wettest decade, with drier conditions observed in the 1830 s. An index of west–east {{circulation in}} the summer season revealed correspondence with two documentary reconstructions of El Niño events and increased westerliness, although this did not always result in drier conditions.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between short-term convective mode evolution, the orientations of vertical shear and mean wind vectors {{with respect to the}} initiating synoptic boundary, the motion of the boundary, and the role of forcing for ascent. The dominant mode of storms (linear, mixed mode, and discrete) was noted 3 h after convective initiation along cold fronts, drylines, or prefrontal troughs. Various shear and <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> orientations relative to the boundary were calculated near the time of initiation. Results indicate a statistical correlation between storm mode at 3 h, the normal components of cloud-layer and deeplayer shear vectors, the boundary-relative mean cloud-layer wind vector, and the type of initiating boundary. Thunderstorms, most of which were initially discrete, tended to evolve more quickly into lines or mixed modes when the normal components of the shear vectors and boundary-relative mean cloud-layer wind vectors were small. There was a tendency for storms to remain discrete for larger normal shear and mean wind components. Smaller normal components of mean cloud-layer wind were associated with a greater likelihood that storms would remain within the zone of linear forcing along the boundary for longer time periods, thereby increasing the potential for upscale linear growth. The residence time of storms along the boundary is also dependent on the speed of the boundary. It was found that the boundary-relative normal component o...|$|E
40|$|Field experiments, with 125 watt Mercury-Vapour light-traps, are {{described}} in this Thesis. Catches of moths in water traps arranged in a circular mosaic pattern around the light-trap were distributed bivariate normal. Comparisons between the bivariate mean moth vector and the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> suggested that the wind vector determined the distribution of moths around the light-trap. In light winds, less than 1 metre/second, moths were randomly distributed around the trap. In stronger winds the direction of moth displacement from the trap {{was associated with the}} direction component of the mean wind velocity. A second experiment with light and water traps was used to estimate the effective light-trap radius. Two light-traps, surrounded by water traps, were separated by up to 25 metres on different evenings. When one light-trap was downwind of another the catch was significantly greater in the downwind trap. However, in crosswind conditions the two catches were similar. Bivariate methods were used to estimate that the effective trap radius was between 10 and 25 metres. A further experiment, using multivariate correlation and regression analysis, found that air temperature, windspeed and moonlight affected light-trap catches. An algorithm is described to enable the calculation of moonlight illuminance. Increased windspeed and increased moonlight illuminance tended to decrease the light-trap catch, however, increased air temperature was associated with an increase in light-trap catch. These effects varied depending on family and species. A final experiment used a remote sensing technique to estimate light-trap efficiency. A 10 cubic metre volume around the light-trap was observed using a video camera. Moth tracks recorded were classified into New Arrivals, Passers By and Local Flights. The number of these tracks was compared to the lighttrap catch so that efficiency estimates could be obtained. Results suggested that at ground level, 125 watt Mercury-Vapour light-traps are only 20 % efficient within this 10 cubic metre volume...|$|E
40|$|Errors in {{the height}} {{assignment}} of some satellite-derived winds exist because the satellites sense radiation emitted from a finite {{layer of the}} atmosphere rather than a specific level. Potential problems in data assimilation may arise because the motion of a measured layer is often represented by a single-level value. In this research, cloud and water vapor motion winds that are derived from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES winds) are compared to collocated rawinsonde observations (RAOBs). An important aspect of this work is {{that in addition to}} comparisons at each assigned height, the GOES winds are compared to the entire profile of the collocated RAOB data to determine the vertical error characteristics of the GOES winds. The impact of these results on numerical weather prediction is then investigated. The comparisons at individual vector height assignments indicate that the error of the GOES winds range from approx. 3 to 10 m/s and generally increase with height. However, if taken {{as a percentage of the}} total wind speed, accuracy is better at upper levels. As expected, comparisons with the entire profile of the collocated RAOBs indicate that clear-air water vapor winds represent deeper layers than do either infrared or water vapor cloud-tracked winds. This is because in cloud-free regions the signal from water vapor features may result from emittance over a thicker layer. To further investigate characteristics of the clear-air water vapor winds, they are stratified into two categories that are dependent on the depth of the layer represented by the vector. It is found that if the vertical gradient of moisture is smooth and uniform from near the height assignment upwards, the clear-air water vapor wind tends to represent a relatively deep layer. The information from the comparisons is then used in numerical model simulations of two separate events to determine the forecast impacts. Four simulations are performed for each case: 1) A control simulation that assimilates no satellite wind data, 2) assimilation of all GOES winds according to their assigned single level height, 3) assimilation of all GOES winds spread over multiple levels, and 4) assimilation of all GOES winds spread over multiple levels, but with variations in the vertical influence of clear-air water vapor winds based on the moisture profile in the model. In the first case, a strong mid-latitude cyclone is present and the use of the satellite data results in improved storm tracks during the initial approx. 36 h forecast period. This is because the satellite data improves the analysis of the environment into which the storm progresses. Statistics for <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> and height differences show that, with the exception of the height field at later times in the first case, the use of GOES winds improves the simulation with time. The simulation results suggest that it is beneficial to spread the GOES wind information over multiple levels, particularly when the moisture profile is used to define the vertical influence...|$|E

This study puts special emphasis on the seasonal differences in the wind patterns. For this purpose 131 days centered on the June solstice of 2003 are considered. Within that period CHAMP's orbit is precessing once through all local times. The cross-track wind estimates of all 2030 passes are used to construct <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> for 918 equal-area cells. These bin averages are presented in corrected geomagnetic coordinates. Both hemispheres are considered simultaneously providing summer and winter responses for the same prevailing geophysical conditions. The period under study is characterized by high magnetic activity (K p = 4 ?) but moderate solar flux level (F 10. 7 = 124). Our analysis reveals clear wind features in the summer (Northern) Hemisphere. Over the polar cap there is a fast day-to-night flow with mean speeds surpassing 600 m/s in the dawn sector. At auroral latitudes we find strong westward zonal winds on the dawn side. On the dusk side, however, an anti-cyclonic vortex is forming. The dawn/dusk asymmetry is attributed to the combined action of Coriolis and centrifugal forces. Along the auroral oval the sunward streaming plasma causes a stagnation of the day-to-night wind. This effect is particularly clear on the dusk side. On the dawn side it is evident only from midnight to 06 : 00 MLT. The winter (Southern) Hemisphere reveals similar wind features, but they are less well ordered. The <b>mean</b> day-to-night <b>wind</b> over the polar cap is weaker by about 35 %. Otherwise, the seasonal differences are mainly confined to the dayside (06 : 00 ? 18 : 00 MLT).

40|$|In this paper, a {{model of}} the {{measuring}} process of sonic anemometers with more than one measuring path is presented. The main hypothesis of the work is that the time variation of the turbulent speed field during the sequence of pulses that produces a measure of the <b>wind</b> speed <b>vector</b> affects the measurement. Therefore, the previously considered frozen flow, or instantaneous averaging, condition is relaxed. This time variation, quantified by the mean Mach number of the flow and the time delay between consecutive pulses firings, in combination with both the full geometry of sensors (acoustic path location and orientation) and the incidence angles of the mean with speed vector, give rise to significant errors in the measurement of turbulence which are not considered by models based on the hypothesis of instantaneous line averaging. The additional corrections (relative to the ones proposed by instantaneous line-averaging models) are strongly dependent on the wave number component parallel to the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> speed, the time delay between consecutive pulses, the Mach number of the flow, the geometry of the sensor and the incidence angles of <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> speed <b>vector.</b> Kaimal´s limit k W 1 = 1 /l (where k W 1 is the wave number component parallel to <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> speed and l is the path length) for the maximum wave numbers from which the sonic process affects the measurement of turbulence is here generalized as k W 1 =C l /l, where C l is usually lesser than unity and depends on all the new parameters taken into account by the present model...|$|R
40|$|Migratory {{shorebirds}} are {{a dynamic}} component of New Zealand's coastal fauna, alternating between distant breeding and non-breeding grounds. The Red Knot Calidris canutus, Bar-tailed Godwit Limosa lapponica and Pied Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus finschi were studied on Farewell Spit, North-West Nelson. The first two species breed in the Arctic and migrate to New Zealand for the non-breeding season. Over the southern summer they experience low thermostatic costs and generally improving prey conditions over the summer. Oystercatchers are resident over autumn and winter, so experience rising costs and declining prey quality in some species. One bivalve species, Macomona liliana, shows seasonal depth {{changes in the}} sediment, and so is largely inaccessible even to a long-billed bird such as the oystercatcher. Despite this, oystercatchers feed for less time than is available, and achieve intake rates sufficient to cover estimated needs. The energy needs of the Arctic waders rise as they prepare to migrate, and they achieve {{at least part of}} this by increasing the duration of feeding. Knots during spring tides in the premigratory period feed for the entire low-water period. Godwits are apparently less stressed, underutilising nocturnal feeding opportunities over summer. They are thought to increase feeding time by using this night-time feeding. The high energy demands for migrating birds come from the need to deposit nutrients for migration, and knots around the Auckland region are estimated to increase in mass from 115 to 185 g prior to migration. Fat deposition is not the only physiological preparation, however, and a sample of knots shot from Northland (illegally, recovered by DoC) revealed complex interactions between organs. Large amounts of fat were deposited, mostly in a subcutaneous layer but also in the abdominal cavity. Muscle protein was also deposited in flight and heart muscles, presumably to prepare for the extreme effort involved in trans-oceanic flights. At the same time, digestive organs decreased in mass. This is interpreted as freeing up muscle protein which is then deposited in organs for use during flight. Knots and godwits migrated from Farewell Spit in March. Most departures occurred in the evening and on rising tides. The former probably allows for the use of multiple navigational cues, while the latter may maximise feeding opportunities immediately before the flight. Most departures occurred after the passage of a low-pressure system or with the approach of a high-pressure system. This enabled favourable winds to be gained, so that the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> was a small tailwind. Thus, while departure directions were intermediate between the expected directions for flights to either Australia or northern New Zealand, it is probable they were able to fly across the top of a high-pressure system and gain wind assistance for a direct flight to Australia. However, the variability in flight range estimates depending on assumptions of travel-speed and protein deposition makes predicting migration routes difficult. Numbers of godwits have increased on Farewell Spit over the past decade, while oystercatchers have remained static Knots have shown a slight decline. Knot numbers are independent of national census counts so are presumably determined largely by factors operating on Farewell Spit itself. A possible mechanism that could give to a slowly declining population could be if a certain sector of the population fails to deposit sufficient nutrients to successfully migrate and return. If site-fidelity is very high (as it generally is in waders) then a long-term decrease could ensue...|$|E

With or without winds, Tampa Bay exhibits a robust, two-layered estuarine circulation that concentrates on the deep channels. The mean outflow at the surface tends to converge on the channels where the free surface elevation is locally minimum.

Geometry thus guides the mean circulation and salinity distributions. at the Tampa Bay mouth, mean outflows exist both in the deeper Egmont Channel and the shallower South Pass, whereas a mean inflow {{is limited to the}} Egmont Channel.

The derivation {{is based on the}} statistics of the SASS observations, and no in situ measurements are required, other than a <b>mean</b> global <b>wind</b> speed, which comes from climatology. The frequency distribution of the global <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> observed by SASS is assumed to be a bivariate normal probability function. A NRCS model function is found that maps the assumed <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> statistics into the observed SASS NRCS statistics. This function is compared with a NRCS model coming from the Joint Air Sea Interaction Experiment (JASIN) and with aircraft scatterometer measurements. The results indicate that the statistically derived NRCS model is an improvement over the JASIN model, which was based on a limited number of in situ anemometer measurements...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} computes {{the velocity}} of wind from the readings of an instrument like the one described in another Tech Brief. To recapitulate: The sensor has no moving parts and is a compact, rugged <b>means</b> of measuring <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> having magnitudes {{of as much as}} 300 mph (134 m/s). The sensor includes a Venturi gap bounded by a curved upper and a curved lower surface that are axisymmetric with respect to a vertical axis and mirror-symmetric with respect to a horizontal midplane. One of the curved surfaces is instrumented with multiple ports for measuring dynamic pressures. The sensor also incorporates auxiliary sensors for measuring temperature, relative humidity, and static atmospheric pressure. The design and operation of the sensor are based on the concepts of (1) using Bernoulli's equation (which expresses the relationship among variations of speed, density, and pressure along a streamline) to calculate the speed of the wind from differences among the pressure readings at the various ports; and (2) calculating the direction of the wind from the angular positions of ports selected according to comparisons among their pressure readings. The present algorithm performs these calculations...|$|R
40|$|Four {{supercell}} motion forecast algorithms are investigated {{with respect}} to their hodograph-analysis parameters. Another method derived from the data presented herein, the so-called offset method, is used to develop a baseline standard for the aforementioned schemes, using the observed storm motions and the <b>mean</b> <b>wind.</b> It is not a forecast scheme, as it is based on knowing the observed storm motions. This work explores the sensitivity of these algorithms to their arbitrary parameters by systematically varying those parameters, using a dataset of 394 right-moving supercells, and associated proximity soundings. The pa-rameters used in these algorithms to define the layer depths for advection and/or propagation of supercells have not been shown to be optimum for this purpose. These arbitrary parameters compose the top and bottom levels of the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> layer, and a deviation <b>vector</b> from the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> defined through that layer. Two of the most recently developed algorithms have also implemented the vertical <b>wind</b> shear <b>vector</b> over an arbitrary layer depth. It has been found that, among other results, the scheme using both <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> and vertical wind shear is more sensitive to the depth of the <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> layer than it is to the depth of the vertical wind shear layer. It has also been shown that, when using the simplest schemes, the most accurate forecasts, on average, are obtained by using deep <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> layers (i. e., greater than 0 – 10 km).

40|$|Abstract A new concept, the {{directed}} angle, is intro-duced {{to study}} seasonal rotation regimes of global <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> and annual variability of monsoon. Compared with previous studies on using angles between <b>wind</b> <b>vectors,</b> this concept better describes the daily variations of both rotation direction and rotation amplitude of <b>wind</b> <b>vector.</b> According to the concept, six categories of <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> rotation with seasonal cycle {{in the global}} have been detected and classified as follows: (1) Clockwise to counter-clockwise (CTCC) rotation; (2) Counter-clock-wise to clockwise (CCTC) rotation; (3) Full clockwise (FC) rotation; (4) Full counter-clockwise (FCC) rotation; (5) Stable style; (6) Unstable style. Generally, wind vec-tors in monsoon regions rotate in forms of the first four styles. Moreover, the rotation direction and rotation amplitude of <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> have regional differences, and different monsoon subsystems possess different rotation styles for <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> in an annual cycle. For instance, the South Asian monsoon follows the CCTC rotation, while the East Asian monsoon follows the FCC rotation. The CTCC rotation {{is seen in the}} South China Sea. Both the West Africa and the South Indo-China Peninsula are covered by the FC rotation. Therefore, the directed angle is able to describe the evolution of <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> on a daily scale, which provides a new clue for spatio-temporal information about <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> variation and model eva-luation. Using the new concept, this study aims at evaluating the model outputs of eight AGCMs of AMIP in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4). Compared to the cor-responding observations, most models are able to simulate the global rotation regimes of <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> reasonably well, however very little skill is shown in the monsoon rotation styles of some models, especially in the South China Sea and West Africa. Moreover, the simulations differ mostly from observations during the transitional season. ...|$|R
40|$|Fast {{response}} {{wind and}} turbulence instruments, including sonic anemometers are used {{more and more}} in the research of aeolian sediment transport. These instruments provide data on <b>mean</b> <b>wind,</b> but also on friction velocity, wind speed fluctuations and turbulence statistics, such as the U-W and W-T covariance (CUW and CWT), which are a measure for the momentum flux and the sensible heat flux. This short paper will examine two problems that may arise when using sonic anemometers, namely the low/high frequency losses and the interpretation of the sonic anemometer measurements over sloping or non-homogeneous terrain. The sonic anemometer The sonic anemometer uses the speed of sound to measure temperature and wind speed. The wind speed is measured in three orthogonal directions, so the complete three-dimensional <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> is known. Since the instrument has no moving parts the measurement is almost instantaneous. Many sonic anemometers have a path length of 15 - 20 cm and an output frequency of around 20 Hz. They can be used to obtain high frequency <b>wind</b> measurements, <b>mean</b> <b>wind</b> speeds and standard deviations of wind speed in the stream-wise or longitudinal (U), lateral (V...|$|R
40|$|Current {{retrieval}} methods for <b>wind</b> <b>vectors</b> from scatterometer observations {{over the ocean}} surface requires a sensor model relating the measured backscatter to the <b>wind</b> <b>vector.</b> The complexity {{of the problem and}} the lack of reliable measurements mean that models based on the analytical solution of the physical equations is impossible. Thus an empirical approach, such as implemented in the operational model Cmod 4, is justified. This paper develops a hybrid neural network forward model, which retains the physical understanding embodied in Cmod 4, but better fits the observed backscatter. We also compare this with a multi-layer perceptron neural network model. Both models are trained in a Bayesian framework, accounting for the noise on the <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> inputs, although this makes little difference to the wind retrieval. Results show the model improves on <b>wind</b> <b>vector</b> retrieval when compared with Cmod 4, particularly at high wind speeds. 3 1.
