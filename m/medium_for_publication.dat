40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} the hymnbook {{in the development of the}} Lutheran church from the publication of the first hymnal in 1524 to the creation of the first cantional style hymnbook in 1587. When Luther introduced the Formula Missae, he called for poets to compose German hymns, which led to the creation of approximately 4000 such hymns. Even though Luther initiated the hymn writing process, the printer-publishers believed a book of hymns could be a viable <b>medium</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication.</b> Initial success of their publications led to the creation of a genre that would produce approximately 500 different hymnbooks between 1524 and 1587. ^ With the unfolding of the Reformation, the hymnbook continued to evolve; this directly paralleled the historical developments of the era. First, reformers created the traditional hymnbooks to broadcast the evangelical message that helped to bring about the Reformation. Second, hymnbook compilers developed books that emphasized lay learning. This corresponded with Luther 2 ̆ 7 s new approach to education, which he introduced after receiving the first visitation reports in 1527. These books encouraged the laity to learn Luther 2 ̆ 7 s theology and the tenets of Christianity. Third, the hymnbooks came to symbolize Lutheran solidarity during the period of confessionalization by promoting state and doctrinal unity. Finally, this {{study examines}} the wealth of polemical hymns left out of sixteenth-century hymnbooks. These hymns attacked a wide range of topics under the guise of religion and utilized song for their delivery. When printers and theologians omitted these songs from the hymnbooks, they sent a clear message about music, which they believed to be important to the salvation of souls and the propagation of the church. ^ On a broader scale, this study demonstrates the importance of hymns as a historical source at the time of the Reformation. Hymns were not cultural by-products of history, but played an active part in the spread, education and adoption of the Lutheran church. ...|$|E
40|$|Developments in {{information}} technology are rapidly changing the way written material is processed and transmitted. Micro-computers and their accessories are becoming commonplace, not only in developed but also in developing countries. A new journal, Livestock production for rural development, has been produced which takes advantage of developments in computer science {{in order to promote}} faster, easier, and less costly technology for communication between scientists working in the field of rural development. It aims to promote improved livestock production and associated technologies and thereby contribute to self-reliant ecologically-balanced rural development. CTA is supporting the journal by meeting the cost of distributing 1300 disks to scientists and development workers in ACP countries. Livestock production for rural development is published on standard floppy disks and can be read on basic IBM compatible microcomputers and printers. It does not require any specialized software or word-processing packages. It aims to publish papers as fast a possible, with the minimum of centralized editorial input, and is distributed throughout the world, through a network of interested and sympathetic colleagues. The journal consists of articles, written in ASCII format, and a simple software package that allows the user to view the articles and print them out on any printer. Papers are submitted on disk to a regional language sub-editor. Authors are required to have their papers refereed before submission by at least two scientists who have post graduate qualifications and proven experience. The paper) can be in any of the journal's languages - English, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Livestock production is not only a low-cost <b>medium</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication,</b> it gives new potential for the transmission of scientific data. Despite the simple form of the original disks, the journal may be printed on high quality laser printers for retention on bookshelves and in libraries.

In addition to a rich historical and cultural background, ithas been a region where much of modern science can find its roots. The great accomplishments of eminent scientists such as Avicenna and Razes are nothidden to anyone. These scholars strived hard to scientifically disentangle the mysteries hidden deep within the field of medicine, and tried diligently to prescribe remedies to cure the sick. They accomplished a lot in the days when there was a lack of technology and equipment. It is my belief that they were able to succeed because of the rich historical and cultural heritage of our region, which lingered on with them as a valuable asset. People strive and flourish in glorious eras, when there is unity, stability and a sense of belonging;when art and science are cherished and artists and scientists are honored and praised. It is a good sign to see that even today, science, especially the field of medicine, is flourishing in our region and our scientists are actively involved in state-of-the-art basic science and clinical research. One of the fields where great concern is being focused nowadays is cancer. Cancer is now becoming a growing health problem in our region, and as ourdiet and lifestyle habits change, we will become more prone to this disease. Because many prominent Middle Eastern scientists are working in this field,we believe it is important to have a journal in our region that can be a <b>medium</b> <b>for</b> <b>publication</b> of these findings. Hopefully, with contributions from researchers in both the Middle East and elsewhere, we can provide a forum for publication of excellent research on this subject so that all interested scientists worldwide can benefit from it. We believe that initiatives of this nature, that can benefitfrom editorial input from different countries and can publish scientific knowledge from the region as well as the world, will enhance the scientific visibility of this part of the world and foster more collaborative research inthe field of cancer.

40|$|Abstract. Although the Internet, as an {{ubiquitous}} <b>medium</b> <b>for</b> communica-tion, <b>publication</b> and research, already significantly {{influenced the}} way histori-ans work, {{the capabilities of}} the Web as a direct <b>medium</b> <b>for</b> collaboration in historic research are not much explored. We report about the application of an adaptive, semantics-based knowledge engineering approach {{for the development of a}} prosopographical knowledge base on the Web- the Catalogus Professorum Lipsiensis. In order to enable historians to collect, structure and publish proso-pographical knowledge an ontology was developed and knowledge engineering facilities based on the semantic data wiki OntoWiki were implemented. The re-sulting knowledge base contains information about more than 14. 000 entities and is tightly interlinked with the emerging Web of Data. For access and exploration by other historians a number of access interfaces were developed, such as a vi-sual SPARQL query builder, a relationship finder and a Linked Data interface. The approach is transferable to other prosopographical research projects and his-torical research in general, thus improving the collaboration in historic research communities and facilitating the reusability of historic research results. ...|$|R
