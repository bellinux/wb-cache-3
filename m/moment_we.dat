25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as every <b>moment</b> <b>we</b> heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the <b>moment</b> <b>we</b> are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the poor}} {{condition}} of the performers, the concert was highly successful, prompting an hour-long ovation. The concert {{was supported by a}} Soviet military offensive, code-named Squall, intended to silence German forces during the performance.

The Leningrad première was considered by music critics {{to be one of the}} most important artistic performances of the war because of its psychological and political effects.

He accepted, and sought to imitate {{the production of a}} television episode by filming in high-definition. During the course of the production, Zicree received advice on directing from J.J. Abrams. In addition to Takei, Grace Lee Whitney appeared as Janice Rand. She too had played the character in The Original Series, and had most recently appeared with Takei in [...] "Flashback". Christina Moses, who portrayed Alana Sulu, was a replacement for an actress who dropped out of the production some four weeks prior to production.

500|$|Unpaid as IOC president, {{even for}} his expenses, Brundage {{sometimes}} spent $50,000 {{per year to}} finance his role. In 1960, the IOC had almost no funds. Brundage and the IOC had considered the potential of television revenue {{as early as the}} Melbourne Games of 1956, but had been slow to address the issue, with the result that television rights for the 1960 Games were {{in the hands of the}} Rome organizing committee; the IOC received only 5% of the $60,000 rights fee. Accounts submitted by the Rome organizers showed they lost money on the Olympics; the IOC would have received a portion of the profits, and had no money to offer the sports federations who wanted a percentage of the proceeds. In future years, the sale of television rights became a major source of revenue for the IOC, rising to $10 million by the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, and $1.2 billion, long after Brundage's death, at Athens in 2004.

500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small <b>moment.</b> <b>We</b> tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be.

500|$|Russell T Davies {{referred}} to a scene in [...] "Last of the Time Lords" [...] as promoting a theory that Jack may one day become recurring character [...] "the Face of Boe" [...] (a large, mysterious disembodied head in a glass case) {{as a consequence of}} his immortality and slow aging. The Face first appeared in 2005 episode [...] "The End of the World", appearing fully three times and maintaining a presence through {{to the end of the}} 2007 series. Barrowman described himself and David Tennant as being [...] "so excited" [...] to the extent where they [...] "jumped up screaming" [...] when they read Jack's line regarding the Face of Boe, remarking [...] "It was probably the most excitable <b>moment</b> <b>we</b> had during the shooting of that series." [...] The Face of Boe had originally been a throwaway line in a script for [...] "The End of the World"; because creating the character seemed expensive, the Face of Boe was nearly discarded and replaced. However, special effects designer Neil Gorton loved the idea and pushed to make sure the character lived. Davies loved Gorton's design and to his surprise, the character was written into future episodes and became pivotal in the third series. In a spin-off novel, The Stealer of Dreams (2005), Captain Jack makes a reference to the Face of Boe as a famous figure. Davies conceived the idea that the two characters might be connected midway through the production of the 2007 series.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s RNC {{underwent}} significant restructuring as it responded {{to changes in}} the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students. However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest. There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college. Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told In Touch, the BBC Radio 4 news programme for visually impaired listeners; [...] "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us. And at the <b>moment</b> <b>we</b> are reducing a small number of A Level courses {{but at the same time}} we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors." [...] In an interview in January 2010, the then principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.|$|E
