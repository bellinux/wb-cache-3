5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> within their society, but not necessarily when they are old enough to be regarded as an adult.|$|E
5|$|We had Belzer in {{the band}} for six months. I {{want to believe it}} was purely musical, and I {{honestly}} believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to be close friends with a gay person at that point in our lives... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.|$|E

50|$|The WS-10A {{reportedly}} <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> after 2009 {{to power}} the J-11B Block 02 aircraft. A WS-10A-powered J-10B was seen in July 2011, but the engine did not power the initial J-10B production batch, possibly because of production or performance issues.|$|R
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and {{trained to be}} ridden {{between the ages of}} two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents also}} took turns feeding their chick. According to one account, the chick {{was covered with}} grey down. The young bird took {{only two or three}} weeks to <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to abandon the nest and land for the water, {{typically}} around the middle of July. The parents cared for their young after they fledged, and adults would be seen swimming with their young perched on their backs. Great auks matured sexually when they were four to seven years old.|$|E
5|$|Although B.cuneata {{was first}} {{collected}} before 1880, {{it was not}} until 1981 that Australian botanist Alex George formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This Banksia is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As Banksia cuneata is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to set seed. Banksia cuneata is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.|$|E
50|$|First of all, {{there had}} been no {{international}} agreements that addressed the rights to the various minerals and areas outside the three mile (5 km) limit. Also, the technology required was not yet developed, or hadn't <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> to be commercially usable.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} of Congress exacerbated {{the tensions between}} the parties in contention. Because seventy-nine seats are needed to elect a president, compromise was indispensable. In mid-1989, however, {{it was unclear whether}} the political system in Bolivia had <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> to allow for compromise.|$|R
25|$|Of all {{the reasons}} Lori and Corey found for {{creating}} a bridge between Trial by Fire and Shadows of Darkenss, the most compelling was {{the feeling that the}} Hero character simply hadn't <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> to face the very grim challenges awaiting him in Transylvania.|$|R

25|$|Contingent {{resources}} are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as {{of a given}} date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet considered <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> for commercial development due {{to one or more}} contingencies. Contingent resources may include, for example, projects for which there are no viable markets, or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly assess commerciality.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. Pacific Northwest, a major Christmas tree growing region, Douglas-fir {{has always}} been the primary species grown. A full {{one-half}} of all trees produced in the Pacific Northwest are Douglas-fir. Douglas-firs typically take five to seven years before they are <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to sell as Christmas trees. Also common in the region are noble fir, a tree which commands a higher price than Douglas-fir, and grand fir, which accounts for about 10percent of the annual harvest in the Northwest. Other species collectively account for only 3–5percent of the total Northwest harvest.|$|E

50|$|By 1990, SCSI had <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> {{to handle}} high data rates and {{multiple}} types of drives, and ATA was quickly overtaking ST-506 in the desktop market. These two events made ESDI {{less and less}} important over time, and by the mid-1990s, ESDI {{was no longer in}} common use.|$|R
25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of pulque {{is complex and}} required {{the death of the}} maguey plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as aguamiel (honeywater), collects. It takes a maguey plant 12 years to <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to produce the sap for pulque.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} large size, king penguin chicks take 14–16 months {{before they are}} ready to go to sea. This is {{markedly}} different from smaller penguins, who rear their chicks through a single summer when food is plentiful. King penguins time their mating so the chicks will develop over the harshest season for fishing. In this way, by the time the young penguins are finally <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to leave their parents, it is summer when food is plentiful and conditions are more favorable for the young to survive alone.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{adolescence}} {{and the beginning}} of adulthood varies by country and by function. Furthermore, even within a single nation state or culture there can be different ages at which an individual is considered (chronologically and legally) <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> for society to entrust them with certain privileges and responsibilities. Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving in the armed forces or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.|$|E

50|$|Ongoing and {{frequent}} assessment between all {{those involved in}} the treatment plan is documented in a readily accessible format - usually the patient record. Assessment of the pain in children depends upon the cooperation and developmental stage of the child.

25|$|Homeschooled by his parents, Christopher Paolini {{graduated}} from high school at the age of fifteen, but felt he was not yet <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> for college, so he wrote Eragon in his spare time. After writing the first draft for a year, he spent a second year rewriting it and fleshing out the story and characters, and then presented it to his parents. They had it self-published by the family publishing company, Paolini International, and Paolini then travelled to various schools advertising his novel. In 2002, author Carl Hiaasen discovered the book while his stepson was reading it, and brought it to the attention of his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. It was republished by Knopf in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a {{young girl}} gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are {{essentially}} delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she pretty much has the free will to choose her mate. Now, her parents can choose a mate for her, but they ask for her consent. It is quite tough for parents to force their daughter to marry a man she isn't attracted to or simply dislikes. Nuer girls do stand up against being pressured by family {{when it comes to}} marriage issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{second season}} follows J.D.'s second year {{practicing}} medicine at Sacred Heart where Elliot, Turk, and he are now residents. As the season develops, money issues affect {{the three of}} them, especially Elliot, whose dad cut her off and J.D.'s older brother Dan (Tom Cavanagh) comes to visit, as does Turk's brother Kevin (D.L. Hughley). Season two focuses on the romantic relationships of the main characters: Turk proposes to an indecisive Carla, who has doubts about if Turk is <b>mature</b> <b>enough,</b> Elliot dates nurse Paul Flowers (Rick Schroder), Dr. Cox dates pharmaceutical rep Julie (Heather Locklear) before reigniting a relationship with his pregnant ex-wife Jordan (Christa Miller). J.D., meanwhile, attempts a relationship with Elliot, and later falls for Jamie (Amy Smart), the wife {{of one of his}} coma patients.|$|E
50|$|Bekisa is a Zulu custom whereby a man asks a {{young girl}} not yet {{physically}} <b>matured</b> <b>enough</b> for marriage (considered to be roughly 16) {{to wait for him}} so they can be married when she has reached this age. This is merely a romantic gesture and does not require the girl to honour the request, as she may fall in love with whomever she wishes.|$|R

25|$|Serial {{manufacturing}} of the WS-10 {{and integration}} with the J-11, {{proved to be}} more difficult than expected. As a result, even though several related prototypes had been tested and at least one regiment converted to the Taihang powered J-11B version in 2007, these aircraft were later grounded for an extended period due to a poor operational reliability. A report in the Washington Times suggested that the Chinese engines lasted 30 hours before they needed servicing, compared to 400 hours for the Russian versions. Defects were traced back to the engine manufacturer, Shenyang Liming Aircraft Engine Company employing sub-standard manufacturing and quality control procedures. Several subsequent batches temporarily reverted to the original, Russian AL-31F turbofans. The engines manufacturing problems had finally been solved by the end of 2009 and the WS-10A had reportedly proved <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to power the Block 02 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Despite the win, and two wins in the NASCAR Busch Series in 1988 and 1989 {{driving for}} Highline Racing, Hillin's career took a downturn; {{he would later}} say he was not <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> {{to deal with the}} {{pressures}} of being a NASCAR winner. He left the Stavola Brothers team after the 1990 season; he started the 1991 season qualifying a backup car for Moroso Racing fastest in third-round time trials for the Daytona 500. A seventh-place finish in the 500 won Hillin the team's regular ride, however after ten races a lack of sponsorship forced the team to cut back its schedule, and Hillin was released; After two races with Jimmy Means Racing, Hillin was named as substitute driver for Kyle Petty, who had broken his leg earlier in the year in a wreck at Talladega; he drove eight races in the Team SABCO No. 42 before Petty returned.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroos have {{developed}} a number of adaptations to a dry, infertile country and highly variable climate. As with all marsupials, the young are born {{at a very early}} stage of development—after a gestation of 31–36 days. At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat. In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not <b>mature</b> <b>enough</b> to survive. When the joey is born, it {{is about the size of}} a lima bean. The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180–320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time. It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months.|$|E
