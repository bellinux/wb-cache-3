5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 {{was caused by}} the rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end of the}} Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised <b>mortgages</b> during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E

A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea.

The {{contract}} {{cost of the}} ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum price of $640,000 per ship. Maryland Steel financed the construction with a credit plan which called for a 5% down payment in cash followed by nine monthly installments for the balance.

Rush and his wife had fourteen children, and the Rush family lived in grand, if not extravagant style; most Rush enterprises were financed by <b>mortgages</b> or promissory notes. When the Banks Crash of 1893 came, Rush was not only deeply in debt, he did not even own the house he lived in.|$|E

5|$|Hollis raised <b>mortgages</b> {{to pay for}} improvements, but {{receipts}} {{were down}} to £1,821 in 1839, the last full year of operation before the London and Southampton Railway opened. The receipts were obtained from tolls, as all freight was moved by independent carriers. At this point, Hollis gave control of the navigation to members of his family. His son managed it until 1841, when a banker called W. W. Bulpett, who was a mortgagee, took over. In 1847 he was given notice to quit by the Hollis family, despite having done a good job, but he refused. F. W. Hollis eventually obtained most of the shares from the other family members, and started legal action to remove Bulpett. Railway competition had caused {{a sharp drop in}} receipts, from £1,012 in 1843 to £430 in 1861, and payments to shareholders and mortgagees ceased in 1850 and 1857. In 1863, Bulpett was replaced by Mr Clarke, formerly the manager of the Andover Canal, but Bulpett returned when he won the action brought by Hollis.|$|E

She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.

Although the railway was completed in 1850, the railway company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against the railway company, and successfully opposed several bills which the railway were trying to get passed in Parliament. Eventually the railway company agreed to pay, and shareholders received £45 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway <b>mortgages.</b> The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December.

5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 personal loan from the Harmonists {{in a letter to his}} political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting <b>mortgages</b> on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E
5|$|Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848, 15 {{years after}} the first proposal. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build {{railways}} in the area, and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke. Under the arrangement, they would take over both navigations, and guarantee a fixed income for the proprietors. They would then merge with the London and York Railway. Both proposals had been absorbed into the Great Northern Railway (GNR) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained, but the original agreement was retained, and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £10,545 per year to the proprietors. This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years, plus five per cent. The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on <b>mortgages</b> amounting to £24,692 which the proprietors held, but had redeemed them by 1857. The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river, and opened on 17 October 1848.|$|E

40|$|High loan-to-value (LTV) <b>mortgage</b> are {{residential}} <b>mortgage</b> loans with LTV ratio {{greater or}} equal to 90 %. Lenders are increasingly engaged in risk-based pricing. If properly quantified, the additional credit risk taken when originating high LTV <b>mortgage</b> can be compensated by higher interest rate charged to customers. High LTV <b>mortgage</b> is regulated to meet higher capital requirement and thus have higher funding cost. Current regulation raises regulatory capital requirement of banks on all high LTV <b>mortgage</b> holdings.

Default risk is derived implicitly. Optionality of defaultable debt results in an upward sloping credit supply curve in terms of a function of interest rate with respect to LTV.
