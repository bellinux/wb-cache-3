They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> control the cloud layer but refuses to help.

5|$|The poem {{opens with}} the {{marriage}} of king Volsung's daughter Signy to Siggeir, king of the Goths. The bridal feast is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a stranger, the god Odin in disguise, who drives a sword into a tree-trunk. Though everyone tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son Sigmund is the only <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> do it. The disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli, the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs. Sigmund marries Borghild, while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild's brother, quarrels with him, and kills him. On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild, and she is turned out by Sigmund, who instead marries Hiordis. Sigmund is killed in battle, and the pregnant Hiordis is taken to live in the hall of King Elf in Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give you all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

The episode earned a Nielsen {{household}} rating of 7.3, {{meaning that it}} was seen by 7.3% of the nation's estimated households.

500|$|Brian Fairbanks {{differed}} {{in his opinion}} of Lazenby, saying that the film [...] "gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb." [...] Fairbanks also thought On Her Majesty's Secret Service to be [...] "not only the best Bond, {{it is also the}} last truly great film in the series.

500|$|James Chapman {{considers}} that Lazenby looks {{the part of}} Bond, identifying his athleticism and [...] "arrogant swagger", which [...] "convey the snobbery of the character".

Brian Fairbanks noted that [...] "OHMSS gives us a James Bond capable of vulnerability, a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> show fear and is not immune to heartbreak. Lazenby is that man, and his performance is superb". Ben Macintyre also observed {{that of all the}} Bonds, Lazenby's characterisation was closest to that of Fleming's original character.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Dolph {{starred in}} Frédéric Forestier's The Peacekeeper, playing Major Frank Cross of the US Air Force {{and the only}} <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> prevent the {{president}} being assassinated and {{with the ability to}} thwart an imminent nuclear holocaust. The threat is from a terrorist group, which has stolen the President's personal communications computer with the capability of launching the US arsenal to threaten global security. The film co-starred Michael Sarrazin, Montel Williams, Roy Scheider and Christopher Heyerdahl, and was shot on location in Montreal. The film was praised for its exciting action sequences. Doug Pratt described {{the first half of the}} film as [...] "excellent" [...] and described Dolph's character as [...] "tenacious", although Robert Cettl wrote [...] "the Peacekeeper trades on the presence of B-movie action star Dolph Lundgren, an actor who never became as popular as his action contemporaries Jean-Claude Van Damme and Steven Seagal." ...|$|E
500|$|Another song {{first issued}} on Capitol's Yesterday and Today, [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] was written {{primarily}} by Lennon, with McCartney {{claiming to have}} helped on the lyric and estimating the song as [...] "80–20" [...] to Lennon. Harrison and McCartney played dual lead-guitar parts on the recording, including an ascending riff that Riley terms [...] "magnetic... everything sticks to it". Riley describes the composition as a [...] "shaded putdown" [...] {{in the style of}} Dylan's [...] "Positively 4th Street", whereby Lennon sings to someone who has seen [...] "seven wonders" [...] yet is unable to empathise with him and his feelings of isolation. According to Gould, the song was directed at Frank Sinatra after Lennon had read a hagiographic article on the singer, in Esquire magazine, in which Sinatra was lauded as [...] "the fully emancipated male... the <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> have anything he wants".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Mickey Rapkin {{considered}} Roma to be {{the central}} character of the play, describing him as [...] "the salesman’s salesman, a shark in a sharkskin suit". Mantegna has stated that he feels Roma is not a [...] "sleazy" [...] character, but simply a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> convince customers {{to follow through on}} their dreams. Reviewing a 2012 revival at the La Jolla Playhouse, Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times compared Roma to a Giacomo Casanova-type figure, adding that [...] "when Roma puts the moves on a prospective buyer, it's as though he's making love to them". While interviewing actor Aidan Gillen, The Guardian Mark Lawson felt that Roma was an amoral character, considering him a [...] "super-schmoozer". Gillen, then portraying the character in the Apollo Theatre in London, described him as a [...] "cunt with a romantic, poetic streak".|$|E

500|$|Cassidy Freeman portrays Tess Mercer, {{the acting}} CEO of LuthorCorp, who was picked by Lex {{to run the}} company should {{something}} ever happen to him. Tess Mercer's primary goal in season eight is finding Lex, which draws her inquisitively to Clark, who she believes {{will be able to}} help her find Lex. Tess's first contact with Clark is when he pulls her from a wrecked city bus in the season eight episode [...] "Plastique"; she immediately suspects that Clark is not telling her all that he knows about Lex's disappearance. That same episode reveals that Tess is bringing together a group of meteor-infected individuals, and in [...] "Plastique" [...] she recruits Bette, a young girl with the power to create combustion on command. In the episode [...] "Prey", Tess enlists a young <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> turn himself into a shadow.

500|$|William J. Bell created Victor as a [...] "despicable, contemptible, unfaithful wife abuser". The soap opera's {{official}} website notes: [...] "Victor is loving and protective toward family and loved ones, but if crossed, or if Victor feels {{that one is}} {{not living up to}} one's full potential; then he can more than live up to the adjective that many have used to describe him ruthless." [...] The Los Angeles Times characterizes him as [...] "charming but complicated", while others publications have described him as a villain, as well as an evil, powerful and ruthless character. Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that Victor is a male chauvinist. Although he is often considered malicious, Braeden stated that [...] "Bill Bell was a very wise man" [...] and that [...] "he created someone in Victor who is a very lonely man yet also a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> be affectionate and loving and forgiving".

500|$|Beecham {{has been}} much quoted. In 1929, {{the editor of a}} music journal wrote, [...] "The stories {{gathered}} around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable.

[...] A book, Beecham Stories, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his bons mots and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, [...] "A musicologist is a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>can</b> read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, [...] "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: [...] "Nothing from Mozart?" ...|$|E
