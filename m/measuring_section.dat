40|$|William Edmond Logan assumed {{his duties}} {{as the first}} head of the Geological Survey of Canada in June 1843. Two {{previously}} overlooked field notebooks provide new insight into his first field project that summer: measurement of the “Joggins section, ” a classic Carboniferous locality in Nova Scotia. Inspired by reports of 40 -foot-tall fossil trees, Logan spent five days measuring 14 570 feet 11 inches of strata exposed along {{the shore of the}} Bay of Fundy. Widely regarded as a meticulous, bed-by-bed <b>measured</b> <b>section,</b> closer examination reveals that many thickness values were calculated using paced distances. Realizing that his <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> was too detailed for scientific journals of the day, Logan published his work in a relatively obscure government publication where it went largely unnoticed for nearly a decade. Unaware of Logan’s <b>measured</b> <b>section,</b> John William Dawson and Charles Lyell visited Joggins in 1852 and <b>measured</b> the <b>section</b> for themselves. Dawson later stated that the two sections contain only minor differences, but careful comparison shows that they have radically different descriptions and measurements for even the most dis-tinctive beds. Dawson disguised these discrepancies in post- 1855 editions of his book Acadian Geology by rewriting much of the <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and abandoning many of his own observations.

On the one hand the results of measurements in the HPP of Sedrun, Soazza and Rabiusa-Realta which all are equipped with two jet horizontal Pelton turbines are presented. For these three plants the differences between upper and lower injector efficiencies for one and two nozzle operation are discussed. In all plants the upper injector showed lower efficiencies. For one nozzle operation differences of efficiency were observed which reached from 0. 5 % in the best and up to 1. 5 % in the worst case. On the other hand a detailed study of the temperature distribution at the tailrace of the HPP of Linth-Limmern is presented and discussed with respect to efficiency.

40|$|The Digital Integrated Stratigraphy Project (DISP) aims to {{eliminate}} the stratigraphical ambiguity associated with sample position within a stratigraphical section. For example, it is often impractical or impossible to compare one author’s <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and data precisely against another author’s geographically identical <b>measured</b> <b>section</b> and data due to discrepancies in the measured thicknesses of units, variations in the assignments of litho- and chronostratigraphical terms, and/or the precise line of <b>measured</b> <b>sections</b> between authors. The DISP will provide {{a solution to this}} problem by producing a precise 3 -D digital rendering of the exposure using Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) LiDAR, Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), overlain digital photography, and GIS software to produce a cm to mm-scale accurate digital version of a given exposure. Once available online as a permanent web-based digital resource for stratigraphy, researchers will be able to access the program and digital models of scanned exposures where they will have the means to log their sample positions directly onto the digital exposure while in the field, thus allowing unambiguous stratigraphical reference for future comparison.

40|$|AbstractThe {{characteristics}} of flow resistance {{of a typical}} hydrocarbon fuel (RP- 3) flow through adiabatic horizontal miniature tubes at supercritical pressures are experimentally investigated for both laminar and turbulent flow. The experiments are conducted by using a long tube <b>measuring</b> <b>section</b> and a short tube <b>measuring</b> <b>section</b> simultaneously in order to eliminate the effect of local pressure drop. In these experiments, the temperature of RP- 3 changes from (295 to 789) K and the reduced pressure (P/Pc, Pc= 2. 33 MPa) ranges from 1 to 2. 58, the mass flux is up to 1572. 7 kg/(m 2 ·s). Test results indicate that frictional pressure drops for various supercritical pressures at the same mass flux {{can be considered as}} equal with each other when the reduced temperature Tb/Tpc 0. 95, difference appears and increases with the increase of Tb/Tpc. Additionally, the friction factor (f) of the supercritical fluid for turbulent flow has a critical value at Tb/Tpc= 1, the values of f at this point for all pressures and mass fluxes are equal with each other. Moreover, at the same mass flux, there are two corresponding friction factors for the same Re, one is in the region of Tb/Tpc 1. Finally, classical correlations of friction factor is inapplicable when Tb/Tpc> 0. 95 at supercritical pressure and a new correlation has been obtained based on the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{starting point}} for designing management improvements, particularly in irrigation areas, is to record the baseline state of the water resources, including the amount of discharge from canals. In this respect discharge measurements {{by means of the}} salt dilution method is a traditional and well-documented technique. However, this methodology can be strongly influenced by the natural streaming characteristics of the canal (e. g. laminar vs. turbulent flow) and accurate precautions must be considered in the choice of both the <b>measuring</b> <b>section</b> and the length of the measuring reach of the canal which can affect the plume shape. The knowledge of plume distribution in the measuring cross-section is of primary importance for a correct location of sampling points aimed in obtaining a reliable measurement. To obtain this, geophysical imaging of an NaCl plume from a slug-injection salt dilution test has been performed within this paper by means of cross-flow fast electric resistivity tomography (FERT) in a real case history. Direct sampling of the same plume has been also performed with a multisampling optimization technique to obtain an average value over the <b>measuring</b> <b>section</b> by means of contemporarily sampling water in nine points.
