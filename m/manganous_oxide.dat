50|$|Blue-black SnO can be {{produced}} by heating the tin(II) oxide hydrate, SnO·xH2O (x<1) precipitated when a tin(II) salt is reacted with an alkali hydroxide such as NaOH.Metastable, red SnO can be prepared by gentle heating of the precipitate produced {{by the action of}} aqueous ammonia on a tin(II) salt.SnO may be prepared as a pure substance in the laboratory, by controlled heating of tin(II) oxalate (stannous oxalate) in the absence of air or under a CO2 atmosphere. This method is also applied to the production of ferrous oxide and <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide.</b>|$|E

Material giving a similar pattern has been described from a natural occurrence in Canada, but no mineral name was assigned; the name birnessite is now proposed.

50|$|The {{association}} of Mn oxides with {{the surfaces of}} microbial cells is well known (Larsen et al., 1999). Oxidation of Mn by Pedomicrobium {{has been shown to}} occur enzymatically, and the deposition of the <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide</b> occurs on extracellular acidic polysaccharides (Sly et al., 1990a; Larsen et al., 1999). The mechanism of Mn II oxidation by Pedomicrobium is a two-step process involving adsorption of Mn through surface charges and ionic attraction, and subsequent oxidation to Mn oxide (Larsen et al., 1999). Larsen et al. (1999) showed that the Mn oxidising enzyme was located in the outer cell membranes and that enzyme activity was copper-dependent. Recent research in the laboratory has shown that the gene encoding the Mn oxidising enzyme is a putative multicopper oxidase with four copper binding sites.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of single crystalline <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide</b> was in-vestigated over the temperature range of 900 ~ 176 while in thermodynamic equil ibrium with oxygen partial pressures of 10 - 6 - 10 - 2 i atm. Results indicated that MnO may be either p- or n-type. Slopes of 1 / 6 and [...] 1 / 6 are {{obtained from the}} log ~ vs. log Po 2 data for the p- and n-type regions, respectively. Thermo-gravimetric measurements at thermodynamic equil ibrium support he evidence of the electron mobility being much greater than that for electron holes in MnO. The enthalpies of formation of nonstoichiometric disorder and activated enthalpy of movement of electron holes in p-type MnO were determined to be [...] 18 and 12 kcal/mole, respectively. The bandgap of MnO was calculated from the minima of the log ~ vs. log po 2 data to be 52. 8 kcal/mole (2. 3 eV).

40|$|Complex-derived iron-cobalt alloy {{catalysts}} {{have been}} studied under conditions similar to those normally prevailing in industry. Despite reports in the literature indicating unusual selectivities with iron-cobalt alloy catalysts under atmospheric pressure conditions, no deviations from normal selectivity behaviour have been observed when studied under steady-state conditions and pressures of 2. 0 MPa. However, when promoted with <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide</b> or supported on silica-alumina, substantial deviations from Anderson-Schulz-Flory statistics occur {{during the first few}} days on stream. These deviations gradually disappear with increasing time on stream leading to normal selectivity behaviour. The unsupported catalysts displayed remarkably high activity and selectivity maintenance, in contrast to supported catalysts, which show substantial oscillations in the catalytic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The self {{diffusion}} of ~<zsMn in monocrystal l ine <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide</b> {{has been studied}} in order to investigate the predominant lattice defect in MnO 1 + 2 in the low oxygen pressure gion of the phase field. In the low oxygen pressure region of the MnO 1 +x phase field the mater ia l exhibits apparent n- type be-havior. A graph of log DTMn VS. log Po 2 for a temperature of 1032 ~ exhibits a constant slope of-{- 1 / 5. 4 for 10 - 18 ~ po 2 ~ 10 -s atm.

40|$|A {{total of}} 442 {{weanling}} pigs (initial age and wt of 22 d and 14. 4 lb, respectively) was {{used on a}} commercial farm in northeast Kansas to evaluate growth performance with diets containing a chelated trace mineral premix or an inorganic trace mineral premix. Minerals evaluated in the premixes provided 16. 5 ppm Cu, 165 ppm Fe, 40 ppm Mn, and 165 ppm Zn. For the inorganic trace mineral treatment, the mineral sources were copper sulfate, ferrous sulfate, <b>manganous</b> <b>oxide,</b> and zinc oxide. The chelated trace mineral premix had the following fractions of these minerals provided as amino acid chelates: 109. 7 % of Cu, 75. 8 % of Fe, 78. 1 % of Mn, and 47. 0 % of Zn with the balance coming from the previous inorganic sources to make diets similar in added trace mineral content. All diets also contained copper sulfate, providing an additional 188 ppm Cu. Pigs fed the chelated trace mineral had increased average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and lower feed efficiency (F/G) from d 0 to 7 postweaning. No differences occurred between treatments in ADG or ADFI from d 7 to 14. For this same period, pigs fed the inorganic trace minerals had lower F/G than pigs fed the chelated trace minerals. For the entire Phase I period (d 0 to 14), pigs fed the chelated trace minerals had greater ADFI with no difference in ADG or F/G. No differences occurred in ADG or FIG for the Phase II period (d 14 to 28). However, pigs fed the inorganic trace minerals had increased ADFI (P>. 02). For the entire nursery period (d 0 to 28), no differences occurred in ADG, ADFI, and F/G between pigs fed either chelated or inorganic trace minerals. Based on the improved performance observed, chelated trace minerals {{may have been more}} available, which benefitted the weanling pig during the stressful first week postweaning. However, for the entire nursery period, based on this single study, no significant differences occurred in growth performance for pigs fed either trace mineral source...|$|E
