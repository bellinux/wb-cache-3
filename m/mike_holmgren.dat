5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Lerner hired former Packers coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> as team president, moving Keenan {{to chief}} {{financial}} officer. A month later, the owner hired Eagles front-office executive Tom Heckert as general manager. Heckert replaced former general manager George Kokinis, who was fired the previous November. The new management said Mangini would return for a second season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17–0 at halftime when head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> benched {{starting}} quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre. Favre was tackled and the completion went for −7yards. The Packers lost the game 31–3, chalking up only 106yards passing.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the stadium}} gained {{national}} attention when the visiting New York Giants committed 11 false start penalties. Seahawks head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> attributed the penalties to the enthusiasm and {{noise from the}} crowd. He dedicated the ball {{used to make the}} game-winning field goal to the fans, and it is now displayed at the stadium. The Giants' general manager, Ernie Accorsi, asked an NFL senior vice president whether the Seahawks had broadcast artificial crowd noise over the public address system during this game. The NFL sent a memorandum early in the 2006 season about such complaints and sent officials to monitor two games. Holmgren denied the allegations, and the crowd responded by being even louder than usual when the Giants returned to CenturyLink Field. Since 2005 the Seahawks have tracked the number of false starts committed by visiting teams and display the statistic on a scoreboard to motivate the crowd. As of 2013, the stadium has had a league-high number of false starts since. In preparation for 2005–06 NFC Championship Game at CenturyLink Field, the Carolina Panthers practiced with the recorded sounds of jet engines in the background to prepare for the volume of the crowd.|$|E
5|$|Pointing {{out that}} Cleveland already had three quarterbacks, Browns {{president}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> said McCoy would likely not play {{his first season}} with the team {{in order to develop}} him as an NFL quarterback. However, due to injuries to starting quarterback Jake Delhomme and back-up Seneca Wallace, McCoy made his first career start against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week 6. McCoy completed 23 of 33 passes for 281 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions in the Browns' loss. He also scrambled four times for 22 yards. McCoy started the following week against the New Orleans Saints and contributed to the surprising victory over the defending Super Bowl champions 30-17 at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. On November 7, McCoy made his third consecutive start and led the Browns to another upset victory, this time against the New England Patriots 34-14. He then started again on November 14 against the New York Jets; however the Browns lost in overtime with McCoy throwing for 205 yards and a touchdown. McCoy injured his ankle in week 11 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and missed the next three weeks before returning to start under center against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 15. McCoy threw for 243 yards and 2 touchdowns with no interceptions, but Cleveland lost. In each of the final two games against division rivals Baltimore and Pittsburgh, McCoy threw 3 interceptions as the Browns lost both games. McCoy finished the season with 6 touchdowns against 9 interceptions.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time ever since {{becoming}} the head coach of the Packers, <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> was coaching against his former team where he was the Offensive Coordinator and Quarterbacks coach for six seasons.|$|E
25|$|The Packers' {{performance}} {{throughout the}} 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s {{led to a}} shakeup, with Ron Wolf hired as GM and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season. In 1992, Wolf hired San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> as the Packers' new head coach.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2008 season, then-head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> stated that 2008 would be his final season before retiring. On December 30, 2008, two days after the season ended, Holmgren officially retired and stepped down as head coach. Jim Mora, the team's assistant head coach and defensive backs coach, was officially selected as his replacement on January 13, 2009. The retirement and Jim Mora's accession had been originally announced on January 22, 2008.|$|E
25|$|This Super Bowl {{featured}} two {{clubs that}} were considered losing teams {{for much of}} the late 1980s. The Packers' fortunes turned after head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> and quarterback Brett Favre joined the team in 1992. The Patriots' rise began in 1993 when Bill Parcells was hired as head coach, and the team drafted quarterback Drew Bledsoe. Under their respective head coaches and quarterbacks, Green Bay posted an NFC-best 13–3 regular season record in 1996, while New England advanced to their second Super Bowl after recording an 11–5 record.|$|E
25|$|The team's biggest {{rival in}} the AAFC was the San Francisco 49ers, though this has cooled {{and in some}} cases turned into a {{friendly}} relationship, as the Browns now play in AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> having started his NFL career in San Francisco. Also, 49ers owners John York & Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, Ohio 60 miles southeast of Cleveland. Former long-time veteran placekicker and fan favorite, Phil Dawson, signed with the 49ers in 2014, along with backup QB Colt McCoy.|$|E
25|$|All {{that changed}} when <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> became the Packers {{head coach in}} 1992. During his first year, the team {{improved}} to a 9–7 regular season record, barely missing the playoffs. One of the significant players on the 1992 Packers team was second-year quarterback Brett Favre, who spent his rookie season as a third-string quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons. During a September 20, 1992 game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Favre replaced injured starter Don Majkowski and proceeded to lead the team to a comeback victory. Afterwards, Favre became the starter {{for the rest of}} that season and held that position with the Packers until his purported retirement and subsequent conditional trade to the New York Jets in 2008 (followed by a departure for Minnesota in 2009).|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the Seahawks {{made their}} biggest {{coaching}} hire with {{the appointment of}} Green Bay Packer head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren.</b> Coming off his success with the Green Bay Packers, Holmgren was given the dual role of general manager and head coach. The hiring brought instant credibility to the franchise as under Holmgren's guidance, the Seahawks won their second division title and first playoff berth since 1988. That year included a memorable 24-7 win over Holmgren's former team, the Green Bay Packers on Monday Night Football but despite a strong 8-2 start, the Seahawks lost 5 of their last 6 to close out the regular season. This skid continued on into the playoffs as the Seahawks lost the final game in the Kingdome 20-17 to Dan Marino and the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Wild Card round; the game proved to be Marino's only career road playoff win.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{heading into}} the 2010 season with an overall sense of optimism, the Browns started off poorly. They set an NFL record when they lost their first three games after leading in the fourth quarter. They finally won their first game against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 4. However, both Delhomme and Wallace injured their ankles over the first five games, forcing Colt McCoy to start in week 6 against the Steelers, though <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> stated he would sit and learn the entire season. Though McCoy lost his first NFL start against the Steelers, {{he was able to}} win the {{following}} week when the Browns upset the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. With this victory, the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl Champions three years in a row, becoming the seventh NFL team to achieve this feat. The Browns continued this positive streak by outplaying the New England Patriots for a 34–14 victory in their next game. However, they lost to the New York Jets in overtime the following week, despite a late fourth-quarter, game-tying touchdown drive by McCoy. On January 3, 2011, after losing four games in a row to end the season, Holmgren and the Browns decided to fire head coach Eric Mangini, who posted a record of 10–22 in his two seasons as head coach. Eleven days later, Holmgren signed St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur to become the new head coach, and former Buffalo Bills and Chicago Bears head coach Dick Jauron as their defensive coordinator.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Wolf {{replaced}} Rhodes with Mike Sherman. Sherman {{had never}} been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as GM to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers President Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both GM and head coach.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Packers went 11–5 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first-round of the NFC playoffs. It was {{the fourth}} {{consecutive}} year these teams had met in the playoffs, and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss {{would result in the}} dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when Terrell Owens caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays appeared to confirm these sentiments, and the next season the NFL re instituted an instant replay system. In the end, this game {{turned out to be the}} end of an era in Green Bay. Days later <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> left the Packers to become Vice President, General Manager and Head Coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000).|$|E
500|$|Wolf was the Packers Executive Vice President and General Manager. [...] He is {{credited}} with bringing the Packers back to its winning ways. [...] Wolf signed <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> and traded for Brett Favre, a combination that led to many successful seasons.|$|E
500|$|Days later, he got {{still another}} chance when the Seattle Seahawks signed {{him to a}} one-year contract, [...] {{planning}} to let him develop slowly (as the Buccaneers had done) to allow his still-injured wrist time to heal. He attended the team's spring minicamps and seemed upbeat about his new team, but then abruptly retired {{at the age of}} 26 just {{before the start of the}} Seahawks' 2002 training camp, offering no explanation at first. [...] Seahawk coach and general manager <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> told the media Leaf's wrist didn't bother him with either the Cowboys or the Seahawks.|$|E
500|$|Four {{different}} {{coaches have}} won NFL championships with the Packers: Earl Louis [...] "Curly" [...] Lambeau in , , , 1936, 1939, and 1944; Vince Lombardi in 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, and 1967; <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> in 1996; and Mike McCarthy in 2010. Lambeau is the franchise leader in career games (334) and career wins (209), while Lombardi {{has the best}} winning percentage (.754). [...] Ray (Scooter) McLean has the worst winning percentage (.077). [...] Four Packers coaches— Lambeau, Lombardi, Bart Starr and Forrest Gregg— have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although Starr and Gregg are recognized as players. [...] Lombardi and Lindy Infante have both been named the league's {{coach of the year}} by major news organizations.|$|E
500|$|The 1997 state {{referendum}} {{stated that}} the stadium would feature a natural grass surface, but FieldTurf {{was not an option}} when the stadium was originally presented to voters according to the Public Stadium Authority. Seahawks management reconsidered surface after the Seahawks played on FieldTurf at Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. Artificial turf was installed because it was easier to maintain than natural grass. The potential damage to a natural grass field caused by Seattle's frequent rain also made the surface an appealing option. In order to keep a grass surface robust under heavy football use during late fall and early winter rains, a $1.8million irrigation and heating system would have been required. The coach of the Seahawks at the time, <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren,</b> said FieldTurf installation was the right decision and stated that [...] "the players love it, and I think this surface will offer a better product on the field for the fans." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the contest, Reggie White was so visibly upset, {{he started}} {{shouting}} at television crews who were filming {{him on the}} sidelines. This was the third consecutive year that Dallas eliminated Green Bay from the playoffs (All three games were played in Dallas).

[...] "I'm tired of getting lessons." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 21, 2009, as Mangini's {{first season}} {{was coming to}} a close, former Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> was hired as team {{president}} and was given authority over the team's football operations. This hire was made after Browns owner Randy Lerner announced he wished {{to bring in a}} [...] "serious, credible leader" [...] to steer the team in the right direction. After much public speculation by the media that Holmgren and Mangini {{would not be able to}} coexist, Holmgren announced the retention of Mangini and the entire coaching staff for the 2010 season. The following week, Holmgren hired former Philadelphia Eagles general manager Tom Heckert to become the new GM for the Browns.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> and the Seattle Seahawks {{played the}} Green Bay Packers {{for a chance}} to play in the NFC Championship game. The Packers beat the Seahawks 42–20. [...] Ryan Grant fumbled twice in the first 69seconds, the {{turnovers}} led to an early 14–0 Seahawk lead. Grant redeemed himself by running for 201yards and three touchdowns – both franchise play-off records (Ahman Green had run for 156yards in a 2004 playoff game). Brett Favre went 18-for-23 for 173yards and three touchdowns, two to Greg Jennings, joining Joe Montana as the only passers in league history with 5,000yards in postseason play. Other Packer team records set during the game include most points in a game with 42, most touchdowns with six, and most first downs with 25.|$|E
2500|$|More famously a {{nickname}} {{for the city}} than its football field, [...] "Titletown, USA" [...] became popularized in 1961, even before Vince Lombardi won any of his championships. At the 1961 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants, which the Packers won 37–0, fans hung up signs around the stadium that read Welcome to Titletown, USA. Then-Giants quarterback Y. A. Tittle joked that the honor was for him, just that his name was misspelled. By the mid-60s, Titletown, USA was registered as a trademark of the Green Bay Packers, Inc. Lambeau Field has been home to seven NFL world championship seasons, five under Lombardi, one under <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> and one under Mike McCarthy, surpassing the six world championship seasons witnessed by its predecessor, City Stadium, under Curly Lambeau.|$|E
2500|$|Seahawks {{head coach}} <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> fueled the debate upon {{returning}} to Seattle, saying during a Seahawks rally, [...] "We {{knew it was}} going to be tough going up against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't know we were going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." [...] Al Michaels commented during a Sunday Night Football game a few months later, [...] "The fact that Holmgren was not fined for that statement speaks volumes to me." [...] Michaels explained he was alluding to Holmgren's need to [...] "blow off steam", but also suggested a perceived admission by the NFL that something went wrong in that game. Both Michaels and John Madden noted Seattle's mistakes, such as poor clock management at the end of each half.|$|E
2500|$|On December 20, 1996, A {{head coach}} R. C. Slocum {{promoted}} Sherman to offensive coordinator to replace dismissed Steve Ensminger. Months later, Sherman resigned {{to start his}} professional coaching career as the assistant offensive line and tight ends coach for the Green Bay Packers. When asked by a reporter why he chose to accept the Green Bay job, Sherman responded: [...] "There is absolutely no other college job I would have left Texas A for and only one professional job that I've ever had any interest in and that being the Green Bay Packers. I've enjoyed the small-town atmosphere of College Station for my family, and Green Bay offers that same atmosphere. If the truth be told, {{there is not a}} whole lot of difference between an `Aggie' and a `Cheesehead." [...] He served the position for the 199798 seasons. After Packers head coach <b>Mike</b> <b>Holmgren</b> resigned to accept the Seattle Seahawks head coach position, Holmgren hired Sherman to become the offensive coordinator for the 1999 season.|$|E
