40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to select the proper model for genetic parameter estimation, to estimate genetic parameters, and to predict breeding values for litter size in most common sheep breeds in Czech Republic. A total of 143 896 lambing records from 1990 to 2012 were analysed. Variance components and genetic parameters for litter size were estimated separately for each breed using the BLUP animal model with repeatability. The basic model equation contained ewe age as a fixed effect and random effects of contemporary group, permanent environment and direct additive genetic effect of the animal. Modifications of the basic model were examined when various combinations of mating effects were included (contemporary group of ewes during mating (harem), additive genetic and permanent environmental effect of service ram). Estimates of phenotype variance increased across breeds (0. 236 for Šumava to 0. 779 for Romanov) with increasing breed average for number of lambs per litter. Variance component estimates for permanent environmental effect of the ewe were low (0. 0001 to 0. 0262). The variance of common environment of contemporary group (from 0. 0223 to 0. 1309) had bigger influence on the total variability of litter size in almost all studied breeds then additive genetic variance (from 0. 0146 to 0. 0587). The lowest heritability and repeatability estimates were for the Šumava (h 2 = 0. 0619; w 2 = 0. 0823) and Romney breeds (h 2 = 0. 0626; w 2 = 0. 0811); while the highest were for Merinolandschaf (h 2 = 0. 1091; w 2 = 0. 1129). The effect of service ram ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 02 of phenotypic variance in Šumava sheep, in Romanov sheep it was from 0. 05 to 0. 10, and in Suffolk sheep it was from 0. 04 to 0. 05. Including effects of <b>mating</b> (<b>service</b> sire, harem, and/or ram´s permanent environmental effect) in the model decreased deviance information criterion, what means that these models are more proper than the basic one. Results from present study demonstrate that genetic parameters did differ among the investigated breeds, which should be taken into account in breeding value estimation. The service rams have low but a clearly detectable influence on litter size of their mates. Genetic parameter estimates indicate that direct selection on the service ram effect could increase litter size and achieve genetic gain through ram selection...|$|E

The unsatisfactory wear properties of various seal and propeller shaft material combinations on many of our submarines, particularly those of the deep-submergence class and those where the trend is towards the larger shaft diameters, prompted this investigation. While the fault may well lay in design, this paper approaches the problem as one in boundary lubrication; attempting to find the best combination of seal material and <b>mating</b> <b>service</b> in this particular service condition from a wear viewpoint. An additional aim was to attempt some correlation between wear, friction, and the physical properties involved. Results from this latter goal could well find application in the selection of steam turbine seals as well as those employed in the aircraft industry. The approach used by the authors was first to evaluate potential seal materials from different families in combination with various corrosion-resistant shaft materials. This work was done on the Kinetic Oiliness Testing Machine (KOTM) and the results are presented in Part I of this investigation. The testing involved obtaining friction and wear data on carbons and laminated phenolics, as well as teflon, in combination with chrome, bronze G, and stellite # 6 „ Synthetic sea water was the primary lubricant, although the effect of wetting agents was also checked. Results here conclusively demonstrated the superiority of commercial grade carbon seals, for the wear of the laminated phenolics was excessive, and transition temperature effects were experienced with the straight teflon samples at roughly 250 °F ambient temperature. While successful as a screening tool, the KOTM proved inadequate for wear measurements of carbons; and for this reason the pin on disc geometric configuration was utilized in Part II. This section involved a more extensive analysis of the friction and wear properties of carbons in combination with five potential shaft materials. Twenty-one commercial grade carbons in all were tested, the number representing a wide cross section in graphite content 8 hardness 9 impregnation and other physical properties. The effect of wetting agents, up to 50 $ by volume, are also presented. Results of this phase conclusively demonstrated the superiority of chrome as a mating surface for carbon, its high heat of reaction and resultant resistance to carbide formation giving reasonably low friction and wear values. Several carbons were grouped close to the top when all were compared from a wear and friction viewpoint, but one, Carbon 1, was shown to be the superior material of those tested in this boundary lubrication problem. The effect of wetting agents contradicted our original assumption, in that concentrations up to 50 $ by volume gave higher frictional values than that experienced with synthetic sea water.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} and analyze a {{framework}} for selfevolving autonomic services in a wireless nomadic environment. We present a disconnected network architecture, where users mobility is exploited to achieve a scalable behaviour, and communication is based on localized peer-to-peer interactions among neighboring nodes. Service management is achieved by introducing autonomic services, whose operations {{are based on a}} distributed evolution process. The latter relies on the concept of mating, i. e., the exchange of information (e. g., code, parameters, data) among service users, which collaborate to enhance their fitness, defined as the ability of the actual service to fullfill the environmental features. The core of the evolution process is given by the <b>service</b> <b>mating</b> policy, which defines the way the running code should be modified when mating with other users. We introduce a general framework for analyzing <b>service</b> <b>mating</b> policies and exploit results from martingales theory to study their convergence properties. In particular, we introduce two optimal policies, clone-and-mutate and combine-and-mutate, and analyze their convergence times through extensive numerical simulations, addressing the impact of various parameters (number of nodes, users speed, mobility pattern). ...|$|R

40|$|Field {{data from}} Australian Angus herds {{were used to}} {{investigate}} 2 methods of analyzing uncertain binary responses for success or failure at first insemination. A linear mixed model that included herd, year, and month of mating as fixed effects; unrelated service sire, additive animal, and residual as random effects; and linear and quadratic effects of age at mating as covariates was used to analyze binary data. An average gestation length (GL) derived from artificial insemination data was used to assign an insemination date to females <b>mated</b> to natural <b>service</b> sires. Females that deviated from this average GL led to uncertain binary responses. Two analyses were carried out: 1) a threshold model fitted to uncertain binary data, ignoring uncertainty (M 1); and 2) a threshold model fitted to uncertain binary data, accounting for uncertainty via fuzzy logic classification (M 2). There was practically no difference between point estimates obtained from M 1 and M 2 for service sire and herd variance; however, when uncertain binary data were analyzed ignoring uncertainty (M 1), additive variance and heritability estimates were greater than with M 2. Pearson correlations indicated that no major re-ranking would be expected for service sire effects and animal breeding values using M 1 and M 2. Given {{the results of the}} current study, a threshold model contemplating uncertainty is suggested for noisy binary data to avoid bias when estimating genetic parameters...|$|R

40|$|Modeling cattle {{production}} systems: integrating components and their interactions {{in the development}} of simulation models C. U. Leon-Velarde 1 and R. Quiroz 2 Several simulation models have been built to analyze the complex components of {{cattle production}} systems. The modelers usually tend to consider the overall complexity and resources of the systems such as investment, labor, feed, herd structure, and its dynamics. A few models also include physiological status of animals, as well as genetic and health parameters. Based on various models, this paper examines the main components considered to build subroutines to simulate intensive or grazing cattle production systems. The mathematical equations explaining the relationships among and within components can be written in different programming languages (FORTRAN, C++, and spreadsheets, among others). We also describe how models for individual animals or herd can be developed. In the first type of model, each animal within a herd is simulated, considering its productive life cycle and based on nutritional requirements for growth, reproduction, milk production and health. The herd model considers groups of animals instead. Specific management decisions accounted for include age at first service, number of days to <b>mating,</b> number of <b>services,</b> culling based on age and reproduction criteria, and effects on birth rate and mortality. These models can be validated, within a desired precision, using information obtained from commercial farms and/or from production, reproduction, genetics and economic data reported in the literature. The models can be generally used in various management situations as well as in training, extension, and research programs in which various scenarios are considered to help decision making in cattle systems...|$|R
