In this situation, although the planes being rolled over the surface are tangent planes in a naive sense, {{the notion of a}} tangent space is really an infinitesimal notion, whereas the planes, as affine subspaces of , are infinite in extent. However these affine planes all have a <b>marked</b> <b>point,</b> the point of contact with the surface, and they are tangent to the surface at this point. The confusion therefore arises because an affine space with a <b>marked</b> <b>point</b> can be identified with its tangent space at that point. However, the parallel transport defined by rolling does not fix this origin: it is affine rather than linear; the linear parallel transport can be recovered by applying a translation.|$|E

40|$|The general problem {{this thesis}} is {{concerned}} with is that of studying the subvarieties of the moduli space Mg,n corresponding to curves with extra automorphisms. A typical curve with <b>marked</b> <b>points</b> has no automorphisms; but some do, depending upon the choice of curves and position of <b>marked</b> <b>points.</b> This gives us certain subvarieties in the moduli space. For Riemann surfaces, these subvarieties are characterized by specifying a finite group of mapping-classes whose action on a curve is fixed topologically. This thesis builds upon previous work by González-Díez, Harvey and Schneps. González-Díez and Harvey [GH 92] considered these irreducible subvarieties for genus g ≥ 2 curves without <b>marked</b> <b>points</b> over the complex numbers, where they have studied the coarse moduli space for surfaces with a specified automorphism group. Cornalba [Cor 87] gives a complete classification of the irreducible subvarieties corresponding to the curves whose automorphism group contains a fixed cyclic subgroup of prime order, in the case g ≥ 1, n = 0 over the complex numbers. Later Schneps [Sch 02 a] considered the situation of genus 0 with n <b>marked</b> <b>points,</b> and genus 1 with n = 1 or 2 <b>marked</b> <b>points,</b> corresponding to the curves having a cyclic group in its automorphism group, over the complex numbers. In this thesis, we consider more general cases in higher genus and in characteristic p, with n <b>marked</b> <b>points,</b> corresponding to the marked curves whose automorphism group contains a fixed cyclic subgroup acting in a fixed way. ...|$|R

6000|$|Newport, with {{repatriation}} accepted, {{would have}} been on many grounds inevitable, I think--as it was to remain inevitable for several years, and this quite apart from William's having to paint; since if I spoke just now of the sweep of our view, from over the water, of a continent, or well-nigh, waiting to receive us, the eligibility of its innumerable sites was a matter much more of our simplified, our almost distressfully uninvolved and unconnected state than of the inherent virtue of this, that or the other particular group of local conditions. Our parents had for us no definite project but to be liberally [...] "good"--in other words so good that the presumption of our being so would literally operate anywhere and anyhow, would really amount in itself to a sort of situated state, a sufficient prime position, and leave other circumstances comparatively irrelevant. What would infallibly have occurred at the best, however, was what did punctually happen--its having to be definitely gathered that, though we might apparently be good, as I say, almost on any ground, there was but one place in which we should even at a restricted pitch be well: Newport imposed itself at that period to so remarkable a degree as the one right residence, in all our great country, for those tainted, under whatever attenuations, with the quality and the effect of detachment. The effect of detachment was the fact of the experience of Europe. Detachment might of course have come from many causes, but it truly came in most cases but from one, though that a fairly merciless: it came from the experience of Europe, and I think was on the whole regarded as--what it could only have been in the sphere of intimacy and secrecy felt to be--without an absolute remedy. As comparatively remedial Newport none the less figured, and this for sundry reasons into the detail of which I needn't go. Its rare distinction and precious attribute was that, being a watering-place, a refuge from summer heats, it had also, were the measure considerably stretched, possibilities of hibernation. We could, under stress, brave there the period from November to June; and it was to be under stress not to know what else to do. That was the pinch to which Europe reduced you; insidiously, fatally disconnected, you could but make the best, as a penalty, of the one <b>marked</b> <b>point</b> of reattachment. The philosophy of all of which was that to confess to disconnection was to confess by the same stroke to leisure--which involved also an admission, however rueful at once and deprecatory, of what might still at that time pass in our unregenerate country for something in the nature of [...] "means." [...] You had had the means, that is, to become, so awkwardly, detached--for you might then do that cheaply; but the whole basis of the winter life there, of that spare semblance of the Brighton life, the Folkestone life, the Bath or the Cheltenham or the Leamington life, was that your occupation or avocation should be vague enough; or that you shouldn't in other words be, like everyone you might know save a dozen or so at the most, in business. I remember well how when we were all young together we had, under pressure of the American ideal in that matter, then so rigid, felt it tasteless and even humiliating that the head of our little family was not in business, and that even among our relatives on each side we couldn't so much as name proudly anyone who was--with the sole exception of our maternal uncle Robertson Walsh, who looked, ever so benevolently, after our father's [...] "affairs," [...] happily for us. Such had never been the case with the father of any boy of our acquaintance; the business in which the boy's father gloriously was stood forth inveterately as the very first note of our comrade's impressiveness. We had no note of that sort to produce, and I perfectly recover the effect of my own repeated appeal to our parent for some presentable account of him that would prove us respectable. Business alone was respectable--if one meant by it, that is, the calling of a lawyer, a doctor or a minister (we never spoke of clergymen) as well; I think that if we had had the Pope among us we should have supposed the Pope in business, just as I remember my friend Simpson's telling me crushingly, at one of our New York schools, on my hanging back with the fatal truth about our credentials, that the author of his being (we spoke no more of [...] "governors" [...] than we did of [...] "parsons") was in the business of a stevedore. That struck me as a great card to play--the word was fine and mysterious; so that [...] "What shall we tell them you are, don't you see?" [...] could but become on our lips at home a more constant appeal. It seemed wantonly to be prompted for our father, and indeed greatly to amuse him, that he should put us off with strange unheard-of attributions, such as would have made us ridiculous in our special circles; his [...] "Say I'm a philosopher, say I'm a seeker for truth, say I'm a lover of my kind, say I'm an author of books if you like; or, best of all, just say I'm a Student," [...] saw us so very little further. Abject it certainly appeared to be reduced to the [...] "student" [...] plea; and I must have lacked even the confidence of my brother Bob, who, challenged, in my hearing and the usual way, was ready not only with the fact that our parent [...] "wrote," [...] but with the further fact that he had written Lectures and Miscellanies James. I think that when we settled awhile at Newport {{there was no one there}} who had written but Mr. Henry T. Tuckerman, a genial and graceful poet of the Artless Age, as it might still be called in spite of Poe and Hawthorne and Longfellow and Lowell, the most characteristic works of the first and the two last of whom had already appeared; especially as those most characteristic of Mr. Tuckerman referred themselves to a past sufficiently ample to have left that gentleman with a certain deafness and a glossy wig and a portly presence and the reputation, positively, of the most practised and desired of diners-out. He was to be recognised at once as a social value on a scene not under that rubric densely peopled; he constituted indeed such a note as would help to keep others of the vague definability in countenance. Clearly indeed it might happen that an association of vaguenesses would arrive in time, by fondly cleaving together, at the semblance of a common identity; the nature of the case then demanding, however, that they should be methodically vague, take their stand on it and work it for all it was worth. That in truth was made easy by the fact that what I have called our common disconnectedness positively projected and proclaimed a void; disconnected from business we could only be connected with the negation of it, which had as yet no affirmative, no figurative side. This probably would come; figures, in the void, would one by one spring up; but what would be thus required for them was that the void should be ample and, as it were, established. Not to be afraid of it they would have to feel it clear of everything and everyone they knew in the air actually peopled.|$|E
