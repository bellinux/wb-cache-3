50|$|If <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> {{is present}} in the {{universe}} with sufficient abundance then its gravitational effects can be detected. Because <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> is analogous to ordinary matter, it is then to be expected that a fraction of the <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> exists in the form of mirror galaxies, mirror stars, mirror planets etc. These objects can be detected using gravitational microlensing. One would also expect that some fraction of stars have mirror objects as their companion. In such cases one should be able to detect periodic Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the star. There are some hints that such effects may already have been observed.|$|E

Here we confront this theory with the most recent experimental data, {{paying attention to the}} various known systematic uncertainties, in quenching factor, detector resolution, galactic rotational velocity and velocity dispersion. We perform a detailed analysis of the DAMA and CoGeNT experiments assuming a negligible channeling fraction and find that the data can be fully explained within the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> framework. We also show that the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> candidate can explain recent data from the CDMS/Ge, EdelweissII and CRESSTII experiments and we point out ways in which the theory can be further tested in the near future.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that magnetic fields prevent mirror particles from entering the galactic disk, thereby disfavoring the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> explanation of the dark matter direct detection experiments. We show that mirror particle self interactions will typically randomize the directions of mirror particles on length scales much shorter than their gyroradius. This means that mirror particles are free to enter the galactic disk and consequently <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> remains consistent with all experiments and observations.

50|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>matter,</b> if it exists, {{would need}} to {{interact}} weakly with ordinary matter. This is because the forces between mirror particles are mediated by mirror bosons. With {{the exception of the}} graviton, none of the known bosons can be identical to their mirror partners. The only way <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> can interact with ordinary matter via forces other than gravity is via kinetic mixing of mirror bosons with ordinary bosons or via the exchange of Holdom particles. These interactions can only be very weak. Mirror particles have therefore been suggested as candidates for the inferred dark matter in the universe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>matter</b> {{could also}} be {{responsible}} for the GZK puzzle. Topological defects in the mirror sector could produce mirror neutrinos which can oscillate to ordinary neutrinos. Another possible way to evade the GZK bound is via neutron-mirror neutron oscillations.|$|E
40|$|We {{point out}} that <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> predicts low energy (E_R <∼ 2 keV) {{electron}} recoils from mirror electron scattering as well as nuclear recoils from mirror ion scattering. The former effect is examined and applied to the recently released low energy electron recoil data from the CDMS collaboration. We speculate that the sharp rise in electron recoils seen in CDMS below 2 keV {{might be due to}} mirror electron scattering and show that the parameters suggested by the data are roughly consistent with the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> explanation of the annual modulation signal observed in the DAMA/Libra and DAMA/NaI experiments. Thus, the CDMS data offer tentative evidence supporting the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> explanation of the DAMA experiments, which can be more rigorously checked by future low energy electron recoil measurements.

40|$|AbstractRecently, the CDMS/Si {{experiment}} {{has observed}} a low energy excess {{of events in}} their dark matter search. In light of this new result we update the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> explanation of the direction detection experiments. We find that the DAMA, CoGeNT, CRESST-II and CDMS/Si data can be simultaneously explained by halo ∼Fe′ interactions provided that vrot≈ 200 km/s. Other parameter space is also possible. Forthcoming experiments, including CDMSlite, CDEX, COUPP, LUX, C- 4, … {{should be able to}} further scrutinize <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> and closely related hidden sector models in the near future...|$|R
50|$|However, in {{particle}} physics, {{the theory}} shares similarities with the <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> of hidden sectors addressing CP violation.

5000|$|If {{hypothetical}} <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> exists, Zurab Silagadze {{proposes that}} demons can be envisaged, [...] "which can act like perpetuum mobiles {{of the second}} kind: extract heat energy from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated {{from the rest of}} ordinary world. Yet the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror) sector of the world by emitting mirror photons." ...|$|E
50|$|If <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> {{does exist}} in large abundances in the {{universe}} and if it interacts with ordinary matter via photon-mirror photon mixing, then this could be detected in dark matter direct detection experiments such as DAMA/NaI and its successor DAMA/LIBRA.

40|$|The CoGeNT {{collaboration}} {{has recently}} reported a rising low energy spectrum in their ultra low noise germanium detector.

40|$|<b>Mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> {{offers a}} {{framework}} {{to explain the}} existing dark matter direct detection experiments, including the impressive DAMA annual modulation signal. Here we examine the implications of <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> for experiments like CDMSII/Ge and XENON 10 which feature higher recoil energy threshold than the DAMA NaI experiments. We show that the two events seen in the CDMSII/Ge experiment {{are consistent with the}} interactions of the anticipated heavy ∼ Fe' component. This interpretation of the CDMSII/Ge events is a natural one given that a) <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> predicts an event rate which is sharply falling with respect to recoil energy and b) that the two observed events are in the low energy region near threshold. Importantly this interpretation of the CDMSII events can be checked by on-going and future experiments, and we hereby predict that the bulk of the events will be in the E_R <∼ 18 keV region.

50|$|In another context, <b>mirror</b> <b>matter</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to give rise to an effective Higgs mechanism responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking. In such a scenario, mirror fermions have masses {{on the order of}} 1 TeV since they interact with an additional interaction, while some of the mirror bosons are identical to the ordinary gauge bosons.

50|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>matter</b> {{could have}} been diluted to unobservably low densities during the {{inflation}} epoch. Sheldon Glashow has shown that if at some high energy scale particles exist which interact strongly with both ordinary and mirror particles, radiative corrections {{will lead to a}} mixing between photons and mirror photons. This mixing has the effect of giving mirror electric charges a very small ordinary electric charge. Another effect of photon-mirror photon mixing is that it induces oscillations between positronium and mirror positronium. Positronium could then turn into mirror positronium and then decay into mirror photons.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mirror</b> dark <b>matter,</b> where {{dark matter}} resides in a hidden sector exactly {{isomorphic}} {{to the standard}} model, can be probed via direct detection experiments by both nuclear and electron recoils if the kinetic mixing interaction exists. In fact, the kinetic mixing interaction {{appears to be a}} prerequisite for consistent small scale structure: <b>Mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> halos around spiral galaxies are dissipative - losing energy via dark photon emission. This ongoing energy loss requires a substantial energy input, which can be sourced from ordinary supernovae via kinetic mixing induced processes in the supernova's core. Astrophysical considerations thereby give a lower limit on the kinetic mixing strength, and indeed lower limits on both nuclear and electron recoil rates in direct detection experiments can be estimated. We show here that potentially all of the viable parameter space will be probed in forthcoming XENON experiments including LUX and XENON 1 T. Thus, we anticipate that these experiments will provide a definitive test of the <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> hypothesis. Comment: about 10 page...|$|R
40|$|<b>Mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> is a {{dissipative}} and self-interacting multiparticle {{dark matter}} candidate which {{can explain the}} DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST-II direct detection experiments.

40|$|Existence of {{a mirror}} world in the {{universe}} is a fundamental way to restore the observed parity violation in weak interactions and provides the lightest mirror nucleon as a unique GeV-scale dark matter particle candidate. The visible and mirror worlds share the same spacetime {{of the universe and}} are connected by a unique space-inversion symmetry [...] the mirror parity (P). We conjecture that the mirror parity is respected by the fundamental interaction Lagrangian, and study its spontaneous breaking from minimizing the Higgs vacuum potential. The domain wall problem is resolved by a unique soft breaking linear-term from the P-odd weak-singlet Higgs field. We also derive constraint from the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis. We then analyze the neutrino seesaw for both visible and mirror worlds, and demonstrate that the desired amounts of visible <b>matter</b> and <b>mirror</b> dark <b>matter</b> in the universe arise from a common origin of CP violation in the neutrino sector via leptogenesis.
