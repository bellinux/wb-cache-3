50|$|A <b>monochrome</b> <b>printer</b> {{can only}} produce an image {{consisting}} of one colour, usually black. A <b>monochrome</b> <b>printer</b> {{may also be}} able to produce various tones of that color, such as a grey-scale. A colour printer can produce images of multiple colours. A photo printer is a colour printer that can produce images that mimic the colour range (gamut) and resolution of prints made from photographic film. Many can be used on a standalone basis without a computer, using a memory card or USB connector.|$|E

40|$|Electrophotographic (EP) {{process is}} widely used in the {{printing}} industry. One of the major image quality issues in EP printers is known as banding which {{is related to the}} fluctuations of the internal printer components. In this thesis, we have proposed a robust and accurate system for banding measurement from the output of an EP printer. The developed tool will measure banding frequencies of a <b>monochrome</b> EP <b>printer</b> from different independent sources. The complete system includes a measurement unit, a specially designed test page, and analysis software. The banding measurement tool will be helpful in the development of new <b>monochrome</b> EP <b>printers</b> by providing a quantitative assessment of banding characteristics for these engines. The banding artifact can also be treated as an intrinsic signature of a printer {{that can be used to}} identify a specific printer. Printer identification based on a printed document has many desirable forensic applications. We propose to use the banding measurement frame work and advanced pattern recognition techniques to detect the intrinsic signatures. The projection data from individual characters of a text only document are represented in a reduced dimension by PCA (principal component analysis). Then a classifier is built based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The distributions of all the printers help us to determine the mixing coefficient for the projection from an unknown printer. Finally, the decision making algorithm identifies the correct printer. ...|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{printing}} {{technology can be}} used to produce color images by adhering a wax-based ink onto paper. As the paper and ribbon travel in unison beneath the thermal print head, the wax-based ink from the transfer ribbon melts onto the paper. When cooled, the wax is permanently adhered to the paper. This type of thermal printer uses a like-sized panel of ribbon for each page to be printed, regardless of the contents of the page. <b>Monochrome</b> <b>printers</b> have a black panel for each page to be printed, while color printers have either three (CMY) or four (CMYK) colored panels for each page. Unlike dye-sublimation printers, these printers cannot vary the dot intensity, which means that images must be dithered. Although acceptable in quality, the printouts from these printers cannot compare with modern inkjet printers and color laser printers. Currently, this type of printer is rarely used for full-page printing, and is now employed for industrial label printing due to its waterfastness and speed. These printers are considered highly reliable due to their small number of moving parts. Printouts from color thermal printers using wax are sensitive to abrasion, as the wax ink can be scraped, rubbed off, or smeared. However, wax-resin compounds and full resins can be used on materials such as polypropylene or polyester in order to increase durability.|$|R

5000|$|Among other {{novelties}} that Lotus introduced was a graph maker {{that could}} display several forms of graphs (including pie charts, bar graphics, or line charts) but required {{the user to}} have a graphics card. At this early stage, the only video boards available for the PC were IBM's Color/Graphics Adapter and <b>Monochrome</b> Display and <b>Printer</b> Adapter while the latter did not support any graphics. However, because the two video boards used different RAM and port addresses, both could be installed in the same machine and so Lotus took advantage of this by supporting a [...] "split" [...] screen mode whereby the user could display the worksheet portion of 1-2-3 on the sharper monochrome video and the graphics on the CGA display.|$|R
50|$|The IBM Personal Computer was {{launched}} in 1981 with the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) expansion card and the <b>Monochrome</b> Display And <b>Printer</b> Adapter. The CGA offered two basic operating modes: 320×200 pixel (or 40x25 character) low resolution or a 640x200 (or 80×25 characters) pixels high resolution mode. While the low-resolution mode was very comparable to 8-bit home computers of the era, the higher-resolution mode offered a fair advance, used with a suitable RGBI (or RGB) monitor (such as the IBM 5153 Personal Computer Color Display). Still, since by design CGA {{was able to be}} connected to cheap composite monitors and even to home TVs (via RF modulator), CGA was limited in resolution; its text modes has a character box size of 8x8 pixels, which made text fairly rough-looking, especially in the vertical direction, which had only one pixel row for descenders.|$|R
40|$|Digital halftoning {{provides}} {{a mechanism for}} rendering continuous-tone images on discrete devices {{that are capable of}} directly generating only a few different output levels. We present robust halftoning approaches for both monochrome and color printing. First we incorporate models for printer dot interactions for <b>monochrome</b> electro-photographic <b>printers</b> within the iterative Direct Binary Search (DBS) halftoning algorithm. Both analytical and stochastic models are studied. In the analytical model it is assumed that the printer can generate a circular spot with constant absorptance at each printer addressable location, whereas the stochastic model is based on microscopic absorptance and variance measurements. We also present an efficient strategy for evaluating the change in computational cost as the search progresses. With our scheme, updating the change in error only involves a few fetches from two look-up-tables and some scalar multiplications and additions. Experimental results are provided that show that DBS with an appropriate model for printer dot interactions yields enhanced detail rendition, suppression of aliasing artifacts, and improved tonal gradation in shadow areas. ^ Next the problem of optimal periodic clustered dot (CD) color screen design is addressed. In CD color screening, the screens for each colorant are rotated to a different angle and offset relative to each other. If the angles and offsets are not carefully chosen, visible moiré and rosette artifacts appear. These artifacts primarily result from the interaction of the periodic structures associated with the halftone screens of different colorants. Registration errors also introduce un-wanted displacements in the individual screens. Using lattice theory and a model for the perceived rendered halftone, we present a systematic method for designing moiré and rosette free CD color screens that are robust to registration errors. ...|$|R
