Computational experiments are carried out on three classes of benchmark instances under different scales (small, medium, and large). Compared with the existing literature, RVNS shows good performance and robustness on a total of 176 tested instances. For the 96 small-sized instances, the RVNS algorithm can find 100 % of the optimal solutions in less computational time; for the 40 medium-sized and the 40 large-sized instances, the RVNS algorithm is competitive against other methods, enjoying good effectiveness as well as high computational efficiency.
