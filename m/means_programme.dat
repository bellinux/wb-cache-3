40|$|Abstract Seven {{endophytic}} bacterial isolates {{were finally}} recovered from native sugarcane varieties at hilly areas namely Berinag, Champawat and Didihat of Uttarakhand state in northern Himalayan region. New isolates and two standard cultures—Azospirillum brasilense and Glu-conacetobacter diazotrophicus, were evaluated for their morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. Morphologically all were rod shaped, Gram-negative bac-teria. Their plant growth promotory properties were also assessed which proved isolates RtBn and StBn as IAA producing. Except isolate StBn, all were phosphate solu-bilising and except RtBn all produced siderophores. Molecular characterisation of the isolates was performed using amplified 16 S r-DNA restriction analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} {{an evaluation of}} a Norwegian initiative to combat poverty launched in 2003. Central to the plan is {{a broad spectrum of}} rehabilitation and activation measures intended to help long-term social security recipients from welfare to work. We illuminate short-term effects up to the end of 2004, taking a dual approach: First, we analyse transitions to work among participants in the programme and study the determinants of this process by means of survival analysis and multivariate hazard rate regression. Second, we address the question of programme effects adopting a quasi-experimental design based on propensity score matching. We find that the <b>mean</b> <b>programme</b> effect is positive, but only when work is defined fairly broadly. However, the impact varies by target group. For immigrants and single mothers, there is no impact whether we use a strict or less strict definition of work. For youth, the effect is even estimated to be negative, implying that they {{would have been better off}} without this initiative. The only significant effect in the desired direction is found among other long-term social security recipients, and applies for both the strict and less strict definition of employment. Moreover, this effect is fairly large. Active labour market programmes; social security recipients; programme evaluation; propensity score matching. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{cost-effectiveness}} {{of primary}} care programmes encompassing both algorithm-driven cardiovascular diseases(CVD) risk assessment and multi-disciplinary care for patients with hypertension(HT) remains unknown. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the Risk-Assessment-and-Management-Programme(RAMP-HT) for HT patients in Hong Kong. Methodology: A prospective cohort study was conducted for 42, 490 RAMP-HT participants and {{the same number of}} propensity-score-matched HT patients receiving usual primary care in Hong Kong between October 2011 and March 2013, who were without CVD at baseline. The effectiveness measures were cumulative incidences of all-cause mortality and CVD including coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke over 3 years. Using a bottom-up approach, the programme costs including set-up costs, ongoing intervention costs and central administrative costs of RAMP-HT were estimated from public health service provider’s perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental effectiveness of the RAMP-HT group compared to those of the usual care group. Results: Significantly lower cumulative incidences of any CVD complications(3. 6 % vs 4. 6 %,p< 0. 001) and all-cause mortality(2. 1 % vs 4. 8 %,p< 0. 001) were observed in the RAMP-HT group compared to the usual care group. The 3 -year <b>mean</b> <b>programme</b> cost of RAMP-HT was US$ 52 per participant. The RAMP-HT costed US$ 5, 452 and US$ 1, 973 to reduce one CVD and death over 3 years, respectively. Discussion and conclusion: The RAMP-HT integrated into usual primary care was demonstrated to be cost-effective over 3 years. These findings support structured, algorithm-driven CVD risk assessment and multi-disciplinary care in routine primary care for all HT patients to prevent CVD/death and reduce healthcare burden...|$|R
