25|$|Ghee is {{clarified}} butter {{that has been}} heated to around 120°C (250°F) after the water evaporated, turning the <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> brown. This process flavors the ghee, and also produces antioxidants that help protect it from rancidity. Because of this, ghee can keep for six to eight months under normal conditions.|$|E
25|$|Butter is {{used for}} sautéing and frying, {{although}} its <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> brown and burn above 150°C (250°F)—a rather low temperature for most applications. The smoke point of butterfat is around 200°C (400°F), so clarified butter or ghee is better suited to frying. Ghee {{has always been a}} common frying medium in India, where many avoid other animal fats for cultural or religious reasons.|$|E

Dual-sugar extenders typically have similar ingredients, with an additional sugar, sucrose. Other extenders (e.g. INRA '96) may also contain milk components.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand to tailor the functional properties of mixed biopolymer systems that find application in dairy food products. The effect of static high pressure processing (HPP), up to 600 MPa for 15 min at room temperature, on milk-gelatin mixtures with different solid concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % w/w <b>milk</b> <b>solid</b> and 0. 6 % w/w gelatin) was investigated. The viscosity remarkably increased in mixtures prepared with high <b>milk</b> <b>solid</b> concentration (15 % and 20 % w/w) following HPP at 300 MPa, whereas HPP at 600 MPa caused a decline in viscosity. This was due to ruptured aggregates and phase separation as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Molecular bonding of the milk-gelatin mixtures due to HPP was shown by Fourier-transform infrared spectra, particularly within the regions of 1610 - 1690 and 1480 - 1575 cm- 1, which reflect the vibrational bands of amide I and amide II, respectively...|$|R

25|$|Clarified {{butter is}} butter with {{almost all of}} its water and <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> removed, leaving almost-pure butterfat. Clarified butter is made by heating butter to its melting point and then {{allowing}} it to cool; after settling, the remaining components separate by density. At the top, whey proteins form a skin, which is removed. The resulting butterfat is then poured off from the mixture of water and casein proteins that settle to the bottom.|$|E

Other than milk, allowed milk products include concentrated milk, evaporated milk, dried milk, and a mixture of butter with skim, concentrated skim, evaporated skim, or nonfat dry milk, in any combination, with the limitation {{on the amount of}} <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> relative to amount of milk fat.|$|E
25|$|Lactose {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, caseinate, whey, lactoserum, <b>milk</b> <b>solids,</b> modified milk ingredients, etc. As such lactose is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers in the milk stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain lactose. Lactose is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though product labeling seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of lactose in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} <b>milk</b> <b>solid</b> content. The {{solid content}} of the milk is affected by a genetic and environmental factor, which include {{the age of the}} cow, environmental temperature, milking management, health of the cow and feeding management. The factor that produces the biggest change in the solid {{content of the}} milk is the feeding management. Milk fat content can be affected between 2 to 3 units, protein content 0. 1 to 0. 3 units; however lactose and mineral content in constant and is not affected by the factors affecting total milk components. The principal factor that affect milk fat content is the feeding management of the cow, which include the forage: concentrate ratio, quality and particle size of the forage, type of concentrate, fatty acids content, buffers, feeding management and other additives...|$|R
50|$|Cheese making. The key step in cheese {{production}} is {{the separation of}} the <b>milk</b> into <b>solid</b> curds and liquid whey. This separation is achieved by inducing the aggregation processes between casein micelles by acidifying the milk or adding rennet. The acidification neutralizes the carboxylate groups on the micelles and induces the aggregation.|$|R
2500|$|There is no {{standardized}} {{method for}} measuring the lactose content of food. The stated dairy content of a product also varies according to manufacturing processes and labelling practices, and commercial terminology varies between languages and regions. As a result, absolute figures {{for the amount of}} lactose consumed (by weight) may not be very reliable. Kosher products labeled pareve or fleishig are free of milk. However, if a [...] "D" [...] (for [...] "dairy") is present next to the circled [...] "K", [...] "U", or other hechsher, the food product likely contains <b>milk</b> <b>solids,</b> although it may also simply indicate the product was produced on equipment shared with other products containing milk derivatives.|$|E
2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking butter into reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold butter into any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|E
2500|$|Dairies {{were founded}} from the Bear River Ridge {{to the south}} side of the Eel River {{starting}} in the late 1860s. [...] Filled kegs of butter were transported along the beach river by four-horse teams from the Mattole to Centerville or Port Kenyon and the teams returned supplies from Ferndale. [...] The eighty-one dairies from the southern area faded as the land along the Eel River Valley was settled for dairying, first by the Danes and later by other settlers. [...] In the 1880s multiple cooperative creameries in the Eel River valley began to process milk into butter; by 1904 the Central Creamery on Main Street Ferndale had combined the smaller operations into a more modern production facility. [...] The use of paper wrapping on butter to reduce air oxidizing the product was pioneered here at the suggestion of Chester E. Gray (1881-1944) from the U.S. Department of Agriculture who studied the problem of unrefrigerated fine butter turning white within hours of production. [...] Gray patented a new spray-drying process (U.S. Patent #858,868 - 1907 and #1,157,935 - 1915) and went into business with Central Creamery owner Aage Jensen in a new dry-milk manufacturing process to utilize non-fat <b>milk</b> <b>solids</b> which had formerly been waste of the process. [...] Their new plant processed 75,000 pounds of milk a day, shipping to San Francisco and filling contracts for the U.S. Navy. [...] In 1916 Grey and Jensen moved to San Francisco and changed the company name to Golden State Creamery.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} {{in the present study}} that {{breastfeeding}} initiation rate was high but duration of any breastfeeding practices was rather low. Introduction of solid foods and cow’s milk was according to guidelines but juice was introduced much earlier. Breastfeeding was associated with later introduction of water, formula and juice but not of cow’s <b>milk</b> or <b>solid</b> foods. We did not find a significant association between breastfeeding or between the timing of introduction of water, formula, juice, cow’s <b>milk</b> and <b>solid</b> foods with weight status in this sample of Hispanic infants. Strategies to support mothers on continuing breastfeeding beyond the hospital and for longer periods are needed among WIC participants to benefit of the protective effect on childhood obesity. In addition, more emphasis should be given on the recommendation to delay introduction of juices at 12  months and beyond.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to estimate the potential acid production value (PAPV) of major diets and to determine the relationship between dietary PAPV and dairy production traits. Estimation of PAPV of major cattle feeds was based on an in vitro technique, which determined the degree of Ca dissociation from CaCO 3. Data on feeds and production traits were collected on 744 multiparous lactating Holstein dairy cows from five different farms. Grains had high PAPV with variable protein sources and by-products. High PAPV feedstuffs had a higher total gas production and lower pH compared to those with low PAPV. Dietary PAPV had a positive correlation with intake of dry matter, NDF, ADF, milk yield and <b>milk</b> <b>solid</b> production but a negative correlation with milk protein and milk fat concentration. Current results indicate that dietary PAPV can be utilized in predicting dairy production traits...|$|R
