Since this site lies in the heart of North Memphis, an affordable golf course would help to bring back some of the neighborhood unity that many residents feel has dissipated over the years. The golf course could serve as a new neighborhood focal point, and it may attract other businesses to come and fill the empty space businesses left when they vacated the area many years ago, bringing more jobs to the surrounding neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|Later in 2005 two Dutch female bobs {{qualified}} for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, however the team line-ups were still unsure. At the qualification play-off (named bob-off) held in Oberhof, Germany four competitors fought for two seats behind Broeders and the other driver Eline Jurg. Christel Bertens, Jurg's <b>main</b> <b>runner</b> was the main victim of the qualification process {{and ended up in}} fourth position. Jeannette Pennings was teamed-up with her main driver Broeders, while Bertens was replaced by Van Haperen who finished second. Jurg's back-up runner Urta Rozenstruik became the Olympic back-up runner. At the Olympics Broeders/Pennings started off first, but crashed, causing concentration trouble for Jurg/Van Haperen who saw it all happen. This resulted in disappointing results and an eleventh position overall after four runs. Despite these happenings Van Haperen did not return to the track and field competitions, but she focusses totally on bobsledding.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{a long-distance}} bicycle road game, {{in order to}} make the <b>main</b> <b>runner</b> win, an entire team makes a {{formation}} and assigns the <b>main</b> <b>runner</b> in an advantageous position with little resistance. This study verified the effects from the formation consisted of multiple riders, usually called “train,” with replicas aerodynamically. Four replicas were used as a train in drag force measurement and flow visualization. Bicycle replicas were fixed onto a ground plate, and the spacing of each replica was kept constant. Drag force of each replica was measured with three component load cell. Flow visualization in a smoke tunnel was also carried out in a horizontal plane at the riders’ height. Several train formation expected to reduce drag were attempted. As a result, the least drag on the replica of the <b>main</b> <b>runner</b> was obtained when it was placed at the end of the train in a linear arrangement.

5000|$|In some engines {{the intake}} runners are {{straight}} for minimal resistance. In most engines, however, the runners have curves...and some very convoluted to achieve desired runner length. These turns {{allow for a}} more compact manifold, with denser packaging of the whole engine, as a result. Also, these [...] "snaked" [...] runners are needed for some variable length/ split runner designs, and allow {{the size of the}} plenum to be reduced. In an engine with at least six cylinders the averaged intake flow is nearly constant and the plenum volume can be smaller. To avoid standing waves within the plenum it is made as compact as possible. The intake runners each use a smaller part of the plenum surface than the inlet, which supplies air to the plenum, for aerodynamic reasons. Each runner is placed to have nearly the same distance to the <b>main</b> inlet. <b>Runners</b> whose cylinders fire close after each other, are not placed as neighbors.|$|R

25|$|Blade <b>Runners</b> <b>main</b> {{focus is}} detective work rather than puzzles or combat, and the {{majority}} of gameplay consists of searching for evidence, questioning suspects and analyzing clues. Occasionally, the player must solve compulsory puzzles, and often, to progress the story, certain clues must be located. Clues are found by searching crime scenes, and {{come in the form of}} items, photographs, interviews, or unusual markings. When analyzing photographs, the player must use the ESPER system, a high-density computer with a powerful three-dimensional resolution capacity which allows for the enhancement of photos and enables the player to find details within the picture. Combat is occasionally available in the game, but is rarely compulsory. The only weapon available to the player is McCoy's standard issue police pistol, which may be loaded with various types of ammunition.|$|R

50|$|Variable-Length Intake Manifold (VLIM) is an {{internal}} combustion engine manifold technology.Four common implementations exist. First, two discrete intake runners with different length are employed, and a butterfly valve can close the short path. Second the intake runners can be bent around a common plenum, and a sliding valve separates them from the plenum with a variable length. Straight high-speed runners can receive plugs, which contain small long runner extensions. The plenum of a 6- or 8-cylinder engine can be parted into halves, with the even firing cylinders in one half and the odd firing cylinders in the other part. Both sub-plenums and the air intake are connected to an Y (sort of main plenum). The air oscillates between both sub-plenums, with a large pressure oscillation there, but a constant pressure at the <b>main</b> plenum. Each <b>runner</b> from a sub plenum to the main plenum can be changed in length. For V engines this can be implemented by parting a single large plenum at high engine speed by means of sliding valves into it when speed is reduced.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Excessive foot {{pronation}} {{and fatigue}} in running are possible {{risk factors for}} injuries. Motion control footwear was designed to limit excessive foot motion in runners, but its clinical efficacy has not been well reported. This study investigated the rearfoot kinematics in runners when running with different footwear before and after fatigue of the lower leg muscles. Design: Within subjects repeated measures. Setting: University gait laboratory. Participants: 25 female recreational <b>runners.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measures: A Vicon three-dimensional motion analysis system was used to capture the rearfoot motions of 25 recreational runners who had excessive foot pronation, when running with motion control shoes and neutral shoes before and after fatigue of the lower leg muscles. Results: The findings with neutral shoe testing revealed {{a significant increase in}} rearfoot angle of 6. 5 ° (95 % CI 4. 7 - 8. 2 °) (p< 0. 01) when the muscles were fatigued. However, the findings with motion control shoes revealed that rearfoot angle was marginally insignificant (p= 0. 06) in subjects before and after muscle fatigue. Moreover, rearfoot motion when running with neutral shoes was higher than that with motion control shoes in both pre- (p< 0. 01) and post-fatigue states (p< 0. 01). Conclusions: Motion control shoes can control excessive rearfoot movements in runners with over-pronation regardless of the state of leg muscle fatigue. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|The {{culture of}} {{running in the}} U. S. is big business. <b>Main</b> drivers for <b>runners</b> center on the desire for health and wellness, {{competitive}} spirit, achieving one’s mental and physical best {{and the sense of}} community that a running event creates. Each year, throughout the U. S., hundreds of races are run, from small, community 5 Ks to major annual races like the New York City Marathon (an estimated annual race revenue of $ 30 million without economic impact 1) or Atlanta’s Peachtree Road Race (an estimated economic impact of over $ 10 million 2). These races provide local residents with an opportunity to run races without requiring them to travel to another city. Because of the sheer demands of producing such an event, it also presents an opportunity for the community to be involved, whether through running, volunteering or just cheering on the participants. Both factors increase {{the quality of life for}} local citizens, in much the same way that having more local shopping options raises the quality of life. The Market to Market Relay Nebraska is a unique event within the state, definitely making good on Nebraska’s promise of “the good life”. Having just completed its fifth annual race, the Relay has now grown to include over 3, 000 runners each year. The Relay is a 78 -mile team run from Omaha’s Memorial Park Old Market to Lincoln’s Historic Haymarket. The course follows trails, paved streets and gravel back roads and culminates in an award ceremony and party in the Haymarket. With a growing number of participants traveling to Nebraska to participate, the Relay has become a tourist attraction which promotes new spending in the state. The economic impact that results is just another byproduct of the Relay, in addition to the quality-of-life benefits discussed above...|$|R
40|$|Music {{appears to}} have {{advantageous}} effects during exercise {{as it has been}} shown to increase motivation, decrease ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and improve exercise performance. The improvement of running performance in particular, is the <b>main</b> effect recreational <b>runners</b> want to focus on as many want to improve their time in road races. Running velocity, indicated by a faster time to completion is thought to improve with an increase in step frequency, step length, or a combination of these variables. Currently, there is limited research that observes methods to help increase step frequency or step length. The manipulation of music cadence may be considered an effective training method that influences step frequency. The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe the effect of music cadence on step frequency in the recreational runner. A total of 30 recreational runners (15 male, 15 female) with a mean age of 31. 0 ± 5. 8 (range= 20 - 39), a BMI of 24. 0 ± 3. 3 (range= 19 - 32), and an estimated VO 2 max of 49. 6 ± 5. 4 (range= 41 - 60) participated in this study. Individually, runners completed four 1600 -meter time trials on an outdoor track at maximal effort. The first trial was a familiarization trial where participants ran 1600 meters with no music. Two music conditions were then created for each runner based on their natural step frequency obtained during the familiarization trial. The first condition represented music at natural step cadence and the second condition represented music at increased step cadence. The next three 1600 meter time trials were randomized and included a control condition of no music, a natural cadence music condition at the runner 2 ̆ 7 s natural step frequency, and an increased cadence music condition of 10 - 20 beats per minute (bpm) above the natural cadence music condition. Results indicated that step frequency was significantly higher during the increased cadence music condition compared to both the natural cadence music and no music conditions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Additionally, time to completion was significantly lower in the increased cadence music condition compared to both the natural cadence music and no music conditions (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Lastly, there was no significant difference in step length among music conditions. These results indicate that music cadence had a positive influence on running performance as it was able to increase step frequency and improve time to completion in a group of recreational runners. Therefore, for practical application, recreational runners can alter music cadence to help improve running performance...|$|R
