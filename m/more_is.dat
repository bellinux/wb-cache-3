5|$|Bessas reappears in the {{campaign}} of 554, when he was appointed joint commander in Lazica with Martin, Bouzes and Justin. Gubazes, though, soon protested to Justinian about the incompetence of the Byzantine generals. Bessas was dismissed, his property was confiscated, and he was sent in exile among the Abasgians. Nothing <b>more</b> <b>is</b> known about him thereafter.|$|E

5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was {{six or seven}} years old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated until she had reached puberty at the age of nine or ten years old. She was therefore a virgin at marriage. Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom <b>more</b> <b>is</b> known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|Although data on Russulaceae {{themselves}} are scarce, <b>more</b> <b>is</b> {{known about the}} habitats they occur in, especially for the ectomycorrhizal species which depend on their host plants: Several of these habitats are affected by loss or degradation, such as peatlands, Mediterranean forests and scrub or tropical African dry woodland. Similarly, dead wood, the habitat of the corticioid Russulaceae, is rare in many exploited forests and needs special management.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{electrical}} flaws, the Metroliners proved mechanically sound. Amtrak ordered over 600 non-powered Amfleet cars, {{based on}} the Metroliner design and also manufactured by Budd, in the mid-1970s. Beginning in 1987, Amtrak converted 23 former Metroliners for use as cab control cars on corridor trains. Fourteen more cars were used with minimal modifications - six as cab cars and 8 as trailer coaches. Most former Metroliners were scrapped between 2003 and 2011. However, some cab cars remain in use on Keystone Service and Shuttle trains. Three former Metroliners have also been converted to technology testing or track measurement cars, and one <b>more</b> <b>is</b> used by Amtrak as a special-purpose business car. One original Metroliner is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or <b>more</b> <b>is</b> intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E

5|$|<b>More</b> <b>is</b> {{known about}} the role of Athenian {{children}} in religion than about any other aspect of their lives, and they seem to have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage, during pregnancy, and at childbirth. Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early-spring festival of the Anthesteria, depictions of boys are far more common.|$|E
5|$|Much <b>more</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|Nothing <b>more</b> <b>is</b> {{known of}} Cragh after his {{testimony}} to the papal commission in 1307. Thirty-eightposthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe were examined by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by the pope and his advisors. Twelve were rejected after further analysis, including Cragh's resurrection, but no reasons were recorded. Pope John XXII formally announced Cantilupe's canonisation on 17 April 1320, thirty-eight years after the new saint's death.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to {{research}} conducted by the Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey, much <b>more</b> <b>is</b> known about the pigeon cameras developed {{at about the same}} time by the Swiss clockmaker Christian Adrian Michel (1912–1980) in Walde. He was assigned to the Swiss Army's carrier pigeons service in 1931, and in 1933 he began work on adapting Neubronner's panoramic camera to 16mm film, and improving it with a mechanism to control the delay before the first exposure and to transport the film between exposures. Michel's camera, patented in 1937, weighed only , and may have been one of the first to have a timer operated by clockwork.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Padres joined Major League Baseball as an {{expansion}} team in 1969. Preston Gómez managed {{the team from}} the inaugural season until 1972. In total, the franchise has had 16 managers. Bud Black was employed in the position since being hired prior to the 2007 season, and he was fired on June 15, 2015. He was replaced by Dave Roberts for 1 game. Then Pat Murphy took over. Bruce Bochy is the manager with the longest tenure, leading the team for 12 seasons from 1995 through 2006. Bochy is also the only Padres skipper to win the Manager of the Year Award, and leads the team in regular-season wins (951) and losses (975), as well as playoff wins (8) and losses (16). The franchise leader in winning percentage among managers who have led the team for a full season or <b>more</b> <b>is</b> Jack McKeon (.541 over three seasons). Besides Bochy, Dick Williams is the only Padres manager to lead the team to a National League pennant; Williams won 337 games in his four seasons with the club {{and is the only}} one of San Diego's sixteen managers to be elected to the Hall of Fame. On October 29, 2015, Andy Green was named manager of the San Diego Padres.|$|E
5|$|The {{credence}} {{given to}} the reports was such that Pope Alexander III {{sent a letter to}} Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing <b>more</b> <b>is</b> recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At any rate, the Letters author was most likely a Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|The main {{primary source}} for Cragh's {{story is the}} record of the {{investigation}} into the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, which is held in the Vatican Library. Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eightmiracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission, after which nothing <b>more</b> <b>is</b> known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320.|$|E

After defeating the vampire Latasha, the PC travels through a portal to reach the chamber of the Night Masks' leader, Orbakh.
