50|$|Acoustic {{telegraphy}} (also {{known as}} harmonic telegraphy) was {{a name for}} various methods of multiplexing (transmitting more than one) telegraph messages simultaneously over a single telegraph wire by using different audio frequencies or channels for each message.

50|$|Keying is {{a family}} of {{modulation}} forms where the modulating signal takes one of a specific (predetermined) number of values at all times.

In an attempt to shield the pilot's eyes from the bright exhaust flames many Spitfires were also fitted with rectangular light-alloy [...] "blinkers" [...] secured to light-alloy brackets fixed {{to the sides of}} the fuel-tank housing: these could be easily removed.|$|E
5000|$|Vibroplex is {{the brand}} of {{side-to-side}} mechanical, semi-automatic <b>Morse</b> <b>key</b> first manufactured {{and sold in}} 1905 by the Vibroplex Company, after its invention and patent by Horace Greeley Martin of New York City in 1904. The original device became known as a [...] "bug", most likely due to the original logo, which showed an [...] "electrified bug". The Vibroplex Company has been in business continuously for 109 years, as of 2014. Amateur radio operator Scott E. Robbins, also known by the call sign W4PA, became the 8th owner of the Vibroplex Company on December 21, 2009. The company is located in Knoxville, Tennessee.|$|E
5000|$|This was a {{major problem}} on the first transatlantic {{telegraph}} cable {{and led to the}} theory of the causes of dispersion being investigated first by Lord Kelvin and then by Heaviside who discovered how it could be countered. Dispersion of telegraph pulses, if severe enough, will cause them to overlap with adjacent pulses, causing what is now called intersymbol interference. To prevent intersymbol interference it was necessary to reduce the transmission speed of the transatlantic telegraph cable to the equivalent of [...] baud. This is an exceptionally slow data transmission rate, even for human operators who had great difficulty operating a <b>morse</b> <b>key</b> that slowly.|$|E
50|$|Working in the company’s {{office in}} Iquique, Chile, he became tired of using {{hand-operated}} <b>Morse</b> <b>keys</b> and Wheatstone tape punches, {{and came up}} with the idea of a typewriter-style machine that would allow the operator to punch Morse code signals onto paper tape simply by pressing the appropriate character key. Creed quit his job and moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he began work in an old shed. Using an old typewriter bought from the Sauchiehall Street market, he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals onto paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System.|$|R

Numerous Vibroplex keys are available to this day; the company presently markets and sells 27 variations of <b>Morse</b> code <b>keys,</b> including the Original Bug, iambic paddles, the Vibrokeyer (an electronic variant of the Original Bug) and traditional straight keys.|$|R
50|$|A {{telegraph}} key is a {{switching device}} used primarily to send <b>Morse</b> code. Similar <b>keys</b> {{are used for}} all forms of manual telegraphy, such as in ‘wire’ or electrical telegraph and ‘wireless’ or radio telegraphy.|$|R
50|$|His {{receiver}} {{proved to}} be able to sense lightning strikes at distances of up to 30 km, thus functioning as a lightning detector. In late 1895, Popov built a version of the receiver that was capable of automatically recording lightning strikes on paper rolls. Popov's system was eventually extended to function as a wireless telegraph, with a <b>Morse</b> <b>key</b> attached to the transmitter. There's some dispute regarding the first public test of this design. It is frequently stated that Popov used his radio to send a Morse code message over a distance of 250 m on 26 March 1896 (three months before Marconi's patent was filed). However, contemporary confirmations of this transmission are lacking. It is more likely that said experiment took place in December 1897.|$|E
50|$|The railway block {{signalling}} bell code {{is a system}} of bell rings used in Great Britain to communicate between manually operated Signal Boxes (the system is not used in modern power signal boxes, unless it is a fringe box to an older signalbox). Each signal box would have a bell circuit to the box {{on either side of}} it along the line. The equipment would consist of a plunger or tapper (rather like a <b>Morse</b> <b>key)</b> which if pressed, rings the bell in the neighbouring box. The neighbouring box would have a key for communicating back, therefore each box has a key which rings the bell in the other box. Where a signal box communicates with more than one other box (in either direction along the line, and possibly along a branch line too), each bell would have a different tone, so that the signalman could tell them apart by ear.|$|E
50|$|On 29 December 1859 {{the newly}} {{constructed}} telegraph line {{was brought into}} use, the line was built generally alongside the Great Western Road from Sydney to Bathurst and was constructed of timber poles with one galvanised wire tied to insulators on each pole. At several intermediate points along the route a telegraph repeater station was located, including Parramatta, Penrith, Katoomba and Hartley. At the intermediate repeater stations an operator manually retyped the message, passing it through that location. The system operated on the earth return principle whereby the circuit started at a large battery at one end (end A), via a <b>morse</b> <b>key</b> used by the telegraph operator, passed along the galvanised iron wire attached to the poles, then through the morse instrument {{at the far end}} (end B) and returned to the battery (at end A) through the ground (earth). This was a cheap method of construction requiring only one wire and no pole crossarms.|$|E
50|$|The Electron was {{designed}} to be very sparse, with a sizable reduction of living space that was intentionally designed to reduce wind and water resistance. They featured a high enclosed wheelhouse superstructure that Crowhurst abandoned for a flush deck that only allowed for a small rounded “doghouse” for the wheel. Aboard the ship was a table with a screw on vice for small repair work, a Marconi Kestrel radio-telephone, a small built-in table with a red cushioned seat that would have hidden the main computer but instead obscured a tangle of carefully color-coded, but unconnected, wires that hung throughout the cabin. He also had a Racal RA 6217 communications receiver, a Shannon Mar 3 transmitter/receiver, headsets, <b>morse</b> <b>keys,</b> switch panels, and gross amounts of radio spares. Powering the existing electronics on the boat was an Onan petrol-driven generator that was seated under the cockpit where it would be at risk of continuous exposure to water in rough weather, but which was again, done in line with Crowhurst’s fear of capsize. The typical “Victress” cabin also featured built in shelving and cabinetry that Crowhurst replaced with Tupperware plastic containers for storing food, electronic components, a second-hand Bell and Howell 16mm camera and Uher tape recorder that had been provided by the BBC for documenting the journey. The boat also housed a Hasler self-steering system and a Hengist-Horsa wind speed and direction indicator.|$|R
5000|$|The {{university}} {{was founded in}} 1914 next {{to the city of}} Chengdu and is still present to this day. The creation of the school manifested from William Reginald Morse's realization that missions in West China were unable to provide educational opportunities. The {{university was}} established through the joint efforts of missionary organizations from the United States, Britain and Canada. The mission of the school was [...] "the advancement of the Kingdom of God by means of higher education in West China under Christian auspices". Dr. O.L. Kilborn, Dr. R.G. Kilborn, and Dr. William Reginald <b>Morse</b> played <b>key</b> roles in its formation.|$|R
50|$|Single {{operator}} two radios contesting requires certain specialty radio hardware. The {{most important}} is a device capable of switching the microphone, <b>Morse</b> code <b>key,</b> or sound card interface for digital mode transmissions, between two radio transceivers. Another necessity {{is the ability to}} switch or mix audio from two different radios to a single pair of headphones. This is generally accomplished with a single hardware device known as an SO2R Switch Box. Some contest logging software packages can use simple parallel port or serial port interfaces to communicate with these switch boxes and allow the SO2R operator to switch radio or audio focus directly from the computer keyboard.|$|R
