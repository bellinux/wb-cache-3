40|$|Azopigments were {{obtained}} from the delta fraction of bilirubin (mammalian biliprotein) in cholestatic sera of <b>men,</b> <b>rats</b> and guinea pigs by diazo reaction with diazotized p-iodoaniline and analysed by t. l. c. Delta bilirubin of <b>men</b> and <b>rats</b> generated both unconjugated and glucuronide-conjugated azodipyrroles, whereas that of guinea pigs, in which the predominant form of conjugated bilirubin in serum was bilirubin monoglucuronide, generated only unconjugated azodipyrrole. We further analysed the azopigments by reversed-phase h. p. l. c. to distinguish their endovinyl and exovinyl isomers. The results indicated (a) that covalent binding of bilirubin to protein occurs exclusively on the conjugated dipyrrolic (either endovinyl or exovinyl) half of the parent conjugated bilirubin, (b) that both bilirubin monoglucuronide and bilirubin diglucuronide generate delta bilirubin, the latter yielding a 'conjugated' form of delta bilirubin that preserves the glucuronic acid moiety on the dipyrrolic half not bound covalently to protein, and (c) that therefore at least four forms of delta bilirubin exist in jaundiced sera of <b>men</b> and <b>rats...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since the <b>maned</b> <b>rat</b> is {{a solitary}} creature, not much {{is known about}} the {{reproductive}} practices of the species. The litter size is 1-3. The young are slightly haired at birth and white markings and black stripes on the body are visible after 9 days. By day 13, the eyes open.

50|$|Many {{species of}} animals {{live in the}} montane forest. Some are residents, and others visit from the {{surrounding}} land. Various species of monkeys, several antelopes, tree hyrax and some larger animals such as elephant and buffalo all live in the forest. Zebra are only found on the northern slopes, where the forest belt is narrowest, and more open. Some rare species, such as the giant forest hog, suni, mountain bongo, and <b>maned</b> <b>rat</b> {{are found in the}} forest. Larger predators include hyena and leopard, and occasionally lion. Many bird species are also found here, including turacos, francolins and hornbills. Various types of sunbirds, parrots, swallows and mountain buzzards are common. At the Met Station, on the Naro Moru route, the olive ibis (Bostrychia olivacea; also called the African green ibis), and Abyssinian ground-thrush can be found, both of which are rare. Also on the Naro Moru route buffalo have been observed digging the soil with their horns and eating it. This is probably because of the nutrients in the soil.|$|E

40|$|A{{symmetric}} NG,NG-dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric NG,N'G-dimethylarginine (SDMA) {{are basic}} endogenous amino acids with a guanidino group. Our renal distribution study of dimethylarginines clearly indicates that, in mouse and rat, ADMA and SDMA levels are most abundant as protein-incorporated compounds (95 %). ADMA represents almost 90 % of this protein-incorporated dimethylarginine amount. The four zones studied (cortex, outer and inner stripe of outer medulla, inner medulla) contain {{more or less}} the same amount of protein-incorporated dimethylarginine; the concentrations of both free dimethylarginines vary more in the different zones. Plasma and urinary excretion levels in <b>Man,</b> <b>rat</b> and mouse were determined, their changes in renal insufficiency were examined and compared between species. Highly significant negative correlations between both plasma dimethylarginine levels and creatinine clearances were found in <b>Man</b> and <b>rat.</b> The correlation between urinary ADMA excretion levels and creatinine clearances was highly significant and positive in Man and mouse; however, in rat the correlation was negative. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, ADMA clearance was only 9. 5 % of controls, and that of SDMA only 7. 8 %. Clearance of ADMA and SDMA in nephrectomized mice was 60. 5 % and 53. 8 % of controls, respectively, whereas in nephrectomized rat, ADMA clearance actually increased 5. 4 times and that of SDMA did not change significantly. <b>Man,</b> <b>rat</b> and mouse show similarities as well as differences in metabolismstatus: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Most of the sulfobromophthalein sodium (BSP) {{appearing}} in the bile of <b>man,</b> <b>rat,</b> dog, sheep and cat differs chromatographically from the free BSP originally administered (1 - 4). The altered BSP compounds in <b>man,</b> <b>rat</b> and dog appear to be anmino acid conjugates (2 - 4). Thus, after hydrolysis of the major BSP compounds with 6 N HC 1, several amino acids have been detected by filter paper chromatography. Glycine, glutamic acid and ala-nine were identified in man (2, 3), glycine and glutamic acid in the rat (2) and glycine in the dog (3). Recently, in a preliminary report, Javitt. Wheeler, Baker and Ramiios (5) suggested that BSP appears in bile of the dog as a conjugate of glutathione. These authors found glycine, glu-tamic acid and evidence of free sulfhydryl groups, as miianifested by a positive sodium azide-iodine reaction, after alkaline hydrolysis of the major BSP conjugates. Occasionally, cysteine was de-tectable. BSP conjugates formed in vitro by ad-mixture of BSP and glutathione were identical electrophoretically and chromatographically with conjugates found in bile. Cysteine has also been identified in human BSP conjugates by Grodsky, Carbone and Fanska (4). Cysteine was difficult to detect after hydrolysis with concentrated HCI, but was more clearly demonstrated when the BSP compounds were hydrolyzed with HBr. Glycine and glutamic acid were also detected after hydroly-sis of the BSP conjugates. However, these amino acids were found in hydrolysates of control bile processed {{in the same fashion}} as BSP bile.

40|$|Normal and {{neoplastic}} {{cells from}} 4 species (<b>man,</b> <b>rat,</b> mouse and hamster) were examined for {{their dependence on}} exogenous L-arginine in tissue culture. The malignant cells required a higher concentration of L-arginine in the medium than their normal counterparts (with similar doubling times) to maintain optimal proliferation. Complete arginine deprivation resulted in equal growth inhibition of normal and malignant cells, but more rapid cytolysis of the malignant cell. Deprivation of L-arginine, followed 24 h later by rescue with L-arginine, allowed normal cells to proliferate, but the reproductive capacity of the malignant cells was irreversibly impaired. Since the cytotoxic activity of LPS-activated macrophages {{was associated with the}} release of arginase and was abrogated by excess L-arginine, it is suggested that the biological basis for the selective effects of such macrophages may reside in the L-arginine dependence of the target cells...|$|R
