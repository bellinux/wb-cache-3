5|$|Barbara Gordon <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> cameo {{appearances}} in the first season of the animated series Young Justice, and is added as a recurring character in season two where she has adopted her Batgirl persona. Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series Birds of Prey (2002). Although this series focused on her role as Oracle, the series included flash-backs of the character's history as Batgirl. In the film Batman & Robin, Alicia Silverstone played {{a variation of the}} character: Barbara Wilson, Alfred Pennyworth's niece. She appears in The Lego Batman Movie voiced by Rosario Dawson. The character is introduced as Barbara Gordon taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. Towards the end of the film, she dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this syncline lies the Wellsboro Anticline. South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of fractures in the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys with narrow floodplains. In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider floodplains, less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent. Several miles upstream of the Alvin R. Bush Dam, the creek <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> 180-degree turns. This may eventually cause an oxbow lake to form.|$|E

Language Logs contributors quoted Nature ("riddled with scientific errors"), tracked down references in little-known journals, and presented counterarguments using the same referenced sources that Brizendine's claims drew from to demonstrate their lack of scientific reliability.|$|E

25|$|As of 2009, regular {{services}} operate between Minehead and Bishops Lydeard. The operating season {{runs from}} March to October, with infrequent operations from November through to February. Trains run daily {{during the summer}} but less frequently during {{the remainder of the}} season. Four regular timetables are run on different days depending on expected demand, varying from two to four trains in operation, each of which <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> round trips which gives between four and eight services each way. From February 2009 to January 2010, services were advertised on 243 days. Operating locomotives are based at Minehead and Bishops Lydeard and a spare is generally kept ready at Williton.|$|E
25|$|The ridge rises {{only about}} 40 feet (12 m) above the {{surrounding}} terrain and is under 2 miles (3.2km) long. The northern end rises to become Cemetery Hill, the southern descends to low, wooded, and sometimes marshy ground {{just north of}} Little Round Top. At {{the northern end of}} Cemetery Ridge is a copse of trees and a low stone wall that <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> 90-degree turns; the latter has been nicknamed The Angle and the High Water Mark of the Confederacy. This area, and the nearby Codori Farm on Emmitsburg Road, were prominent features in the progress of Pickett's Charge during the third day of battle, as well as Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division assault on the second.|$|E
25|$|Since Everett's {{original}} work, {{there have}} appeared {{a number of}} similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> assumptions: first, the wavefunction {{is not simply a}} description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the Copenhagen interpretation which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} {{for an early}} date is what some scholars have suggested is an interplay between the Gospel of John and the logia of Thomas. Parallels between the two {{have been taken to}} suggest that Thomas' logia preceded John's work, and that the latter was making a point-by-point riposte to Thomas, either in real or mock conflict. This seeming dialectic has been pointed out by several New Testament scholars, notably Gregory J. Riley, April DeConick, and Elaine Pagels. Though differing in approach, they argue that several verses in the Gospel of John are best understood as responses to a Thomasine community and its beliefs. Pagels, for example, says that John's gospel <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> references to the inability of the world to recognize the divine light. In contrast, several of Thomas' sayings refer to the light born 'within'.|$|E
25|$|In 1599, Abbas {{sent his}} first {{diplomatic}} mission to Europe. The group crossed the Caspian Sea {{and spent the}} winter in Moscow, before proceeding through Norway, Germany (where it was received by Emperor Rudolf II) to Rome where Pope Clement VIII gave the travellers a long audience. They finally arrived at the court of Philip III of Spain in 1602. Although the expedition never managed to return to Iran, being shipwrecked on the journey around Africa, it marked an important new step in contacts between Iran and Europe and Europeans began to be fascinated by the Iranians and their culture – Shakespeare's 1601–02 Twelfth Night, for example, <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> references (at II.5 and III.4) to 'the Sophy', then the English term for the Shahs of Iran. Persian fashions—such as shoes with heels, for men—were enthusiastically adopted by European aristocrats. Henceforward, the number of diplomatic missions to and fro greatly increased.|$|E
25|$|Mullayanagiri: Mullayanagiri {{is part of}} the Baba Budan Giri Hill Ranges here. It stands 1930 meters {{tall and}} is the tallest peak in Karnataka. Its height is famous mostly for {{watching}} sunsets from. It is 16km from Chikmagalur town. Driving to Mullayanagiri is worth taking a risk. On the way is Sitalayanagiri where the water in the Shiva temple neither increases nor decreases. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with a views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is not possible and includes a trek up the hill from the halfway point. There is a temple on top of the hill. From the topmost point of the hill the Arabian Sea is visible on clear days. The small hillock in the temple compound is the highest point in Karnataka. The narrow road to the temple <b>makes</b> <b>two</b> way traffic impossible. It is a great trekking spot in Karnataka.|$|E
