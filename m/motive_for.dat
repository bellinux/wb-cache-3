5|$|At a hotel, Borat, {{just out}} of the bath, sees Azamat masturbating over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the Baywatch booklet. An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{individual differences in}} self-attributed <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> tipping. The findings indicate that: (i) individual differences in various intrinsic motives load on one factor while individual differences in various self-presentational motives load on another factor, (ii) more people claim to tip for intrinsic reasons than for self-presentational reasons, (iii) the self-attributed <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> tipping appear to be largely similar across demographic lines, (iv) individual differences in self-attributed <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> tipping are rooted in more general dispositional tendencies toward conformity and feelings of gratitude, and (v) intrinsic <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> tipping are associated with larger restaurant percentage tips and greater likelihood of nonrestaurant tipping, and (vi) self-presentational <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> tipping are associated with smaller restaurant percentage tips. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with directions for future research...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{self-determination}} theory it is proposed that adolescents' <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> forming and maintaining identity-relevant commitments can be either autonomous or controlled in nature. This study examined whether <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> identity commitments would add {{to the prediction of}} late adolescents' adjustment beyond the effect of strength of commitment per se. In addition, it was examined how late adolescents' identity-processing styles would relate to <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> commitment and whether <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> commitment would mediate between identity styles and adjustment. In a sample of 431 late adolescents it was found that autonomous and controlled motives were, respectively, positively and negatively related to adjustment even after taking into account the role of strength of commitment. Each of the three identity styles showed a specific pattern of associations with the <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> commitment, with an information-oriented style relating to the most autonomous and internalized motivational profile. Mediation analyses showed that {{at least part of the}} associations between identity styles and adjustment are mediated by <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> commitment. Directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Low {{levels of}} {{physical}} activity (PA) during adolescence contribute to obesity and poor health outcomes in adolescence, and these associations endure into adulthood. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the associations between <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> PA and the level of PA among adolescent boys and girls. We obtained data regarding <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> PA and frequency of PA in 2010 via the Health Behavior in School-aged Children cross-sectional study in the Czech and Slovak Republics (n = 9018, mean age = 13. 6, 49 % boys). Respondents answered questions about their <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> PA and the frequency of their PA. <b>Motives</b> <b>for</b> PA were assessed using 13 items, which were structured in four groups. We explored the association between the <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> PA and sufficient PA using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, and separately for boys and girls. “Good child” motives and Achievement motives were significantly associated with sufficient PA among both boys and girls. Health motives were associated with sufficient PA only among boys, and Social motives were associated with sufficient PA only among girls. <b>Motives</b> <b>for</b> PA were associated with the level of PA, and this association was partially gender dependent. These gender differences should be considered in interventions focusing on enhancement of PA...|$|R
5|$|Friendship {{is another}} {{prominent}} element of Live and Let Die, where {{the importance of}} male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter. In turn this provides a strengthened <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> Bond to chase Mr Big as revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.|$|E
5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons.

5|$|The HV offensives {{in western}} Slavonia {{conducted}} in late 1991 (Operations Hurricane-10, Swath-10 and Papuk-91) created {{a total of}} 20,000 Serb refugees. They fled the area when the JNA ordered Croatian Serb forces to withdraw, and were settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The refugee resettlement coincided with Croatian Serb efforts to change the ethnic composition of the Danube area seized in late 1991, providing a secondary <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the expulsion of non-Serb civilians.|$|E
5|$|The alleged <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the {{attempted}} assassination {{was a white}} supremacist belief that an African American should not be elected President of the United States. Gartrell was arrested August 24, 2008, and found to be in possession of rifles and other weaponry; Adolf and Johnson were arrested shortly thereafter. In a televised interview after his arrest, Johnson identified Adolf {{as the man who}} allegedly hatched the assassination plot and planned to be the shooter.|$|E
40|$|The private rented sector varies much in {{size and}} {{character}} between European countries. Several studies from different countries have shown that investors in the sector are a very heterogenous group with many different <b>motives</b> <b>for</b> buying and letting out residential property.

5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the General Accounting Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

They could not understand his <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the attack on Frick. Surely {{it must have been}} a personal dispute or a business quarrel. His explanations were met with condescending smiles. One fellow prisoner, a Homestead worker who was about to stand trial for throwing dynamite at the Pinkertons, told him the workers did not believe in violence. Berkman had no connection with Homestead, and the strike was none of his business. He had only hurt the workers' cause with his action.|$|E
5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they {{have no reason to believe}} that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> the crime was burglary.|$|E
5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

5|$|The {{published}} work was criticised {{on the grounds}} that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that Lancet editor Richard Horton must have had a political <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} the three bears was in {{circulation}} before the publication of Southey's tale. In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's old woman has no <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} <b>motive</b> <b>for</b> men, especially young males, for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E
