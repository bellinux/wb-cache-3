5|$|The {{slightly}} haphazard {{nature of}} the cricket tournament was mirrored {{throughout the rest of}} the 1900 Olympics. Events took place throughout a six-month period from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> until October, and like the Games themselves, were often considered part of the Exposition Universelle, a world's fair held in Paris from 15 April until 12 November 1900.|$|E
5|$|A monsoon is a {{seasonal}} prevailing wind that lasts {{for several months}} within tropical regions. The term was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and neighboring countries {{to refer to the}} big seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the development off a heat low over the Asian, African, and North American continents during <b>May</b> <b>through</b> July, and over Australia in December.|$|E
5|$|Another major human chain, {{which was}} {{expected}} to occur 5 May, was abruptly postponed the previous night by organizers because {{of the impact of}} previous demonstrations. The cancellation was reported throughout Facebook, Twitter, Tamil television and radio stations and word of mouth. Some thought the cancellation was because of the recent swine flu outbreak. The postponed human chain demonstration instead took place on 9 <b>May</b> <b>through</b> Downtown Toronto, reminiscent of the one that occurred on 30 January.|$|E

5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (<b>May</b> <b>through</b> September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage on a limited basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75°F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18°C (64°F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is <b>May</b> <b>through</b> November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The winds are north alizé trade winds.|$|E
5|$|For the U.S. program {{there were}} {{teething}} troubles. There {{was a lack}} of sufficient numbers of sensor strings and controlling the number of aircraft available for the missions proved problematic. These difficulties could be remedied. Commando Hunt II (1 <b>May</b> <b>through</b> 31 October 1969), however, was thrown off track by phenomena that the Air Force could do absolutely nothing about. The first wet season offensive was hampered by atrocious weather, especially heavy rain (48inches of rain in July alone).|$|E

5|$|The 2003 Pacific typhoon {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average yearlong period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting {{the development of}} 45 tropical depressions, of which 21 became named storms; of those, 14 became typhoons. Though every month {{with the exception of}} February and March featured tropical activity, most storms developed from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> October. During the season, tropical cyclones affected the Philippines, Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, Indochina, and various islands in the western Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission {{operates}} {{the visitor center}} {{as part of the}} nearby Drake Well Museum, adjacent to Oil Creek State Park, outside of Titusville. The visitor center contains several exhibits, including a scale model of the city at its peak, an oil-transport wagon that is stuck in mud, and a small, informational theater. The visitor center is usually open, annually, from the Memorial Day weekend, at end of <b>May,</b> <b>through</b> Labor Day in September. The season is kicked off with the annual Wildcatter Day celebration featuring music, tours, demonstrations and other activities.|$|E
5|$|The gallery {{itself was}} a fashionable hit with the public. Newspapers carried updates of the {{construction}} of the gallery, down to drawings for the proposed façade. The Daily Advertiser featured a weekly column on the gallery from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> August (exhibition season).

5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> July, during the cold, rainy season, {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, rainy season.|$|E
5|$|Annual average {{precipitation}} is , {{with most of}} it occurring during the wet season from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> October. However, rainfall occurs in all months, even during the drier months from November through April, mainly as short-lived heavy afternoon thunderstorms. Fort Lauderdale has an average of 143 rain days and 250 sunshine days annually. The hurricane season is between June 1 and November 30 with major hurricanes most likely to affect the city or state in September and October. The most recent storms to directly affect the city were Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma, both of which struck the city in 2005. Other direct hits were Hurricane Cleo in 1964, Hurricane King in 1950, and the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane.|$|E
5|$|However, no {{progress}} was made with the airfield for over a decade. Instead, the water aerodrome at Bukta was upgraded. Initially the passengers were transported to the aircraft with a boat, {{but after a few}} years a floating dock was built. Services were only provided during five summer months, from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> September. During the rest of the year, Alta had no airline service; travel time to Oslo was then six days, largely by ship. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1954, who bought a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter to serve a route from Tromsø via Alta to Hammerfest, Kirkenes and Vadsø. In Tromsø, the routes connected with a Norwegian Air Lines' seaplane service to Oslo. Bukta had 2,000 annual passengers in 1957, and the summer route was flown daily beginning in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Lemurs {{time their}} mating and birth seasons {{so that all}} weaning periods are {{synchronized}} to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' sifaka, {{has been shown to}} be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, but from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from <b>May</b> <b>through</b> July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, wet soil. Maturity is reached in five to eight months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian {{surrender}} {{came into}} effect at 04:00 on 28 May. Recriminations abounded with the British and French claiming the Belgians had betrayed the alliance. In Paris, the French Premier Paul Reynaud denounced Leopold's surrender, and the Belgian Premier Hubert Pierlot informed {{the people that}} Leopold had taken action against the unanimous advice of the government. As a result, the king {{was no longer in}} a position to govern and the Belgian government in exile that was located in Paris (later moved to London following the fall of France) would continue the struggle. The chief complaint was that the Belgians had not given any prior warning that their situation was so serious as to capitulate. Such claims were largely unjust. The Allies had known, and admitted it privately on 25 <b>May</b> <b>through</b> contact with the Belgians, that the latter {{were on the verge of}} collapse.|$|E
