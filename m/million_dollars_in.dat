40|$|An {{article in}} journal : Obesity Medicine 6 (2017) 18 - 22 Aims: To {{estimate}} {{current and future}} direct cost of diabetes and its complications for the period 2010 and 2030. Methods: This study is a prevalence-based approach that combines model-based forecasts of diabetes prevalence rates from the validated OPT IMPACT Diabetes forecast model, diabetes complications prevalence rates and health care costs and economic data. We use a societal and health care perspective and a time horizon to 2030, and costs were estimated as international US dollar adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). Results: The estimated direct costs for diabetes per person in 2012 was 1087 PPP dollars (281 - 1895 PPP dollar) and the direct costs of diabetes and its complications was 2156 PPP dollar (981 - 4508 PPP dollar). The estimated diabetes direct cost for the year 2012 was 184 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar</b> (47 e 320 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar).</b> The cost {{is expected to increase}} to 209 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar</b> (54 e 364 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar)</b> <b>in</b> 2015, 248 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar</b> (64 e 432 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar)</b> <b>in</b> 2020 and 300 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar</b> (77 e 523 <b>million</b> PPP <b>dollar)</b> <b>in</b> 3030 with 3 % discounting rate assumption.

5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and his hard money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. The import tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857. Between February 17 and May 1 of 1861, 65% of all government revenue was raised from the import tariff. However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent. Secretary of Treasure Memminger had expected that the tariff would bring in about 25 <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>in</b> revenue in the first year alone. In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E
