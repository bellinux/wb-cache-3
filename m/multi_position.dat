40|$|Electric {{energy meters}} are {{designed}} to account energy under sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal conditions, because both, old and new standards for energy meters require testing their accuracy under different conditions. The latest EN 50470 standard increases the range of meter testing under nonsinusoidal conditions, introducing new shapes of test signals such as the phase fired waveform or the burst fired waveform. This paper discusses calibration problems of electronic revenue energy meters for direct connection and for connection through current transformers, and it proposes a new calibration procedure which reproduces normal operating conditions better: three-phase configurations of measurement systems, load range during meter testing or shapes of test signals. Recently, modern Electrical Power Standards, also known as Power Calibrators, enable automatic testing of various types of electrical devices, including electricity meters in their normal operating conditions. This article presents examples of single and <b>multi</b> <b>position</b> fully automatic test systems, which employ Power/Energy Calibrator from Poland as the precision source with programmed waveforms of three phase voltages up to 560 V and currents up to 120 A conforming to EN 50470, or with random waveforms generated by PC software random wave generator. Measurement uncertainty of the energy meters under different nonsinusoidal conditions using a test system with reference to accuracy of the power calibrator or to the reference meter, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to re-think {{the meaning of}} Digital Media in Internet era in according to the “Message-Carrier Model” by Naoki Takubo the model dubbed “Quantity of Receivers which the Transmitter of Media supposes” by Masataka Yano. Takubo’s Model proceeds {{from the perspective of}} the construction of Digital Media. In this model, “the Carrier” of which Digital Media are considered only one part is monaural. In contrast, this paper argues that the Carrier is built up from several layers. These are: 1) the Material Layer, 2) the Format Layer, 3) the Program Layer and 4) the Data Layer. Especially the third and fourth layer have some mobilities due to TCP/IP as Format Layer in Internet Era. The Program Layer acquires a character defined the recursivity as it comprises the composition of programs within the uncompleted programs (compare, for instance, the recursive definition on LISP). In other words, i. e. the program is not the stock/ commodity, but also a co-programming work. The Program Layer has changed into what should be called the Recursive Program Layer in Internet era. The Data Layer, on the other hand, bears the earmarks of a sort of programmability that keeps to ready for being programmed the digital data is not only the material, but also a material that is waiting for be programmed. In the Internet era, the Data Layer has been transformed into what should be called Programable Data Layer. Yano’s Model is, as it said, considers Media relative to its handler, e. g. the author/producer - the user. This paper stresses that a yet different relationship should be added to. In the Internet era, somebody connecting to an element of information in Internet takes the <b>multi</b> <b>position</b> of both transmitter and receiver at the same time, and this in a very strict sense -because of the character of conx nection by TCP/IP. If looked at from this perspective, Digital Media acquire a character that is still different, i. e. as a gateway to programs of contents by users. If these interpretations were applied to Digital Database in,the meaning of “lost” or “deterioration” would change into the likes of “useless” or “forgetting”. Data preservation is thus not only a matter of ‘storing or saving’ data, but also guaranteeing“accessibiy to them”. Such guarantee presupposes two conditions.. On the one hand, it presupposes, it is “the condition-free possibility to program each databases by anyone via APIs”. It hints at the possibility of expanding the means of manipulating data and ensuring to keep the recursive way of the collaboration with Databases, i. e, “Re-Constituting a Database by some Databases”. To keep the open accessability is in other words identical to saving databases. Second, scholars should become aware of their responsibility in the age of information ubiquity. We need to recognize the importance of “brushing the Quality of Data in a recursive manner” by means Internet. It it the most important thing for scholar’s works in domain of databases not to constrain themselves to elaborate design of the interface of digital databases or intricate programming, but also, to collect the current databases and to costruct and preserve a data matrix. Finally, the meaning of using digital databases for scholars would be to build their databases in comparison to ones also, data collection and presentation should be considered as a means of scientific publishing in its own right...|$|E

40|$|Today s {{position}} measurement {{systems are}} restricted to systems based on lateral Hall-Sensors and, hence, suffer from low robustness concerning temper-ature dependency and disturbing external magnetic fields. With the application of 3 D magnetic field sensors new principles in signal conditioning can be applied. Position values are then calculated from the complete flux vector and not only from a single component of the magnetic field. Thus it is possible either to perform <b>multi</b> axis <b>position</b> measurement or to use gradient approaches to come to more robust systems. The drawback of these approaches is that the complexity of system design increases. So {{it is necessary to}} set up new development methodolo-gies for such multidimensional systems.

The FE board {{is designed to be}} located in the SPS tunnel, where it must withstand radiation doses of up to 100 Gy per year. Analogue components, such as Logarithmic Amplifiers (LA), ADC-Drivers (ADC-D) and Voltage Regulators (VR), have been tested at PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute) for radiation hardness, while several families of bidirectional SFP, both single-fiber and double-fiber, have been tested at both PSI and CNRAD.

Treatment planning system gives an optimal fluence; this fluence distribution is delivered by various <b>multi</b> leave <b>positions</b> called segments for various beams. An evaluation of the verification of the intensity modulated beams {{is very important in}} the process of verification of the IMRT plan to the treatment delivery. A 2 -dimensional diode array called the MapChek is used for all quality assurance tests. The conventional film or extended range film EDR- 2 has been extensively used for the quality assurance of IMRT. The use of film involves many steps where as the use of the 2 -d diode array is straight forward and less time consuming. The results obtained from the MapCheck diode array system will be compared with the results from the conventional use of film for quality assurance. Other methods used for IMRT quality assurance are being investigated are electronic portal imaging device (EPID). The objectives are to introduce the MapChech, the set up, calibration of diode array, making the beam fluence measurements, analysis and results about the IMRT QA with MapCheck.
