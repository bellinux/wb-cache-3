5|$|Among {{the critics}} of using Sangam {{literature}} for historical studies is Herman Tieken, who maintains that the Sangam poems were composed in the 8th or 9th century and that they attempt to describe a period <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> when they were written.|$|E
5|$|Metallic zinc was {{isolated}} in India by 1300 AD, <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> in the West. Before it {{was isolated}} in Europe, it was imported from India in about 1600 CE. Postlewayt's Universal Dictionary, a contemporary source giving technological information in Europe, {{did not mention}} zinc before 1751 but the element was studied before then.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of Gubazes's {{accession}} is unknown, but it {{must not}} have been <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> 541, when he is first attested as king of the Lazi. It is very likely that before his accession he had lived for several years at the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, for he is recorded {{to have been a}} silentiarius, an influential position at the imperial palace; alternatively, but less probably, he may have been given the title as an honorary appointment after his accession.|$|E
50|$|According to some evidence, however, it {{dates to}} a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> time <b>than</b> the Silla dynasty. Recent archaeological {{excavations}} in the Kwangsan areas in Jeolla-namdo Provincer revealed fragments of a Gayageum {{from around the}} 1st century BCE.|$|R
50|$|The 2002 Holiday Teddy {{was also}} solid green {{like that of}} 2001, but it was made with a hat that had reindeer-like antlers. It retired at a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> date <b>than</b> {{previous}} ones - in early November.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} General Lockhart, himself, {{went out with}} a strong force {{to the top of}} Saransur; but met with little resistance, and the force {{returned}} at a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> hour <b>than</b> on the previous occasion, and reached camp before nightfall.|$|R
5|$|Blacklock, racing {{under his}} {{name for the}} first time, started the 1818 season <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> he had done the {{previous}} two seasons, with his first race coming on 18 May at the York Spring Meeting in a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each over two miles. He started as the 1/2 favourite, but could only finish third behind St. Helena. Two days later he started as the 4/6 favourite for the Constitution Stakes over a mile-and-a-quarter. He biggest rival {{was expected to be}} the Duke of Leeds's Rasping, who was priced at 2/1. Blacklock won the race from Rasping, with Hornby in third and Whiff last of the four runners.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Fort Lewis, Washington was {{notified}} {{of a major}} change of structure. A corps headquarters was to be activated in March 1982. I Corps was formally activated on 1 October 1981, <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> expected. On 1 August 1983, the corps expanded its operational control of active Army units outside Fort Lewis, to include the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord, California, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade in Alaska, which then {{became part of the}} 6th Infantry Division. In 1988, the distinctive unit insignia was approved for the corps. This was the fourth design held by the corps, with previous versions being approved then retracted in 1942, 1970, and 1982.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that the idea of}} annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry's father Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II on the grounds that Catherine was still a virgin.|$|E
50|$|The archaeological {{excavations}} detailed above {{suggest a}} <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> civilization <b>than</b> the 12th century. The Lordship of Acy {{appeared in the}} Middle Ages through the record of particular lords. Until the 17th century the lordship was {{the property of the}} Colbert family.|$|R
50|$|H. Łowmiański {{thought that}} Nadruvian and Scalovian tribes had changed ethnically due to Lithuanian {{colonization}} {{as early as}} times of tribal social order. Linguist Z. Zinkevičius has presumed that Nadruvians and Skalovians were transitive tribes between Lithuanians and Prussians since <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> times <b>than</b> German invasion had occurred.|$|R
50|$|In antiquity the {{sea level}} {{was a few}} metes lower than today. Greek and etrurian trays reveal <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> {{settlements}} <b>than</b> expected. Chioggia (Clodia) was a Roman military colony and in the Fontego dei Turchi above the Canal Grande a coin {{from the days of}} emperor Trajan was found.|$|R
5|$|The Amaury Sport Organisation {{announced}} the wildcard entries to the Tour de France in January, <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> in past years. Team Europcar had among their number French national champion Voeckler, though he lost that title {{shortly before the}} Tour, a de facto national hero after he wore the yellow jersey for ten days in the 2004 Tour de France. Confident of their inclusion, they were indeed among the four teams added to the 18 UCI ProTeams obligated to attend. Voeckler was named as the squad leader, with Charteau and Kern his top support riders. Gène was also named to the squad, the first black rider in the Tour's history. The team started quietly, with no rider finishing {{near the front of}} the race on stage 1 at the Mont des Alouettes and 13th of 22 teams in the stage 2 team time trial. The team did not really figure into the sprint finishes that happened early in the Tour, having left their best sprinter Chavanel off the squad for the Tour. Turgot's eighth place in stage 7 was their highest such finish.|$|E
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Millar's {{opinion of}} these novel {{handicraft}} remains {{was that they}} [...] were the products of a pre-Celtic civilisation. [...] "The articles found," [...] he writes, [...] "are strongly indicative of a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> period <b>than</b> post- [...] Roman; they point to an occupation of a tribe in their Stone Age." ...|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, Huju adapted {{many modern}} plays. It adopted {{divisions}} of acts and recognized {{the role of}} the playwright and director at a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> time <b>than</b> other similar art forms. Red Lantern and Shajiabang—the most influential Jingju (Peking opera) plays among the eight model plays created during the Cultural Revolution—were both adapted from Huju plays.|$|R

25|$|Like {{the coins}} for this series, {{some of the}} {{denominations}} were initially printed in 2002 but were never released into circulation, pointing to a planned monetary revaluation <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> 2009 that was never carried out.|$|E
25|$|Parents become {{concerned}} <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> doctors. A {{study in}} 1980 asked parents and physicians the age that children should stay dry at night. The average parent response was 2.75 years old, {{while the average}} physician response was 5.13 years old.|$|E
50|$|The Aalesund ship is {{an ancient}} vessel which was {{discovered}} embedded in the earth south of Aalesund, Norway in 1920. It is considered of a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> construction <b>than</b> either the Oseberg ship or the Gokstad ship, both of which date to the ninth century. The Aalesund ship dates to the fourth century and was built during the iron age.|$|R
50|$|A 'sanctuary stone' in the kirkyard {{marks the}} centre of an 'area of sanctuary' that once {{extended}} one Scots mile around. The east and west 'sanctuary stones' still stand in their original positions. It {{has been suggested that}} these stones are of <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> origin <b>than</b> the medieval Preceptory, possibly being related to the important Neolithic henge and burial mound at Cairnpapple Hill, to the east.|$|R
50|$|Recent studies {{showcase}} that ambulocetids {{were fully}} aquatic like modern cetaceans, possessing a similar thoraxic morphology and {{being unable to}} support their weight on land. This suggests that complete abandonment of the land evolved <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> among cetaceans <b>than</b> previously thought.|$|R
25|$|Mogami was {{scrapped}} on 1 April 1928.

25|$|The {{preservation}} of the laryngeals, {{and the lack of}} evidence that Hittite shared certain grammatical features possessed by the other early Indo-European languages, has led some philologists to believe that the Anatolian languages split from the rest of Proto-Indo-European <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> the other divisions of the proto-language – see Classification above.|$|E
25|$|The Central Bank of Ireland {{failed to}} spot Madoff's {{gigantic}} fraud, {{when he started}} using Irish funds and had to supply large amounts of information {{which would have been}} enough to enable Irish regulators to uncover the fraud <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> late 2008 when he was finally arrested in New York.|$|E
40|$|Beta-amyloid (Au) aggregation, {{believed}} {{to be responsible for}} Alzheimer's disease, is monitored using its intrinsic fluorescence decay. Alterations in the fluorescence decay of tyrosine correlate with the A beta aggregation at a <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> stage <b>than</b> the traditionally used fluorescence intensity of Thioflavin T (ThT).

50|$|Evidence exists {{showing that}} Hunmanby was {{occupied}} by <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> people <b>than</b> the Danes. A landslip occurred in 1907 revealing a British chariot burial site from the 1st or 2nd century BC, in which a chariot was buried horse and all. A tumulus on a local farm was opened up to reveal an ancient burial site containing 15 skeletons. Roman pottery and flint axe and arrowheads are frequently found in and around Hunmanby.|$|R
25|$|The eastern wolf {{primarily}} targets {{small to}} medium-sized prey items like white-tailed deer and beaver, unlike the gray wolf which can effectively hunt large ungulates like caribou, elk, moose and bison. The average territory ranges between 110–185km², and the earliest age of dispersal for young eastern wolves is 15 weeks, <b>much</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>than</b> gray wolves.|$|E
25|$|According to Rowland Bowen in his Growth and Development of Cricket, {{the first}} {{reference}} to cricket being {{played in the}} county of Berkshire was in 1751.
