40|$|AbstractThis article exposes a {{solution}} to ensure Closed-Loop Manufacturing from CNC machines to CAM systems. The main goal is to capitalize knowledge from the CNC machine and to reuse it in the CAM system. This proposal aims to help CAM programmers in making choices for planning new machining sequences. The STEP-NC standard allows bi-directional exchanges in the digital chain – from CAD systems to CNC machines. Unfortunately, STEP-NC standard does not allow having a traceability of machining program. To achieve the information feedback from CNC machine to CAM system, Closed-Loop Manufacturing sets up a manufacturing loop using PLM systems. This solution is based on OntoSTEP-NC, an ontology based on STEP-NC which provides trades between Product Data Management, <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Management</b> and Enterprise Resource Planning. As {{a solution}} OntoSTEP-NC supports data extraction from CNC machines, and relevant information reinjection to CAM systems. Closed-Loop Manufacturing is a three steps process: (1) Manufacturing feature recognition {{to have the most}} relevant information reinjection from the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Management</b> database in the CAM programming stage, (2) validation of machining sequences before capitalizing them, (3) capitalization of cutting parameters, the manufacturing feature and the material to fill the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Management</b> database. This process will help CAM programmers making choices for cutting conditions based on company good practices. A case study has been chosen to test Closed-Loop Manufacturing concepts. The case study is divided into three scenarios aiming at testing first the “reuse phase” including manufacturing feature recognition for the reinjection of relevant information. The third scenario tests the “capitalization phase” and the ability of the system to detect the changes made by the operator directly on the CNC machine. This paper also details the trades between the CAM systems and OntoSTEP-NC by focusing on extracted data and the way the information is capitalized into the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Management</b> database. It also details the queries addressed to the <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Management</b> database to send the most relevant information...|$|E

The literature characterizing the relationship between EM and OM has broadly investigated {{the positive effects of}} environmental practices on plant performance, but has paid little attention to their implementation. However, there is not a unique way to implement EM–OM, and different levels of integration might be attained. We draw on the contingency approach and project management literature to study how and under what conditions EM–OM might be integrated. Based on the analysis of six pollution prevention projects at three large multinational firms, we find that EM–OM integration is contingent upon the degree of project uncertainty and project complexit...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing number}} of organisations are using radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) technology to improve their manufacturing processes. A case study approach is used to explore {{the development of an}} RFID-based <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> <b>management</b> system in a garment factory in China. The results indicate that both technology push and need pull factors influence the garment factory's intention to adopt RFID technology. The technology push factors include relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, extendibility and the cost of the technology, whereas the need pull factors include competitor and customer pressure. We identify eight factors for the successful implementation of an RFID-based <b>manufacturing</b> <b>process</b> <b>management</b> system, namely, vendor selection, organisational motivation, cost/benefit evaluation, top management support, user involvement, the extent of progress supervision, staff competence and training, and policy, structure and operating process compatibility.
