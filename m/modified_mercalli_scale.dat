25|$|The {{earthquake}} was {{the last}} large event to occur along {{that portion of the}} San Andreas Fault, and was estimated to have a maximum perceived intensity of IX (Violent) on the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> (MM) near Fort Tejon in the Tehachapi Mountains, and along the San Andreas Fault from Mil Potrero (near Pine Mountain Club) in the San Emigdio Mountains to Lake Hughes in the Sierra Pelona Mountains. Accounts of the events' effects varied widely, including the time of the main shock as well as foreshocks that occurred at several locations earlier in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Reports of the quake's {{intensity}} in Christchurch generally ranged from IV to VIII (moderate to severe) on the <b>modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale.</b> A strong smell of sulphur was widely reported in Christchurch following the earthquake. Sewers were damaged, and water lines were broken. The water supply at Rolleston, located {{to the southwest}} of Christchurch, was contaminated. Power to up to 75 {{percent of the city}} was disrupted. Christchurch Hospital was forced to use emergency generators {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the quake. About 90% of the electricity in Christchurch had been restored by 6:00pm the day of the earthquake. The repair of electricity was estimated to be more difficult in the rural areas. One building caught fire after its electricity was turned back on, igniting leaking LPG in the building. The fire was quickly extinguished by the Fire Service before it could spread. Damage to buried pipes may have allowed sewage to contaminate the residential water supply. Residents were warned to boil tap water before using it for brushing teeth, drinking, and washing or cooking food. Several cases of gastroenteritis were reported. By 7 September 28 cases had been observed at the city's welfare centres. The boil water notice for Christchurch and Banks Peninsula was lifted late on 8 September 2010, after more than 500 tests conducted over three days found no contamination.|$|E
500|$|The region {{near the}} triple {{junction}} experiences high seismicity, {{with more than}} 60 earthquakes of intensity VI (Strong) or greater or magnitudes ≥ 5.5 since 1853. The mainshock in the sequence (11:06a.m. Pacific Daylight Time) occurred onshore, [...] west of Petrolia {{at a depth of}} 10.5 kilometers, and was among an infrequent number of earthquakes with fault-plane solutions that conveyed evidence of slip at the Cascadia subduction zone. While the focal mechanism indicated slip on a thrust fault striking N.10°W with a shallow dip of 13° to the east-northeast, the rupture most likely propagated to the west, based on the mainshock location at the southeastern boundary of the aftershock zone. Investigation of more than 1,200 surveys from the North Coast area led to the assignment of an intensity rating of IX (Violent) on the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> <b>scale</b> for the region near Petrolia.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{destructive}} earthquake in Santa Barbara history, {{and the first}} destructive earthquake in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, occurred on June 29, 1925, converting much of the town to heaps of rubble. While the quake's epicenter was centered on an undetermined fault offshore, most of the damage came about due to two strong aftershocks which occurred onshore and five minutes apart.

50|$|At the {{epicenter}} of the 1935 Timiskaming earthquake, cracks in gravel and sand could be seen. Almost all chimneys were damaged or destroyed, and some cracks developed in brick walls. These conditions persisted 110 km away from {{the epicenter}}. The next day, Tee Lake (close to the epicenter) was clouded.

50|$|The {{epicenter}} {{is believed}} to have been located southeast of Neulengbach, about 30-40 km west of Vienna, in a flat dipping and North-South striking thrust fault that is part of the Vienna Transform fault zone. This moderately-active fault system extends over a distance of some 300 km from the Northern Limestone Alps through the Vienna Basin into the West Carpathian Mountains. The temblor's energy release is estimated at 5.5-6.0 on the Richter magnitude scale and it had class VII intensity on the <b>modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> intensity <b>scale</b> in most of Lower Austria.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of the}} shaking intensity noted in Andrew Lawson's (1908) report was the clear correlation of intensity with underlying geologic conditions. Areas situated in sediment-filled valleys sustained stronger shaking than nearby bedrock sites, and the strongest shaking occurred in areas of former bay where soil liquefaction had occurred. Modern seismic-zonation practice accounts for the differences in seismic hazard posed by varying geologic conditions. The shaking intensity as described on the <b>Modified</b> <b>Mercalli</b> intensity <b>scale</b> reached XI (Extreme) in San Francisco and areas to the north like Santa Rosa where destruction was devastating.|$|R
