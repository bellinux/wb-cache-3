2500|$|After {{burying the}} dead and resting the survivors, Lukin {{advanced}} to Sidi Barrani and entered unopposed on 28 February. On 2 March, two reconnaissance aircraft was sent from Matruh and on 8 March the aircraft flew to Sidi Barrani to search from Sidi Barrani to Sollum. The WFF had gained a base [...] further west than Matruh but could only land supplies in good weather and {{had to rely on}} the overland route until the navy caught up. As soon as the British were established at Sidi Barrani, Lukin returned as many horses and gunners as possible to reduce the demand for food, which by camel convoy took four days and needed [...] for each journey. Delivery of supplies by sea was complicated by the fear of German submarines but had been completed by 4 March, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> return the bulk of the WFF to Sidi Barrani by 7 March. Many units had been posted away and new ones sent forward, including the Cavalry Corps Motor Machine-Gun Battery, with [...] armoured cars and [...] The Khedival Road to Sollum followed the coast and the inland escarpment which was [...] from the coast at Sidi Barrani converged with the coast at Sollum.|$|E
2500|$|By the 16th century, {{the humanist}} {{ideas of the}} Renaissance (14th–16th century) were slowly accepted; France had {{propagated}} them first to Germany, then to England, during the Protestant Reformation (1517). In that intellectual humanist mode, university education began including preparing the student for a civilized life — of culture and civility — and concern for society’s public affairs. To achieve that, the curriculum comprised the liberal arts Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, logic), and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music) meant {{to prepare students for}} further specialized education in either theology, the law, or medicine. In 1492, the socio-political consequences of the discovery of the New World expanded European university curricula, as human rights and international law became contemporarily relevant matters. The Spanish enslavement of the native (aboriginal) populaces they conquered in the [...] “New World” of the Americas eventually raised ethico-moral questions in Europe about the human rights of the American aboriginals — questions of cultural tolerance evinced by Renaissance humanism, the Bible, and mediæval theories of natural law. In analogy to the ancient world’s works, Rüegg relates the “New World” idea to the idea of “new knowledge”. In the mid-16th century, scholarly and scientific journals <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> “spread innovations among the learned”; by the 18th century, universities published their own research journals. In the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment also encouraged education’s transition, from the “preservation and transmission of accepted knowledge” to the “discovery and advancement of new knowledge”; the newer universities effected that change more quickly, and adapted Enlightenment ideas about the harmfulness of monarchic Absolutism more readily than did the older universities.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} was towards faster chariots with spoke-wheels. Lighter wheels made lighter constructions possible. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> outrun light {{infantry}} and other chariots. Plus the development of short composite bows that made it a devastating weapon.|$|E
25|$|There was an {{argument}} that community services would be cheaper. It was suggested that new psychiatric medications <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> release people into the community.|$|R
50|$|Before the 2004/2005 {{academic}} year, {{the newspaper}} was printed biweekly in broadsheet format. In {{the fall of}} 2004, the editorial staff scaled the paper down to tabloid format which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> financially <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> print on a weekly basis.|$|R

It replaced the QT-8D's integrated power supply with a rechargeable battery pack, but it was otherwise nearly identical to the QT-8D.|$|R
5000|$|Bernardi. The Bernardi had {{the size}} and comfort {{provisions}} of the Bearcat, but a moderate exterior redesign made it resemble the 1950s British MG TD. Engine options included the four-cylinder choices of the Bantam, {{as well as the}} Ford 2.8 liter V6.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of double-sided, double density minifloppy drives, the storage capacity of a single floppy became approximately 360K bytes (the same as the original IBM-PC floppy drive capacity). This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> store Exec, applications and data on a single floppy. The System 8810 was functionally identical to the 8813, but in a smaller chassis, with 5 slots and only one minifloppy drive.|$|E

50|$|Refined salt for {{domestic}} use {{is made by}} evaporating salt water in large open vats using ovens with rice husks used as the fuel source. This method produces very clean, fine grained salt in which the impurities are removed during cooking. Traditionally, the stove used in salt making was wood-fueled. Wood became more expensive, prompting a shift to rice hull stoves. The abundance of rice hulls has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> economically <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> reprocess the salt and is a renewable source of fuel. The residue, rice hull ash, (RHA) is then sold back to farmers for use as fertilizer.|$|R
5000|$|LINCtape, and its derivative, DECtape, were {{variations}} on this [...] "round tape". They were essentially a personal storage medium. The tape was 0.75 in wide and featured a fixed formatting track which, unlike standard tape, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> read and rewrite blocks repeatedly in place. LINCtapes and DECtapes had similar capacity and {{data transfer rate}} to the diskettes that displaced them, but their [...] "seek times" [...] were {{on the order of}} thirty seconds to a minute.|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1995, Sega AM2's Sega Saturn division was split into three sub-departments, each one charged with porting a different arcade game to the Saturn: Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop, and Daytona USA. Due to unexpectedly slow progress in the Daytona USA port, a number {{of members of the}} Virtua Fighter 2 team were reassigned to Daytona USA. In March, AM2 Research completed the Sega Graphics Library, a Saturn operating system which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> create a near-arcade perfect port of Virtua Fighter 2 for the Saturn.|$|E
50|$|Ingarö is {{an island}} in Värmdö Municipality, Stockholm County. The chief {{settlement}} is called Brunn. With an area of 63 km2, it is the 16th biggest island in Sweden. Petroglyphs indicate that the island has been inhabited since the Nordic Bronze Age. For most of the 20th century the resident population decreased, {{while at the same}} time many vacation homes were built. However, in recent years population has grown as new homes are being built and vacation homes are being converted into permanent homes.

5000|$|The Industrial Revolution {{brought the}} first barbed wire (also [...] "barbwire" [...] or just [...] "barb") fences, which were widely used after their {{introduction}} in the mid-19th century. This technology <b>made</b> <b>it</b> economically <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> fence rangeland {{for the first}} time. In the United States, introduction of barbed wire contributed to the range wars of that century, as various ranch interests attempted to use barbed wire fences to claim exclusive access to the best pasture and water resources, including those lands in the public domain. It also exacerbated tensions between cattle ranchers and crop farmers, partly when access to water was involved.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{progress}} in deep reinforcement learning has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> increasingly <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> train controllers for high-dimensional humanoid bodies. However, methods that use pure reinforcement learning with simple reward functions tend to produce non-humanlike and overly stereotyped movement behaviors. In this work, we extend generative adversarial imitation learning to enable training of {{generic neural network}} policies to produce humanlike movement patterns from limited demonstrations consisting only of partially observed state features, without access to actions, even when the demonstrations come from a body with different and unknown physical parameters. We leverage this approach to build sub-skill policies from motion capture data and show {{that they can be}} reused to solve tasks when controlled by a higher level controller...|$|R
5000|$|Electrical {{recording}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> record {{one part}} to disc and then play that back while playing another part, recording both parts {{to a second}} disc. This and conceptually related techniques, known as overdubbing, enabled studios to create recorded [...] "performances" [...] that feature one or more artists each singing multiple parts or playing multiple instrument parts and that therefore could not be duplicated by the same artist or artists performing live. The first commercially issued records using overdubbing were released by the Victor Talking Machine Company in the late 1920s. However overdubbing was of limited use until the advent of audio tape. Use of tape overdubbing was pioneered by Les Paul in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, Russian cars, {{especially}} Pobeda and Volga, {{dominated the}} taxi market in Finland for several years. In the late 1950s the import restriction on cars was lifted for taxi operators, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> import western cars in larger numbers. By {{the end of}} 1960s Mercedes-Benz in particular had gained a dominant position, accounting for up to half the taxi stock, and the Finnish distributor of Mercedes, VEHO, even has a separate taxi sales department. Mercedes has remained the archetypal taxi ever since, although other makes such as Volvo (especially estate models) and the VAG brands are also common.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{the scope}} of genetic {{epidemiology}} has expanded to include common diseases for which many genes each make a smaller contribution (polygenic, multifactorial or multigenic disorders). This has developed rapidly {{in the first decade}} of the 21st century following completion of the Human Genome Project, as advances in genotyping technology and associated reductions in cost has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> conduct large-scale genome-wide association studies that genotype many thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms in thousands of individuals. These have led to the discovery of many genetic polymorphisms that influence the risk of developing many common diseases.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins and}} history of {{recombinant}} inbred strains are described by Crow. While the potential utility of recombinant inbred strains in mapping analysis of complex polygenic traits was obvious from the outset, {{the small number of}} strains only <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> map quantitative traits with very large effects (quasi-Mendelian loci). One of the initial motivations to use recombinant inbred strains is that expensive genotype data can be accumulated and reused - greatly simplifying mapping studies. Another factor is the precision of mapping that can be achieved using these strains compared to typical F2 intercross progeny.|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{reality has}} {{achieved}} an adequate {{level of development}} {{for it to be}} considered in innovative applications such as education, training, and research in higher education. Virtual reality offers both opportunities and challenges for the educational sector. One of the challenges of virtual reality technology is the costs associated which have been unaffordable for educational institutes. However, in recent years, computer hardware and software development has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> more <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> incorporate virtual reality technology into future teaching strategies. Despite the cost challenges, educational benefits of implementing virtual reality remain compelling.

5000|$|Johann II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar (or John II), {{died young}} leaving eight {{surviving}} sons (including Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the youngest, the famed general) and a will ordering them to rule jointly. When {{the eldest of}} them, John Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Weimar died in action (1626) unmarried, two more of his brothers were already deceased without children, leaving five dukes of Saxe-Weimar, with Wilhelm the eldest. Two more died within fifteen years, including Bernhard in 1639, without heirs. In 1638, the senior Coburg-Eisenach line became extinct and its possessions were divided between the Altenburgs and the Weimars, this doubled the Saxe-Weimar possessions and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> again <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> be divided.

40|$|Meta-analysis {{is widely}} used to {{synthesize}} the results of multiple studies. Although meta-analysis is traditionally carried out by combining the summary statistics of relevant studies, advances in technologies and communications have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> increasingly <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> access the original data on individual participants. In the present paper, we investigate the relative efficiency of analyzing original data versus combining summary statistics. We show that, for all commonly used parametric and semiparametric models, there is no asymptotic efficiency gain by analyzing original data if the parameter of main interest has a common value across studies, the nuisance parameters have distinct values among studies, and the summary statistics are based on maximum likelihood. We also assess the relative efficiency of the two methods when the parameter of main interest has different values among studies or when there are common nuisance parameters across studies. We conduct simulation studies to confirm the theoretical results and provide empirical comparisons from a genetic association study. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Fine-grained {{user profile}} {{generation}} approaches have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> increasingly <b>feasible</b> <b>to</b> display on a profile page in which topics a user has expertise or interest. Earlier work on topical user profiling {{has been directed}} at enhancing search and personalization functionality, but making such profiles useful for human consumption presents new challenges.

We have developed a topical generalization approach which finds coherent groups of topics and adds labels to them, based on their association with broader topics in the Wikipedia category graph. A nested layout mode, employing topical generalization, is compared with a simpler flat layout mode in our user study. The results indicate that users favor the nested structure over flat profiles, but tend to overlook the specific topics on the lower level. We propose a third layout mode to address this issue.
