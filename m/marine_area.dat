A 1940 report mentioned several worms like Nematodes, Archiannelida, Oligochaeta and Turbellaria, crustaceans like ostracods, and ciliate protozoans in the sands of the Kniepsand beach.

25|$|In 1967 it was {{set apart}} by the State {{division}} of Fish and Game as a Marine Protected Area, a term used generically to describe any <b>marine</b> <b>area</b> that had {{some or all of}} its resources protected. In Hanauma Bay's case everything became protected, from the fish to the reef, to the sand itself. A volunteer group set up a booth at the beach and began teaching visitors about conservation of the reef and fish who lived there. More changes in the 1970s by the City cleared more area in the reef for swimming, made an additional parking lot, and shipped in white sand from the North Shore, leaving Hanauma Bay increasingly more attractive to visitors.|$|E

2500|$|When {{it turned}} to the environment, the Carbon Tax {{proposal}} came up repeatedly, with both Dion and May supporting it, although May to more ambitious figures than Dion, pointing out {{it was the most}} recommended and proven way to deal with carbon emissions by countries and organizations around the world, noting the growth that Sweden and Germany have had with this system. Harper criticized the plan, saying would increase taxpayers' burden and that Dion should be [...] "honest with the people" [...] that some environmental measures will cost the economy and said the plan includes $40 billion in carbon taxes and $26 billion in tax cuts. Dion defended the Liberal's Green Shift, saying that [...] " [...] not true at all", and that [...] "for every dollar that we will raise, you will have a tax cut, and these tax cuts will be on your income". Duceppe commented that he would like targets to be applied to individual provinces, thereby allowing Quebec to financially benefit due to already-implemented greenhouse gas reductions. Layton, who favours a cap-and-trade system, said that it is a [...] "figment of Mr. Harper's imagination" [...] that emissions will fall under his plan.
