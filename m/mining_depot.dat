50|$|Clifford's Fort was a {{defensive}} gun battery established {{near the mouth}} of the Tyne during the Anglo-Dutch Wars in the 17th century. It subsequently served as a submarine <b>mining</b> <b>depot</b> and survives today as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in the historic Fish Quay area of North Shields, Tyne and Wear, in North East England.|$|E
50|$|Traces of {{the colonial}} defences remain from the {{establishment}} of Fort Bastion here in 1886. Initially the Battery defending the Harbour entrance had two 'disappearing guns', supplemented by two 6 pounders, with a magazine linked to covered passages and a search light mounted on Bastion Rock. At sea level, the submarine <b>mining</b> <b>depot</b> was set up at Biddick's Bay, opposite its northern equivalent across the Harbour at Torpedo Bay. Fort Bastion covered the seaward approaches, the Motukorea and Rangitoto Channels.|$|E
50|$|HAA gun {{sites were}} {{equipped}} with 3.7-inch or the older 3-inch guns. Although LAA units were receiving Bofors 40 mm guns, {{many of the}} sites only had LMGs, though some like the Royal Naval <b>Mining</b> <b>Depot</b> at Wrabness at least had quadruple mountings. The first, very secret, Gun-Laying Radar Mk I sets {{began to appear in}} May 1940, with one being stationed at Landguard Fort at Harwich to replace the old sound-locator at the S/L site operated by 469 AA Co, 74th AA Bn.|$|E

50|$|Clifford's Fort, {{located on}} the Fish Quay, {{was built in the}} 17th century as a coastal defence against the Dutch. The Fort also played a role during the Napoleonic Wars. The site of the fort was used to build new fish {{processing}} facilities and very little now remains of the original fort. The area is currently undergoing restoration. Part of the foundations of the 18th century Master Gunner’s House (demolished in 1973) were found below the concrete floor of a fish processing unit. Elsewhere on the site, part of the stone edging of Cable Tanks belonging to the Submarine <b>Mining</b> <b>Depot</b> (established at the fort in 1888) were uncovered.|$|E
5000|$|At {{some point}} between 1895 and 1907, Shornemead Fort was disarmed. Subsidence {{had made it}} {{structurally}} unsafe for its emplaced guns to be fired, {{and it was in}} any case strategically redundant by that point. It was used for a time by the Thames Militia Division (Submarine Miners), Royal Engineers, as a training facility linked with the nearby submarine <b>mining</b> <b>depot.</b> It was temporarily re-armed in 1913 with two 12-pdr. QF guns in emplacements outside the fort and again in 1941 when it was designated as an emergency battery. Two 5.5-inch naval guns were installed in the same emplacements as the 1913 guns, 250 m east of the fort, with concrete gun houses protecting them. An embarkation hard was constructed on the riverside below the fort to support the D-Day operation. Aerial photographs from the time show the battery, fort, associated concrete pillboxes and searchlights surrounded by dense tangles of barbed wire. The fort was reduced to care and maintenance status in November 1943, while the battery was deactivated in 1945 and demolished around 1976.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1801 and 1803, {{the town}} and {{waterway}} were protected by temporary batteries at Hakin Point and south of St Katherine's Church, {{in response to the}} perceived threat following the Fishguard Invasion. In 1814 the Royal Dockyard was transferred to Pembroke Dock, which quickly reduced the fortunes of the new town. John Bartholomew commented in 1887 that Milford was in a languishing state, although he noted that the commercial docks, at that time under construction, [...] "will probably become a great seat of trade with America." [...] Robert Fulke Greville inherited the estate in 1824, and in 1853 relocated to the town. He commenced a series of improvements, including the building of a wooden pier and hotel for the Irish traffic, two bridges across Milford's two pills (accompanied by toll houses) and obtaining an Improvement Act for the town. [...] The town's population was further boosted by Quaker whalers from Nantucket, and a growing fishing industry that employed a large number of people. By 1849, the district of Hakin was described as a considerable centre of boat building, with approximately 200 [...] "shipwrights residing at that place". The Milford Docks Act 1874 authorised the construction of a docks in Hubberston Pill, a plan which was estimated to require {{two and a half years}} before completion. Actual completion was not achieved until 1888, delayed in part due to the bankruptcy of Samuel Lake. Contemporary speculation suggested that a journey between London and New York via Milford would now be possible in less than seven days, two days fewer than the voyage on the established Liverpool route. There was also considerable thought given to a proposed [...] "Montreal & Milford Line", linking the two ports and potentially cutting the journey time even further than that of New York. It was eventually finished in 1888, but the transatlantic trade hoped for never materialized. Instead, the newly completed dockyard became the home of a sprawling fishing industry. By 1906, Milford had become the sixth largest fishing port in the UK, and in contrast to the general decline in Pembrokeshire's economy and a migration towards the South Wales Coal fields during the 1880s, its population rose. The Pembrokeshire Herald claimed in 1912 that [...] "the fish trade is Milford's sole industry....the population of the town has doubled by means of it". In 1863, the railway network came to Milford, linking it to the Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was completed on an additional extension which provided access to the docks and <b>mining</b> <b>depot</b> on the eastern side of the town. [...] If the Manchester and Milford Railway scheme had come to fruition, the town would have enjoyed a direct rail link to the Midlands and Northwest England.|$|E

40|$|How can the {{abstract}} idea of memory be represented through {{the discipline of}} landscape architecture? How could this be more specifically achieved within the man-made landscape, using materiality and time as tools within the design process? This thesis essentially addresses the relationship that may exist between landscape architecture and the exploration of selective memory within the landscape. In this case, the definition of memory can be defined by site and urban context. The exploration of theories relating to collective and individual memories, identity in the man-made landscape, materiality and trace will aim to define and anchor memory within landscape architecture. The {{first part of the}} research will examine the works of Sebastien Marot, Mark Crinson and Paul Tyrer. On one hand Crinson describes memory as a sense of structure and rhetoric. He suggests that memory cannot be physically represented as the same idea for everyone, leaving memory very subjective. On the other hand, Marot works around the concept of social frameworks of memory. He describes how it is important for landscape architects to understand cities and their spatialised design systems. These reflect the conditioning of memories, described as dense accumulations of traces within the environment (collective memories). The connection between site, social frameworks of memory and the urban realm will be tested through a variety of design interventions. Importantly, a decision needs to be made on whether to design for the collective or individual memories of the site. The second part of this thesis addresses the idea of memory within the man-made landscape. How infrastructure has impacted upon the identity of the natural landscape, which has in turn affected the collective memory of the site within the larger urban environment. The selected site for this research is the former Air Force Base at Shelly Bay, Miramar. Originally a submarine <b>mining</b> <b>depot,</b> the coastal area was reclaimed for military purposes since before World War One. The land has recently been bought by the local Iwi as part of a Treaty of Waitangi Settlement, who plan to develop the site for the public of Wellington. This site is an example of memory bound within a city, providing interstitial spaces to test designs of memory against the collective and individual memories, both man-made and natural. The design experimentation will investigate how memory can be recreated and represented on the chosen site of Shelly Bay. An investigation into temporary and permanent aspects of design, including materiality and weathering, will allow a more in-depth exploration of memory to take place upon the site. The materiality of landscape elements establishes the form and design ideas. The process of the weathering and durability over time makes the design intent visible, and displays the character and identity of the landscape. The ability {{to bridge the gap between}} a fixed idea of memory and the realization of that built idea over time could be achieved by allowing for process and change to occur within the design and the site. These concepts will be tested upon the site of Shelly Bay through three specific design interventions. These interventions will aim to test and represent different memories upon the site, both man-made and natural...|$|E
