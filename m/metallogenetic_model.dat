40|$|The Romanian Carpathians {{sector of}} the Late Cretaceous Banatitic Magmatic and Metallogenetic belt (BMMB) {{contains}} 1) plutons and volcano-plutonic complexes, i. e. calc-alkaline, I-type granitoids, with related ores; 2) shoshonitic plutons that lack economic interest. Two provinces have been delineated: the Apuseni Mts. Province in the North and the Western South Carpathians in the South. Apuseni Mts. Province is a non-porphyry environment related to more evolved (granodioritic-granitic) magmatism. It is subdivided into three zones: Vlădeasa (Pb-Zn ores of restricted metallogenetic potential); Gilău-Bihor (Fe, Bi, Mo, Cu, W, Au, Ni, Co, Pb, Zn, Ag, U, B ores / conspicuous peri-batholitic arrangement) and South Apuseni (only one minor Fe-skarn occurrence). Western South Carpathians Province occurs in Romania and extends in Eastern Serbia. It is subdivided into South Banat Mts. –Timok Zone (SBTZ) and Poiana Ruscă Mts. – North Banat Mts. – Ridanj-Krepoljin Zone (PR-NB-RKZ). SBTZ is a typical porphyry environment of high metallogenetic potential (Cu, Au, Pb, Zn), while PR-NB-RKZ is a non-porphyry environment with small to medium size Pb, Zn, Fe, Cu deposits/prospects exhibiting commonly a peri-plutonic zoning. The <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> of the Romanian Carpathians segment of BMMB is conceived based on correlating magma composition/level of emplacement and ore types. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comThe North European Basin hosts mineral deposits like the Kupferschiefer and the Mississippi Valley Type deposits in the Silesian sub-basin in Poland. The basement to this basin, exposed in the Harz Mts and in the Flechtingen and Calvörde Blocks, contains Mesozoic Pb–Zn vein mineralization and barite–fluorite deposits as well as massive hematite veins in the Rotliegend volcanics. A comparison of the mineralizing models of these deposits with results from a basin-wide petrographic, fluid inclusion and stable isotope study shows that {{the genesis of the}} mineral deposits can be explained by fluid systems that were active during different stages of basin evolution. These comprise syn- to post-magmatic fluids derived from or mobilized {{in the course of the}} Rotliegend magmatism, fluids convecting in the Rotliegend units during the extensional basin subsidence in the Permo-Triassic and originating from progressive devolatilization of the basin sequence and fluids derived from the overlying Zechstein evaporites.

40|$|The Thelon basin, Nunavut, shares many {{similarities}} {{with the}} uranium-producing Athabasca basin, Saskatch-ewan; however, the uranium deposits {{associated with the}} Thelon basin are still poorly understood. The Kig-gavik project area (AREVA Resources Canada) is located near the northeastern terminus of the Thelon basin and comprises multiple uranium deposits hosted exclusively in basement rocks. The Bong deposit is hosted dominantly by Neoarchean metagraywacke of the Woodburn Lake group. A five-phase <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> is proposed for the Bong deposit, with three stages of uraninite identified. The premineralization phase is characterized by host-rock silicification. Mineralization is separated into three main stages. Stage 1 uraninite (U 1; ca. 1500 Ma) is preserved in highly fractured and altered disseminated grains that are overgrown by later stages of uraninite. Stage 2 uraninite (U 2; ca. 1100 Ma) forms veinlets parallel to D 1 foliation and coats and fills fractures in organic matter nodules and blebs. Stage 2 uraninite is associated with pervasive illite that formed from ~ 190 °C fluids (δ 18 O: – 6. 4 ‰, δ 2 H: – 97 ‰), which remobilized much of Stage 1 uraninite and completely overprinted Stage 1 alteration. At ~ 1000 Ma an oxidizing fluid deposited uraninite along redox fronts (U 3) while altering and remobilizing Stage 1 and 2 uraninite.

The analyzed samples comprise two generations of dolomite, two generations of sphalerite, galena, and late calcite. The two dolomite generations and the late calcite were also analyzed for their oxygen and carbon isotope compositions, allowing a characterization of the mineralizing fluids. The ore-forming fluids represent highly saline (20 - 23 wt% CaCl 2 equiv) Na-Ca-Cl brines, episodically introduced into the Triassic host carbonates. They had an oxygen isotope composition of similar to 0 per mil V-SMOW Their Na-Cl-Br content (molar Na/Br and Cl/Br ratios between 99 and 337 and between 248 and 560, respectively) suggests that they originated by evaporation of sea-water. which most likely occurred in the Permian-Triassic. The relative concentrations of potassium (molar K/Cl between 0. 0147 and 0. 0746) and lithium (molar Li/Cl between 0. 0004 and 0. 0031) further indicate that the fluids significantly interacted with siliciclastic rocks.

40|$|M. Sc. The Pering Pb-Zn deposit is hosted in the stromatolitic dolomites of the Campbellrand Subgroup of the Ghaap Group, Transvaal Supergroup. The deposit is {{situated}} 20 km {{northeast of the}} town Reivilo in the semi-arid region of the Northwest Province, South Africa. It has been classified as a Mississippi Valley type deposit and is, together with the Bushy Park Pb-Zn deposit and F-Pb-Zn deposits near Zeerust, the only known MVT deposit of Paleoproterozoic age. The Pering open cast mine has been operational since 1986, yielding 18 Mt at an average ore grade of 3. 6 wt. % Zn and 0. 6 wt. % Pb. The {{aim of this study}} is to devise a <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> by integrating core logging, petrography, fluid inclusion and stable C- 0 -S isotope studies. The mineralogy includes sphalerite, galena and minor chalcopyrite as ore minerals, with diagenetic pyrite, hydrothermal dolomite, quartz and calcite as gangue minerals. Sphalerite predominates over galena. Mineralisation occurs as (a) disseminated stratabound replacements sheets restricted mainly to stromatolitic zones of the Steekdorings Member of the Reivilo Formation, and as (b) open space infill in breccia bodies that cross-cut the stratigraphy. Three events of hydrothermal brecciation, resultant of prolonged pulses of fluid infiltration, and mineralisation are recognised. The first brecciation event is marked by the cementation of the dolomite host rock by sparry dolomite, closely associated with finegrained disseminated sphalerite and galena. The second brecciation event is of minor importance, and is marked by the formation of small amounts of the second sphalerite generation, while the third, and final, brecciation event is marked by the formation of euhedral sphalerite, galena, quartz, sparry dolomite, and calcite as open space fill...|$|E

40|$|Until its closure in 1997, the Serra do Navio deposit, {{located in}} Amapá Province, Brazil, {{was one of}} the most {{important}} sources of high-grade manganese ore to the North American market. The high-grade manganese oxide ores were derived by lateritic weathering from metasedimentary manganese protoliths of the Serra do Navio Formation. The local geological context and nature of this protolith succession are not well understood, due to poor surface outcrop conditions, and intense deformation. However, based on similar age, regional tectonic setting and lithology the Paleoproterozoic volcanosedimentary succession that includes the Serra do Navio Formation is widely believed to be similar in origin and laterally equivalent to the Birimian Supergroup in West Africa. For the present investigation several diamond drill cores intersecting the protolith succession were studied. Detailed petrographic and whole rock geochemical studies permit distinction of two fundamental lithological groups comprising of a total of five lithotypes. Biotite schist and graphitic schist lithotypes are interpreted as former metapelites. A greywacke or pyroclastic protolith cannot be excluded for the biotite schist, whereas the graphitic schist certainly originated as a sulfide-rich carbonaceous mudstone. Rhodochrosite marble, Mn-calcite marble and Mn-silicate rock are grouped together as manganiferous carbonate rocks. Manganese lutite constitutes the most probable protolith for rhodochrosite marble, whereas Mn-calcite marble was derived from Mn-rich marl and Mn-silicate rock from variable mixtures of Mn-rich marl and chert. The sedimentary succession at the Serra do Navio deposit is similar to that encountered at many other black shale and chert-hosted Mn carbonate deposits. A <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> is proposed, predicting deposition of manganese and closely associated chert in intra-arc basins, in environments that were bypassed by distal siliciclastic (carbonaceous mud) and proximal pyroclastic/siliciclastic detritus. Positive Ce anomalies and δ 13 CVPDB values of − 4. 3 to 9. 4 per mill suggest that manganiferous carbonates derived during suboxic diagenesis from sedimentary Mn 4 + oxyhydroxide precipitates. Metamorphic alteration of manganese carbonate–chert assemblages resulted in the formation of Mn-silicates, most importantly rhodonite and tephroite; porphyroblastic spessartine formed where Mn-carbonate reacted with aluminous clay minerals. Microthermometric studies of fluid inclusions in spessartine porphyroblasts suggests that peak metamorphic conditions reached the upper greenschist facies (1 – 2 kbars and 400 – 500 °C). Retrograde metamorphism is marked by partial re-carbonation, expressed by the formation of small volumes of rhodochrosite, and Mn-calcite that are closely associated with quartz, chlorite and minor amounts of sulfides related to post-metamorphic veinlets. It is this metamorphosed succession that sourced the high-grade manganese oxide ores during prolonged lateritic weathering...|$|E
40|$|The Northern Norrbotten Ore Province in northernmost Sweden {{includes}} the type localities for Kiruna-type apatite iron deposits {{and has been}} the focus for intense exploration and research related to Fe oxide-Cu-Aumineralisation during the last decades. Several different types of Fe-oxide and Cu-Au±Fe oxide mineralisationoccur in the region and include: stratiform Cu±Zn±Pb±Fe oxide type, iron formations (including BIF´s), Kiruna-type apatite iron ore, and epigenetic Cu±Au±Fe oxide type which may be further subdivided into different styles of mineralisation, some of them with typical IOCG (Iron Oxide-Copper-Gold) characteristics. Generally, the formation of Fe oxide±Cu±Au mineralisation is directly or indirectly dated between ~ 2. 1 and 1. 75 Ga, thus spanning about 350 m. y. of geological evolution. The current paper will present in more detail the characteristics of certain key deposits, and aims to put the global concepts of Fe-oxide Cu-Au mineralisations into a regional context. The focus will be on iron deposits and various types of deposits containing Fe-oxides and Cu-sulphides in different proportions which generally have some characteristics in common with the IOCG style. In particular, ore fluid characteristics (magmatic versus non-magmatic) and new geochronological data are used to link the ore-forming processes with the overall crustal evolution to generate a <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model.</b> Rift bounded shallow marine basins developed at ~ 2. 1 - 2. 0 Ga following a long period of extensional tectonics within the Greenstone-dominated, 2. 5 - 2. 0 Ga Karelian craton. The ~ 1. 9 - 1. 8 Ga Svecofennian Orogen is characterised by subduction and accretion from the southwest. An initial emplacement of calc-alkaline magmas into ~ 1. 9 Ga continental arcs {{led to the formation of}} the Haparanda Suite and the Porphyrite Group volcanic rocks. Following this early stage of magmatic activity, and separated from it by the earliest deformation and metamorphism, more alkali-rich magmas of the Perthite Monzonite Suite and the Kiirunavaara Group volcanic rocks were formed at ~ 1. 88 Ga. Subsequently, partial melting of the middle crust produced large volumes of~ 1. 85 and 1. 8 Ga S-type granites in conjunction with subduction related A-/I-type magmatism and associated deformation and metamorphism. In our <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> the ore formation is considered to relate to the geological evolution as follows. Iron formations and a few stratiform sulphide deposits were deposited in relation to exhalative processes in rift bounded marine basins. The iron formations may be sub-divided into BIF- (banded iron formations) and Mg-rich types, and at several locations these types grade into each other. There is no direct age evidence to constrain the deposition of iron formations, but stable isotope data and stratigraphic correlations suggest a formation within the 2. 1 - 2. 0 Ga age range. The major Kiruna-type ores formed from an iron-rich  magma (generally with a hydrothermal over-print) and are restricted to areas occupied by volcanic rocks of the Kiirunavaara Group. It is suggested here that 1. 89 - 1. 88 Ga tholeiitic magmas underwent magma liquid immiscibility reactions during fractionation and interaction with crustal rocks, including metaevaporites, generating more felsic magmatic rocks and Kiruna-type iron deposits. A second generation of this ore type, with a minor economic importance, appears to have been formed about 100 Ma later. The epigenetic Cu-Au±Fe oxide mineralisation formed during two stages of the Svecofennian evolution in association with magmatic and metamorphic events and crustal-scale shear zones. During the first stage of mineralisation, from 1. 89 - 1. 88 Ga, intrusion-related (porphyry-style) mineralisation and Cu-Au deposits of IOCG affinity formed from magmatichydrothermal systems, whereas vein-style and shear zone deposits largely formed at c. 1. 78 Ga. The large range of different Fe oxide and Cu-Au±Fe oxide deposits in Northern Norrbotten is associated with various alteration systems, involving e. g. scapolite, albite, K feldspar, biotite, carbonates, tourmaline and sericite. However, among the apatite iron ores and the epigenetic Cu-Au±Fe oxide deposits the character of mineralization, type of ore- and alteration minerals and metal associations are partly controlled by stratigraphic position (i. e. depth of emplacement). Highly saline, NaCl+CaCl 2 dominated fluids, commonly also including a CO 2 -rich population, appear to be a common characteristic feature irrespective of type and age of deposits. Thus, fluids with similar characteristics appear to have been active during quite different stages of the geological evolution. Ore fluids related to epigenetic Cu-Au±Fe oxides display a trend with decreasing salinity, which probably was caused by mixing with meteoric water. Tentatively, this can be linked to different Cu-Au ore paragenesis, including an initial (magnetite) -pyrite-chalcopyrite stage, a main chalcopyrite stage, and a late bornite stage. Based on the anion composition and the Br/Cl ratio of ore related fluids bittern brines and metaevaporites (including scapolite) seem to be important sources to the high salinity hydrothermal systems generating most of the deposits in Norrbotten. Depending on local conditions and position in the crust these fluids generated a variety of Cu-Au deposits. These include typical IOCG-deposits (Fe-oxides and Cu-Au are part of the same process), IOCG of iron stone type (pre-existing Fe-oxide deposit with later addition of Cu-Au), IOCG of reduced type (lacking Fe-oxides due to local reducing conditions) and vein-style Cu-Au deposits. From a strict genetic point of view, IOCG deposits that formed from fluids of a mainly magmatic origin should be considered to be a different type than those deposits associated with mainly non-magmatic fluids. The former tend to overlap with porphyry systems, whereas those of a mainly non-magmatic origin overlap with sediment hosted Cu-deposits with respect to their origin and character of the ore fluids...|$|E

Both types of ore deposits are spatially and temporally related to the same granite generation (i. e. G 4 -granites of 986 ± 10 Ma; Tack et al., 2010; Dewaele et al., 2011), but one coherent and combined metallogenic model that links both types of deposits is absent. Research will be carried out on the type and physico-chemical conditions and the geochemical evolution of the mineralising fluids form the Nb-Ta-mineralisation (pegmatites) to the Sn- (pegmatites, hydrothermal quartz veins) and W-mineralisation (hydrothermal quartz veins). Both types of mineralisation will be described and modelled in terms of magmatic and hydrothermal geochemical processes around granite intrusions (G 4 -granites).

All results will be synthesised and combined with existing data (e. g. Dewaele et al., 2011; De Clercq, 2012) to reconstruct a metallogenic model for granite-related mineralisation in the KAB.

Fine (- 100 mesh) stream sediment, panned concentrate and water samples were collected at every site. Cu, Pb, Zn, MO, As, Ba, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cr, V and Zr were determined in stream sediment samples; Cu, Pb, Zn, Ba, Fe, Mn, Ti, Nl, Ce and Sn in panned concentrates, and Cu, Pb and Zn in water.

Strong regional patterns are displayed by many elements and it is demonstrated that these are caused by bedrock li thology, hydromorphic processes, mineralisation and contamination. Geochemical signatures characteristic of the following metallrferous concentrations were identified: ii) disseminated copper ‘porphyry-style’ mineralisation; ‘gold-belt’ vein-style mineralisation in Cambrian rocks; mineralisation in Ordovician volcanic and sedimentary rocks; bedded manganese deposits in the Cambrian; manganese vein-style mineralisation in Ordovician volcanic rocks; (ii) (iii) iiv) iv) (vi) (vii) granite-related mineralisation; dark mudstones. Rhobell Fawr volcanism and possible associated metasomatism may also have generated metal anomalies but the evidence available is inconclusive. Small, bedded iron ore deposits failed to produce distinct anomalies. Despite widespread past mining activity eleven areas or styles of mineralisation have been identified where it is considered that further work might lead to the recognition of deposits of economic or supply significance. These targets include base metal anomalies in Ordovician volcanic rocks where there is some potential for volcanogenic stratiform mineralisation; copper and gold anomalies in Upper Cambrian rocks indicating the presence of further gold-belt vein-style mineralisation; arsenic anomalies over Ordovician acid volcanic rocks whose gold potential merits investigation; manganese and barium anomalies related to manganese-barium vein mineralisation in Arenig volcanic rocks and metalliferous concentrations in dark mudstones marginal to the Rhobell volcanic centre. A <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> is. proposed for the area involving: syngenetic metalliferous concentration during Cambrian sedimentation; copper and possibly gold mineralisation in an island arc-type setting at the close of the Cambrian; syngenet ic and volcanogenic base-metal enrichment during the Lower Ordovician, and deep burial and remobilisation of these metals to form vein-style deposits during or after the main (end Silurian) Caledonian erogenic event. Strong regional trends displayed by elements not directly involved in mineralisation, such as Zr, Ce and Cr, can be related to the lithostratigraphy and suggest, in conjunction with other evidence, significant palaeogeographic changes at the close of the Middle Cambrian, involving the derivation of sediment from source areas of contrasting geochemical character in Lower Cambrian and Upper Cambrian-Ordovician times. The characteristics of volcanic rocks show less clearly because of the rapid alternation of acid and basic lithologies with respect to the scale of the survey. INTRODUCTION This survey. covers about 1100 km 2 of western Wales bounded by the towns of Bala in the east, Tywyn in south, Blaenau Ffestiniog in the north, and Cardigan Bay in the west (Figure 1). The area is formed almost entirely of sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive rocks of Lower Palaeozoic age, folded into the structure known as the Harlech Dome. The area lies within the Snowdonia National Park and 1 s mountainous. The most prominent hills are the Cader Idris, Aran, Arenig and Moelwyn groups which rise to 907 m on Aran Fawddwy and form a ring on the periphery of the survey area. The westcentral part of the area is dominated by another range of hills, the most prominent of which is Rhinog Fawr. Drainage is dominated by the catchment of the Afon Mawddach, which drains the central part of the area. Acid, peaty soils underlain by variable thicknesses of glacial deposits and interspersed locally with extensive areas of rock exposure characterise the high ground. Lower slopes are blanketed in drift deposits and have less acid soils. Streams cut to bedrock except in the lower reaches of the larger rivers. High ground is covered by heather or rough grass and used for sheep grazing; lower ground is mostly grass covered with small areas of deciduous forest. There is little arable farming. Extensive coniferous forest plantations cover all except the highest ground in several areas. Stream contamination is only a problem in the vicinity of farms, villages and a disused military training area to the east of Trawsfynydd. No detailed geochemical survey data has been published for this area though surveys have been carried out by universities and commercial companies. The area is included in the Wolfson Geochemical 4 tlas (Imperial College, 1978) and a geochemical study of Wales by Urquidi-Barrau (1973). Both works are based on the same data and provide useful information on a regional scale. Mohr (1959) studied the lithogeochemistry of the Manganese Beds, and more recently geochemical data were Included in studies of the Rhobell Fawr Volcanic Group (Kokelaar, 1977) and Aran Volcanic Group in the type area (Dunkley, 1978). The results of airborne geophysical, magnetic, electromagnetic and radiometric surveys of the Harlech Dome and geological, geophysical and geochemical investigations of twenty six anomalies arising from them, as well as various orientation studies carried out in support of these investigations, are described in an earlier MRP report (Allen and others, 1979). The literature on geology and mineralisation in the area is extensive and was summarised in the earlier report (Allen and others, 1979). Recent publications of most relevance to this study include, on the geology, Matley and Wilson (1946), Davies (1958), Lynas (1973), Bassett, Whittington and Williams (1966), Ridgway (lY 75, 1976) and BGS 1 : 50 000 map sheet 135; on mineralisation, Rice and Sharp (1976), Allen and others (1979), Cole (1977) and Foster-Smith (1977); and on mining and the environment, Searle (1975) ...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Geologia (Metalogenia), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências, 2016 The Neves Corvo deposit {{stands out}} among the VHMS {{deposits}} of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) for its richness in terms of metal grades and total metal contents, and for its multisourced regime of metal supply. Previous studies suggested that the metallogenesis of the tin and copper-rich ores in the deposit resulted from a long-lived magmatic-hydrothermal system. Hence, {{the understanding of the}} geology of zinc, indium and selenium within the overall context of the Neves Corvo ore-forming processes constitutes an unsolved challenge and an opportunity to assess the occurrence of indium and selenium in the deposit. This study focuses therefore on the zinciferous ores at the Neves Corvo deposit, and on the indium and selenium abundance, distribution and mineral allocation in the deposit. The aims of this study consisted in (1) characterizing the hydrothermal patterns and geochemical signatures related with the zinc-rich mineralization; (2) determining the textural, mineralogical, and geochemical features of the zinciferous ores; (3) assessing the abundance, distribution and mineral allocation of indium and selenium in the deposit; and finally (4) proposing an integrated <b>metallogenetic</b> <b>model</b> for the deposit. The Lombador orebody represents the largest and zinc-richest orebody in the deposit, comprising over 106. 2 Mt of massive sulfides and a total amount of zinc resources of 73. 5 Mt @ 5. 86 % Zn, which represent about 63 % of the mine total zinc resources. Extensive log and petrographic characterization of selected drill holes indicate that the Lombador orebody immediate footwall sequence is characterized by a much more pronounced lateral and vertical variation of lithofacies than that commonly recognized {{in other areas of the}} deposit. This is though to result from variable paleomorphology of the basin where the mineralization developed. The Lombador orebody comprises a huge, stratabound stockwork system that extends across the entire length of the orebody, and that is better developed in the central and central-W sectors of the orebody, where the axis of the feeder system locates and chalcopyrite-rich veins dominate. As elsewhere in the IPB, the hydrothermal alteration pattern at the Lombador orebody comprises a chlorite-dominated innermost alteration zone (Type I alteration) that grades outwards into a K-sericite-dominated (Type IIa alteration) peripheral alteration zone. The Na-sericite-bearing alteration (Type IIb alteration) was only found in some coherent rhyolite lenses tectonically emplaced in a hanging wall position. Moreover, the intense footwall carbonatization was found to constitute a distinctive feature relative to the hydrothermal pattern recognized at the Corvo orebody. Microprobe analysis confirmed the occurrence of iron-rich ripidolite, donbassite, sericite and siderite as the main alterationrelated mineral phases. Also, the overall abundance of iron-rich chlorite, siderite, pyrite, ironrich sphalerite, arsenopyrite and, to a lesser extent, pyrrhotite in the Lombador ores indicate that these formed by iron-rich, low pH, CO 2 -enriched, and high-temperature ore-forming solutions under moderate to strongly reduced conditions. However, although the chlorites from the Lombador feeder system are more aluminous than those reported in typical IPB stringer systems, its iron and aluminum contents, as well as its estimated average peak formation temperature do not reach values as high as the ones found in the Corvo copper-rich stockwork system. This implies less intense ore-forming conditions at the zinc-rich Lombador stockwork system than those at the copper-rich Corvo stockwork system. The petrography and geochemistry of the zinc-rich Lombador ores indicate that these have formed from a combination of prominent sub-seafloor replacement and episodic direct exhalation onto the seafloor. The mineralization develops around, and was controlled by, a NNW-SSE trending sub-vertical fault zone located in the central-W and south sectors of the orebody. Sub-seafloor replacement phenomena prevailed in this part of the orebody, and caused large scale enrichment in iron and depletion in silica and alkalis in Type I altered rocks due to intense chlorite and sulphide formation, and the enrichment in silica and alkalis towards the peripheral Type II altered zones. Contrastingly, the presence of banded, semi-massive, carbonate-rich zinciferous ores alternating with sediment-rich facies in the northernmost peripheral areas of the orebody indicates that part of the zinc-rich ores formed by episodic and tectonically triggered exhalation of ore fluids onto the seafloor. The same inference can be made for part of the zinc-rich ores from the remaining Neves Corvo orebodies as these exhibit similar ore petrographic and geochemical features. Factors such as a porous and chemically reactive footwall host sequence, temperature decrease, variations in the pH, mixing of fluids, and boiling should have promoted and controlled the extensive alteration and ore deposition. The investigation of the abundance and distribution of the ore metal contents, metal zonation, and ore petrographic and geochemical features suggest that the various Neves Corvo orebodies display distinct degrees of hydrothermal maturity, in close parallel with present-day submarine hydrothermal systems. The large predominance of zinc-rich ores over low grade copper ores at the Lombador orebody, coupled with ore-forming signatures that denounce a sustained, low to moderate temperature (300 ºC) copper-rich hydrothermal fluids and sustained, long-lived hydrothermal activity, and should have involved additional metal contributions of probable magmatic affiliation as previously indicated by their radiogenic isotopic signatures. The indium and selenium distribution, abundance and mineral allocation at the Neves Corvo deposit is complex, and resulted from the combined effects of long-lasting ore-forming processes and late tectono-metamorphic remobilization, specially in the most deformed domains. Indium and selenium are mainly associated to the copper-rich ores at the Neves Corvo deposit, in particular in the MCZ ores, which account for more than 60 % of the estimated indium and selenium metal content in the deposit. This argues for the joint transport and co-precipitation of copper, indium and selenium from high-temperature, acidic, reduced, saline, copper-rich ore fluids. Also, the abundance, distribution and mineral allocation of both indium and selenium agree well with the degree of hydrothermal maturity shown by the various Neves Corvo orebodies. In addition, the zinc-rich ores may constitute as well a potential source for indium and selenium, in particular in ore zones affected by stronger tectono-metamorphic deformation, where significant indium and selenium enrichment occurs. Sphalerite, chalcopyrite and minor stannite are the main indium-carrier ore sulphides in the deposit, whereas galena constitutes the main selenium-carrier. Nevertheless, replacement of the early-formed low-temperature ore types, zone refining, recrystallization, annealing, and tectono-metamorphic remobilization were responsible for the occurrence of minor amounts of roquesite, naumanite, roquesite-sakuraiite intermediate phases, and unknown Bi-Se and Pb- Bi-Se phases. Strontium, neodymium and lead isotope data indicate that the footwall rocks and, in particular, the PQ Group sequence constitute the main source of zinc and copper for the metal budget of the deposit. Nevertheless, some highly radiogenic lead and neodimium isotopic signatures, as well as the high indium and selenium abundances depicted by some of the copper-rich ore types, suggest that as tin and part of the copper metal contents in the Neves Corvo deposit, a significant fraction of the indium and selenium may have resulted from direct magmatic contributions. A sustained, long-lived, multi-stage and multi-sourced hydrothermal ore-forming system, developed within a highly dynamic rift basin environment, was envisaged to model the overall metallogenetic process at the Neves Corvo deposit. Nevertheless, further investigation is needed to fully understand the unique metal association, mineral assemblage and ore geochemistry of the Neves Corvo deposit, and to fully constrain its complex, multi-stage and multi-sourced metallogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Although {{not well}} known by most people, tin (Sn) and {{tungsten}} (W) are two metals {{that are important in}} our society. Tin is for instance used for the production of corrosion-resistant steel, as a solder and for the production of bronze, while tungsten is used in cutting tools, heavy metal alloys, light bulbs and dental drills. Tin and tungsten deposits can be found worldwide. Tin and tungsten are often closely associated to one another and can even occur in the same deposit. The Mesoproterozoic Karagwe-Ankole belt (KAB) in Central Africa hosts numerous Sn and W deposits. These mineralisations principally occur in pegmatites and hydrothermal quartz veins that are presumably related to granite intrusions. This PhD study focuses on the Sn and W vein-type mineralisations in {{the central part of the}} KAB, in Rwanda. This study aims to determine the origin and evolution of the Sn and W vein-type deposits, focussing on the evolution of the mineralising fluids and their composition (geochemistry). The mineralising fluids are studied by means of a detailed petrographical, geochemical and microthermometrical study and by using specialised geochemical techniques (LA-ICP-MS, crush-leach, Raman analysis and stable isotope geochemistry). The absolute age of the ore deposits is determined by means of the 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating technique. The metasedimentary rocks of the KAB in Central Africa have been affected at ~ 1375 Ma by a major intracratonic bimodal magmatic event (Tack et al., 2010). This event consists of widespread, voluminous S-type granitoid rocks with accompanying subordinate mafic intrusive rocks (Fernandez-Alonso et al. 1986; Tack et al., 2010). These granites have been called G 1 &# 8209; 3 in Rwanda and are not associated with mineralisation (Dewaele et al., 2009). At ~ 1000 Ma, reactivation of structures in the underlying basement caused folding and thrusting of the rocks in the Western Domain of the Karagwe-Ankole belt, as the result of a far-field effect of the Southern Irumide Orogen (Theunissen, 1988, 1989; Fernandez-Alonso et al., 2012). At 986 ± 10 Ma, post-compressional relaxation gave rise to the emplacement of S-type granites, which have been called G 4 -granites in Rwanda (Tack et al., 2010; Fernandez-Alonso et al., 2012). These granites show enrichment and depletion trends typical for granites associated with hydrothermal mineralisation or rare element pegmatites (Dewaele et al., 2009). After emplacement of the G 4 -granites, pegmatites intruded at 969 ± 8 Ma (Brinckmann & Lehmann, 1983). This age overlaps with the age of the G 4 -granites. The pegmatites show a regional mineralogical zonation surrounding the granites (e. g. Varlamoff, 1954 a, b). Recently, a study by Hulsbosch (2012) has shown that a geochemical relationship exists between the G 4 &# 8209;granites and these pegmatites. Based on REE-modelling, it is concluded that these pegmatites formed from a last, small melt fraction that remained after fractionation in a chemically zoned G 4 -granite (Hulsbosch, 2012). Some of these pegmatites are mineralised in columbite-tantalite and cassiterite. Columbite-tantalite mineralisation within the pegmatites has been dated between 975 ± 8 Ma and 966 ± 9 Ma, which overlaps with the timing of the pegmatites (Dewaele et al., 2011). Precipitation of minor cassiterite is related to this early stage of pegmatite crystallisation. The major proportion of cassiterite, however, precipitated during a later metasomatic-hydrothermal overprint of local zones of the pegmatites, associated with sericitisation and muscovitisation (Dewaele et al., 2011). Fluids and metals were introduced along fractures and faults, clearly after pegmatite crystallisation. In the Karagwe-Ankole belt, numerous quartz veins occur that are mineralised in tin and tungsten. In Rwanda, the Sn-mineralised veins are sometimes located in the vicinity of Nb-Ta-Sn mineralised pegmatites (e. g. Musha-Ntunga). In most places however, there is no clear relationship to pegmatites or granites in the field. Sn and W deposits are usually not spatially related to each other. In the central part of Rwanda, the location of the W and Sn vein-type deposits shows a typical structural and lithological control. The W vein-type deposits in the Tungsten-belt are located in the core and the flanks of complex anticlinal structures. The host rock is typically composed of alternating sequences of sandstones and black pyritiferous metapelitic rocks. Two types of W-mineralised quartz veins have been observed: thick bedding-parallel and crosscutting quartz veins that are at high angle to the bedding. The bedding-parallel quartz veins are typically hosted by dark shales, where they intruded cleavage planes sub-parallel to S 0. These veins have been interpreted to have been formed during or in a late stage of a compressional deformation event, which is thought to be related to the intrusion of the G 4 -granites and post-dating the far-field effect of the Southern Irumide orogeny during amalgamation of Rodinia around 1000 Ma. The W-mineralised crosscutting veins are interpreted to have also been formed in a late stage of a deformation event, possibly overlapping in time with the formation of the W mineralised bedding parallel veins. The crosscutting quartz veins formed by opening of pre-existing planar structures (cleavage planes, axial planes, joints [...] .), some of which were connected to form important pathways for the mineralising fluid. Both vein types are associated with small alteration zones, comprising silicification, tourmalinisation, muscovitisation and precipitation of biotite. Dating of muscovite crystals at the border of the veins indicates that the closure temperature (~ 350 - 400 &# 176;C) was reached between 992. 4 ± 1. 5 Ma and 984. 6 ± 2. 4 Ma. These ages are within error identical to the ages obtained for the G 4 &# 8209;granites (i. e. ~ 986 Ma), but are older than the ages obtained for the Nb&# 8209;Ta&# 8209;Sn mineralised pegmatites (i. e. between ~ 975 and ~ 966 Ma). The W-bearing minerals formed during two different phases. The first phase is characterised by scheelite and massive wolframite. These minerals formed somewhat late in the evolution of the massive quartz veins, sometimes in fractures that crosscut the veins. The ore minerals precipitated from an aqueous-gaseous fluid with a low to moderate salinity (0. 6 - 13. 8 eq. mass % NaCl), at temperatures and pressures between 310 &# 176; and 510 &# 176;C and 60 and 270 MPa, respectively. The gas phase was dominantly composed of CO 2 (53 - 92 vol. %), with lesser amounts of N 2 (6 - 38 vol. %) and minor amounts of CH 4 (1 - 9 vol. %). Na is the dominant cation in solution, with lesser amounts of Mg (Mg/Na: 0. 01 - 0. 41), Ca (Ca/Na: 0. 10 - 0. 32), K (K/Na: 0. 08 - 0. 11), Ba (Ba/Na: 0. 04 - 0. 09), Fe (Fe/Na: 0. 02 - 0. 07) and Mn (Mn/Na: 0. 01 - 0. 07). Cl is the dominant anion. Tungsten was likely transported as NaHWO 4, NaWO 4 -, HWO 4 - and WO 42 -. The dark metapelitic rocks, which typically host the W vein-type deposits, were a controlling factor in mineral precipitation. The metapelitic rocks could have acted as a source of iron and calcium necessary for the formation of the W-bearing ore minerals. Mineral precipitation could have resulted from a combination of falling temperature, addition of volatiles and an increase in pH through reaction with metapelitic wall rocks. In a second phase, scheelite became unstable and was replaced by fibrous ferberite to form pseudomorphs. This could simply have been caused by a decrease in temperature, which makes ferberite more stable than scheelite. Other possible mechanisms are a decrease of the Ca/Fe ratio of the fluid in contact with the ore minerals, a change in pressure and in the chloride concentration. Pyrite crystals inside the quartz veins and in the surrounding rocks could have been altered to supply the necessary iron for this replacement reaction. Afterwards, the quartz veins have been crosscut by a sulphide phase. Scheelite inside the pseudomorphs that had not been replaced by ferberite was altered to secondary tungstates in a late stage. The delta 18 O values of the W-mineralised quartz veins are relatively homogeneous (14. 4 to 16. 0  V&# 8209;SMOW), but the deltaD values vary significantly (- 33 to - 57  V-SMOW). The delta 18 O&# 8209;deltaD signature of the ambient fluids indicates a dominant metamorphic signature. The delta 18 O data of the massive wolframite samples analysed are 0. 3 and 1. 8  V-SMOW. Their deltaD composition ranges between - 93 and - 101  V&# 8209;SMOW. The delta 18 O values of the fibrous wolframite samples cover a small range, except for one sample (- 3. 3 to 3. 9  V-SMOW), and there is a large spread in deltaD values (- 87 to &# 8209; 133  V-SMOW). The delta 18 O-deltaD signature of the ambient fluids indicates that the W-mineralising fluid interacted with metamorphic rocks that contained organic material and NH 4 +-rich micas or feldspars. Based on the lithological setting (black shales), the stable isotope data, the similar Pb isotopic composition of sulphides in the veins and in the metapelitic rocks, the gaseous composition of the W-mineralising fluid (N 2 and CH 4),and their elemental composition, it is concluded that the ore forming fluid from which scheelite and massive wolframite precipitated, have been largely influenced by interaction with metamorphic rocks. However, based on the close spatial link, the structural setting of the ore veins and an overlap in ages for the W-mineralised veins and the G 4 -granites, a magmatic origin for the W&# 8209;mineralising fluid can not be excluded. In this case, the magmatic fluid equilibrated with metamorphic rocks. This magmatic fluid could have been a primary magmatic fluid, which interacted with the metasedimentary rocks or a metamorphic fluid that equilibrated isotopically both with metasedimentary and magmatic rocks. In the second model, the emplacement of G 4 -granites triggered hydrothermal circulation around the contact zone between the intrusion and the country rocks. The Sn vein-type deposits in the Rutongo area are also located in secondary anticlines. In contrast to the W deposits, the Sn deposits are typically hosted by a number of massive sandstone and/or quartzite units that are separated by units of alternating metapelitic rocks and sandstones. The Sn&# 8209;mineralised quartz veins occur in fields or swarms of several hundreds of sub-parallel crosscutting veins that are oriented perpendicular to the fold axis. The veins are associated with intense alteration, comprising silicification, tourmalinisation, muscovitisation and precipitation of biotite. The Sn&# 8209;mineralised quartz veins and the associated alteration zone crosscut the foliation planes in the host rock. Structural analysis indicates that Sn-mineralised veins formed due to extension, with the maximum compressive stress oriented at high angle to the bedding. The structural setting indicates a relatively late formation of the Sn-mineralised veins in the general evolution of the Rutongo anticline, after (G 4 -) granite emplacement. Cassiterite is the only ore mineral in the Sn vein-type deposits in the Central part of Rwanda. It formed in a late stage of the evolution of the mineralised veins. It is intimately associated with muscovite crystals in fractures in the quartz veins. Cassiterite was deposited from an aqueous-gaseous fluid with a low to moderate salinity (6. 2 - 15. 4 eq. mass % NaCl) and a minimal temperature of formation between 225 &# 176; and 349 &# 176;C. The gas phase was composed of CO 2 (50 - 78 vol. %), N 2 (11 - 40 vol. %) and smaller amounts of CH 4 (10 - 15 vol. %). Na is the dominant cation in solution, with lesser amounts of K (K/Na: 0. 14), Li (Li/Na: 0. 08) and Cs (Cs/Na: 0. 07). Cl is the dominant anion. Tin was probably transported in solution to the site of deposition as Sn 2 +-chloride complexes. Precipitation of cassiterite could have resulted from a pH increase of the mineralising fluid, which was caused by muscovitisation of the host rock and possibly transformation of CO 2 to CH 4 in the mineralising solution. Afterwards, the quartz veins have been crosscut by a sulphide phase. The sulphide-mineralising fluid was a moderate saline (13. 0 - 18. 3 eq. mass % NaCl) H 2 O-(X) -CaCl 2 -NaCl fluid, with a minimal temperature of formation between 249 &# 176; and 265 &# 176;C. The delta 18 O values of the Sn-mineralised quartz veins are similar, i. e. 13. 6 and 14. 1  V-SMOW. The deltaD values show a larger spread between - 47 and - 67  V-SMOW. The delta 18 O-deltaD signature of the ambient fluids indicates a metamorphic and possibly magmatic signature. Both delta 18 O and deltaD values of the cassiterite samples are relatively homogeneous (7. 5 and 7. 9  V-SMOW delta 18 O, and - 90 and - 105  V&# 8209;SMOW deltaD). The delta 18 O-deltaD signature of the ambient fluids indicates that the Sn-mineralising fluid interacted with metamorphic rocks that contained organic material and NH 4 +-rich micas or feldspars. Based on the stable isotopic composition of the Sn-mineralised veins, the similar Pb isotope ratios in the sulphides of the Sn mineralised veins and the country rocks, and the gaseous composition of the Sn-mineralising fluid (N 2, CH 4), it is concluded that the Sn-mineralising fluid strongly interacted with metamorphic rocks that contained NH 4 +-rich micas or feldspars and organic material or graphite. Fluids that predate cassiterite precipitation in the quartz veins also show a metamorphic signature. It is clear that both the Sn and W vein-type deposits in Rwanda have many things in common, such as the structural setting (secondary anticlines), the relative timing (during or in a late stage of a deformation event, after intrusion of the G 4 -granites), host rock alteration (muscovitisation, tourmalinisation and the precipitation of biotite), the mineral paragenesis (quartz veins that have been crosscut by a late sulphide phase), the ore-mineralising fluid (an aqueous-gaseous fluid with a low to moderate salinity dominantly composed of Na and Cl, a minimal temperature of formation between ~ 230 &# 176; and ~ 350 &# 176;C, a gas phase dominantly composed of CO 2 with lesser amounts of N 2 and CH 4,), and the stable isotope composition of the ore minerals (points to interaction of the mineralising fluids with metamorphic rocks that contain NH 4 +-micas and feldspars and mature organic material). Although both the Sn and W vein-type deposits show this large amount of similarities, they do not occur together in the same location. The main difference between both deposit types is their lithological control, i. e. : the W vein-type deposits are typically hosted by units of alternating metapelitic rocks and sandstones, while the Sn vein-type deposits are hosted by thick sandstone/quartzite units. This leads to the conclusion that the host rock of the ore deposits played a controlling factor in ore deposition through water-rock interactions. Based on the similar setting, mineralogy and fluid composition it is stated that both types of ore deposits have been caused by the same mineralising event. Given that there is an overlap in ages between the G 4 &# 8209;granites and the W-mineralised quartz veins, and the typical association of Sn- and W-deposits with granite intrusions worldwide, the conclusion is drawn that both the Sn- and W-mineralising fluids originate from the geochemically specialised G 4 -granites in Rwanda. Strong water-rock interactions have subsequently overprinted this original signal and gave rise to the complex fluid chemistry as it can be seen today.
