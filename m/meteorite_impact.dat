5|$|Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 {{billion years}} ago to the present. Amazonian regions have few <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> craters, but are {{otherwise}} quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the ejected {{material}} from a <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> crater was discovered near Ullapool in Wester Ross. Preserved within sedimentary layers of sandstone, {{this is the}} largest known bolide impact from what are now the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Diamonds {{can also}} form under other {{naturally}} occurring high-pressure conditions. Very small diamonds of micrometer and nanometer sizes, known as microdiamonds or nanodiamonds respectively, {{have been found}} in <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> craters. Such impact events create shock zones of high pressure and temperature suitable for diamond formation. Impact-type microdiamonds can be used as an indicator of ancient impact craters. Popigai crater in Russia may have the world's largest diamond deposit, estimated at trillions of carats, and formed by an asteroid impact.|$|E

5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E
5|$|The K-T {{boundary}} {{is associated}} with abnormally high amounts of iridium, an element which is rare in Earth's crust, but relatively common in asteroids and in Earth's core. This {{has been used as}} evidence that a <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> caused the extinction of the dinosaurs (the Alvarez hypothesis). However, some paleontologists attribute the extinction event and the iridium anomaly to more gradual climatic change caused by the volcanic activity of the Deccan Traps. The Nanxiong Basin has special relevance to this discussion because it contains the K-T boundary. However, the position of boundary, as well as the duration of the extinction have been subject to debate. Zhao et al. (2002 and 2009) have postulated that there were at least two iridium-delivering events over a time period consistent with the Deccan Traps volcanism, correlated with a gradual decline in diversity and eventual disappearance of fossil eggs from the Nanxiong Basin. According to their interpretation, Macroolithus survived 250,000 years into the early Paleocene. However, Buck et al. (2004) disputed these claims, arguing that debris flows mixed and reworked the sediments near the boundary, causing a blurring of the iridium anomaly and the appearance of eggshell fragments on both sides.|$|E

25|$|Tridymite and {{cristobalite}} are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 {{that occur}} in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth's crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> sites. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|Mason Bay, on {{the west}} side, is notable as a long sandy beach on an island where beaches are {{typically}} far more rugged. One suggestion is that the bay was formed in the aftershock of a <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> in the Tasman Sea.|$|E

25|$|Artifacts {{recovered}} with tektites {{from the}} 803,000-year-old Australasian strewnfield event in Asia link a Homo erectus population {{to a significant}} <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> and its aftermath. Significant examples of Pleistocene impacts include the Lonar crater lake in India, approximately 52,000 years old (though {{a study published in}} 2010 gives a much greater age), which now has a flourishing semi-tropical jungle around it.|$|E
25|$|One {{attraction}} of large impact theories is that theoretically they could trigger other cause-considered extinction-paralleling phenomena, {{such as the}} Siberian Traps eruptions (see below) as being either an impact site or the antipode of an impact site. The abruptness of an impact also explains why more species did not rapidly evolve to survive, {{as would be expected}} if the Permian-Triassic event had been slower and less global than a <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact.</b>|$|E

25|$|Other mechanisms, such as melting from a <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact,</b> {{are less}} {{important}} today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, {{and the outer}} several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites {{in the last few}} hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.|$|E
25|$|The first {{recorded}} expedition {{arrived at the}} scene {{more than a decade}} after the event. In 1921, the Russian mineralogist Leonid Kulik, visiting the Podkamennaya Tunguska River basin as part of a survey for the Soviet Academy of Sciences, deduced from local accounts that the explosion had been caused by a giant <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact.</b> He persuaded the Soviet government to fund an expedition to the Tunguska region, based on the prospect of meteoric iron that could be salvaged to aid Soviet industry.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{theories}} {{for the cause of}} the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that included the dinosaurs is a large <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact.</b> The Chicxulub Crater has been identified as the site of this impact. There has been a lively scientific debate as to whether other major extinctions, including the ones {{at the end of the}} Permian and Triassic periods might also have been the result of large impact events, but the evidence is much less compelling than for the end Cretaceous extinction.|$|E
5000|$|Magelhaens {{is located}} {{southwest}} of the volcanic region of Tharsis. It is surrounded by rocky peaks of unknown origin. These forms {{may be the result}} of tectonic movements in the Tharsis region, or of <b>meteorite</b> <b>impacts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lapilli is a size {{classification}} term for tephra, which is material that {{falls out of}} the air during a volcanic eruption or during some <b>meteorite</b> <b>impacts.</b> Lapilli (singular: lapillus) means [...] "little stones" [...] in Latin.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the remains}} of ancient impacts {{generally}} are found on dry land, many, including most of the examples detailed in this volume, actually occurred in marine settings. In addition to the deformation of sedimentary target rocks, the record of <b>meteorite</b> <b>impacts</b> also includes proximal to distal ejecta and tsunami deposits, {{both of which are}} typically preserved in sedimentary successions. So, despite general agreement that impactites are metamorphic rocks because they have been exposed to shock-metamorphic pressures, many impacts and their lateral correlates are sedimentary by nature.

25|$|By the Cretaceous, hybodontiforms were {{primarily}} (though not solely) restricted to freshwater settings. They remained successful during the Cretaceous by adapting to freshwater conditions, for example seven genera {{were found in}} freshwater deposits from Thailand. The end-Cretaceous extinction of hybodont sharks may have been caused more by competition with other sharks than by the <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact</b> and volcanic eruptions cited {{to be the main}} cause of this extinction event. Most other sharks were not significantly affected by the end-Cretaceous extinction, also suggesting that competition lead to the demise of hybodonts.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{consensus of}} Earth and planetary scientists is that tektites consist of terrestrial debris that was ejected during {{the formation of}} an impact crater. During the extreme conditions created by an hypervelocity <b>meteorite</b> <b>impact,</b> near-surface terrestrial sediments and rocks were either melted, vaporized, or some combination of these and ejected from an impact crater. After ejection from the impact crater, the material formed millimeter- to centimeter-sized bodies of molten material, which as they re-entered the atmosphere, rapidly cooled to form tektites that fell to Earth to create a layer of distal ejecta hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the impact site.|$|E
