40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1976. Bibliography: leaves [86]- 88. Microfiche. v, 88 leaves illEconomists have {{suggested}} {{a variety of}} policies for the adjustment of balance of payments. The broad policies of adjusting internal demand or changing the foreign exchange rate to adjust the balance of payments have been categorized as expenditure changing and expenditure switching. Expenditure changing comes from varying the level of national income mainly through monetary and/or fiscal policy. Expenditure switching uses the foreign exchange rate to divert domestic and foreign expenditure between home and foreign goods. A change in uniform rates of export subsidy and import tariffs is often said to be identical with {{a foreign exchange rate}} change in its effects on the balance of payments. The main purpose of my study is to search for the most satisfactory policy tool to attain a more favorable balance of payments adjustment. I set the hypothesis that changing the foreign exchange rate is the best among these alternative policy tools. I compare the policy effects of monetary and/or fiscal policies with those of the foreign exchange rate change through a theoretical analysis. The opinion that the foreign exchange rate change and a uniform change in rates of export subsidy and import tariffs are identical is analyzed theoretically as well as tested empirically using Korean data. They are identical on three assumptions: First, the subsidy-tariff scheme must be applied to all international transactions, not only to <b>merchandise</b> <b>transactions.</b> Second, the elasticities of exports and imports with respect to subsidy and tariff changes must be equal to the elasticities of exports and imports with respect to foreign exchange rate change. Third, there must not be any inefficiency or corruption in the bureaucracy controlling the subsidy and tariff. Even if the second and third assumptions are met, the first is denied by the existence of international capital movements and the debt service transactions associated with them. In this case, the interest rate differential between local and foreign financing and the potential gap between the social and private cost of foreign borrowing plays the essential role in comparing the effects of the two policies. The theoretical discussion shows that the change of foreign exchange rate is better than monetary and/or fiscal policy as long as the foreign sector's fluctuations are not temporary phenomena. It is also found that changing the foreign exchange rate is better than the uniform subsidy-tariff scheme, when the latter is applied only to <b>merchandise</b> <b>transactions,</b> because of the foreign capital flow and its effects on <b>merchandise</b> <b>transactions.</b> The empirical test using Korean data for the period from 1962 to 1973 supports the theoretical conclusion of the advantage of changing the foreign exchange rate over the subsidy-tariff scheme. A non-uniform subsidy-tariff scheme, the subsidy on exports exceeding the tariff on imports, has been applied to <b>merchandise</b> <b>transactions</b> in Korea. The effects of foreign capital inflow on imports, which is the main point in the theoretical discussion are supplemented {{by the fact that the}} elasticities of several categories of exports with respect to foreign exchange rate change are higher than those with respect to the subsidy-tariff. The empirical findings show that the balance of payments would have improved by 3. 5 billion dollars more with the use of exchange rate policy than with the use of the uniform subsidy-tariff scheme during the period studied...|$|R

40|$|We use a dataset that {{includes}} all New Zealand <b>merchandise</b> export <b>transactions</b> to analyse exporters' dynamic currency hedging behaviour. We focus on whether exporters change their hedging behaviour ("selectively hedge") when {{the exchange rate}} and/or forward points depart from historical norms. We find that hedging ratios for exporters' Australian dollar exposures vary systematically as the exchange rate departs from historical averages; this behaviour is more marked for larger relative to smaller exporters. Consistent with efficient markets theory, {{there is no evidence}} that selective hedging is a profitable strategy for exporters. Selective currency hedging Exchange rates...|$|R

The implementation of the virtual currency would start from March 1, when fans and visitors to the Sacramento Kings games would be able to use Bitcoin to make the payment. In this instance, fans would pay in Bitcoin before BitPay converted the Bitcoin amount into dollars for the Sacramento Kings. The move came after Adafruit began accepting Bitcoin in November, which enabled the Sacramento Kings to accept the cryptocurrency.

40|$|Large-scale {{migration}} occurred {{from the}} late 19 th century to the 1930 's. There were 3 directions: from north to northeast, from inland areas to the coastal big cities, and from the south to southeast Asia; the southward and northward labor migrations being roughly equal. There was a short-term, periodic migration of farm workers and the like along with long-term or permanent abode-oriented (immigration) type of migration. Agriculture and mining in the northeastern region, industry in the coastal region, and commerce and sugar or rubber plantations in southeast Asia, were popular. In each of these cases, the provincial, affiliated relations of the migrants’ native places were maintained without interruption and, based {{on the development of}} various organizations mediating the migration, labor migration was made easy. However, in terms of proficiency of the labor force and the relatively low correlation with industry should be noted. With regard to the transfer of funds, there existed locally a country-wide remittance network of Shanxi bankers and the Remitting Houses directing remittances of Chinese merchants residing abroad in southeast Asia, which formed an international remittance network. The latter possessed several remittance routes based on Singapore and Hong Kong along with diverse exchange remittance functions. The client in southeast Asia pays into the Remitting Houses with local currency. It is then remitted to the agent in Hong Kong by Hong Kong dollars, exchanged for the currency of the People's Republic of China, and sent to agents in Fujian and Guangdong from where it is submitted to the remittee through the agent at home. This route was the established mode of the Remitting Houses, but even within this process there existed such forms as cancellation by countervailing by exchange trading in Singapore and Hong Kong, the abbreviation of cash remittance through <b>merchandise</b> <b>transactions,</b> and countervailing through trade connections by forming directly a settling connection with Guangdong and Amoy where remittances were concentrated. Selection was made among these, depending upon the price of merchandise and exchange rate in the market, and involved a close relationship between the southern Chinese economy and the money markets in Hong Kong and Singapore. Based on these general background, this paper tried to examine the history of emigration of Chao-Zhou people in the east Guangdong province and their relationship with their home land...|$|R
