5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> at {{the start}} of the game it is vital for the goalkeeper to stretch for 15 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> {{the volume}} of data is {{increasing}} exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 10 months.|$|E
5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base {{defined by a}} physical example or artefact. <b>Moreover,</b> after the 1996–1998 recalibration a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary Hittite {{accounts}} {{about the}} campaigns of Attarsiya and the Ahhiya in general {{may indicate that}} there was a possible Mycenaean empire centered on late Bronze Age Greece. <b>Moreover,</b> Attarsiya might be a possible Hittite reconstruction of the Greek name Atreus, a king of Mycenae according to Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the claims}} for 15 September 1942 are in serious doubt, {{following}} the first detailed {{scrutiny of the}} records of individual Allied squadrons by Australian historian Russell Brown. <b>Moreover,</b> Brown lists three occasions on which Marseille could not have downed as many aircraft as claimed.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{independence}} is essential. It would be futile {{for people to}} approach the courts for adjudication of their disputes if the courts do not apply the law independently. <b>Moreover,</b> people can only be guided by the law if judges apply it correctly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> any object {{traveling}} {{at a constant}} velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This {{is the definition of}} dynamic equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> goalkeepers {{should have}} leadership. They should inform field players of information, such as unmarked {{players and the}} time of the game clock and give {{instructions}} to the field players. Because of this, they may sometimes be known as the coach in the water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> {{in living}} cells, the storage {{can be turned}} active by enzymes. Light-gated protein domains fused to DNA {{processing}} enzymes are suitable for that task in vitro. Fluorescent exonucleases can transmit the output according to the nucleotide they have read.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> the Jeita cave emits {{a spring}} with a flow ranging from 1–2m3/s, {{providing}} fresh drinking water for one-and-a-half million {{inhabitants of the}} capital, Beirut. However, water pollution, due to domestic and agricultural runoff, remains a serious concern as recent analysis detected an increasing presence of coliform bacteria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> {{the town}} is home to local offices for Defra, the Charity Commission for England and Wales, and General Electric. The first ever store of the {{multinational}} clothing retailer New Look opened in Taunton in 1969. Taunton is also famous {{for the production of}} cider.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moreover,</b> their {{volatile}} composition {{means that}} as they repeatedly approach the Sun, radiation gradually boils the volatiles off until the comet splits or develops an insulating crust that prevents further outgassing.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the current}} {{population}} of Taiwanese aborigines, about 70% {{identify themselves as}} Christian. <b>Moreover,</b> many of the Plains groups have mobilized their members around predominantly Christian organizations; most notably the Taiwan Presbyterian Church and Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Overall, damage {{amounted}} to $9.6million; including $4million in property damage. <b>Moreover,</b> 18individuals were injured. Around 220,000were homeless. In all, 5,365homes were damaged due to Typhoon Faye. Although the typhoon passed {{well to the}} south of Japan, Faye killed two people there, including one due to a landslide.|$|E
5|$|Pindus {{mountain}} range. <b>Moreover,</b> {{it belongs}} to the Natura 2000 ecological network of protected areas {{and is one of the}} three places in Greece that hosts a population of bears.|$|E
5|$|SLCO1B3 {{has been}} {{identified}} as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; <b>moreover,</b> substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The Arp2/3 complex {{simultaneously}} controls nucleation of actin polymerization and branching of filaments. <b>Moreover,</b> autocatalysis {{is observed}} during Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization. In this process, {{the newly formed}} filaments activate other Arp2/3 complexes, facilitating the formation of branched filaments.|$|E
5|$|The Germans were {{especially}} {{active in the}} destruction of Jewish culture in Poland; nearly all of the wooden synagogues there were destroyed. <b>Moreover,</b> the sale of Jewish literature was banned throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|The Song Chinese {{observed}} supernovae. <b>Moreover,</b> the Soochow Astronomical Chart on Chinese planispheres {{was prepared}} in 1193 for instructing {{the crown prince}} on astronomical findings. The planispheres were engraved in stone several decades later.|$|E
5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. <b>Moreover,</b> Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, {{at a lower price}} to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. <b>Moreover,</b> the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E
5|$|The provinces ceded to him {{for that}} ten-year period {{comprised}} much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, Syria, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Egypt. <b>Moreover,</b> command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.|$|E
5|$|The {{states of}} West Bengal and Tripura in India also follow and {{celebrate}} the Day by paying {{tribute to the}} unsung heroes. <b>Moreover</b> all the bengalees in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives {{just for the sake}} of the First language.|$|E
5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. <b>Moreover,</b> {{the threat of}} future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time {{it became apparent that}} the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E

25|$|<b>Moreover,</b> the Liouville numbers form a dense {{subset of}} the set of real numbers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Moreover,</b> {{the impact}} of various kinds of matter fields has been investigated.|$|E
