5|$|<b>Maritime</b> trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple <b>maritime</b> trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in <b>maritime</b> monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the <b>maritime</b> trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{is governed by}} the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF), the Japan <b>Maritime</b> Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).

The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.|$|E

40|$|Species {{biogeography}} is {{a result}} of complex events and factors associated with climate change, ecological interactions, anthropogenic impacts, physical geography, and evolution. To understand the contemporary biogeography of a species, it is necessary to understand its history. Specimens from areas of localized extinction are important, as extirpation of species from these areas may represent the loss of unique adaptations and a distinctive evolutionary trajectory. The walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) has a discontinuous circumpolar distribution in the arctic and subarctic that once included the southeastern Canadian <b>Maritimes</b> region. However, exploitation of the <b>Maritimes</b> population during the 16 th- 18 th centuries led to extirpation, and the species has not inhabited areas south of 55 °N for ∼ 250 years. We examined genetic and morphological characteristics of specimens from the <b>Maritimes,</b> Atlantic (O. r. rosmarus) and Pacific (O. r. divergens) populations to test the hypothesis that the first group was distinctive. Analysis of Atlantic and <b>Maritimes</b> specimens indicated that most skull and mandibular measurements were significantly different between the <b>Maritimes</b> and Atlantic groups and discriminant analysis of principal components confirmed them as distinctive groups, with complete isolation of skull features. The <b>Maritimes</b> walrus appear to have been larger animals, with larger and more robust tusks, skulls and mandibles. The mtDNA control region haplotypes identified in <b>Maritimes</b> specimens were unique to the region and a greater average number of nucleotide {{differences were found between the}} regions (Atlantic and <b>Maritimes)</b> than within either group. Levels of diversity (h and π) were lower in the <b>Maritimes,</b> consistent with other studies of species at range margins. Our data suggest that the <b>Maritimes</b> walrus was a morphologically and genetically distinctive group that was on a different evolutionary path from other walrus found in the north Atlantic...|$|R
5|$|Along {{with land}} trade routes, a <b>Maritime</b> Silk Road {{contributed to the}} flow of goods and {{establishment}} of a Pax Mongolica. This <b>Maritime</b> Silk Road started with short coastal routes in Southern China. As technology and navigation progressed these routes developed into a high-seas route into the Indian Ocean. Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, and the sea off East Africa.|$|E
