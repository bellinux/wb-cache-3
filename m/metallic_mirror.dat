25|$|Vacuum {{deposition}} {{began with}} {{the study of the}} sputtering phenomenon during the 1920s and 1930s, which was a common problem in lighting in which metal ejected from the electrodes coated the glass, blocking output. However, turning sputtering into a reliable method of coating a mirror did not occur until the invention of semiconductors in the 1970s. Evaporation coating was pioneered by John Strong in 1912. Aluminum was a desirable material for mirrors, but was too dangerous to apply with electroplating. Strong used evaporation coating to make the first aluminum telescope mirrors in the 1930s. The first dielectric mirror was created in 1937 by Auwarter using evaporated rhodium, while the first <b>metallic</b> <b>mirror</b> to be enhanced with a dielectric coating of silicon dioxide was created by Hass the same year. In 1939 at the Schott Glass company, Walter Geffcken invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings (stacks).|$|E

Be layers formed in PISCES-B exhibit high levels of porosity which makes the reflectivity of the Be layers much lower than the reflectivity of pure Be.

This work investigates routes to miniaturization of chip-scale optical devices. Two new techniques and devices based thereon are introduced for the first time. One technique makes use of integrated <b>metallic</b> <b>mirrors</b> to construct reflectors which are by an order of magnitude smaller than their counterparts. Another technique is based on folding of chip-scale devices to fit long structures into small area on a chip. Although both techniques are demonstrated on some specific examples, the developed toolkit is applicable to a wide range of chip-scale devices including modulators, filters, channel add-drop multiplexers, detectors, and others. The major part of this Thesis focuses on miniaturization of waveguide reflectors and the devices based thereon.

40|$|Plasma-surface {{interactions}} in fusion devices represent {{a critical issue}} for the design and operation of diagnostic systems based on transmission of light signals from plasma where <b>metallic</b> <b>mirrors</b> {{will be used as}} first plasma-viewing elements. In this work, the behavior of <b>metallic</b> <b>mirrors</b> is investigated with respect to the influence of plasma-induced changes of surface morphology and composition on the surface reflectivity. The work is based on the series of dedicated experiments performed in tokamaks TEXTOR and DIII-D, in which pre-characterized <b>metallic</b> <b>mirrors</b> were exposed during the plasma operation (TEXTOR) and during the thermo-oxidative wall conditioning (DIII-D). The morphology, composition and optical properties of the mirror surfaces are analyzed post-mortem. To understand the observed surface modifications, ion-surface interactions are modelled with the SDTrimSP code. The processes responsible for modifications of the surface morphology and composition under energetic particles bombardment, the surface erosion and formation of deposited layers, are investigated. Measurements show that the specular reflectivity of a mirror strongly depends on the surface roughness. The surface roughness after a plasma exposure depends on the crystalline structure of the material {{due to the fact that}} grains with different crystalline orientations have different sputtering rates. An increase of the surface roughness resulting from non-homogeneous sputtering of a polycrystalline material leads to a significant drop of the specular reflectivity due to diffuse scattering of the incident light. It is shown that under net erosion conditions coatings with nano-sized crystallites demonstrate a similar behaviour compared to polycrystalline materials. On the contrary, single crystalline mirrors are sputtered uniformly, thus show significantly less roughening and preserve the reflectivity better. The mirror reflectivity depends also on the surface composition, which can be changed due to plasma-surface interactions. The thickness of the affected surface layer depends on the balance between the processes of erosion, deposition, particle implantation, diffusion, and chemical reactions. For instance, carbide formation is observed on mirrors exposed in TEXTOR, thus contributing to the decrease of the surface reflectivity. The independence of the resulting depth distributions of carbon atoms from the mirror temperature suggests that the volume diffusion of carbon is very slow and can be neglected when comparing the diffusion depth with the ion implantation depth or the thickness of the eroded layer within the time scale of the experiment. It is shown that formation of carbides and oxides slows down the volume diffusion and prevents deeper penetration of impurity atoms into the surface. Measurements and modelling give a strong indication of a dynamic equilibrium established between the different physical and chemical processes involved. This equilibrium results in similar thicknesses of carbide layers formed on all molybdenum mirrors independent on the incident particle fluence and sample temperature. The overall balance between erosion and deposition processes on the mirror surface depends strongly on plasma parameters. Net erosion conditions are beneficial for <b>metallic</b> <b>mirrors</b> since such conditions do not lead to an unpredictable layer growth. It is demonstrated in this work that the balance between erosion and deposition can be shifted towards net erosion by means of intentional injection of gaseous species in the vicinity of the mirror surface during the plasma exposure...|$|R
