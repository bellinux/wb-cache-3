25|$|Microtubules {{can act as}} {{substrates}} for motor {{proteins that}} are involved in important cellular functions such as vesicle trafficking and cell division. Unlike other microtubule-associated proteins, motor proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical work that moves the protein along the substrate. The major motor proteins that interact with microtubules are kinesin, which usually <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> (+) end of the microtubule, and dynein, which <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> (−) end.|$|E

25|$|The surface {{composition}} of the northern ice cap in middle spring (after a winter's accumulation of seasonal dry ice) has been studied from orbit. The outer edges of the ice cap are contaminated with dust (0.15% by weight) and are mostly water ice. As one <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> pole, the surface water ice content decreases and is replaced by dry ice. The purity of the ice also increases. At the pole, the surface seasonal ice consists of essentially pure dry ice with little dust content and 30 parts per million of water ice.|$|E
25|$|The diagram on {{the right}} {{suggests}} a plausible explanation of whistle operation. Within the cavity is an off-center vortex. In the upper drawing, the vortex center is near the jet; the nearby cavity flow is slower and the pressure is less than atmospheric so the jet is directed into the cavity. When the jet <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cavity an additional thrust {{is given to the}} interior vertical flow which then rotates around and back to the edge. At that point, the cavity flow and the local pressure are sufficient to force the jet {{to move away from the}} cavity.|$|E
25|$|The {{sperm and}} the egg cell, {{which has been}} {{released}} {{from one of the}} female's two ovaries, unite in one of the two fallopian tubes. The fertilized egg, known as a zygote, then <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> uterus, a journey that can take up to a week to complete. Cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the male and female cells unite. Cell division continues at a rapid rate and the cells then develop into what is known as a blastocyst. The blastocyst arrives at the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall, a process known as implantation.|$|E

25|$|Having {{moved away}} from the socialist {{economic}} model since the mid-1980s and early 1990s, Israel has made dramatic <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> free-market capitalist paradigm. , Israel's economic freedom score is 67.8, making its economy the 48th freest in the 2012 Index of Economic Freedom. Israel's economic competitiveness is helped by strong protection of property rights, relatively low corruption levels, and high openness to global trade and investment. Income and corporate tax rates remain relatively high. , Israel ranks 36th out of 182 countries in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Bribery and other forms of corruption are illegal in Israel, which is a signatory to the OECD Bribery Convention since 2008.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the bolt}} is locked into the barrel {{extension}} by locking lugs, so the expanding gas forces the bolt carrier backward a short distance. As the bolt carrier <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{butt of the}} gun, the bolt cam pin, riding in a slot on the bolt carrier, forces the bolt to rotate and thus unlocks it from the barrel extension. Once the bolt is fully unlocked it begins its rearward movement along with the bolt carrier. The bolt's rearward motion extracts the empty cartridge case from the chamber. As soon as {{the neck of the}} case clears the barrel extension, the bolt's spring-loaded ejector forces it out the ejection port {{in the side of the}} upper receiver.|$|E
25|$|Cap {{formation}} {{is now seen as}} {{closely related to}} the carbon particle experiments of Abercrombie. In this case, crawling fibroblasts were held in a medium containing small (~1 micrometre in size) carbon particles. On occasion, these particles attached to the front leading edge of these cells: When they did so, the particles were observed to move rearward on the cell’s dorsal surface. They did so in a roughly straight line, with the particle remaining initially stationary with respect to the substratum. The cell seemed to ooze forward under the particle. In view of what we know of capping, this phenomenon is now interpreted as follows: The particle is presumably stuck to many surface molecules, crosslinking them and forming a patch. As in capping, the particle <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> back of the cell.|$|E

25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the jejunum, while most of the ileum and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the ileum, the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E
25|$|Within ASL {{there is}} a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. These verbs include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either {{physically}} present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, direct or indirect depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and <b>moves</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed {{at each other and}} alkuately approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify where things are or how they moved them around.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{elements}} in Barton Fink highlight the veneer of postmodernism: {{the writer is}} unable to resolve his modernist focus on high culture with the studio's desire to create formulaic high-profit films; the resulting collision produces a fractured story arc emblematic of postmodernism.
