50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>fireleg</b> <b>tarantula</b> is {{native to}} Mexico, where it is found along the central Pacific coast in western Guerrero State, where it prefers dry scrubland, and is found in burrows, either self-made or {{abandoned}} rodent or lizard burrows, usually under rocks or fallen logs.|$|E
50|$|To {{regulate}} {{its commercial}} trade across borders, this species has been listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In Mexico, permits {{are required to}} collect or remove any spider {{of the family of}} tarantulas, Theraphosidae, and the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fireleg</b> <b>tarantula</b> is now frequently bred in captivity, reducing the need to collect it from the wild.|$|E
50|$|Tarantulas of this genus are long-lived, with males {{reaching}} maturity {{at seven}} to eight years, females at nine to ten. While males only live {{up to a year}} after their final molt, females may live for a further ten years. Sub-adults and adults molt {{at the end of the}} dry season (November to June), after which males begin their search for mating females. The mating, time spent gravid and the egg sac is laid after the female molts. If the female molts prior to laying the sac, the eggs and sperm are lost with the molt. If the egg sac is successful it will generally hatch three to four weeks before the rainy season begins. <b>Mexican</b> <b>Fireleg</b> <b>tarantulas</b> tend to be active after dark, but can also be active during daylight, particularly in the morning and evening.|$|R
50|$|Brachypelma boehmei (also {{known as}} the <b>Mexican</b> <b>fireleg,</b> or the <b>Mexican</b> rustleg {{tarantula}}) is a tarantula native to Mexico in Guerrero state.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>fireleg</b> resembles its better-known relative, the Mexican redknee {{tarantula}} (Brachypelma smithi), in its dramatic {{orange and}} black coloration, though the adults {{of the species}} range from 5 to 6 inches in size. This species of tarantula has a slower growth rate {{than many of the}} larger South American tarantula species. The black femora (upper legs) provide a dark dividing band between the rich orange color of the carapace and lower legs. Unlike the orange joints of Brachypelma smithi, the legs of this species are a bright, fiery red on the patellae (or knees), fading gradually to a paler orange further down and tipped by black tarsi (or feet). Although not particularly defensive, this species of spider can have a nervous temperament, where the spider can flick urticating hairs when it feels threatened.|$|R
