The locus&# 13; of the observable is the televised panorama of channels whose screens display time clocks&# 13; (which is why these channels constitute the corpus of this research), with the clocks serving&# 13; as the reference system of observation. The <b>main</b> <b>time</b> <b>clock</b> frame on the screens of different&# 13; channels is analyzed and a discussion is made of the figures of time displayed thereon. Este artigo tem por objeto a natureza precípua das audiovisualidades de tevê, configuradas&# 13; por imagens técnicas eletrônicas que são a síntese temporal de um conjunto mutante de&# 13; formas dispostas em incessantes fluxos simultâneos. O lócus dos observáveis é o panorama&# 13; televisivo dos canais que hoje mostram em seu écran "relógios" de marcar o "tempo"&# 13; (canais que, por isso, constituem o corpus da pesquisa), sendo que estes foram escolhidos&# 13; para serem o sistema de referência do observatório. Será analisada a moldura principal de&# 13; relógios em panoramas televisivos de diferentes canais e se discutirão as figuras do tempo&# 13; que ali são enunciadas...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide the}} proper {{positioning}} signal, global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs), need very accurate satellite on-board time references. For GPS, GLONAS and GALILEO, such time references are spaceborn atomic clocks. The augmentation/positioning system QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System) would need {{the same kind}} of accuracy. However, due to the high QZSS satellite visibility, a completely new kind of time reference method, where no on-board atomic references are needed, could be adopted. If an opportune ground location is chosen, QZSS satellites are fully visible for the whole orbital period. Therefore, a <b>main</b> <b>time</b> reference (atomic <b>clock),</b> located on the ground, could be kept synchronized to a inexpensive and compact time reference (VCXO) on board each QZSS satellite. In the following article, a new practical implementation of such a remote synchronization method is proposed and some of its problematic are discussed...|$|R
