5000|$|The Irish Moiled Cow {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} breed of cow in Ireland and [...] "the Moiled breed has been very {{successful}} in proportion to its numbers in open competition with other breeds in the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> contests." [...] Although the Irish Moiled Cow really did originate from Ireland, its known location to most is Finland. This is due to the fact that Norseman, such as the Danes, took much of the cattle. The numbers of Irish Moiled Cow left in Ireland made the true Irish cows endangered, and in an effort to replenish the numbers, the Irish Moiled Cattle Society tried to buy cows from Finland. The only problem was that they had to get special permits in order to breed these cows to bring them back. Once the cow had been replenished in Ireland, there was a sharp decline from 1930 to 1970. By the late 1970s there were only 30 cows left in Ireland owned by two breeders. The cow was becoming extinct and if the demand for Irish Moiled beef had not been required, this breed would have died out. Since then, the cow has made a comeback, it is still rare and endangered but is now being produced more widespread throughout Ireland as well as parts of England. There are now around one hundred breeders in the mainland of Ireland as well as another 40 breeders in England. Another important note of the Irish Moiled Cow is that throughout all the hardships that the breed has faced, they have maintained a pure breed albeit with some careful admixture of polled Lincoln red and beef shorthorn blood when the breed numbers were so low and no pedigree bulls were registered. Since then a grading up register was for a period allowed but has now been officially closed. This means that the species of Irish Moiled is maintained and healthy and breeding pure once again.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{elaborated}} a detailed {{review of literature}} to illuminate the importance of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in breeds of dairy cows, which illustrates the benefits of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> for breeders. The emergence of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic dates back to 1905, when it began <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> {{carried out by the}} Danish model. From the beginning of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> was not met with such great success. Over time, the importance of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic grew. Patronage over <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> over the years was taken by the International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR), which includes the Czech Republic since 1992. The <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic is performed using several methods. Official method A and unofficial methods B and F, wherein the method A is divided into A 4 -P, A 4 -A and A 4 -T. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> in the Czech Republic is performed only properly educated personnel, who takes sample in individual farms. After sampling, the samples are transported and subsequently processed in laboratories for analysis of milk. Results of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> are important for the monetization of milk and breeding organization. The results of many years of breeding work, the main base are just the results of <b>milk</b> <b>recording,</b> were the reduction cows and increase milk production. Only the number of cows in lactation period from the year 2005 to 2014 fell by 50, 636 dairy cows. To reduce dairy cows occurred precisely because of the increasing milk production. Larger quantities of milk milked from each cow meant that {{there was no need for}} such a large amount of dairy cattle. Milk production from 2005 to 2014 increased on average by 1, 477 kg, which is the result of breeding work. Importance of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> is currently mainly breeding again.

40|$|Information on {{accuracy}} of milk-sampling devices used on farms with automated milking systems (AMS) {{is essential for}} development of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> protocols. The hypotheses {{of this study were}} (1) devices used by AMS units are similarly accurate in estimating milk yield and in collecting representative milk samples compared with devices used by certified <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> providers on farms with conventional milking systems (CMS) and (2) devices used on both AMS and CMS comply with accuracy criteria described by the New Zealand Standard and by the International Committee of Animal Recording (ICAR). <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> data from 5 AMS farms were collected during 13 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days between December 2011 and February 2013. Milk yield was estimated by ICAR-approved milk meters on AMS units. Milk samples were collected over a 48 -h period and submitted to an off-site certified laboratory for milk composition analysis. Data were also collected manually from 5 to 10 cows per AMS unit; a complete milking of a cow was weighed to serve as gold standard for milk yield, and 3 milk samples per cow milking were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to serve as gold standards for milk composition. A similar procedure was used during 6 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> occasions with devices used during conventional <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> at a CMS research farm. Farm type, breed, season, and region did not appear to affect accuracy of devices used on AMS units. Milk meters used by AMS units complied with ICAR limits in 12. 5 and 25 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days for test bucket weights between 2 and 10 kg and for test bucket weights > 10 kg, respectively. These percentages were 52 and 42 %, respectively, for devices used on CMS. Analyzing all samples as one <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test day, 1. 4 % fell outside the 20 % difference band for AMS compared with 1. 1 % of the milk samples for CMS. Devices used by AMS complied with ICAR in 73 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days for fat percentage, compared with 42 % of the <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test days by devices used at the CMS farm. When analyzing all milk samples as one <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test day, 3. 5 % of the milk samples fell outside the 99 % ICAR limit for AMS compared with 17. 2 % of the milk samples for CMS. Applying the ICAR standards for fat percentage to crude protein percentage and SCC, devices used on AMS were accurate in estimating crude protein percentage but not in estimating SCC. Thus, devices on AMS units did not comply with national nor ICAR standards with regard to milk yield and fat percentage. However, devices used on AMS were similarly or more accurate compared with devices used during conventional <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> It is proposed that devices used on AMS units, when calibrated regularly and when set up according to the manufacturer’s instruction, have similar or improved accuracy compared with CMS devices. Because the New Zealand industry accepts data from devices currently used by certified providers for <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> on CMS farms, results imply that the AMS devices should also be permitted to be used for <b>milk</b> <b>recording...</b>|$|E

The data used in this study were 11, 430 individual test-day milk yield records collected from November 2004 to November 2006 on 813 cows reared on 15 family farms in Croatia. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> was performed according to A 4 and A 6 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> method by the field officer of the Croatian Livestock Centre. From the corrected database with test-day records, two different datasets were created. The first dataset (A 4; n = 7, 500) included test day records collected every four weeks, while the second dataset (A 6; n = 3, 830) included test day records collected every six weeks. When lactation milk yields were predicted from alternative <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> methods (AT 4, AT 6), daily (24 h) milk yield was estimated from single evening or morning milk yield using linear model that taken into account effect of interval between successive milkings. Lactation milk yield was calculated for three different days in milk (100, 200 and 305 days) using the Test Interval Method (TIM) that is reference method by ICAR (ICAR, 2003).

40|$|Dairy cows grazing {{pasture and}} milked using {{automated}} milking systems (AMS) have lower milking frequencies than indoor fed cows milked using AMS. Therefore, <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> intervals used for herd testing indoor fed cows {{may not be}} suitable for cows on pasture based farms. We hypothesised that accurate standardised 24 h estimates could be determined for AMS herds with <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> intervals of less than the Gold Standard (48 hs), but that the optimum <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> interval {{would depend on the}} herd average for milking frequency. The Gold Standard protocol was applied on five commercial dairy farms with AMS, between December 2011 and February 2013. From 12 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> test periods, involving 2211 cow-test days and 8049 cow milkings, standardised 24 h estimates for milk volume and milk composition were calculated for the Gold Standard protocol and compared with those collected during nine alternative sampling scenarios, including six shorter sampling periods and three in which a fixed number of milk samples per cow were collected. Results infer a 48 h <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> protocol is unnecessarily long for collecting accurate estimates during <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> on pasture based AMS farms. Collection of two milk samples only per cow was optimal in terms of high concordance correlation coefficients for milk volume and components and a low proportion of missed cow-test days. Further research is required {{to determine the effects of}} diurnal variations in milk composition on standardised 24 h estimates for milk volume and components, before a protocol based on a fixed number of samples could be considered.

Statistical analysis using survival analysis and logistic regression method included 14, 864 Holstein cows with a total of 29, 278 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> records and 18, 708 Simmental cows with a total of 37, 416 <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> records. Correlation coefficient values were within the range ± 0. 00 to ± 0. 20 indicating a negligible correlation between the service periods duration and the traits recorded during the <b>milk</b> <b>recording.</b> Higher conception probability at all classes of service periods duration in the Simmental compared to the Holstein breed was determined using the analysis of movement survival curves for service period duration.

40|$|We {{propose a}} semi-parametric model for {{lactation}} curves that, along with stage of lactation, accounts for {{day of the}} year at <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> and stage of gestation. Lactation is described as having 3 different phases defined by 2 change points of which the second is a function of gestation stage. Season of <b>milk</b> <b>recording</b> is modelled using cosine and sine functions. As an application, the model is used to estimate the association between intramammary infections (IMI) dynamics as measured by somatic cell count (SCC) over the dry period and the shape of the lactation curve. <b>Milk</b> <b>recording</b> data collected in 2128 herds from England and Wales between 2004 and 2007 were used in the analysis. From a random sample of 1000 of these herds, smoothed milk production was used to test the behaviour of the model and estimate model parameters. The first change point was set at 60 days in milk. The second change point was set at 100 days of gestation or 200 days in milk when the latter was not available. Using data from the 1128 remaining herds, multilevel models were then used to model individual test-day milk production within lactations within herds. Average milk production at 60 days in milk for cows of parities 1, 2, 3 and greater than 3 were 26. 9 kg, 31. 6 kg, 34. 4 kg and 34. 7 kg respectively and, after this stage, decreases in milk production per 100 days milk of lactation were 3. 1 kg, 5. 1 kg, 6. 3 kg and 6. 7 kg respectively.
