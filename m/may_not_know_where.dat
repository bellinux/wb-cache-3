To that extent, many new varieties of maps (including three-dimensional ones) have been developed but not thoroughly studied.

40|$|Today most on-site systems fail {{due to lack}} of {{monitoring}} and maintenance. For instance, the septic tank, which is the most common on-site system, requires periodic checking of the bottom sludge layer and the top scum layer, so that the homeowner knows when it is time to pump it out. Otherwise, the scum and sludge layers may become too thick and eventually overflow into the leach field, which may clog both the leach lines and the soil. If the soil gets clogged, the bacteria contaminated water may surface and cause ponding. Clogging of the leach lines may cause the wastewater to back up into the house. One {{of the reasons for the}} lack {{of monitoring}} is that the layers have to be manually checked, which requires working with wastewater and risking bacteria and virus contamination. Some homeowners <b>may</b> <b>not</b> even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the septic tank is buried. MicroSepTec has developed the first intelligent wastewater treatment system called the EnviroServer.

The veracity of the world he has created is poetic, not literal; he deals not in road signs but in symbols....Jimmy Porter no longer impresses me in fiction or in life, but the lesson I learned watching Look Back in Anger has stayed with me.

The main impact of the World Health Organization’s Health for All 2000 programme was probably related to its focus upon using health indicators as health policy goals rather than productivity or cost alone. The vision was that healthcare planning would be prepared by people with expertise in public health, clinical medicine as well as economics and management. Health professionals should outline the paths to achieve these goals, and the managers should estimate how much it would cost and let the politicians make the final decisions. The hope was that the decision process would be related to health parameters and that the progress would be transparent for the taxpayers, so that achievements could be monitored. The philosophy of this approach is still worth pursuing, but the first condition for such a planning process is to identify relevant health indicators that can be monitored over time. If we have no such indicators, we do <b>not</b> <b>know</b> whether we are on the right track; we <b>may</b> <b>not</b> even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we are.

Those who receive images <b>may</b> <b>not</b> exactly <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they have originated from or who their sender was. In those circumstances, determining the authenticity of received images would be extremely difficult and therefore providing authenticity to images has been considered as an essential area of image security research. On the other hand, processing images for storage reduction, noise removal, or quality enhancement, is also essential in many computer applications, because images are inherently larger than text and are subject to noise or transcoding. The authentication of image is achieved either by appending a Message Authentication Code or a Signature to an image or by embedding a watermark into the image which is fragile to any modification. On the other hand, storage reduction for images is mainly achieved by lossy compression techniques such as JPEG or MPEG, and the quality enhancement or noise reduction for images is accomplished by employing filtering techniques such as Median or Gaussain. In this thesis, we propose hash functions which extract essential image features that survive acceptable level of JPEG compression while distinguishing other modifications using statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, hypothesis of testing, and k-mean clustering, and wavelet/discrete cosine transform. For the proposed transform based hash functions, we optimise performance by fixing some essential parameters such as the size of hash, the value of the threshold and the low-pass filter used. We also propose two oblivious fragile watermarking schemes. The first one embeds a logo on feature points or critical point extracted using wavelet or discrete cosine transform, and the next one embeds a logo on image blocks based on polarity of pixel points. For the proposed schemes, after analysing the security level, the possibilities of embedding multiple logos for secret sharing have also been investigated. The appendix of the thesis addresses some of our early work on combined compression and encryption scheme based on adaptive Huffman coding, compression performance of a proposed JPEG encryption scheme, and cryptanalysis of Huffman coding with four symbol alphabet...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{development}} of most engineered systems usually involves {{large amounts of}} investment, yet their value may decrease significantly when operation environments change. The out-of-date systems are often discarded because upgrading usually costs more than replacing. While it has been recognized that system adaptability is required by both economical and mission-critical needs, {{there has been little}} research that explores and develops theories and methodologies for designing adaptive systems partly due to the traditional "static design" framing of engineering design problems.; A general way to solve design problems is to "Divide and Conquer" the problem whereby the design is decomposed through its various hierarchical layers in the hopes that it becomes simpler to address and realize at the lower levels. The systems which the D&C approach is suited to be applied to are those systems with a limited level of complexity, i. e. statically connected system elements. Adaptability requires flexibility which calls for allowing system elements to have dynamic connections. Doing so results in an increase of system complexity because more information is required to define it. As a result, the D&C based approach may find its limitations when being applied to such complex systems because one <b>may</b> <b>not</b> even <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to begin dividing. In order to cope with the complexity problem of adaptive systems design and avoid potential limitations of the D&C type top-down approach, we explore a more bottom-up approach to design. The basic idea of this approach is two-fold. First, to allow a system to exhibit adaptability the system must be able to self-organize itself in case of situational changes. Second, for an adaptive system to maintain its designated functionality, it must possess mechanisms that allow the system to keep its functional information and regulate its self-organizing process.; We develop and discuss a Self-Organizing System Design Framework or SOS Framework for the {{development of}} adaptive systems and draw insights for it from principles and concepts extracted from biology. In this dissertation we expand one facet of SOS by developing an artificial DNA-based Cellular Formation Representation framework (cFORE) for representing and constructing artificial systems in a manner which mimics biological systems. One of the key issues in achieving high adaptability in artificial systems is how to dynamically capture, represent and apply design information pertaining to the designed functions and changing environmental situations. Biological DNA in natural systems plays the key role in keeping, maintaining and transferring such "design information" within and between individuals. Resembling biological DNA, we developed an "artificial DNA" called dDNA (Design DNA) which maintains design information and provides an avenue for generating new designs adaptively. In this dissertation, we present a discussion of the overall SOS framework along with the modeling of its first facet, cFORE. A simple case example along with a more detailed multi-agent based computer simulation study is provided to demonstrate the power of SOS and cFORE towards the development of mechanical self-organizing cellular adaptive systems...|$|R

All the additional costs will catch participants' attention and some may think they are not worth of investment. Thirdly, DG will seem to be a favourable technologies for renewable energy to use because their characteristics of small in size and feasible to co-operate with traditional energy sources. However, it will create additional load on the existing distribution system that causes the electrical power to flow back to electrical energy grid, which is not original design of the electrical energy gird.
