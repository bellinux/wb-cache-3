5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> develop ambivalent attachments.

5000|$|The charity Empty Homes {{argued that}} empty homes were helping {{contribute}} to the housing crisis, saying in a report [...] "The longer a property is empty the more our housing assets are being wasted. Also, the longer a property lies empty, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> it is <b>to</b> deteriorate; the <b>more</b> it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cost to bring back into use; and the <b>more</b> it is <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be seen as a}} blight by the neighbours." ...|$|R

5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be artefacts {{at the end of}} their usable life. Aquatic animal products arriving at Motul de San José were far <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5000|$|The Residential Principle. The more {{segregated}} the role-relationship, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{couples are}} <b>to</b> have a stable residence pattern.

5|$|Cataclysmic events (meteorite/asteroid impacts, volcanism) {{that cause}} mass extinctions of species that, until the event, were {{perfectly}} adapted to their environment, {{such as the}} dinosaurs.

50|$|Asthma {{is caused}} by a {{combination}} of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions. These factors influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment. It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment. Onset before age 12 is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> due <b>to</b> genetic influence, while onset after 12 is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> due <b>to</b> environmental influence.|$|R

5|$|In a Swiss {{study of}} the {{nominate}} subspecies, 76% of eggs hatched, and 58% of chicks fledged. Birds of the race A. s. blakistoni in the Tian Shan hatched 90% of their eggs, and hatchlings survived to fledging in 47% of the nests. In the latter study, early nests were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> fail because less plant cover made them <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be found by predators. Neither the average lifespan nor the maximum age of survival are known.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, {{cancer is a}} cause of considerable morbidity in women. Women have a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E
