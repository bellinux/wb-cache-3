5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a <b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E

5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (<b>minimum</b> <b>of</b> <b>two</b> players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put no limitation on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the fans are listed below with their vote totals.|$|E
