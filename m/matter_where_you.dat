500|$|Catherine Hoad {{finds the}} issue of {{national}} and racial identity central to Viking metal. For instance, she writes that when Trafford and Pluskowski claim that Manowar could not claim religious or racial identity with the Vikings when the band had a lead singer with the [...] "'less than wholly Scandinavian name of Joey di Maio', [...] are approaching a more complex and racially-charged issue than their offhandedness would suggest." [...] While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad {{the definition of a}} [...] "true" [...] Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: [...] "Some people understand perfectly that it doesn't <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> live, what's really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood." [...] Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of Christian Viking metal, but is rarely criticized as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{positive}} reviews by music critics. During a review of Saxobeats, Celeste Rhoads from AllMusic saw [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] as a club sensation along with [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] (2009) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Rodrigo of Yam Magazine wrote, [...] "One day, I heard Mr. Saxobeat by accident and I was instantly hooked. Thanks to its insanely catchy saxophone riffs and Stan's voice, Mr. Saxobeat is a very fun, upbeat song that you can smile and dance to no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are. Plus, the song works like a charm for parties." [...] McCall of The Star-Ledger associated the song with {{the revival of the}} saxophone in music. The Hollywood Reporter Shirley Halperin listed the saxophone sequences in [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] in her list of [...] "12 Awesome Sax Solos". Johnston, writing for Village Voice, said [...] "the way they're employed" [...] sounded like Pitbull's [...] "I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)" [...] (2009).

500|$|The heavy metal-inspired {{world of}} Brütal Legend was also well received, and {{considered}} {{to show a}} clear reverence for the genre. [...] Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be [...] "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" [...] and [...] "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements {{that made up the}} heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being [...] "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" [...] at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game {{may not be the most}} sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that [...] "no <b>matter</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at", while Donlan considered the world to be a [...] "constant unfolding delight". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's [...] "Through the Fire and Flames" [...] would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have [...] "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of [...] "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation." ...|$|E
