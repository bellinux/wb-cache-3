A number of such allelochemicals are commercially available or in the process of large-scale manufacture.

Although it was found to be too weak as a commercial herbicide, a chemical analog of it, <b>mesotrione</b> (tradename Callisto), was found to be effective. It is sold to control broadleaf weeds in corn but also seems to be an effective control for crabgrass in lawns.

50|$|Pyrazolate, pyrazoxyfen and benzofenap {{were first}} commercialized in the Japanese rice market {{starting}} in 1980, but became less important when sulfonylurea herbicides were introduced.

50|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} modern agrochemicals {{are much more}} complex than in older products, but lower than of their pharma counterparts. The average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330, as compared with 477 for the top 10. In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. sodium azide, halogens, methyl sulfide, phosgene, phosphorus chlorides, are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals. With exception of the pyrethroids, which are photostable modifications of naturally occurring pyrethrums, active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely are chiral. Examples within herbicides are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s round-up (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type <b>mesotrione</b> and paraquat dichloride. Within insecticides, the traditional organophosphates, like malathion, and pyrethroids such as γ-cyhalotrin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids, like Bayer’s imidacloprid and Syngenta’s thiamethoxam and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s fipronil. Chloranthaniliprole {{is the most important}} representative of Du Pont’s award-winning anthranilic diamide family of broad spectrum insecticides. Within fungicides, the strobilurins, a new class, are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10 billion global fungicide market. Syngenta’s azoxystrobin was the first product launched. Also BASF’s F-500 Series, a.o. pyraclostrobin and kresoxim-methyl, Bayer CropScience, and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this class.

40|$|The {{heavy use}} of {{pesticides}} in agriculture, have encouraged researchers to evaluate their behavior and potential environmental impacts of newer herbicides when applied alone or {{in combination with other}} herbicides. <b>Mesotrione</b> (2 -[4 -(methysulfonyl) - 2 -nitrobenzoyl]- 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione), a pre- and post-emergence herbicide is one of these newer herbicides used to control broadleaf weeds in corn. Assessing the soil behavior of newer herbicides is important to understand the potential impacts on key ecological processes. The primary objectives of this research were to: 1) determine the optimal conditions to extract <b>mesotrione</b> from four soils with varying physical and chemical characteristics using Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE); 2) study the effect of atrazine on <b>mesotrione</b> degradation in soil; and 3) determine if <b>mesotrione,</b> <b>mesotrione</b> + atrazine treatments, and application rates had an impact on soil microbial activity (respiration). In the first experiment, <b>mesotrione</b> recoveries were not significantly different between two tested solvents across the four soils. The 4 : 1, acetonitrile: 5 % acetic acid solvent was selected as the extraction solvent for all subsequent tests. When the three static cycles (1, 2, and 3) were evaluated, <b>mesotrione</b> recoveries were not significantly different between the three static cycles across the four soils. The two static cycles was selected as optimal, resulting in higher recoveries for the four soils. The investigation of extraction temperatures (50 ?C, 100 ?C, and 150 ?C) resulted in no significant differences between temperatures of 50 ?C and 100 ?C, and the temperature of 50 ?C was selected since higher recoveries obtained with that temperature. In the second experiment, the results demonstrated that <b>mesotrione</b> + atrazine herbicide mixtures have the potential to decrease <b>mesotrione</b> degradation in soils. However, it remained unclear whether the reduced degradation was due to the combined impacts of the herbicides, varying soil characteristics, and/or the soil microbial populations present in each soil. The third experiment resulted in the <b>mesotrione</b> and <b>mesotrione</b> + atrazine treatments that inhibited microbial activity (respiration) only at certain incubation time periods and rates for some soils. Furthermore, the <b>mesotrione</b> treatment was found to also stimulate microbial respiration at the 10 X rate in the Orelia soil.

DilleThis {{dissertation}} has two complementary components: educational, in {{a survey}} of students in Weed Science and their perception of the Kansas State University Agronomy Learning farm, and research, regarding interactions between <b>mesotrione</b> and sulfonylurea herbicides. The Learning Farm serves as a resource where undergraduate students at KSU can develop agronomic skills through hands-on field site experiences and investigations. Students’ perceptions of experiential learning activities in the development of problem-solving and critical thinking skills were studied {{as a result of the}} Learning Farm. Activities included: undergraduate students in Weed Science (AGRON 330) developing a weed management recommendation, and Undergraduate Research Assistants (URAs) conducting weed science research projects at the Learning Farm. Students stated that experiential learning activities increased their critical thinking skills, required effective time management, and presented concepts that could be used in other situations. Pre- and post-project evaluation questionnaires showed that URAs had an increased interest in agronomy, weed science, and research following the completion of their project. For the research project, field and greenhouse studies were conducted from 2003 to 2006 to evaluate the efficacy of various sulfonylurea herbicides when applied with <b>mesotrione</b> or <b>mesotrione</b> + atrazine. Research demonstrated that the addition of <b>mesotrione</b> to sulfonylurea herbicides decreased efficacy of sulfonylurea herbicides on green foxtail, yellow foxtail, and shattercane.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Perennial {{ryegrass}} (Lolium perenne L.) is {{a widely}} grown cool season, bunch type, short lived perennial grass that is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but has been adapted globally. Perennial ryegrass is quick to establish, has a long growing season, and produces high seed yield and forage or turf quality (high density, fine leaves, and dark green color). <b>Mesotrione</b> is a selective 4 -hydroxyphyenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibiting herbicide used for weed control in perennial ryegrass seed production and turfgrass in the USA. HPPD inhibiting herbicides cause a reduction in carotenoids which protect chlorophyll from high energy light. The photodegradation of chlorophyll results in a bleaching of leaf tissue in susceptible plants. In seed production, <b>mesotrione,</b> commercialized in the USA as Callisto®, is applied postemergence in the spring to fall planted perennial ryegrass seed crops. <b>Mesotrione</b> for use in turfgrass, commercialized in the USA as Tenacity®, is applied pre or postemergence. The effects of a postemergence application of <b>mesotrione</b> on chlorophyll concentration, dry biomass, plant height, and seed yield and germination compared to an application of another HPPD inhibitor, pyrasulfotole-bromoxynil, on perennial ryegrass cultivars were evaluated. There were differences in perennial ryegrass cultivar response to a postemergence application of both HPPD inhibitors in chlorophyll concentration and to a postemergence application of pyrasulfotole-bromoxynil in dry biomass. No reduction in plant height {{was caused by the}} HPPD inhibitors. Seed yield of the perennial ryegrass cultivars was not negatively impacted by a postemergence application of <b>mesotrione.</b> However, only twelve perennial ryegrass cultivars were evaluated in this study; therefore, caution may be warranted when using <b>mesotrione</b> with other perennial ryegrass cultivars. The effects of <b>mesotrione</b> applied postemergence on perennial ryegrass cultivars at three different temperatures, 5, 25, and 35 °C, on chlorophyll concentration, leaf color, and total chlorophyll were investigated. At each temperature, there was a response within some cultivars. The cultivar ‘Derby Xtreme’ exhibited the most sensitivity to <b>mesotrione</b> at 5 °C and ‘SR 4660 ST’ was the most sensitive at 35 C. The cultivar ‘PR 8821 ’ was the most sensitive overall at all evaluation timings and temperatures. The cultivar exhibiting the most tolerance to <b>mesotrione</b> was ‘Esquire’. Assessing perennial ryegrass cultivar response to <b>mesotrione</b> at one temperature versus another temperature resulted in ‘Allstar 3 ’ exhibiting less sensitivity at 35 than at 5 or 25 °C. The majority of cultivars exhibited more sensitivity at 25 than at either 5 or 35 °C. Turfgrass managers should use caution when applying <b>mesotrione</b> postemergence to some perennial ryegrass cultivars if temporary bleaching of the turf is undesirable...|$|E
40|$|International audienceToxicity of {{pesticides}} towards microorganisms {{can have a}} major impact on ecosystem function. Nevertheless, some microorganisms are able to respond quickly to this stress by degrading these molecules. The edaphic Bacillus megaterium strain Mes 11 can degrade the herbicide <b>mesotrione.</b> In order to gain insight into the cellular response involved, the intracellular proteome of Mes 11 exposed to <b>mesotrione</b> was analyzed using the two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) approach coupled with mass spectrometry. The results showed an average of 1820 protein spots being detected. The gel profile analyses revealed 32 protein spots whose abundance is modified after treatment with <b>mesotrione.</b> Twenty spots could be identified, leading to 17 non redundant proteins, mainly involved in stress, metabolic and storage mechanisms. These findings clarify the pathways used by B. megaterium strain Mes 11 to resist and adapt to the presence of <b>mesotrione...</b>|$|E
40|$|Amaranthus tuberculatus is a {{troublesome}} weed in {{corn and}} soybean production systems in Midwestern USA, {{due in part}} to its ability to evolve multiple resistance to key herbicides including 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Here we have investigated the mechanism of resistance to <b>mesotrione,</b> an important chemical for managing broadleaf weeds in corn, in a multiple herbicide resistant population (NEB) from Nebraska. NEB showed a 2. 4 -fold and 45 -fold resistance increase to <b>mesotrione</b> compared to a standard sensitive population (SEN) in pre-emergence and post-emergence dose-response pot tests, respectively. Sequencing of the whole HPPD gene from 12 each of sensitive and resistant plants did not detect any target-site mutations that could be associated with post-emergence resistance to <b>mesotrione</b> in NEB. Resistance was not due to HPPD gene duplication or over-expression before or after herbicide treatment, as revealed by qPCR. Additionally, no difference in <b>mesotrione</b> uptake was detected between NEB and SEN. In contrast, higher levels of <b>mesotrione</b> metabolism via 4 -hydroxylation of the dione ring were observed in NEB compared to the sensitive population. Overall, the NEB population was characterised by lower levels of parent <b>mesotrione</b> exported {{to other parts of the}} plant, either as a consequence of metabolism in the treated leaves and/or impaired translocation of the herbicide. This study demonstrates another case of non-target-site based resistance to an important class of herbicides in an A. tuberculatus population. The knowledge generated here will help design strategies for managing multiple herbicide resistance in this problematic weed species...|$|E
40|$|The {{photocatalytic}} {{elimination of}} the herbicide <b>mesotrione</b> from the commercial formulation Callisto® in environmental and synthetic waters by means of heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes was investigated. The activities of the commercial photocatalyst TiO 2 Degussa P 25 (TiO 2) and ZnO in the degradation of <b>mesotrione</b> under UVA and simulated sunlight in doubly distilled, ground and in river water was compared. Environmental waters as the matrix significantly lowered the removal rate (by about 4 and 1. 5 times for TiO 2 and ZnO, respectively) under UVA irradiation. Besides, the organic additives from Callisto® also reduced the degradation rate of <b>mesotrione.</b> The effects of inorganic anions (Cl-, SO 4 2 - and HCO 3 -) and humic acid (HA), which were identified as major species in ground and river water, was evaluated. It was found that Cl−(pH ≈ 4 and ≈ 8) and HCO 3 - (pH ≈ 8) using TiO 2 mainly accelerated the degradation rate of <b>mesotrione,</b> while SO 4 2 - had the opposite effect at pH ≈ 4 and {{did not affect the}} degradation rate at pH ≈ 8. Furthermore, HA mainly did not significantly affect the degradation rate of <b>mesotrione</b> at pH ≈ 4 and ≈ 8. Moreover, almost all anions, and HA slightly inhibited the degradation rate of <b>mesotrione</b> in synthetic water using ZnO.

Physiological and Molecular Characterization of Hydroxyphenylpyruvate Dioxygenase (HPPD) -inhibitor Resistance in Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.). Frontiers in Plant Science, 8, 12. doi: 10. 3389 /fpls. 2017. 00555 Herbicides that inhibit hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) such as <b>mesotrione</b> {{are widely}} used to control a broad {{spectrum}} of weeds in agriculture. Amaranthus palmeri is an economically troublesome weed throughout the United States. The first case of evolution of resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides in A. palmeri was documented in Kansas (KS) and later in Nebraska (NE). The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechansim of HPPD-inhibitor (<b>mesotrione)</b> resistance in A. palmeri. Dose response analysis revealed that this population (KSR) was 10 - 18 times more resistant than their sensitive counterparts (MSS or KSS). Absorbtion and translocation analysis of [C- 14] <b>mesotrione</b> suggested that these mechanisms were not involved in the resistance in A. palmeri. Importantly, <b>mesotrione</b> (> 90 %) was detoxified markedly faster in the resistant populations (KSR and NER), within 24 hours after treatment (HAT) compared to sensitive plants (MSS, KSS, or NER). However, at 48 HAT all populations metabolized the <b>mesotrione,</b> suggesting additional factors may contribute to this resistance. Further evaluation of mesotrione-resistant A. palmeri did not reveal any specific resistance-conferring mutations nor amplification of HPPD gene, the molecular target of <b>mesotrione.</b> However, the resistant populations showed 4 - to 12 -fold increase in HPPD gene expression. This increase in HPPD transcript levels was accompanied by increased HPPD protein expression. The significant aspects of this research include: the <b>mesotrione</b> resistance in A. palmeri is conferred primarily by rapid detoxification (non-target-site based) of mesotrione; additionally, increased HPPD gene expression (target-site based) also contributes to the resistance mechanism in the evolution of herbicide resistance in this naturally occurring weed species...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe fate of ionisable {{pesticides}} in {{the environment}} is complex as it is importantly related to many soil properties: pH, mineralogy, organic matter content and other soil characteristics. The adsorption of a weak acid herbicide, <b>mesotrione,</b> was studied in detail on whole and peroxide-treated vertisol topsoil and also on its granulometric fractions (clay, silt, sand) to evaluate the role of mineralogy and different organic matter pools. The soil studied is alkaline silty loam with smectite as the main clay mineral. It contains 1. 7 % organic carbon, mostly stabilized as a complex with smectite. Humus is of fulvic type. <b>Mesotrione</b> adsorption occurs on both mineral and organic constituents. Adsorption is weak and <b>mesotrione</b> can be easily and totally desorbed. As shown with 13 C NMR experiments, adsorption best correlates with the alkyl and carboxylic carbon content, and occurs on both bound and free organic matter.
