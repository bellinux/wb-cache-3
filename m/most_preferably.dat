The role {{of parents and}} communities in obesity prevention By Rebecca Surles, Leah Whigham and Sherry Tanumihardjo Background: Overweight children face serious medical issues as well as emotional and social problems. Both families and communities have key roles in the prevention and treatment of childhood overweight. Increasing physical activity and encouraging healthy eating habits go handinhand to help improve children’s fitness and health. Experts recommend that we begin to teach these healthy behaviors early in a child’s life. Parental involvement: Parents {{are the most important}} role models for children.

The present aim was to establish what the working places of specializing and specialized physicians in general practice are, and where they assume they will work in the future. Methods The study population comprised 5, 357 physicians licensed in Finland during the years 1977 – 1996. Altogether 2, 956 questionnaires were returned, a response rate of 55. 2 %. Those either specializing (GP trainees, n= 133) or already having specialized (GPs, n= 426) in general practice were included in the study. Respondents were asked what kind of physician’s work they would <b>most</b> <b>preferably</b> do. They were further asked what work they assumed they would be doing in the year 2020. Results Altogether 72 % were working in public primary health centres and 14 % in the private sector. Of GPs 53 % and of GP trainees 70 % would <b>most</b> <b>preferably</b> work in health centres. Of GPs 14 % would <b>most</b> <b>preferably</b> work as private practitioners and 9 % as occupational health physicians. Sixteen per cent assumed they would be working as private practitioners and 35 % assumed they would be retired in the year 2020. Of GP trainees 57 % assumed they would be working as health centre physicians in 2020.

30|$|We {{conclude}} that even for low penetration rates, series {{vehicles equipped with}} VANET technology according to current standardization have to handle several hundreds of messages per second under challenging conditions. Considering the usual restrictions for automotive hardware and software regarding robustness, size, and cost, {{there are two ways}} to deal with this challenge, with the option to combine both of them. First, the hardware capabilities are dimensioned sufficiently high which in turn leads to higher costs and potentially larger size. Second, the CAM processing chain is designed sufficiently smart.

40|$|Multiple {{risk factor}} {{intervention}} is essential inorder to prevent cardiovascular (CV) disease inpatients with diabetes. Therefore, to reduce atherothrombotic events, an ideal oral anti-diabetic agent {{should be able}} to modulate <b>most,</b> and <b>preferably</b> all, car-diovascular risk factors associated with diabetes. Of the currently available agents, the insulin sensitis-ers (metformin, thiazolidinediones) seem to have most promise in cardiovascular protection. Metformin has a positive effect on several CV risk factors; outcome stud-ies have shown that this agent reduces cardiac events in overweight subjects with diabetes. In a similar manner, thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone) have a wide spectrum of activity, favourably modulating most risk factors, with evidence to suggest a reduction in CV events with this class of drugs. Agents in the sulphonyl-urea group have beneficial, though inconsistent, effects on some risk factors but outcome studies have failed to show a cardioprotective role for these agents. New classes of drugs to manage type 2 diabetes are currently at various stages of development and their role in prevention of cardiovascular disease awaits evaluation. At present, first-line management of insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes should utilise metformin, with the addition of thiazolidinediones and sulphonylureas to achieve opti-mal glycaemic control...|$|R

Delta B compared bar widths to space width to code bits. This was extremely sensitive to ink spread where too much ink or pressure would cause both edges of a bar to spread outward and too little to cause them to shrink. To make it worse as bars spread spaces shrink and vice versa. Delta C achieved its higher performance by only using leading to leading or trailing to trailing edges which was unaffected by uniform ink spread. The code provided best performance when it had a defined character set with a fixed reference distance that spanned <b>most</b> or <b>preferably</b> all the character. In August, 1971, Crouse joined the scanner effort. After several months they had made no progress. They {{were aware of the}} RCA bull’s eye label that could be scanned with a simple straight line laser scanner, but a readable label was far too large. Although Litton Industries proposed a bull’s eye symbol cut in half to reduce the area, it was still too large and presented the same ink smear printing problems as the RCA symbol. The redundancy and checking ability were removed completely. They were also aware of the many proposals from around the world, none of which were feasible.|$|R

In addition, boreal forests constitute a large carbon store; it has been estimated that, were no burning to occur, an additional 7 gigatons of carbon would be sequestered in boreal soils each century. Effective wildfire suppression requires anticipation of locales and times for which wildfire is <b>most</b> probable, <b>preferably</b> with a two to four week forecast, so that limited resources can be efficiently deployed. The United States Forest Service (USFS), and other experts and agencies have developed several measures of fire risk combining physical principles and expert judgment, and have used them in automated procedures for forecasting fire risk. Forecasting accuracies for some fire risk indices in combination with climate and other variables have been estimated for specific locations, with the value of fire risk index variables assessed by their statistical significance in regressions. In other cases, the MAPSS forecasts [23, 241 for example, forecasting accuracy has been estimated only by simulated data. We describe alternative forecasting methods that predict fire probability by locale and time using statistical or machine learning procedures trained on historical data, and we give comparative assessments of their forecasting accuracy for one fire season year, April- October, 2003, for all U.
