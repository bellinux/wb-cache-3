40|$|<b>Medical</b> <b>device</b> <b>implants</b> {{are drawing}} {{increasing}} amounts of interest from modern medical practitioners. However, this attention is not evenly spread across all such devices; most of these implantable devices can cause adverse reactions such as inflammation, fibrosis, thrombosis, and infection. In this work, the biocompatibility of silicone rubber (SR) was improved through carbon (C) ion implantation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed that these newly generated carbon-implanted silicone rubbers (C-SRs) had large, irregular peaks and deep valleys on their surfaces. The water contact angle of the SR surface decreased significantly after C ion implantation. C ion implantation also changed the surface charge distribution, silicone oxygen rate, and chemical-element distribution of SR to favor cell attachment. The dermal fibroblasts cultured on the surface C-SR grew faster and showed more typical fibroblastic shapes. The expression levels of major adhesion proteins, including talin- 1, zyxin, and vinculin, were significantly higher in dermal fibroblasts cultured on C-SR coated plates than in dermal fibroblasts cultured on SR. Those same dermal fibroblasts on C-SRs showed more pronounced adhesion and migration abilities. Osteopontin (OPN), a critical extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, was up-regulated and secreted from dermal fibroblasts cultured on C-SR. Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) activity was also increased. These cells were highly mobile {{and were able to}} adhere to surfaces, but these abilities were inhibited by the monoclonal antibody against OPN, or by shRNA-mediated MMP- 9 knockdown. Together, these results suggest that C ion implantation significantly improves SR biocompatibility, and that OPN is important to promote cell adhesion to the C-SR surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Conductive diamond has {{exceptional}} chemical stability, {{making it}} an appealing candidate material for long-term <b>medical</b> <b>device</b> <b>implants.</b> This work describes the characterization, and fabrication of four diamond-based neural devices. A previously developed 30 µm diamond-disk in vitro needle electrode was characterized. The device could detect 1 nM concentration analytes in a flow cell using fast scan cyclic voltammetry, but the fabrication was not reproducible. A novel in vitro diamond device was developed with diamond selectively grown {{at the tip of}} a hollow quartz capillary, resulting in a 2 - 4 µm tip diameter. The diamond tip shape and size were geometrically reproducible, although an electrical connection to these tips is still needed. Two novel in vivo diamond based devices were also fabricated. The first generation in vivo diamond electrode was assembled by attaching a brittle diamond electrode to a flexible insulated substrate. The device fabrication time was 6 hrs of hands-on activity, but it was successfully implanted in a freely behaving Aplysia californica. Electrical recordings were compared to a stainless steel standard for two surgeries, respectively 8 days post surgery and 12 days post surgery. However, external electrical connections to equipment had sufficiently large noise and signal variability. No definitive conclusions could be reached about differences in recordings by diamond and steel. A second generation in vivo diamond electrode was fabricated on a substrate that remained flexible after diamond growth, also reducing the fabrication time by 4 hrs. Substrates typically become embrittled during diamond growth because of surface carbide formation. Two rhenium alloys, 75 % tungsten / 25 % rhenium (v/v) and 47. 5 % molybdenum / 52. 5 % rhenium (v/v), were investigated as flexible substrates that might not form carbides during diamond growth but adhere strongly to diamond. Three growth times were explored, with the rhenium alloys compared to a traditional tungsten substrate. Diamond grown for 20 hours on 47. 5 % molybdenum / 52. 5 % rhenium alloy had the highest diamond quality (crystal size, sp 3 content, and good electrochemical activity), with the substrate remaining flexible after the diamond growth. This device has not yet been insulated with a biocompatible material; however, in vitro recordings were obtained with Aplysia...|$|E

Any design of BAN further has to ensure: i) {{the safety of the}} human body, i. e. limiting any undesirable side-effects (e. g. heat dissipation) of BAN operations (involving sensing, computation, and communication among the devices) on the human body; and ii) the sustainability of the BAN operations, i. e. the continuation of the operations under constrained resources (e. g. limited battery power in the devices) without requiring any re-deployments.

Multiple research groups have demonstrated that micro and nanoscale topographies significantly reduce bacterial biofouling, for both individual cells and bacterial biofilms.
