40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results obtained from laundry wastewater treatment using conventional methods namely precipitation/coagulation and the flocculation process with adsorption on granular-activated carbon (GAC) and an alternative method, <b>membrane</b> <b>filtrations,</b> namely ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Chemical analyses showed that parameter values of untreated wastewater like temperature, pH, sediment substances, total nitrogen and phosphorous, COD, BOD 5, {{and the amount of}} anion surfactants had been exceeded in regard to Slovenian regulation. These regulations can be used as requirements for wastewater reuse and make treated wastewater an available source for the existing water supply. The study of conventional treatment was based on a flocculation with Al 2 (SO 4) 3 18 H 2 O and adsorption on GAC. <b>Membrane</b> <b>filtrations</b> were studied on a pilot wastewater treatment plant: ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis (RO) units. The membranes used in this experiment were ceramic UF membrane and spiral wounded - polyethersulfone- RO membranes. The quality of the wastewater was improved by both methods and the specifications of a concentration limit for emission into water were confirmed. The disadvantage of GAC {{is that there is no}} possibility of any kind of selection, which is essential for recycling and re-use, while permeate coming from RO met the required regulation as well as requirements for reusing in washing process. However, the economical analyses showed that the <b>membrane</b> <b>filtrations</b> are more expensive compared to the GAC treatment process...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> is {{the method}} of choice for the {{analysis}} of fecal coliforms in water. [...] Samples to be tested are passed through a filter of particular pore size (generally 0.45 micrometre). [...] The microorganisms present in the water remain on the filter surface. [...] The filter is placed in a sterile petri dish with a selective medium, growth of the desired organisms is encouraged, while other non--target organisms is suppressed. [...] Each cell develops into a separate colony, which can be counted directly, and the initial inoculum size can be determined. [...] Typically sample volumes of 100 ml will be used for water testing and filtered, with the goal of achieving a final desirable colony density range of 20 to 60 colonies per filter. [...] Contaminated sources may require dilution to achieve a [...] "countable" [...] membrane. The filter is placed on a petri dish containing M-FC agar and incubated for 24 hours at 44.5 °C (112.1 degrees F). [...] This elevated temperature heat shocks non-fecal bacteria and suppresses their growth. [...] As the fecal coliform colonies grow they produce an acid (through fermenting lactose) that reacts with the aniline dye in the agar thus giving the colonies their blue color.|$|E
50|$|The second method, <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration,</b> {{typically}} {{a combination of}} microfiltration and ultrafiltration, uses molecular size {{as the basis for}} separating components from the whey stream. In the process, pressure is applied across a membrane surface which forces smaller molecules through the membrane while larger molecules are retained. Both methods yield a very high protein to non-protein product ratio, although <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> is somewhat less selective allowing any molecule within a size range to be retained. One compositional difference between whey protein isolates made from cheese whey via <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> compared to ion exchange is that <b>membrane</b> <b>filtration</b> includes significant levels of the casein fragment caseino-glycomacropeptide (cGMP).

Prior to <b>membrane</b> <b>filtrations,</b> an antifouling polymer based on poly(ethylene glycol), poly(TMSMA-r-PEGMA) was synthesized and applied on silicon-based surfaces like silicon, silicon nitride, and glass.

In BSA and skimmed milk filtrations no differences could be seen between unmodified and PEG-coated membranes (decreasing permeability in time).

40|$|Abstract—With the use {{of silicon}} micromachining, an {{inorganic}} membrane sieve for microfiltration has been constructed having a silicon nitride membrane layer with thickness typically 1 m and perforations typically between 0. 5 m and 10 m in diameter. As a support a h 100 i-silicon wafer with openings of 1000 m in diameter has been used. The thin silicon nitride layer is deposited on an initially dense support {{by means of a}} suitable chemical vapor deposition method (LPCVD). Perforations in the membrane layer are obtained with use of standard photo lithography and reactive ion etching (RIE). The deflection and maximum load of the membrane sieves are calculated in a first approximation. Experiments to measure the maximum load of silicon-rich silicon nitride membranes have confirmed this approximation.

40|$|International audienceEnrichment of {{cranberry}} juice in anthocyanins by electrodialysis with <b>filtration</b> <b>membrane</b> (EDFM) was investigated. Six <b>filtration</b> <b>membranes</b> (FM) with distinct constitutive materials and cut-offs were tested. The higher enrichment yields in anthocyanins (24 %) without any significant depletion of polyphenols from the raw juice were obtained with 2 filtration membranes: (1) polyvinyldiene fluoride (PVDF) with a cut-off of 150 kDa and (2) polyethersulfone (PES) with a cut-off of 500 kDa. EDFM treatment performed during 90 min {{did not affect}} the pH and conductivity values of the treated juices. The constant degree Brix obtained after EDFM treatment confirmed that this technology can selectively migrate anthocyanins without affecting the sugar concentration in the juice. Furthermore, the decrease in titrable acidity of the enriched juice improved its organoleptic characteristics. It was also demonstrated that the enrichment in anthocyanins was influenced by the FM zeta potential (ZP). Indeed, for <b>filtration</b> <b>membranes</b> presenting positive surface charge (ZP close to 2 - 3 mV), repulsions would be established with anthocyanins positively charged and would avoid their electro-migration through the membrane. On the opposite, <b>filtration</b> <b>membranes</b> with moderate negative charges (ZP close to − 5 mV) seem to facilitate the electro-transfer of anthocyanins due to the attraction between opposite charges...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} a microfiltration filter for separation of biological microparticles from body fluids, including peripheral blood. The model used a single membrane filter with a homogeneous 2 D transmission structure. In the model, the individual sieve with a uniform transmission structure in 2 D space was applied. Because of the required survival of biological particles, the presented model was limited to the narrow filtration conditions that guarantee biological activity of these particles. In this model, the filtration process proceeds in the gravitational field without the involvement of external forces forcing or inhibiting the filtration process. Based on this model there were given basic dependencies describing the required filtration process conditions, such as filtration time and internal forces for particle migration in the filtered body fluid. The basic relationships between the height of the filtered column, duration of the process, and average fluid expenditure of the filtration process for different shapes of the channels molecular drainage lines filter have been determined. Based on this data, the directions of further works on improving the presented model of molecular filtration of biological particles for enriching selected biological fractions have been described.
