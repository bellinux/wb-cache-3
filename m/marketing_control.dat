50|$|Innovations: Unlike similar {{retailer}} of the day, {{there were}} no leased departments {{in any of the}} Caldor stores, allowing managers the flexibility to rearrange a floor plan to suit the season or sales patterns. This allowed more space for outdoor goods during the summer and a larger toy department during the holidays. Caldor’s early and successful adoption of computerization of inventory, cost and <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> made it a model in the retail field. “Buyers, every Monday morning, have on their desks reports on the merchandise that was sold in their departments as of the previous Saturday night,” reported Bennett. Indicative of the interest created by Caldor’s computer programs was a visit by a group of Australian retailers who traveled in the late 1960s to the company’s headquarters to observe their computer operations, which also handled the Caldor payroll.|$|E

During this stage, tracking sales growth becomes an important aspect. On the average, 10% batch and remote job entry, 60% are dedicated to data base and data communications processing, 5% personal computing, 25% minicomputer processing. Management control systems are used the most in Stage VI (40%). There are three aspects of management control; manufacturing, marketing and financial. Manufacturing control demands forecasting — looking down the road for future needs. <b>Marketing</b> <b>control</b> strictly deals with research. Financial control, forecasts cash requirements for the future. Stage VI exercises high control, by compiling {{all of the information}} from Stages I through V.

50|$|Ownership {{advantages}} are the firm's specific assets, international experience, {{and the ability}} to develop either low-cost or differentiated products within the contacts of its value chain. The locational advantages of a particular market are a combination of market potential and investment risk. Internationalization {{advantages are}} the benefits of retaining a core competence within the company and threading it though the value chain rather than to license, outsource, or sell it. In relation to the eclectic paradigm, companies that have low levels of ownership advantages either do not enter foreign markets. If the company and its products are equipped with ownership advantage and internalization advantage, they enter through low-risk modes such as exporting. Exporting requires significantly lower level of investment than other modes of international expansion, such as FDI. As you might expect, the lower risk of export typically results in a lower rate of return on sales than possible though other modes of international business. In other words, the usual return on export sales may not be tremendous, but neither is the risk. Exporting allows managers to exercise operation control but does not provide them the option to exercise as much <b>marketing</b> <b>control.</b> An exporter usually resides far from the end consumer and often enlists various intermediaries to manage marketing activities. After two straight months of contraction, exports from India rose a whopping 11.64% at $25.83 billion in July 2013 against $23.14 billion in the same month of the previous year.|$|E
40|$|Hybrid {{governance}} {{forms that}} seek to meld the virtues of both <b>market</b> <b>control</b> and traditional hierarchical control are alluring governance forms. While extensive research has examined such hybrids forms, the research has been restricted largely to external hybrids ⎯ market exchanges infused with elements of hierarchical control. Comparatively little research, outside of the M-form literature, has examined internal hybrids ⎯ hierarchical forms infused with elements of <b>market</b> <b>control.</b> This paper contends that common change initiatives, such as TQM, reengineering, autonomous work teams, and group-based rewards, are appropriately viewed as attempts to craft internal hybrids by selectively infusing elements of <b>market</b> <b>control</b> within hierarchy. However, these common change initiatives are implemented typically in isolation and, as a consequence, violate patterns of complementarity that both sustain traditional hierarchy or support the stable infusion of <b>market</b> <b>control.</b> Managers overlay new measures on existing, functionallyoriented structures; they implement new structures without new performance measures and without new pay systems; they implement new pay systems, but fail to restructure or develop new performance measures. The paper argues that these violations of complementarity often unravel the bundle of elements that support traditional hierarchy and spiral hierarchies toward fundamental transformation. The clear trajectory of these transformations is toward quite radically, disaggregated organizations structured around teams. The paper presents both logic and evidence supporting the presence of complementarities in common change initiatives...|$|R

This article focuses on the largely neglected question of how firms organize their marketing activities across countries. With our empirical study which differentiates between marketing planning, marketing implementation and <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> we contribute to international configuration and coordination literature. Our findings indicate that firms show a preference for centralising their marketing planning and <b>marketing</b> <b>control</b> activities, whereas the implementation of their marketing activities is more decentralised. For the coordination of marketing activities, in management practice, direct personal supervision and informal communication are the preferred coordination mechanisms. However, we not only describe existing configuration-coordination profiles, but also identify effective, efficient and resource-supportive patterns. Our results show that marketing activities are best coordinated by applying superior levels of direct personal supervision and output coordination plus the superior use of socialisation and networks...|$|E
