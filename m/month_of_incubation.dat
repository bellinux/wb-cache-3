Phosphorus (P) sorption by these components can decrease environmental {{problems associated with}} excess accumulation of P in soils. The long-term stability of P sorbed by Fe/Al hydroxides is of major concern. Synthetic Fe and Al hydroxides coprecipitated with P (1 : 1 metal:P molar ratio) were incubated at 70 ◦C for 24 months to simulate natural long-term weathering processes that could influence the stability of sorbed P. Heat incubation (70 ◦C) of the untreated (no P) Al hydroxides resulted in drastic decreases (within the first <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation)</b> in oxalate–Al extractability, specific surface area (SSA), and micropore volume with time. These changes {{were consistent with the}} formation of pseudoboehmite. Untreated Fe hydroxides showed no formation of crystalline components following heating (70 ◦C) for 24 months. Much smaller changes in oxalate-Al, P extractability, and SSA values were observed in the P-treated Al particles when compared with the untreated. Phosphorus treatment of both Fe and Al hydroxides stabilized the particle surfaces and prevented structural arrangements toward a long-range ordered phase. Slight reduction in SSA of the P-treated particles was related to dehydration phenomena during heating at 70 ◦C. Monitoring of physicochemical properties of the solids after heating at 70 ◦C for 2 years showed that sorbed P may be stable in the long-term.

40|$|Kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) occurs {{naturally}} {{in the warm}} temperate forest of northern New Zealand where it grows mixed with angiosperm tree species. Below mature kauri trees thick organic layers develop in which large amounts of nitrogen are accumulated. This nitrogen seems to be inaccessible to plants. While litter quality can explain the low decomposition rate below kauri, {{it is not known}} what causes the accumulation of nitrogen. We hypothesised that kauri tannins reduce nitrogen mineralisation and litter decomposition below kauri. We further hypothesised that high tannin concentrations in the soil would increase the availability of dissolved organic nitrogen relative to the availability of inorganic nitrogen. To test these hypotheses a laboratory incubation was carried out for 1 year. Purified tannins of kauri and of two other common New Zealand tree species were added to samples of the soil organic layer from under a kauri tree. The results suggest that during the first <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> the added tannins reduced nitrogen availability by sequestering proteins or by stimulating nitrogen immobilisation. In the long-term, the reduced nitrogen release, which was found following tannin addition, seems attributable to the complexation of proteins by tannins.

We conclude that the effect of kauri tannins on nitrogen release offers a good explanation for the accumulation of nitrogen below kauri trees...|$|E

To test this hypothesis, we investigated {{the effect of}} an acute temperature rise on energy metabolism of the oyster, Crassostrea gigas chronically exposed to elevated CO 2 levels (partial pressure of CO 2 in the seawater ~ 0. 15 kPa, seawater pH ~ 7. 7). Within one <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> at elevated PCO 2 and 15 °C hemolymph pH fell (pHe = 7. 1 ± 0. 2 (CO 2 -group) vs. 7. 6 ± 0. 1 (control)) and PeCO 2 values in hemolymph increased (0. 5 ± 0. 2 kPa (CO 2 -group) vs. 0. 2 ± 0. 04 kPa (control)). Slightly but significantly elevated bicarbonate concentrations in the hemolymph of CO 2 -incubated oysters ([HCO- 3]e = 1. 8 ± 0. 3 mM (CO 2 -group) vs. 1. 3 ± 0. 1 mM (control)) indicate only minimal regulation of extracellular acid-base status.

Results: The friable calli with yellow-green color only appeared from leaf explants on three different treatments including: 1 : 2. 5 (mg/L 2, 4 -D); 2 : 2 (mg/L  2, 4 -D); 3 : [2 (mg/L) 2, 4 -D+ 1 (mg/L Kin].   The best callus induction (75 %) was obtained at 2, 4 -D (2 mg/L) + Kin (1 mg/L) after 2 <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> under the photoperiod of 16 / 8 (light/dark). The highest callus growth rate (CGR) (0. 072 mm/day) and callus fresh weight (0. 135 g) were denoted {{to the treatment of}} 2 mg/L (2, 4 -D).   Conclusion: The benefits of the protocol described here include the possibility of its use throughout the callus culture for commercial production of suitable secondary metabolites of Zataria in rapid time and huge scale...|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation of 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(4 -chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) by biostimulation {{of native}} {{microbial}} populations in soil {{was investigated in}} a lab-scale and pilot scale under anaerobic conditions. To evaluate the role of molasses (co-substrate) and potassium nitrate (electron acceptor) in the reductive dechlorination of DDT, experiments were conducted in a microcosm using five treatments: (T 1) control, (T 2) natural attenuation, (T 3) molasses, (T 4) molasses + potassium nitrate and (T 5) potassium nitrate. Results showed that after 30 days of incubation, DDT concentration was reduced by 30. 3 % in the control, 32. 85 % for natural attenuation, 72. 3 % with addition of molasses, 92. 5 % for amendments with molasses + potassium nitrate, and 70. 2 % for biostimulation only with potassium nitrate. An upscaling of the microcosm to a larger fixed-bed reactor was conducted for treatment T 4. After one <b>month</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation,</b> DDT concentrations in the reactor decreased by 91. 54 % of the initial quantities. The DDT biodegradation rate fit a pseudo-first-order kinetic decay function and declined to 0. 077 d− 1, with half-life of 8. 9 days {{in the absence of}} oxygen. Predominant microbial strains were isolated and identified through biochemical and molecular tests before and after the bioremediation process. The microorganisms isolated were identified as Bacillus circulans and Bacillus megaterium before and after the treatment application, respectively. This study provides evidence that the combination of a donor electron substance (molasses) and acceptor electron (KNO 3) can enhance the DDT biodegradation rates under anaerobic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Effect of cold {{temperature}} on {{the length}} <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> <b>of</b> Chamaeleo chamaeleon Carmen Díaz-Paniagua Abstract. Common chameleon eggs spend the first <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> at low temperatures. I incubated eggs of different clutches at 25 ◦C in four treatments with respectively 0, 84, 119 and 149 days of initial cold period (at 14 ◦C). Treatments with longer cold periods had longer total incubation but shorter periods <b>of</b> <b>incubation</b> at 25 ◦C. Eggs which did not experience initial cold period showed low synchronization at hatching. Hatchling body mass and length were influenced by {{the length of the}} cold period. Hatchlings were largest and heaviest for cold periods of intermediate length which had similar duration than the cold period experienced by eggs in nature. These results suggest that the cold torpor period of Common chameleon embryos contributes to optimization of development and growth, and synchronizes hatching...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Deposition of dredged harbor sediments in {{relatively}} undisturbed ecosystems is often considered {{a viable option}} for confinement of pollutants and possible natural attenuation. This study investigated the effects of deposition of heavy-metal-polluted sludge on the microbial diversity of sandy sediments during 12 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> meso-cosm <b>incubation.</b> Geochemical analyses showed an initial increase in pore-water metal concentrations, which sub-sided after 3 <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation.</b> No influence <b>of</b> the deposited sediment was observed in {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) profiles of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes, whereas a minor, transient impact on the archaeal community was revealed. Phylogenetic analyses of bacte-rial 16 S rRNA clone libraries showed an abundance of members of the Flavobacteriaceae, the a- and c-Proteo-bacteria, in both the muddy and the sandy sediments. Despite the finding that some groups of clones were shared between the metal-impacted sandy sediment and the harbor control, comparative analyses showed that the two sedi-ments were significantly different in community composition. Consequences of redeposition of metal-polluted sediment were primarily underlined with cultiva-tion-dependent techniques. Toxicity tests showed that the percentage of Cd- and Cu-tolerant aerobic heterotrophs was highest among isolates from the sandy sediment with metal-polluted mud on top...|$|R
40|$|Black-foot is an {{important}} grapevine disease, caused by the fungus Cylindrocarpon destructans, which causes a darkening of the basal-end of the plant, leading to early decline and death of young grapevines. Both, C. destructans and C. obtusisporum are considered responsible for this disease, although only the former was isolated in Portugal. Neonectria radicicola (teleomorph of C. destructans) is an Ascomycota forming perithecia on host tissue, but such structures haven’t been observed yet {{in the country in}} grapevine. There is some uncertainty concerning the sexual behaviour of the fungus, some authors considering this as a homothallic species while other considered it as heterothallic. Attempting to obtain the teleomorph of C. destructans, a collection of 15 isolates was used, originated from different regions of the country. Crosses between isolates (120 pairs) were done in Petri dishes containing Carnation Leaf Agar (CLA), under Near-UV light (NUV) at 6 ºC. For some crosses, perithecia formation began after three <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation.</b> After five <b>months</b> <b>of</b> <b>incubation,</b> morphological and biometrical traits of perithecia, asci and ascospores were evaluated. The teleomorph was only obtained when crossing distinct isolates, suggesting a tendency for an heterothallic behaviour of the species. Four isolates can be pointed out as more fertile (Cy 68, Cy 36, Cy 76, Cy 111), with Cy 68 forming perithecia in 60 % of crossings involving it, while the remaining produced perithecia in 33 % of crosses. The identification of these isolates will allow enlarging the scope of the study to all C. destructans isolates under collection, aiming to confirm the sexual behaviour of this species...|$|R
