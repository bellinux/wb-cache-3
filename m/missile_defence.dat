5|$|This {{programme}} is one {{of three}} programmes that NATO is pursuing in the area of <b>missile</b> <b>defence.</b> The contract puts the Alliance on track for having, by 2010, a system to protect troops on missions against ballistic missiles. The contract is worth approximately 75 million EUR for work that would be conducted over a period of six years. The theatre <b>missile</b> <b>defence</b> would be a multi-layered system of systems, comprising early warning system sensors, radar and various interceptors. While NATO member countries would provide the sensors and weapon systems, NATO itself would develop a commonly funded NATO architecture to integrate all of these elements. The development of the ALTBMD system was agreed by NATO members in large part because it is limited. NATO members are deeply divided about the multi-tiered BMD architecture promoted by the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA).|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, NATO {{selected}} {{an international}} consortium led by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) {{to build an}} Integration Test Bed for the Alliance's future Active Layered Theatre <b>Missile</b> <b>Defence</b> (ALTBMD) capability. After two months of negotiations, ALTBMD Programme Manager, General (Ret) Billard, and SAIC contracting Officer, Mr. Robert Larrick, signed the contract {{on the first day}} of NATO's Riga Summit. This decision was based on an unpublished report agreed upon earlier by NATO ministers following a study into the feasibility of theatre missile defences.|$|E

25|$|Chevaline (pronounced: Shev-a-leen) was {{a system}} to improve the {{penetrability}} of the warheads used by the British Polaris nuclear weapons system. Devised as {{an answer to the}} improved Soviet anti-ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>defences</b> around Moscow, the system increased the probability that at least one warhead would penetrate Moscow's anti-ballistic <b>missile</b> (ABM) <b>defences,</b> something which the Royal Navy's earlier UGM-27 Polaris re-entry vehicles (RV)s were thought to be unlikely to do.|$|R

5|$|The 2006 Riga summit {{was held}} in Riga, Latvia, and {{highlighted}} the issue of energy security. It was the first NATO summit {{to be held in}} a country that {{had been part of the}} Soviet Union. At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a <b>missile</b> <b>defence</b> system. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Ballistic <b>Missile</b> <b>Defence</b> Programme is an {{initiative}} {{to develop and}} deploy a multi-layered ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>defence</b> system to protect India from ballistic missile attacks. It is a double-tiered system consisting of two interceptor missiles, namely the Prithvi Air Defence (PAD) missile for high altitude interception, and the Advanced Air Defence (AAD) Missile for lower altitude interception.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, as ACSAN, Panton {{oversaw the}} {{commencement}} of the Chevaline project - an effort to increase the ability of British Polaris nuclear missiles to penetrate Soviet <b>missile</b> <b>defences.</b> A key feature of Chevaline was its use of multiple decoy warheads and other penetration aids to overwhelm enemy missile-tracking radars, thus guaranteeing that some warheads would reach their targets. Panton was instrumental in obtaining political and financial support for the project, which entered service in 1975 and remained active through the 1980s.|$|R
