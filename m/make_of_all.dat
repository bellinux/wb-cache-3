[...] "What, do you take the savages of America for Jews?" [...] he asked, understanding the general drift of the missionary's meaning.|$|E
60|$|In {{the midst}} of my triumph I {{observed}} a little knot gathering together in {{the upper part of}} the room. By degrees it increased. A tittering broke out there; and glances were cast round at me, and then there would be fresh tittering. Some of the young ladies would hurry away to distant parts of the room, and whisper to their friends; wherever they went there was still this tittering and glancing at me. I did not know what to <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this. I looked at myself from head to foot; and peeped at my back in a glass, to see if any thing was odd about my person; any awkward exposure; any whimsical tag hanging out--no--every thing was right.

They tell us that [...] "the English people see with regret his Majesty's government squandering away the funds which had been granted to him."

At last he began thus: 'Hold, let's see,' says he, telling upon his fingers still, and first on his thumb; 'there's #246 in money at first, then two gold watches, diamond rings, and plate,' says he, upon the forefinger. Then upon the next finger, 'Here's a {{plantation}} on York River, #100 a year, then #150 in money, then a sloop load of horses, cows, hogs, and stores'; {{and so on}} to the thumb again. 'And now,' says he, 'a cargo cost #250 in England, and worth here twice the money.' 'Well,' says I, 'what do you <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> that?'

60|$|This {{frequently}} gave me {{occasion to}} observe, and that with wonder, that, however it had pleased God in his providence, {{and in the}} government of the works of his hands, to take from so great {{a part of the world}} of his creatures the best uses to which their faculties, and the powers of their souls, are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them the same powers, the same reason, the same affections, the same sentiments of kindness and obligation, the same passions and resentments of wrongs, the same sense of gratitude, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing good, and receiving good, that he has given to us; and that when he pleases to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay more ready, to apply them to the right uses for which they were bestowed, than we are. And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these, even though we have these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, added to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the life saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.|$|E

No; it was not the amount but the character of the art which caused me to take a seat on one of the blossomy stones and gaze up and down this fairy--like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration. One thing became more and more evident the longer I gazed: an artist, and one with a most scrupulous eye for form, had superintended all these arrangements. The greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand, and the pittoresque, in the true sense of the Italian term, on the other. There were few straight, and no long uninterrupted lines. The same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice, usually, but not oftener, at any one point of view. Everywhere was variety in uniformity. It was a piece of [...] "composition," [...] in which the most fastidiously critical taste could scarcely have suggested an emendation.|$|E
