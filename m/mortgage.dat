5|$|In a 16 December statement, three StabÃ¦k Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million.

5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from Â£2,000 to Â£1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to <b>mortgage</b> the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to <b>mortgage</b> it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E
