5|$|While in power, Rajoelina {{periodically}} {{engaged in}} ongoing negotiations to establish {{conditions under which}} {{free and fair elections}} could be held to restore government constitutionality and legitimacy {{in the eyes of the}} international community. On 4 August 2009 Rajoelina met with former Madagascar presidents Ravalomanana, Ratsiraka and Zafy along with former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano acting as mediator at the four-day mediation crisis talks held in <b>Maputo,</b> Mozambique. The <b>Maputo</b> Accords signed by the four leaders in August and further accords signed in Addis-Abeba in November provided guidelines for a period of consensual political transition. In the months that followed, however, Rajoelina obstructed the implementation of the accords, making unilateral political decisions and filling all important government posts with TGV party representatives.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Eline struck Mozambique, {{there was already}} {{incoming}} assistance from the international community, responding to the earlier flooding. Mozambique's president at the time, Joaquim Chissano, requested for additional aid after the storm struck, asking for $65 million for both reconstruction and emergency aid, and later increasing the request to $160 million. By the end of February 2000, various countries had pledged $13.5 million to Mozambique, well short of the required needs, but that rose to nearly $119 million by March 17. By March 4, 39.6 tons of various relief goods reached the country, to be distributed from the towns of Bilene and Magul. The supplies nearly overwhelmed the small airport at <b>Maputo,</b> as lack of distribution caused food to decay in the sun.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of <b>Maputo.</b> The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200–400, 400–500, 500–600, and 600–700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while females were more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages saw their Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to <b>Maputo,</b> Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesia's {{strategic}} position underwent {{a fundamental change}} in June 1975 when the Portuguese government suddenly withdrew from Mozambique which bordered Rhodesia on the east. Mozambique now came under the control of a Soviet-allied government which was supportive of black nationalist forces in both South Africa and Rhodesia. This created a delicate situation since Rhodesia's main road and rail links to the outside world were via the Mozambican ports of Beira and <b>Maputo.</b> Initially, the new Mozambican government allowed the Rhodesians continued use of these links. This was so even while ZANU guerrillas were allowed to base themselves in Tete province adjoining north eastern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|The Natal {{red rock}} hare or greater red rock hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family Leporidae (rabbits and hares). It has a {{slightly}} grizzled, grayish brown head and reddish brown upperparts.The dense fur is thick and rougher than other rock hares. It is endemic to Africa, and found in southeastern provinces of South Africa (Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal), eastern Lesotho, Swaziland (Highveld and Lumbobo), and southern Mozambique (<b>Maputo</b> Province). It is aherbivore, primarily feeding on grass. It breeds throughout the year, {{and one or two}} pups are usually born in the summer. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.|$|E
5|$|In Mozambique, Domoina dropped heavy {{rainfall}} {{in the capital}} <b>Maputo</b> that accounted for 40% of the annual total. Floods in the country destroyed over 50small dams and left widespread crop damage just before the summer harvest. Later, the rains caused the worst flooding in over 20years in Swaziland, which damaged or destroyed more than 100bridges. Disrupted transport left areas isolated for several days. In South Africa, rainfall peaked at 950mm (37in), which flooded 29river basins, notably the Pongola River which altered its course after the storm. Flooding caused the Pongolapoort Dam to reach 87% of its capacity; when waters were released to maintain the structural integrity, additional flooding occurred in Mozambique, forcing thousands to evacuate. Throughout the region, Domoina caused widespread flooding that damaged houses, roads, and crops, leaving about $199million in damage. There were 242deaths in southeastern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Zacharias is a {{frequent}} keynote lecturer within the evangelical community at {{events such as the}} Future of Truth conference in 2004, the National Religious Broadcasters' Convention and Exposition in 2005, the National Conference on Christian Apologetics in 2006. On successive nights in October 2007, he addressed first the students and faculty of Virginia Tech, then the community of Blacksburg, Virginia, on the topic of evil and suffering {{in the wake of the}} Virginia Tech massacre. Zacharias has represented the evangelical community at occasions such as the National Day of Prayer in Washington, DC, the Annual Prayer Breakfast at the United Nations, and the African Union Prayer Breakfast in <b>Maputo,</b> Mozambique, and was named honorary chairman of the 2008 National Day of Prayer task force. He also participated in the ecumenical Together 16 meetings in July 2016, which Pope Francis addressed, describing the event as a valiant effort.|$|E
5|$|While Hudah {{was located}} in the Mozambique Channel, the cyclone was {{expected}} to cause flood conditions in the Mozambican provinces of Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and potentially Zambezia. Even prior to Hudah, Mozambique was already facing a widespread flood and resultant humanitarian crisis; conditions which were further exacerbated by three tropical cyclones which impacted the country within the previous four months. The Instituto Nacional de Gestão de Calamidades(INGC) warned residents in potentially affected areas to take precautionary measures and secure fishing boats. The South African National Defense Force(SANDF) maintained 50soldiers and other military personnel {{and a number of}} aircraft to monitor the ongoing floods in Mozambique and potential impacts from Hudah. An Australian contingency held operations for a hospital and water purification plant in Chibuto to assist potentially affected populations. Multiple other relief organizations began to supply Mozambique with relief supplies due to the threat of the impending storm. The UN World Food Programme(WFP) sent 1,000tonnes (1,100short tons) of food to Nampula Province and 500tonnes (550short tons) of food to Quelimane Province. The WFP also placed relief aircraft on standby. The Mozambican Ministry of Health sent 30tents and 10rolls of plastic to Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Zambezia provinces. The United States Agency for International Development(USAID) dispatched a group of 12-member search and rescue team to <b>Maputo</b> in order to train local relief crews.|$|E

25|$|While Vitens’ {{obligations}} under the first contract {{were similar to those}} in AdeM’s management contract, its services were provided free of charge and its staffing arrangements were quite different. While AdEM management changed constantly and its expatriate-only team was based in <b>Maputo</b> only, according to a World Bank study, Vitens used a staffing model with only the team leader residing in Mozambique, assisted by short-term experts from the Netherlands. The Dutch team developed a close working relationship with Mozambican team members, thus strengthening local capacity.|$|E
25|$|In late 1997 {{and early}} 1998 Outeniqua {{conducted}} two voyages to resupply a SANAE weather reporting team in Antarctica.

During August and September 1998 Outeniqua and two minesweepers conducted a flag-showing cruise up {{the east coast of}} Africa, and visited <b>Maputo,</b> Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. A helicopter handling system was installed during 1998. During 2000 Outeniquas flight deck and logistic support capabilities were upgraded.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{published}} reliable data {{on water}} and sanitation service quality in Mozambique. Many water systems provide water intermittently. However, four cities - Beira, Pemba, Quelimane and Nampula – have achieved continuous or almost continuous water supply {{as a result of}} private sector participation, increasing the hours of water supply per day from 9 hours (Beira and Quelimane) and 17 hours (Nampula and Pemba) in 2002 to 22–24 hours in 2007. Water supply in <b>Maputo</b> remains intermittent, increasing only slightly from 12 to 14 hours.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, and {{a widower}} since 1956, Simões Dias moved with his {{daughter}} and son-in-law to Lourenço Marques, present-day <b>Maputo,</b> capital of {{what was then the}} Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique. There he pursued his dedication to poetry and filled several notebooks with his memoirs, as yet unpublished. Until his death shortly after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, he maintained a radio show along the molds of his previous project in Portugal – A Arte de ouvir (The Art of Listening), broadcast by local station Rádio Clube de Moçambique.|$|E
25|$|In early April, Saga Rose {{finally put}} to sea, with Port Elizabeth, South Africa, listed as her destination. Once again, rumours of a {{conversion}} {{to a hotel}} ship circulated. On 29 April, Saga Rose docked in Durban for refuelling, and was under-way again with her destination now reported to be <b>Maputo,</b> Mozambique. Rather than dock again in Africa, Saga Rose next headed into the Indian Ocean, with Saga Cruises refusing {{to comment on the}} ship's possible sale for scrap or any other use. By 23 May, the ship was off the Taiwanese coast with her destination being reported as Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 the {{government}} competitively awarded a hybrid lease/management contract for seven cities {{to an international}} consortium called Aguas de Moçambique (AdeM), which was led by the French firm SAUR (35%) and included Aguas de Portugal (32%). For <b>Maputo</b> and Matola the contract consisted of a 15-year lease and for the other cities of a 5-year management contract. AdEM also included a 30%-shareholding by a Mozambiquan holding company called Mazi of Mozambique consisting of six local shareholders. AdeM’s financial bid was substantially {{lower than that of}} the closest competitor. According to a World Bank study, it ultimately proved to be unrealistically low.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands has {{committed}} {{a total of}} 17 water projects for Mozambique in the period 2005-11. The largest commitment was 18.6m Euro for a <b>Maputo</b> water project in joint funding with the EIB, the EU water facility and the French Development Agency in 2007. The second-largest commitment was 15m Euro for a water project {{in the city of}} Chimoio in Manica Province in 2009. More than 8m Euro were approved in 2008 to support the activities of the public Dutch water company Vitens in four cities (see further above under history). The Netherlands also provided US$10m of co-financing for the World Bank-led second national water supply project.|$|E
25|$|CRA {{approved}} real average tariff {{increases of}} 5 to 10 {{percent per year}} in the service areas of the private company AdeM over the period 2002–07, applying a tariff indexation formula. However, after adjustment for inflation tariffs barely increased. Due to the contract structure, the limited inflation-adjusted increases benefited the public asset holding company FIPAG, not the private operator. FIPAG’s financial performance improved steadily {{as a result of the}} tariff increases. The water company for <b>Maputo</b> has to pay a regulatory fee to CRA, and all licensed water companies have to pay water abstraction charges to the central government for pumping water from rivers or the ground. These fees and charges are added to the water tariff.|$|E
25|$|The Water Services and Institutional Support Project, a US$30M project {{approved}} in 2007, aims to increase water service {{coverage in the}} cities of Beira, Nampula, Quelimane, and Pemba and to establish an institutional and regulatory framework for water supply in smaller cities and towns. The World Bank was closely involved in the promotion of private sector participation in urban water supply through two projects. The first project (1998–2006) supported building capacity, rural water supply, water resources management, and the preparation of a new urban water supply strategy through a US$36m credit. This strategy, implemented during the second water project (2004–2009), supported large-scale civil works for urban water supply systems in five cities – <b>Maputo</b> (the capital), Beira, Quelimane, Nampula and Pemba through a US$75m credit.|$|E
