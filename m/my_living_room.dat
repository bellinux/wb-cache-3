25|$|Attending {{the debut}} of the King of <b>My</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Room</b> {{songwriter}} series in Charlottesville in 2001, Curreri decided to make his home there. The original group of Charlottesville songwriters that launched this series of live shows included such artists as Brady Earnhart, Danny Schmidt, Stratton Salidis, Jan Smith, Lance Brenner, Browning Porter, and Jeff Romano. The concept resulted {{in a number of}} concerts, many of which Curreri would join in on – including the reunion/finale in November 2007 at the Gravity Lounge in Charlottesville.|$|E
500|$|The trio {{released}} two 7-inch EP recordings with Cargo {{during the}} interim. By {{the summer of}} 1996, [...] "Wasting Time" [...] had been released as a single to keep matters moving along nattily. The track was the final single from the Cheshire Cat sessions, and the band would soon return to their native home state to record a follow-up. Before recording of the album began, the band booked time at DML Studios in Escondido, California, where they perfected the songs for Dude Ranch. Most of the lyrics for the album had been written over 1995 and 1996, while touring. [...] "I remember writing most of those songs in <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> sitting on a [...] curb, whatever," [...] recalled DeLonge in 2001. [...] "Back then, each song was pretty much written with a specific girl or event in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Miracle Man" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The X-Files written by Howard Gordon {{without the aid of}} his {{long-term}} collaborator Alex Gansa. The pair had worked on several other series before The X-Files, and had also contributed the episodes [...] "Conduit", [...] "Ghost in the Machine", [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] to the series so far. Series creator Chris Carter recalls being asked to collaborate on the episode, saying [...] "Howard came to my house, and said, 'Help me out,' so we went to <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and put up this bulletin board and {{in a matter of hours}} we came up with this story". Originally the script had called for more overt religious imagery, though censors at Fox objected to depictions of faith healer Samuel being beaten to death whilst in a cruciform pose, leading to scenes being cut.|$|E

I really think that you're just hard-wiring (synapses) in your brain up {{until the age of}} maybe 12 or 10, and there are certain things you can't learn in an authentic way after that."

5000|$|Though {{a lifelong}} actor, Stanley Bennett Clay has stated he prefers {{directing}} and producing: [...] "I've {{always been the}} one in charge. I like the responsibility. At 12, I produced my first show: wrote it, composed the music, directed it, sold tickets, controlled the concessions—lemonade and cookies—and starred in it in <b>my</b> parents' <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> People from the neighborhood lined up to see it. Yeah, it's about control. I'm doing my own things, doing them the way I want them done." ...|$|R
5000|$|That night, the fright totally disappeared. [...] "The minute I got up {{on stage}} I had this feeling like I'd been {{preparing}} for this all my life. I was so relaxed that I felt as though I was in <b>my</b> own <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Chick and I played musical games - he'd play these real simple lines and I'd be giving my interpretations of them, then go off into the Chick Corea 'outness.' I ended up in New York two weeks later."With keyboardist and composer Chick Corea’s pioneering fusion group that featured bassist Stanley Clarke and drummer Lenny White, Connors established himself on the national and international music scenes, touring in Japan and Europe, and recording the now legendary Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy.|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table where I would stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast because we wanted to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case. I have such a place in my heart for Britney".|$|E
60|$|Under the {{influence}} of Spencer I traced a parallel development of the Arts and found a measure of scientific peace. Under the inspiration of Whitman I pondered the significance of democracy and caught some part of its spiritual import. With Henry George as guide, I discovered {{the main cause of}} poverty and suffering in the world, and so in <b>my</b> little <b>room,</b> <b>living</b> on forty cents a day, I was in a sense profoundly happy. So long as I had a dollar and a half with which to pay my rent and two dollars for the keepers of the various dives in which I secured my food, I was imaginatively the equal of Booth and brother to the kings of song.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Tim Nichols and Craig Wiseman. The duo {{had a friend who}} {{received}} a medical misdiagnosis regarding a form of lung cancer. Wiseman and Nichols began discussing family members and friends who learned of illnesses, and how they often had a new perspective on life upon learning they had limited time. They decided to write a song based on the concept, hoping that it might inspire someone in such a situation. After they came up with the title, they began writing the first verse and chorus. They found themselves attached to the song, and continued to write in late into the night over the phone. [...] "I remember going in <b>my</b> totally dark <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> laying on the floor, and we wrote the second verse on the phone," [...] Wiseman recalled. The inclusion of the lyric about riding a bull was intended as a sort of [...] "palette cleanse," [...] as they felt the chorus was growing too sentimental. The duo judged its creation as a [...] "really spiritual thing, because it came strong. Me and Tim's instincts and intuitions just kept leading us." ...|$|R

2500|$|Pearson {{signed the}} Canada–United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and {{unemployment}} fell {{to its lowest}} rate in over a decade. While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the Vietnam War. Pearson spoke at Temple University in Philadelphia on 2 April 1965, while visiting the United States and voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold. To President Lyndon B. Johnson, this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to Camp David, Maryland, to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, [...] "Don't you come into <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and piss on my rug." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carson {{opposed the}} Vietnam War, and capital punishment, favored racial equality, and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography.

[...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, {{and there are times}} when I would like to express a view on the air.

To prepare, he watched Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry movies and Mel Gibson in Road Warrior.

[...] Jackman was adamant about doing his own stunts for the movie. [...] "We worked a lot on the movement style of Wolverine, and I studied some martial arts. I watched a lot of Mike Tyson fights, especially his early fights. There's something about his style, the animal rage, that seemed right for Wolverine.

500|$|The Ellwood House <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did {{not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The {{original}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In the <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and sunroom. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme.
