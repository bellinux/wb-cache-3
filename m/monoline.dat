25|$|The <b>monoline</b> {{insurance}} companies {{got involved with}} writing credit default swaps on mortgage-backed CDOs. Some media reports have claimed this was a contributing factor to the downfall {{of some of the}} monolines. In 2009 one of the monolines, MBIA, sued Merrill Lynch, claiming that Merrill had misrepresented some of its CDOs to MBIA in order to persuade MBIA to write CDS protection for those CDOs.|$|E
25|$|In June 2005, Wachovia {{negotiated}} {{to purchase}} <b>monoline</b> {{credit card company}} MBNA. However, the deal fell through when Wachovia balked at MBNA's purchase price. Within a week of the deal's collapse, MBNA entered into an agreement to be purchased by Wachovia's chief rival, Bank of America. Wachovia received $100 million out of this deal, {{the result of an}} agreement Wachovia predecessor First Union made in 2000 when it sold its credit card portfolio to MBNA. This agreement required MBNA to pay this sum if it were ever sold to a competitor. In late 2005 Wachovia announced that it would end its relationship with MBNA and start up its own credit card division so that the bank could issue its own Visa cards.|$|E

50|$|<b>Monoline</b> {{insurers}} play {{a critical}} role in modern-day Credit Enhancements; they are more effective in (a) off-balance-sheet models creating synthetic collateral, (b) sovereign ratings' enhancement with built-in asset derivatives and (c) cross border loans with receivables and counterparties in the domain and jurisdiction of the <b>monoline</b> insurer. The decision whether to use a <b>monoline</b> insurer or not often depends upon the cost of such cover vis-a-vis the improvement in pricing for the loan or bond issue by virtue of such credit enhancement.|$|E

5000|$|While {{many other}} <b>monolines</b> were {{acquired}} by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking {{with a focus}} on subprime customers.|$|R
50|$|The 1990s saw {{continued}} {{expansion of}} the <b>monolines</b> into non-municipal and international sectors as U.S. domestic municipal bond insurance was becoming more of a “commodity.” See, for example, the 1994 BusinessWeek article on MBIA.|$|R
5000|$|Commentators such as {{investor}} David Einhorn [...] {{have criticized}} rating agencies for being slow {{to act and}} for giving the <b>monolines</b> undeserved ratings {{that allowed them to}} be paid to “bless” bonds with these ratings.|$|R

50|$|At that time, Capital One was a <b>monoline</b> bank, {{meaning that}} all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards. This {{strategy}} is risky in that {{it can lead to}} losses during bad times. Capital One attributed its relative success as a <b>monoline</b> to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, the New York Insurance Department (NYID) {{introduced}} {{several new}} guidelines aimed at credit default swaps, CDOs, <b>monolines,</b> and other entities {{involved in the}} financial meltdown. These guidelines were described in the document entitled “Circular Letter No. 19 (2008).” ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, the CDO market (especially the mortgage-backed CDO market) was growing significantly. The <b>monolines</b> became {{involved}} in more of these transactions, typically by selling credit default swap (CDS) protection on the CDO tranches. This occurred {{at the same time}} that an increasing number of CDOs were being based on subprime mortgage debt. This business contributed to the monolines’ growth during this period, with the total amount of outstanding obligations insured by the <b>monolines</b> reaching $3.3 trillion in 2006. In 2006, this contingent liability was backed by approximately $47 billion of claims-paying resources, all in compliance with Article 69 and other states’ financial guaranty insurance statutes and with capital adequacy guidelines set by the rating agencies.|$|R
50|$|FSA insured {{primarily}} municipal bonds, {{asset-backed securities}} and mortgage-backed securities. Before insuring a municipal bond, <b>monolines</b> request a pledge of local tax revenues or revenues from essential public {{services such as}} municipal water charges. FSA was bought on 4 March 2000 for EUR€2.7 billion by the Franco-Belgian bank Dexia.|$|R
50|$|Some {{municipal}} bonds are insured by <b>monoline</b> insurers that {{take on the}} credit risk of these bonds for a small fee.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} slab-serifs {{were often}} called [...] "antiques" [...] or [...] "Egyptians". They were often quite <b>monoline</b> in construction and had similarities to nineteenth-century serif fonts, such as ball terminals.|$|E
50|$|Credit default swap markets quoted {{rates for}} <b>monoline</b> default {{protection}} more typical for below-investment-grade credits. Structured credit issuance ceased, and many municipal bond issuers spurned bond insurance, {{as the market}} was no longer {{willing to pay the}} traditional premium for monoline-backed paper. New players such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Assurance entered the market. By January 2008, many municipal and institutional bonds were trading at prices as if they were uninsured, effectively discounting <b>monoline</b> insurance completely. The slow reaction of the ratings agencies in formalizing this situation echoed their slow downgrading of subprime mortgage debt a year earlier.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} generally {{agrees that}} the traditional insurance sector is not a source of systemic risk, and insurers are often considered to be shock absorbers rather than shock amplifiers. Yet, {{the evolution of the}} industry both in terms of structure (concentration of the reinsurers, increased linkages with banks, especially through bancassurance conglomerates) and in terms of techniques (securitization, <b>monolines,</b> derivatives) increased the systemic relevance of the insurers...|$|R
50|$|Stock {{prices for}} the {{publicly}} traded <b>monolines,</b> such as Ambac and MBIA, fell dramatically. Ambac share prices climbed from the teens in the early 1990s to $96 by 2007. By mid-2008, Ambac shares were trading for around $1 - {{and by the end}} of 2010 at 10 to 13 cents per share. MBIA had a similar fate, climbing to the $60s by 2007, but falling to about $6 per share by 2009.|$|R
50|$|Nonetheless, {{some have}} criticized the entire {{business}} model. In her book Confidence Game, Christine S. Richard examines the basic assumptions upon which the industry was based. She argues that a <b>monoline's</b> business can be seen as, basically, selling a triple-A credit rating to a municipal bond issuer. However, the credit rating agencies had a separate “rating scale” applied to obligations of municipal issuers, as opposed to non-municipal issuers (e.g., corporations). Some argued that if the rating agencies had rated municipalities on the same scale they rated corporations, then the municipalities would have been rated much higher to begin with, and thus {{there was no real}} need for bond insurance. The question was debated before Congress in 2008, at the House Committee on Financial Services under Barney Frank. Richard Blumenthal, then-attorney general of Connecticut, Ajit Jain of Berkshire Hathaway, then-Superintendent Eric Dinallo of the New York State Insurance Department, and a Moody's representative were also in attendance.|$|R
50|$|Blackstone made a {{significant}} investment in Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), a <b>monoline</b> bond insurer alongside PMI Group, The Cypress Group and CIVC Partners. FGIC incurred heavy losses, along with other bond insurers in the 2008 credit crisis.|$|E
50|$|CIFG http://www.cifg.com/, {{a family}} of {{financial}} guaranty companies, was formerly a triple-A <b>monoline</b> insurer. Its mission is to provide global clients with secure and well-capitalized Triple-A credit protection through financial guarantee insurance, reinsurance and other credit enhancement products.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>monoline</b> slab serifs such as Serifa, Helserif and Roboto Slab {{have been}} {{designed}} {{under the influence of}} neo-grotesque or realist sans-serif fonts of the 1950s and 60s onwards, and these may be called [...] "neo-grotesque" [...] slab serifs.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{mortgage}} insurance, {{bond insurance}} generally provides for unconditional payment of claims, although the insurer reserves {{the right to}} pursue contractual or other available remedies. As a result, the bond insurers were faced with {{billions of dollars of}} claims to insured security holders associated with their exposure to RMBS following the financial crisis, with uncertain prospects for recoveries from the sponsors of the securitizations giving rise to those claims. One indication of the extent of loan quality misrepresentation was the settlement in 2011 between Assured Guaranty and Bank of America, which had purchased mortgage originator Countrywide. Under the terms of the settlement, Bank of America made a $1.1 billion payment to Assured Guaranty and agreed to cover 80% of up to $6.6 billion of Assured Guaranty’s future paid losses from breaches of representations and warranties on 21 insured RMBS transactions. [...] Subsequently, in 2013, in the first R&W trial to reach a judgment, Flagstar Bank was required to compensate Assured Guaranty in full for past and future claims. The amounts that Assured Guaranty caused R&W providers to pay or commit to pay through putbacks and settlements plus the amount of future projected losses that Assured Guaranty avoided through negotiated terminations totaled approximately $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2015. While the widespread misrepresentations caused bond insurers to experience considerable losses on insured securities backed by residential mortgage loans (including first lien loans, second lien loans, and home equity lines of credit), the most severe losses were experienced by those <b>monolines</b> that insured CDOs backed by mezzanine RMBS. Although the bond insurers generally insured such CDOs at very high attachment points or collateral levels (with underlying ratings of triple-A), those bond insurers and the rating agencies failed to anticipate the correlation of performance of the underlying securities. Specifically, these bond insurers and rating agencies relied upon historical data that did not prove predictive of residential mortgage loan performance following the 2008 crisis, which witnessed the first-ever nationwide decline in housing prices. Notably, AGM and AGC did not insure such CDOs, which has allowed Assured Guaranty to continue writing business throughout the financial crisis and ensuing recession and recovery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995 the New York State Insurance Department {{enabled the}} 'monoline' municipal-bond {{insurance}} companies to write insurance on GICs. Thus if the GIC issuer failed, the <b>monoline</b> insurer could pay back investors instead. Insured GICs were called [...] "wrapped" [...] GICs.|$|E

5000|$|A second aspect in the {{development}} of slab-serifs was the influence of geometric design of the 1920s, and many slab-serifs were produced that had a more <b>monoline</b> structure similar to geometric sans-serifs also popular around this time, such as Futura. These are called [...] "geometric" [...] designs.|$|E

50|$|The term Egyptian {{was adopted}} by French and German foundries, where it became Egyptienne. A lighter style of slab serif with a single width of strokes was called 'engravers face' since it resembled the <b>monoline</b> {{structure}} of metal engravings. The term 'slab-serif' itself is relatively recent, possibly twentieth-century.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>monoline</b> insurer, American Municipal Bond Assurance Corporation (now Ambac), {{was formed}} in 1971 as an insurer of {{municipal}} bonds.
