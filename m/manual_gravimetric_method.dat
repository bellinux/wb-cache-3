40|$|Simulation of wear in {{artificial}} joint implants {{is critical}} for evaluating implant designs and materials. Traditional protocols employ the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> to determine the loss of material by measuring {{the weight of the}} implant components before and after various test intervals and after the completed test. However, the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> cannot identify the location, area coverage or maximum depth of the wear and it has difficulties with proportionally small weight changes in relatively heavy implants. In this study, we compare the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> with two geometric surface methods; an optical light method (RedLux) and a coordinate measuring method (CMM). We tested ten Adept hips in a simulator for 2 million cycles (MC). <b>Gravimetric</b> and optical <b>methods</b> were performed at 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00, 1. 33 and 2 MC. CMM measurements were done before and after the test. A high correlation was found between the <b>gravimetric</b> and optical <b>methods</b> for both heads (R 2 = 0. 997) and for cups (R 2 = 0. 96). Both geometric methods (optical and CMM) measured more volume loss than the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> (for the heads, p = 0. 004 (optical) and p = 0. 08 (CMM); for the cups p = 0. 01 (optical) and p = 0. 003 (CMM)). Two cups recorded negative wear at 2 MC by the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> but none did by either the optical method or by CMM. The geometric methods were prone to confounding factors such as surface deformation and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> could be confounded by protein absorption and backside wear. Both of the geometric methods were able to show the location, area covered and depth of the wear on the bearing surfaces, and track their changes during the test run; providing significant advantages to solely using the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{measurements}} {{performed on}} frozen and unfrozen samples demonstrated that no divergence was observed between the MC values {{obtained for the}} frozen and unfrozen material with a 95  % confidence level. Due to the long winters in the Nordic region, it {{is a prerequisite for}} any technique that it can handle frozen material. The <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> was used as reference method in this study. This method is standardized and widely accepted, both at research institutes and in industry around the world. However, there are some questions to be raised concerning this method. Errors might occur due to water that is strongly bound to the cell wall still remains upon drying, or that volatile compounds are evaporated during drying. It has also been shown by Björklund and Fryk [20] that the temperature inside the drying ovens could vary significantly from the set value. It is likely that the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> holds some errors, and {{it is important to keep}} this in mind when interpreting different parameters, such as the SEE, because this includes the error from both the MDS and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method.</b> Because the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> destroys the sample, it is also impossible to make repeatable measurements on the same sample and obtain a fair reference value of the precision for the method itself, similar to what has been reported by the MDS. However, since the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> is a standardized method, commonly accepted and widely used, it is natural to use it as a reference method to a new technique performing the same measurement, so is done in studies by, for example, Duarte Da Paz [7] and Berg et al.

It has already been proven that the correlation curve for quantification is species dependent, but it has not yet been investigated whether this is also the case for the optimization of the Nile Red assay protocol.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} in the last decennia to develop a rapid method for lipid determination in microalgae, as an alternative for the time consuming <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods.</b> Different studies showed that in situ lipid staining with Nile Red is a promising method, but very few did a profound optimization and validation. In this study, lipid determination with in situ staining of lipids with Nile Red has therefore been thoroughly optimized and validated for Nannochloropsis oculata. It was found that fluorescence intensity at 570 - 580 nm (when excitation wavelength was 486 nm) increased in microalgal suspensions with Nile Red compared to the blank without Nile Red, suggesting that Nile Red enters the microalgal cells and stains the lipids. Fluorescence intensity, calculated by peak height or peak area, was increased by addition of glycerol to the microalgal suspension. This method was further improved by optimization of the optical density of the algal suspension, the Nile Red concentration and glycerol concentration in the algal suspension and the incubation time. This optimized procedure was used to validate the method. In contrast to almost all studies about this subject, the validation was performed on different, independent batches of Nannochloropsis oculata, on which both the Nile Red <b>method</b> and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> was tested. A good correlation (R² = 0. 9483) was found between neutral lipid content obtained by the Nile Red <b>method</b> and the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method.</b> It can also be concluded that Nile Red staining correlates better with neutral lipid content than with total lipid content. It can be concluded that Nile Red in situ lipid staining gives an indication of the (neutral) lipid content in Nannochloropsis oculata. Also for other microalgal species, this is a promising method. However, for exact quantification of total lipid content, <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> are recommended, which are both more accurate and more precise. status: publishe...|$|R
