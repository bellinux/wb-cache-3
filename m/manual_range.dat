50|$|The Mamiya ZM, {{introduced}} in 1982, was essentially an advanced {{version of the}} ZE-2, {{with some of the}} features of the ZE-X. It was the last Mamiya 135-film camera produced. It had an aperture-priority automatic time control, based on center-weighted TTL readings, an automatic shutter-speed range from 4 seconds to 1/1000, and a <b>manual</b> <b>range</b> from 2 seconds to 1/1000. Visual and audio signals indicated over- or under-exposure, pending battery failure, or excessive camera shake. Metering modes, shutter release, self-timer, manual time settings and the ergonomics of the camera body were also improved.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{single and}} double manual harpsichords {{made by the}} Ruckers family had the {{disposition}} 8' 4', with each keyboard having a set of jacks for each set of strings. The standard compass of the Ruckers keyboard is from short octave C/E to [...] Double manual harpsichords had their keyboards uncoupled and aligned to sound a 4th (occasionally a 5th) apart, with the upper manual at standard pitch and the lower pitched below it; when each manual was being used the jacks of the other manual were disengaged. The Ruckers double manual harpsichord thus worked as two instruments in one, pitched a 4th apart. Later two-manual harpsichords keyboards had {{the two sets of}} strings tuned together or antiphonally at the same pitch, for timbral contrasts. Variations of the standard models were sometimes produced for export to France or England; there are single manual harpsichords with chromatic basses (rather than the short octave) down to C, probably intended for England, and double manual harpsichords with a lower-manual range of GG to [...] produced for France, the lower manual being at standard pitch and the upper a 4th below, reversing the usual pitch arrangement. The lower <b>manual</b> <b>range</b> of these instruments suits the music of contemporary French harpsichord composers such as Chambonnières and Louis Couperin, while the upper <b>manual</b> <b>range</b> is close to early French organ design.|$|E
50|$|The range (compass) of the {{keyboards}} on {{an organ}} has varied widely between different time periods and different nationalities. Portative organs {{may have a}} range of only an octave or two, while a few large organs, such as the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ, may have some manual keyboards approaching the size of a modern piano. German organs of {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} featured manual ranges from C to f&prime;&prime;&prime; and pedal ranges from C to d&prime;, though some organs only had manual ranges that extended down to F. Many French organs of this period had pedal ranges that went down to AA (though this ravelement applied only to the reeds, and may have only included the low AA, not AA-sharp or BB). French organs of the nineteenth century typically had manual ranges from C to g&prime;&prime;&prime; and pedal ranges from C to f&prime;; in the twentieth century the <b>manual</b> <b>range</b> was extended to a&prime;&prime;&prime;. The modern console specification recommended by the American Guild of Organists calls for manual keyboards with sixty-one notes (five octaves, from C to c&prime;&prime;&prime;&prime;) and pedal keyboards with thirty-two notes (two and a half octaves, from C to g&prime;). These ranges apply to the notes written on the page; depending on the registration, the actual range of the instrument may be much greater.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivePractice {{guidelines}} recommend early {{physical therapy}} {{in intensive care}} unit (ICU) [1]. We aimed to evaluate the tolerance of an early exercise program in ICU based on a decisional algorithm issued from the evidence based data and an experts opinion. MethodsIn this pilot feasibility study, main outcome collected before and after exercise session is discomfort on a Visual Analogue Scale (VASdiscomfort). Secondary outcomes are muscle strength (Medical Research Council scale), length of stay on ICU, mortality in ICU and place for discharge destination. The standardized program includes an upper and lower limbs (LL) training (cycloergometer for LL and <b>manual</b> <b>range</b> of motion) and a functional training, delivered by a physical therapist. The progression is based on fixed VASdiscomfort threshold at 7 / 10 during exercise and on algorithm constructed from a systematic review of literature [2], using the Consort recommendations and the PEDro grid. ResultsThirty patients were recruited, a total of 150 training sessions were made daily and overall tolerance of an early exercise program in ICU, based from an algorithm applied to the ICU patients is good. We confirm the feasibility of such programs and the very few benign adverse events rate. We note a low incidence of polyneuromyopathy diagnosis. ConclusionTolerance of an early exercise program in ICU based from an algorithm is good, but these preliminary results remain to be confirmed in a prospective randomized controlled trial. However, the use of this decisional algorithm should be encouraged to standardize and to initiate progressively very early exercise programs in ICU...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates if and to {{what extent}} the Dutch Obesity Intervention in Teenagers (DOiT) program was {{implemented}} as intended and how this affected program effectiveness. We collected data at 20 prevocational education schools in the Netherlands. We assessed seven process indicators: recruitment, reach, dosage, fidelity, satisfaction, effectiveness and continuation. Data collection involved teacher questionnaires (n = 110), adolescent questionnaires and adiposity measures (n = 938). Using multi-level confirmatory factor analyses, we applied an innovative method to obtain explorative implementation index scores. The percentage of accomplished activities ranged from 9 % (for ‘closure meeting’) up to 93 % (for ‘obtaining support within the school for adoption’). The percentage of lessons delivered decreased from 74 to 18 % {{towards the end of the}} program. Fidelity to the teacher <b>manual</b> <b>ranged</b> from 85 to 26 %. In general, teachers were satisfied with the DOiT lessons and teaching materials. Despite teachers’ satisfaction with the DOiT lessons and teaching materials, degree of program implementation was lower than expected, especially towards the end of the program.

40|$|AbstractSaccadic and manual {{responses}} {{were used to}} investigate the speed of discrimination between happy and non-happy facial expressions in two-alternative-forced-choice tasks. The minimum latencies of correct saccadic responses indicated that the earliest time point at which discrimination occurred ranged between 200 and 280 ms, depending on type of expression. Corresponding minimum latencies for <b>manual</b> responses <b>ranged</b> between 440 and 500 ms. For both response modalities, visual saliency of the mouth region was {{a critical factor in}} facilitating discrimination: The more salient the mouth was in happy face targets in comparison with non-happy distracters, the faster discrimination was. Global image characteristics (e. g., luminance) and semantic factors (i. e., categorical similarity and affective valence of expression) made minor or no contribution to discrimination efficiency. This suggests that visual saliency of distinctive facial features, rather than the significance of expression, is used to make both early and later expression discrimination decisions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Intracyclic {{velocity}} {{variation is}} an important kinematic parameter to evaluate swimming performance. It can be estimated by a fixed point at the swimmer’s hip. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the reproducibility and repeatability of active light markers to measure intracyclic velocity variation in swimming. Methods. Reproducibility and repeatability were tested by image measurement, by five manual digitizing processes and five sessions of automatic tracking of a LED marker set in a swimmer’s hip. The procedures were evaluated by the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the agreement between the methods was evaluated with Bland-Altman plots.
