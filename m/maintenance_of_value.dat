It reviews and interprets evidence on {{the ways in which}} central and local governments, non-governmental organizations, interest groups and the wider public can collaborate in planning and managing cultural landscapes. Particular attention is given to: the role of stakeholders, participation by communities-of-interest and communities-of-place; the management of specific landscape features; and policy and funding frameworks. It is concluded that community-based initiatives are unlikely to substitute for formal management of extensive protected areas, but that participatory approaches can be effective in more targeted situations. ...|$|R

Zambia prides itself to be a democratic and peaceful country. However, accountability, openness and responsiveness to the needs of citizens has been a challenge despite this great record, which has come as a result of free, fair and peaceful elections recorded consecutively since Zambia became a multi-party democracy. The partial fusion of the Executive and Legislative organs of government ably qualified by provisions of the current Constitution, makes it difficult to hold government accountable by the governed. Consequently, presidential appointment of Cabinet Ministers from Parliament equally weakens legislative ability of checking and balancing powers of the Executive. Moreover, appointment of judges by the President is another factor that punches holes in judicial independence and injures the last line of defence. It is as such imperative that the colossal presidential powers are reduced to allow a flourishing democratic society. In the view that the current Constitution does not have adequate provisions to prevent abuse of power by the Executive; this thesis has made recommendations for the Constitution to be amended to provide effective ways of balancing power between the three arms of government. This will inevitably create an environment of mutual accountability in government and construct a platform where the electorate could question irregular administrative actions...|$|R
