40|$|Abstract: Shewhart {{control limits}} for {{individual}} observations are traditionally {{based on the}} average of the <b>moving</b> <b>ranges.</b> The performance of this control chart behaves quite well if the underlying distribution is normal and the sample size is greater than 250. Under non-normality it is recommended to use control charts based on non-parametric statistics. The drawback of these individual control charts is that at least 1, 000 observations are needed to obtain appropriate results. In this paper we propose an alternative individual control chart which behaves quite well under non-normality for moderate sample sizes in the range of 250 through 1, 000 observations. To apply this control chart one starts with an initial guess for the density function of the characteristic under study. Based on this initial guess and the observed data a density function can be derived by means of an approximation with Bernstein polynomials. The in-control and out-of-control performance of the proposed control chart and the traditional control charts are studied by simulation. If the initial guess is appropriate, then for non-normal data and moderate sample sizes in the order of 250 through 1, 000 observations, the new method performs better than the individual control charts based on {{the average of the}} <b>moving</b> <b>ranges</b> or based on non-parametric statistics. So for these sample sizes we have tried to close the gap...|$|R

The M2, the first motorway, was built in 1997 with the contract being awarded to the Korean firm Daewoo. It linked the federal capital Islamabad with Punjab's provincial capital Lahore. The network was then extended to Sargodha and then to Faisalabad with the M3. M1 highway to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's capital Peshawar had been completed in October 2007. M4, M5, M6, and M7 have been planned and also being built by local and foreign firms. This will connect Faisalababd, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rotadero (Larkana) to Karachi. N5 links Karachi to other cities.Entry on all Pakistan highways is restricted to fast moving wheelers only. Slow-moving traffic and two wheelers (such as motorcycles and bicycles) are not allowed and construction and agricultural machinery is also restricted. Highway Police personnel use heavy motor bikes and fast <b>moving</b> <b>Range</b> Rovers for patrolling and are quite good at maintaining the traffic system. M9 and M10 are also functional now that connect Karachi to Hayderabad. The LSM (Lahore Sialkot Motorway) which is 103 km is under construction and will be completed by 2010.Expressways are similar to motorways with lesser access restrictions and are owned, maintained and operated either federally or provincially. Pakistan's Motorways are patrolled by Pakistan's National Highways & Motorway Police (NH&MP), {{which is responsible for}} enforcement of traffic and safety laws, security and recovery on the Pakistan Motorway network.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in mobile communications have brought dramatic and fundamental {{changes to the}} modern world. These developments {{have resulted in a}} great demand for applications that integrate geographic locations and services to fulfill the user’s needs. Different types of spatial queries are used in such applications, however, most studies consider the <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query to be the most common, and frequently used. The <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query is used to find all objects of interest within a given radius while the user who invokes the query is moving. During the last decade, some studies in <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> queries considered Euclidean geometry, where the distance between two objects is determined by their relative position in space. Some other studies considered network distance, wherein the trajectory between two objects is specified by the underlying network. The main objective of all the previous studies is to process <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> queries efficiently. However, most of these studies focus on index efficiency and less effort has been made to address the issues of moving query updating and optimisation, which are crucial factors affecting system performance. In this thesis, we attempt to investigate this possibility by proposing four new processing techniques. First, we introduce a new “approximate <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query” to optimise the query process in two ways: i) we reduce the amount of time needed to obtain the results; and ii) we give the users alternative options in order to avoid another search(es) when searching an empty result or a massive number of objects in the result. The result of our experiments show that our techniques are successful in terms of reducing the number of split points and false hits. Also, the approximate results are of a high quality compared to the exact results. Furthermore, our algorithms reduce the number of communications between the mobile device and the databases server, indicating their performance is better in terms of lower search time and improved search accuracy. Second, we present a technique to deal with the <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query called “safe region”. The high computation and communication costs of monitoring and updating the location of the <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query needs to be considered, as the calculation of the range query needs to be re-evaluated whenever the query moves. Our aim is to avoid any communication between the query and the server while the query moves within the specified safe region. We have extended the size of the safe region {{to reduce the amount of}} supplementary communication. Our main objective is to reduce the need for continuous monitoring of the query, and eliminate the need for the user to follow a defined path. Third, we propose a linear model called “monitoring <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query” to monitor moving queries inside a safe region. Our technique gives the users the ability to monitor themselves and inform the server when leaving the safe region. This will give the user more privacy and reduce the load on the server. Also, our technique will eliminate the need for the user to follow a defined path. We use the time and the concept of the safe region together, hence, if the query makes a sudden turn, the result will not be affected because the query will still be located inside the safe region. Finally, we introduce a novel query processing technique for the <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query in spatial network databases, called “lookforward <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query”. Our technique is related to Euclidean and network distance to retrieve related objects and at the same time to exclude unrelated ones. Our technique can distinguish between the significant important objects and the minor important objects inside the range query. Our technique improves the selectivity of the filter step to reduce the number of candidate objects, and consequently, minimise the number of communications between the mobile device and the database server. The lookforward <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query achieves a better running time and delivers a better performance having fewer split points than the original <b>moving</b> <b>range</b> query as shown on our experiments...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRange shift, a {{widespread}} response to climate change, {{will depend on}} species abilities to withstand warmer climates. However, these abilities may vary within species and such intraspecific variation can strongly impact species responses to climate change. Facing warmer climates, individuals should disperse according to their thermal optimum with consequences for species range shifts. Here we studied individual dispersal of a reptile in response to climate warming and preferred temperature using a semi-natural warming experiment. Individuals with low preferred temperatures dispersed more from warmer semi-natural habitats while individuals with higher preferred temperatures dispersed more from cooler habitats. These dispersal decisions partly matched phenotype-dependent survival rates in the different thermal habitats, suggesting adaptive dispersal. This process should result into a spatial segregation of thermal phenotypes along species <b>moving</b> <b>ranges</b> which should facilitate local adaptation to warming climates.

To evaluate the indoor climate thorough measurements have to be made. But how should this data be analysed? There are some established and some newer methods to evaluate measured climate data. The authors present here a new analytical method and its application on measured climate data from unheated historic buildings such as the King's House on the Schachen, Linderhof Palace and the small rural church of St. Margaretha in Roggersdorf.
