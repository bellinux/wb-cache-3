50|$|The modele 1931 {{machine gun}} is a gas {{operated}} weapon which fires from open bolt and in full automatic only. It {{is derived from}} the French FM 24/29 Fusil-Mitrailleur (light machine gun) also designed by Lt Colonel Reibel, and based on the Browning Automatic Rifle. The FM 24/29 was developed into a heavier machine gun capable of relatively sustained fire, by giving it an extremely thick and massive barrel, to act as a heat sink. This was necessary, since the FM 24/29 lacked a quick-change barrel or water-cooling and its normal light barrel would rapidly overheat and wear out, if fired in more than short bursts, with cooling rests between. The long stroke gas piston is located below the barrel and operates the vertically tilting bolt group. Ammunition is fed from side-mounted multi-layer 150-round pan magazines (with bullets pointing {{to the center of the}} round magazine). The gun can be modified to take magazines on either the left or right side, to ease magazine changes while mounted in the standard side-by-side JM twin-mount. Ejection is straight down, through the short chute attached to the base of the receiver, which in fortifications, usually led into a longer tube or chute that directed the spent cases into the ditches outside. The gun was fitted with a forward-curved pistol grip to aid control and a standard rifle-style trigger. When mounted in fortifications, the twin-mount included an adjustable twin-shoulder stock, a tubular metal bar that extended from the rear of the <b>mounting</b> <b>frame,</b> which mounted a horizontal crossbar, with shoulder pads on each end. The operator would face the breeches of the guns and place these pads against his shoulders. He would then use his body to control traverse, while his hands would grip the pistols grips to fire one or both guns. Elevation was controlled by a brass crank underneath the weapon. Twin mountings came in T and F configurations; F types used standard triggers and stocks and were used for embrasure mounts in casemates and cupolas, while the T featured a trigger operated by Bowden cable and was intended for remote use in retractable turrets.|$|E

50|$|Stabilization qualities {{enhanced}} by placement of Kenyon gyros onto mount Helicopter mounts {{are based on}} the principle of a balanced beam that has its gimbal point (center of gravity) behind the operator’s head. The gimbal point is the exact balance point of the roll, pitch and yaw. At the front of the balanced beam is the camera and camera control. At the back of the beam are the counterweights and batteries. The camera has an additional pan and tilt axis (yaw and pitch axis). These are balanced in their own right about the sub camera tilt axis of the balanced beam. This balanced beam in itself has a certain amount of inertia and will resist minimal angular disturbances coming up the gimbal <b>mounting</b> <b>frame.</b> However, in order to achieve a further degree of stabilization, Kenyon gyro modules are added. The Kenyon gyro module is an off-the-shelf motorized flywheel in a cage with one degree of freedom. When the spinning masses (flywheels) within the Kenyon gyro housing, are activated, they add an increased inertia (synthetic) to the overall system, which improves the mount’s ability to absorb the base angular disturbances from reaching the camera. These helicopter mounts with or without Kenyon gyros, can work quite well if: the weather conditions are perfect; the helicopter has the minimum of low frequency vibration (blades have been ‘tracked’ correctly); and you have a “qualified movie pilot” in control of the ship. An operator can achieve good stability for medium focal length lenses with short duration shots at the longer end of the lens. The drawbacks of (C) systems are that the operator’s physical strength is needed to position the camera while they are hanging out the side door of the helicopter. It is hard for the operator to maneuver the camera’s line of site when they are following a subject. The Kenyon gyros will resist their camera positioning, as the gyro will consider it part of the angular base motion. Because of this interaction, the helicopter pilot must undertake most of the camera positioning; the operator will just point the camera at the subject, relying on the pilot for keeping the subject in frame.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) on the department of mobile command center with supervised by ÅF. FMV Mobile Command centers main task is to integrate communication systems into Swedish Armed Forces (FM) vehicle systems. FMV has conducted a new radio system that will be integrated in FM. In communications systems various interfaces as mounting interface and connections interface frequent occurs. A mounting interface is an interface were the radio is mounted into a <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> or matching, connection interface is the cables and contacts or interfaces similar. During the procurement of the new radio system no requirements were written in the specification that it should fit in the existing mounting interface called <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> 42 / 48. Nor did the connection interfaces stated requirements in detail. The problem formulation of this thesis reads; How {{is it possible for}} FMV to work with integration of the new communications system in FM vehicles to create the best conditions, inside the boundaries that is given for this thesis? To get an understanding how integration can be better in FMV, questions were formulated from FMV, which are underlying the further work. A good foundation for the analysis are made from the feasibility on how a specification is written in FM, which laws that would have an effect for public authority and which methods and manuals that is available to aid. Interviews are then conducted with staff from FMV and with co-workers on the concept plant in Enköping, a lot of the tryouts of the new communication systems are done. Four different mounting system concepts on how the integrations can be done are evaluated and analyzed to get to a standing point. The conclusion from the analyze of the <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> concepts is that an updated version of the existing <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> could be the best. With the addition that the new acquired <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> also should have the potential to mount older radio systems. A <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> adjusts for the new radio system {{at the same time as}} the older fits. In this conclusion recommendations are presented on what FMV could work on to achieve better conditions for the integrations of communications systems. Conclusions that the start of a project is the most important factor, for the whole project to be made. The importance of the knowledge of a change late in a project is much more expensive than early in a project and the project participants have easier to get a clear picture if it is a good startup of a project. To find a common connection interface for the radio systems was not seen as a solution. Instead it is proposed to work with standards where it is possible and detail specifications where it is needed. ISRN UTH...|$|E
