40|$|Natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> are {{increasingly}} being considered {{an important component of}} innate resistance to viruses, but their role in HIV infection is controversial. Some investigators have found that natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> do not confer a protective effect during the progression of HIV disease, whereas others have shown that natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> may be protective and retard the progression of the disease, either through their lytic activity or by a chemokine-related suppression of HIV replication. In this study, we analyzed functional alterations in the activity of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> during HIV- 1 infection using a natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> activity assay with K 562 cells as targets. RESULTS: Our results show that the activity of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> decreases only in the advanced phase of HIV infection and when high (40 : 1) effector cell-target cell ratios were used. The depression {{at this stage of the}} disease may be related to increased levels of some viral factors, such as gp 120 or gag, that interfere with the binding capacity of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells,</b> or to the decreased production of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> -activity-stimulating cytokines, such as IFN-a and IL- 12, by monocytes, a subset of cells that are also affected in the late stage of HIV infection.

The yeast Malassezia can act as an allergen in atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome, and induce maturation of dendritic cells. Our aims were to study the distribution of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in the skin from atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome patients with the emphasis on possible natural <b>killer</b> cell–dendritic <b>cell</b> interaction, and to assess whether the interaction of Malassezia with dendritic cells would affect subsequent interaction between dendritic <b>cells</b> and natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> A few scattered natural killer (CD 56 +/CD 3 –) cells were found in the dermis of healthy individuals and in nonlesional skin from atopic eczema/dermatitis syndrome patients. In lesional skin and in biopsies from Malassezia atopy-patch-test-positive skin, however, natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> were differentially distributed {{and for the first time}} we could show close contact between natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and CD 1 a+ dendritic cells. Dendritic cells preincubated with Malassezia became less susceptible to natural-killer-cell-induced cell death, suggesting a direct effect imposed by Malassezia upon interaction of dendritic <b>cells</b> with natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings indicate that natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and dendritic cells can interact in the skin and that Malassezia affects the interaction between natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and dendritic cells.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effect of {{exposure}} to nitrogen oxides on peripheral blood natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells.</b> METHODS: Groups of glass craftsmen and braziers exposed to nitrogen oxides and non-exposed controls were studied. Air concentrations of nitrogen oxides were measured. Mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood samples were assayed for natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity with K 562 target cells in a 51 Cr release assay {{and the percentage of}} natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> (CD 16) was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Braziers were exposed to 1. 2 ppm nitrogen dioxide and 8. 6 ppm nitric oxide and glass craftsmen to 2. 9 ppm nitrogen dioxide and 26. 5 ppm nitric oxide. The natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity of exposed workers was significantly lower than in non-exposed controls (P < 0. 05 ANOVA Scheffe test). The percentage of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in glass craftsmen was significantly greater than in controls (P < 0. 05 ANOVA Scheffe test).

Methods: Using the monoclonal antibody for CD 57 specific marker for natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells,</b> we quantified natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> infiltration in 150 patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma who underwent curative tumor resection to investigate the relationship between natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> counts and clinicopathologic factors and prognosis. Results: The natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> count was significantly related to the regulation of tumor progression, involving T classification, N classification, and stage (P =. 01 for T classification or stage; P =. 02 for N classification).

40|$|Acute starvation, {{which is}} {{frequently}} observed in clinical practice, sometimes augments the cytolytic activity of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> against neoplastic cells. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying {{the enhancement of}} natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> function by fasting in mice. The total number of liver resident natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in a unit weight of liver tissue obtained from C 57 BL/ 6 J mice did not change after a 3 -day fast, while the proportions of tumor necrosis factor– related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) + and CD 69 + natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> were significantly elevated (n = 7, p, 0. 01), as determined by flow cytometric analysis. Furthermore, we found that TRAIL 2 natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> that were adoptively transferred into Rag- 22 / 2 c chain 2 / 2 mice could convert into TRAIL+ natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in fasted mice at a higher proportion than in fed mice. Liver natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> also showed high TRAIL-mediated antitumor function in response to 3 -day fasting. Since these fasted mice highly expressed heat shock protein 70 (n = 7, p, 0. 05) in liver tissues, as determined by western blot, the role of this protein in natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activation was investigated. Treatment of liver lymphocytes with 50 mg/mL of recombinant heat shock protein 70 led to the upregulation of both TRAIL and CD 69 in liver natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> (n = 6, p, 0. 05). In addition, HSP 70 neutralization by intraperitoneally injecting an anti- heat shock protein 70 monoclonal antibody into mice prior to fasting led to the downregulation of TRAIL expression (n = 6, p, 0. 05).

Since thymosin alpha 1 proved capable of accelerating natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity recovery in animals irradiated and reconstituted with symgenic marrow cells, we hypothesize that the synergistic effect between thymosin alpha 1 and IFN could result from the differentiation of natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> lines by thymosin alpha 1 which can then become sensitive to IFN.

Bone marrow and peripheral blood CD 56 (low) CD 16 (low) natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> compared with CD 56 (low) CD 16 (high) natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> express lower levels of killer inhibitory receptors, higher levels of CD 27, CD 127, CD 122, CD 25, but undetectable levels of CD 57, suggesting that they have a higher proliferative and differentiation potential.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity and the possible role of beta- endorphin in a natural model of autoimmune orchitis, the dark mink. An assay was developed to study natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in the mink and base-line levels of activity in this specie were determined. Natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was assessed in fertile mutation mink, primary infertile dark mink and secondary infertile Utah dark mink with autoimmune orchitis. The study included three sampling times: November, March and April. Natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity was significantly lower in mink studied in April than it was in. mink studied in March or November, and there was a significant correlation of activity to fertility. The addition of beta-endorphin to natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> cultures had no effect on activity. A preliminary study was done to determine concentration levels of beta-endorphin in mink plasma, pituitary, hypothalamus and testes. Measurable amounts were found in all tissue types studied. Although the number of samples was too limited to draw significant conclusions, there appears to be a trend toward lower beta-endorphin concentration, in pituitary tissue and plasma samples, of mink with autoimmune orchitis. Beta-endorphin levels did not appear to correlate with natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity in the mink. Two assays, the natural killer assay and the blasto-genesis assay, were used to insure that the beta-endorphin preparation used in this study were active. Natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity had been reported to be enhanced by the addition of beta-endorphin. In the present study natural <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activity of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was enhanced in the presence of betaendorphin, suggesting that the peptide was active. In addition, the blastogenic response of human PBMC was enhanced by the addition of beta-endorphin to cultures in the present study...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: CD 8 (+) T-lymphocytes, natural <b>killer</b> T-like <b>cells</b> (NKT-like cells, CD 56 (+) CD 3 (+)) {{and natural}} <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> (NK cells, CD 56 (+) CD 3 (-)) {{are the three}} main classes of human <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> and they are implicated in the {{pathogenesis}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Activation of these cells can initiate immune responses by virtue of their production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that cause lung tissue damage, mucus hypersecretion and emphysema. The objective of the current study was to investigate the activation levels of human <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers, ex-smokers with COPD and current smokers with COPD, in both peripheral blood and induced sputum. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After informed consent, 124 participants were recruited into the study and peripheral blood or induced sputum was taken. The activation states and receptor expression of <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> were measured by flow cytometry. In peripheral blood, current smokers, regardless of disease state, have the highest proportion of activated CD 8 (+) T-lymphocytes, NKT-like cells and NK cells compared with ex-smokers with COPD and healthy non-smokers. Furthermore, CD 8 (+) T-lymphocyte and NK cell activation is positively correlated with the number of cigarettes currently smoked. Conversely, in induced sputum, the proportion of activated <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> was related to disease state rather than current smoking status, with current and ex-smokers with COPD having significantly higher rates of activation than healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: A differential effect in systemic and lung activation of <b>killer</b> <b>cells</b> in COPD is evident. Systemic activation appears to be related to current smoking whereas lung activation is related to {{the presence or absence of}} COPD, irrespective of current smoking status. These findings suggest that modulating <b>killer</b> <b>cell</b> activation may be a new target for the treatment of COPD...|$|R
