25|$|D {{note that}} the {{internal}} energy, , of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume {{to the number of}} particles in the volume). This is because there is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends to smear out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> negative ions and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Complete and {{correctly}} copied texts {{would usually}} be immediately placed in use and thus usually would wear out fairly quickly, requiring repeated recopying. Further, because manuscript copying was highly costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods, a manuscript might only be made when commissioned, {{in which case}} the size of the parchment, script used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost), whether it was one book or a collection of several, etc. would be determined by the one commissioning the work. The idea of stocking extra copies would probably have been considered at best wasteful and unnecessary since the form and presentation of a manuscript were more often than not customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.

25|$|There {{are other}} {{theories}} regarding this final scene, however.

Schlueter argues that the play provides possible evidence it was written to be performed and viewed primarily by a young audience, and as such, to be staged at university theatres, as opposed to public playhouses. Such an audience would be more predisposed to accepting the farcical nature of the scene, and <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> humorous the absurdity of Valentine's gift. As such, in Schlueter's theory, the scene does represent what it appears to represent; Valentine does give Silvia to her would-be rapist, but it is done purely for comic effect.|$|E

40|$|Dominant {{narratives}} of creativity regularly expect female-associated forms of creativity to be provisioned naturally without {{need for the}} economic incentives provided by exclusive rights, just like housework and childcare. Even as the concept of Romantic authorship has come under sustained analytic assault, its challengers often look elsewhere–to the kinds of creativity in which men are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> participate–to <b>find</b> models of situated, always-influenced authorship. In this chapter, I examine one variant of the problem, in which certain arguments about copyright discount the value of forms that are predominantly produced and enjoyed by women. But creative works in these oft-denigrated genres, such as media fandom, open up new possibilities in sexual and gender relations, and women learn {{to see themselves as}} valuable speakers by becoming creators. As a result, increasing the visibility of women’s creative works, including explicitly transformative works based on specific copyrighted predecessors, {{is an important part of}} rejecting the fetishization of Romantic authorship and valuing diverse kinds of creativity...|$|R

Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the death of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that data analyses have been selective and misleading, and that the evidence for copycat suicides are much less consistent than suggested by some researchers.|$|E
500|$|The {{quantity}} {{of the work}} taken is also taken into account. If the infringer uses the majority of a copyrighted work, or all of it, they reduce the expected returns of the copyright owner and compromise [...] "the role that copyright plays in encouraging creativity". As such, the fair dealing defence usually only applies when part of a work has been taken, although some judicial comments, {{such as those of}} Megaw LJ in Hubbard, state that there are a few cases in which the work is so short that reproducing it in its entirety may be acceptable. The use made of the work is another factor; if the infringer takes a copyrighted work and reorganises or reinterprets it, the courts are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that the dealing qualifies as fair than if the work is simply reproduced without modification or analysis.

As an overview to consumption related to chronic disease and obesity, the World Health Organization's independent meta-studies specifically distinguish free sugars ("all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices") from sugars occurring naturally in food. The reports prior to 2000 set the limits for free sugars at a maximum of 10% of carbohydrate intake, measured by energy, rather than mass, and since 2002 have aimed for a level across the entire population of less than 10%. The consultation committee recognized that this goal is [...] "controversial. However, the Consultation considered that the studies showing no effect of free sugars on excess weight have limitations".

Levine cited that his reason for this was that [...] "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out to do very well, but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music".

This approach has attracted criticism. Former BBRC chairman Ian Wallace and others have written about the subject in Birdwatch magazine. Wallace believes that the committee has a blacklist of observers, from whom it automatically rejects records unless there are other observers able to corroborate the sighting. He mentions two specific observers, both of whom live in remote parts of northern Scotland. Ken Shaw, a former BBRC member, has claimed that BBRC would not accept a single-observer record of a species new to Britain without photographic evidence, regardless of the track record of the observer. Graham Bell, another former member, writing in response to Shaw's article, has accused the committee of adopted unfounded suspicions, arguing that just because a competent observer moves to an underwatched part of the country, their abilities do not change. One of the observers who Wallace claimed was blacklisted, Alan Vittery, also contributed to the debate, stating that he had been informed by the BBRC that they would not consider any single-observer record he submitted, unless supported by a photograph. Vittery contrasted the BBRC's attitude with that of other national rarities committees, arguing that the result of the approach is to distort rarity statistics. Vittery invited the BBRC to reply in public, but this request was declined.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} {{renovation}} decisions to be framed as a decision process that originates {{in everyday life}} at home. Based on interviews with homeowners prior to and following major home renovations, renovation decisions are conceptualised as emerging from six background conditions of domestic life. The conditions range from balancing competing commitments to the physicality of living. The paper then sets out how each condition can be empirically substantiated in large samples using standardised measurement items. A nationally representative UK homeowner survey (n= 1028) is used to test this “scaling up and out” approach for explaining why some homeowners decide to renovate whereas others do not. Self-selection and sampling biases are addressed by comparing homeowners not considering renovations with homeowners deciding about renovations. Homeowners in the renovation decision process are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> (i) <b>find</b> differences between their and others’ homes unsettling, (ii) face competing commitments {{with the use of}} space at home, (iii) find ideas and inspiration for the home from external sources.

However, the α parameter seems decisive in how sensitive Ueda’s method becomes. Specifically, the smaller this shape parameter, the <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> it is that the method detects outliers. When α is large, the method detects very few outliers. This result is due to the somewhat bell-shap of the resulting distribution when α is large. However, {{it is worth noting that}} the effect of the shape parameter stresses as n increases (note R when 2 <α< 6 and n= 10 as compared to the same α range when n= 500). In the case of the two-parameter Weibull distribution, there is a tendency for the Ueda’s method <b>to</b> <b>find</b> less outliers as the sample size increases.

2500|$|These {{inconsistent}} {{results have}} led researchers to propose novel theories {{that attempt to}} explain the sex differences observed in certain studies.One theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories.

For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these [...] "individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles". [...] Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy.
