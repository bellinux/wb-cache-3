60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> evidently {{struck by}} the haggard look upon the other's face.|$|E
60|$|Are you {{quite sure}} that she knew whether <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> aware of her share in the matter?' said Anne.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> gone {{not over}} ten minutes, yet the wait seemed an age. He {{returned}} with a brightened face.|$|E
6000|$|... 4. Some epicures are ungenerous; [...] All <b>my</b> <b>uncles</b> <b>are</b> generous. [...] <b>My</b> <b>uncles</b> <b>are</b> not epicures. [...] pg108 5. Gold is heavy; [...] Nothing but gold will silence him. [...] Nothing {{light will}} silence him.|$|R
60|$|VARINKA. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> {{receiving}} {{you with}} unusual civility, Captain. He has just kicked a general downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Philip; 'when old Sir Guy {{made it an}} especial {{point that}} my father should take the guardianship, he only consented on {{condition}} that <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> should <b>be</b> joined with him; so now <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> alone in the trust, and I cannot help thinking something must have happened at Redclyffe. It is certainly not Sir Guy's writing.' ...|$|R
60|$|We were breakfasting {{together}} in the big window bay at Lady Grove that looks upon the iris beds; <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> in London.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have heard}} bad news. My {{father and my}} uncle were {{attacked}} by some man who tried to ransack the house. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> seriously hurt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think that}} <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> poisoned?" [...] Hilda exclaimed {{in a tone}} of horror, while Netta started to her feet with clenched hands and flushed face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I heard <b>my</b> <b>uncle,</b> in Parliament Street, say, {{that when}} a chap has got any infested {{interest}} in a thing, they can't turn him out,' said Corkscrew; 'and <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> a parliamentary agent.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>My</b> <b>Uncle</b> <b>is</b> a Hunkle, Says Clarice Bean - {{picture book}} - Clarice's parents have gone away {{and she is}} looked after by her Uncle.|$|R
6000|$|... "All I {{can tell}} you," [...] said Morris, with a harsh laugh, [...] "is {{that the whole}} thing's impossible. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> at Bournemouth, unable to move." ...|$|R
60|$|That {{letter to}} <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> the nadir of my failure. Its {{remarkable}} consequences, which ended my student days altogether, I will tell {{in the next}} chapter.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> too enraged to pay {{attention}} to my words. He hurled the chair aside and sprang upon me as a wild beast springs upon its prey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Did you, indeed. You did {{not know}} that my aunt Holmby is my mother's sister? She kindly took me when <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> ordered to spend this winter abroad.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And we won't race, good cousin," [...] said Lizzie, [...] "for <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> to {{ride with}} me, and you know he is not fond of going very fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> in Scot----" [...] Pen {{was going}} to break out, but Warrington pressed his foot under the table as a signal {{for him to be}} quiet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{repeated}} all her own three; Jock adding [...] "Father {{would have}} known {{it as soon as}} you, and I don't see that <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> much worse." ...|$|R
60|$|At this reply <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> very angry. He {{wanted to}} let loose a flood of bad temper, but did not dare {{to do so in}} that public place.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} the {{interview}} <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> very weak. The doctor was called in and he revived him, but it was not for long. He died at sundown.|$|E
60|$|Beyond a doubt <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> {{in league}} with Captain Hannock, and the two were engaged in as big a piece of villainy as had ever come to my notice.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, Blanche was {{not quite}} {{satisfied}} with Sir Patrick's reply. She appealed to her husband. [...] "There is something wrong," [...] she said--"and <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> hiding it from me." ...|$|R
50|$|But above {{anything}} I was an Aramaean. It is {{no wonder}} that <b>my</b> <b>uncles</b> <b>were</b> Byzantines, and that I was a Hijazi child coddled by Umar and Sophronius when Jerusalem was opened.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fairish. Well, now, see {{and clean}} these {{military}} boots of mine. I'll cock my foot {{up on this}} bench. This pigsty of <b>my</b> <b>uncle's</b> <b>is</b> not fit for a soldier to come into.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> greatly astonished, and {{he finally}} persuaded me to tell my story. When I had {{concluded}} {{he asked me to}} call up Mr. Mason, and I did so.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> humanely {{anxious to}} get Harrison to bed as soon as possible, for the smith, {{although}} he laughed at his own injuries, had none the less been severely punished.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> evidently relieved. I {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} of making my confession, and taking the whole blame on myself. Lady Claudia stopped me with the perfect grace of which she was mistress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Miss Wardour," [...] he said, [...] "do {{not make}} {{yourself}} uneasy; <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> coming immediately, and I am sure {{he will find}} some way to clear the house of these rascals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The end of it! How can I say? <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> an old man,--very old, very infirm, very good, very prejudiced, and broken-hearted {{because his}} own son, who died, married against his will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a {{very short}} time ago," [...] she told him, [...] "I was {{wondering}} what you were doing. You know that <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> expecting to see or hear from you this afternoon?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> in a rage, {{but he did}} {{not know}} what to do. Now that I had some one to stand by me, I no longer felt the alarm I had when alone.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> {{too busy}} to devote any time to the dog {{for the next day}} or so, and all that could be done was to keep the animal {{carefully}} confined to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Some, naturally. You don't climb {{mountains}} always without accidents. There was one {{the first}} time anyone ever made the ascent of the Piz Margatsch. That was fifty years ago. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>was</b> killed in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alick is no judge! He is {{the child}} of the house, and <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> and Mr. Lifford don't feel {{complete}} without him. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> as fond of me as can be, and he and I could get on beautifully, but then Mr. Lifford is impracticable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do wish," [...] she persisted, [...] "that {{you would}} try and see {{things a little}} more humanly. <b>My</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> full of enthusiasms about you. You have had some {{conversation}} already, haven't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall {{we go now}} {{and hear}} what the scoring says? Every {{one is going to}} the other end now--shall we join them? I think <b>my</b> <b>uncle</b> <b>is</b> looking toward me. He perhaps wants me." ...|$|R
