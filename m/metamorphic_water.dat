The worldwide interest in – and understanding of – fluid flow in relation to various geological processes have advanced rapidly, especially since the early 1990 ’s (Bethke 1985, 1989; Doligez, 1987; Garven, 1985; Hubbert, 1953; Tóth, 1980, 1987; and since 1990 : Al-Aasm et al., 2002; Bredehoeft & Norton, 1990; Dahlberg, 1994; Garven, 1995; Ingebritsen & Sanford, 1998; Jamtveit & Yardley, 1997; Law et al., 1998; Lerche & Thomsen, 1994; Mc- Caffrey et al., 1999; Mitchell & Grauls, 1998; Parnell, 1994, 1998; Pueyo et al., 2000;Van Balen, 1995;Verweij, 1993).

In {{order to determine the}} origin of fluids and carbon existing in zinc carbonate minerals in Chah-Talkh 18 13 deposit, initially the amounts of changes of O SMOW and CPDBin various zinc minerals in important deposits of Iran and the world were studied and then by comparing these values in Chah-Talkh deposit with other deposits, the origin of fluids responsible for the ore forming, carbon and formation temperature of Chah-Talkh 18 deposit was determined. The range of changes of OSMOWin smithsonite mineral in non-sulfide lead and 18 zinc deposits varies from 18. 3 to 31. 6 per mil and OSMOWin hydrozincite mineral varies from 7. 8 to 27 per mil. Due to the impossibility of smithsonite sampling from Chah-Talkh deposit (due to being fine-grained and dispersed), hydrozincite minerals which have high isotopic similarities with smithsonite are used for isotopic 18 analysis of carbon and oxygen. The range of changes of O SMOW in hydrozincite mineral of Chah-Talkh deposit varies from 7. 8 to 15. 15 per mil which places in the domain of <b>metamorphic</b> <b>water.</b> The extensiveness of 18 OSMOWchanges in Chah-Talkh indicates the role of at least two fluids in the formation of nonsulfide minerals.

Four stages of ore paragenesis are identified, demonstrating mineral assemblages of ankerite–quartz–albite, quartz–albite–pyrite–ankerite, pyrite–calcite–quartz, and fluorite–dickite–gypsum, respectively. Fluid inclusions hosted in stages I, II, and III hydrothermal minerals yield homogeneous temperatures of 300 – 463 °C, 220 – 340 °C and 100 – 279 °C, with salinities lower than 22. 7 wt% NaCl equiv. Trapping pressures estimated from CO 2 –H 2 O fluid inclusions show a gradual decrease from 100 – 170 MPa (KT 8 ore body) to 17 – 55 MPa (KT 2 ore body), corresponding to mineralization depths from 3. 8 – 6. 4 km (KT 8) to 0. 6 – 2. 1 km (KT 2). Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic data suggest that the ore-forming fluids evolved from <b>metamorphic</b> <b>water</b> to magmatic water, and lately meteoric water. Sulfur and carbon isotope compositions show that these fluids might have originated from interaction with the host rocks with minor additional magmatic source. Based on geochemical investigations, with combination of regional and ore deposit geology, a possible genetic model with a three-step ore-forming process is proposed. The Devonian Xinghongpu sedimentary rocks are characterized by a relatively high gold content, which might provide the initial gold source. Linear folds and faults formed during Triassic orogenic processes provided the subsequent pathways for ore-forming fluids and suitable space for gold mineralization. Postorogenic magmatic activity induced voluminous hydrothermal fluids that mixed with the basinal fluids and may have started the ore formation process. Over pressure led to hydrofracturing and the subsequent pressure drop promoted fluid boiling, which in turn resulted in abundant gold deposition. Induced by postorogenic magmatic hydrothermal activity, the Shuangwang gold deposit is considered a special type of orogenic gold deposit formed in a compression–extension transition...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to marshal the {{evidence}} and try to build a case that (1) shallow (1 to 7 km) circulation of surface waters in the Earth's crust is an extremely widespread and common phenomenon in areas of igneous activity and (2) deep (10 to 15 km) circulation of surface waters can occur in certain favorable geological situations, particularly in rift zones and areas of extensional tectonics. It is shown that very large amounts of water may interact with the rocks in such zones and that this can take place at temperatures high enough for melting and metamorphism to occur. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope studies have proven to be very useful in establishing the characteristics of such deeply circulating hydrothermal systems and in determining the origins of the aqueous fluids involved in producing granitic and rhyolitic magmas in such environments. This is mainly because oxygen- 18 and deuterium are constituents of the H_ 2 O molecule itself, and thus stable isotope signatures are by far the best way to characterize hydrothermal fluids of different origins. These conclusions are most clear-cut when low- ^(18) O, low-D meteoric waters are involved in the isotopic exchange processes, but ocean waters, sedimentary formation <b>waters,</b> <b>metamorphic</b> dehydration <b>waters,</b> and magmatic waters can also be distinguished from each other in favorable circumstances. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{compressive}} events, deformation in sedimentary basins {{is mainly}} accommodated by thrust faulting and related fold growth. Thrust faults are generally {{rooted in the}} basement and may act as conduits or barriers for crustal fluid flow. Most of recent studies suggest that fluid flow through such discontinuities is not apparent and depends on the structural levels of the thrust within the fold-and-thrust belt. In order to constrain the paleofluid flow through the Jaca thrust-sheet-top basin (Paleogene southwest-Pyrenean fold-and-thrust belt) this study compares on different thrust faults located at different structural levels. The microstructures in the different fault zones studied are similar and consist of pervasive cleavage, calcite shear veins (SV 1), extension veins (EV 1) and late dilatation veins (EV 3). In order to constrain the nature and the source of fluids involved in fluid-rock interactions within fault zones, a geochemical approach, based on oxygen and carbon stable isotope and trace element compositions of calcite from different vein generations and host rocks was adopted. The results suggest a high complexity in the paleohydrological behaviors of thrust faults providing evidence for a fluid-flow compartmentalization within the basin. Previous studies {{in the southern part of}} the Axial Zone (North of the Jaca basin) indicates a circulation of deep <b>metamorphic</b> <b>water,</b> probably derived from the Paleozoic basement, along fault zones related to the major basement Gavarnie thrust. In contrast, in northern part of the Jaca basin, the Monte Perdido thrust fault is affected by a closed hydrological fluid system involving formation water during its activity. The Jaca and Cotiella thrust faults, in turn, both located more to the south in the basin, are characterized by a composite fluid flow system. Indeed, stable isotope and trace element compositions of the first generations of calcite veins suggest a relatively closed paleohydrological system, whereas the late calcite vein generations, which are probably associated with the late tectonic activity of the basin, support a contribution of both meteoric and marine waters. Based on these results, a schematic fluid-flow model is presented. This model allows visualization of three main fluid flow compartments along a N-S transect...|$|E

Application of phase equilibria has fixed the temperature of the primary stage of skarn formation between 550 -degrees-C to 625 -degrees-C. Similar applications indicate a larger range of temperature (525 -degrees-C to 300 -degrees-C) for the secondary stage. The different types of skarn (primary stage) are enriched in REE relative to the corresponding precursor rock (T. R. = 126 ppm (protolith) to 228 ppm (inner zone) for the skarn on gneisses; T. R. = 14 ppm to 71 ppm for the skarn on calcic hornfelses; T. R. = 12 ppm to 200 ppm for the skarn on dolomitic marbles), but all the inner zones of these different types of skarn show a similar REE distribution with a slight LREE fractionation and no Eu anomaly. It is inferred that the primary metasomatic fluid has a parallel REE pattern. The oxygen isotope composition of water in equilibrium with the early stage of skarn at T = 600 -degrees-C ranges from 8. 3 per mil to 8. 9 per mil. At the beginning of the first hydroxylation stage (secondary stage), the fluid delta O- 18 remains in the range observed in the primary stage but within it, there is a sharp decrease from 8. 0 per mil to 5. 0 per mil. During the sulphidation stage, the fluid delta O- 18 decreases more gradually from 5. 0 per mil to 3. 0 per mil. The I(Sr) of the early skarn silicates ranges from the values observed in the dolomitic marbles (0. 70874 to 0. 70971) to the I(Sr) of the intrusion (0. 70947 to 0. 71064). During the secondary stage, there is a progressive increase of the minerals I(Sr) up to 0. 71372. The REE pattern of the primary metasomatic fluid does not put any precise constraint on the primary fluid source. On the other hand, both stable and radiogenic isotopes suggest that the early high-temperature metasomatic fluid was isotopically equilibrated with the dioritic intrusion. This implies that this early fluid is either exsolved from the crystallizing intrusion or a <b>metamorphic</b> <b>water</b> previously equilibrated with the intrusion.

The mineralization is hosted in fractures (striking N 30 °E and dipping 78 °W) that were widened by dissolution. Chrysocolla mainly fills fractures. It has variable H 2 O contents but a Cu:Si ratio is always close to 1 : 1. Plancheite forms compact fissure fillings and aggregates of interlocking spherules. Copper is partially replaced by Mg (up to 2. 22 wt. % MgO), with small amounts of Na, K, Ca, Al and Fe also present. Dioptase occurs as prismatic crystals dominated by { 10 1 0 } and { 11 2 1 } that can reach over 2 cm in length, and also as granular fracture fillings. Unit-cell parameters are a 14. 5719 (6), c 7. 7799 (3) Å, V 1430. 7 (1) Å 3 ; refractive indices are ε = 1. 707 (3), ω = 1. 656 (3), with an anomalous small 2 V. Magnesium (up to 0. 15 wt. % MgO) is the only significant substituent. Yellow barite crystals tabular on { 001 } contain traces of Sr. Quartz occurs rarely, as drusy linings. A few cases of botryoidal, opal-like quartz crusts are known. Tenorite forms dark brown masses and stringers included in marble. Very scarce grains of copper sulfides (anilite altering to spionkopite and covellite along rims and cracks) are found scattered in the marble. Copper is partially replaced by Bi (≥ 0. 15 wt. % Bi) and Pb (≥ 0. 16 wt. % Pb). Malachite and brochantite are alteration products of sulfides. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the minerals precipitated from a single-phase fluid initially at a temperature above 300 °C that cooled to c. 220 °C. Salinity was very low, 0 to 2 wt. % NaCl eq. Isotopic analyses of calcite give d 13 C values of 0. 4 - 0. 9 ‰ PDB and d 18 O values of 17. 1 - 15. 1 ‰ VSMOW, coincident with the isotopic signature of the regional marbles.

40|$|Stable isotope and Ar- 40 /Ar- 39 measurements,were made on samples {{associated}} with a major tectonic discontinuity in the Helvetic Alps, the basal thrust of the Diablerets nappe (external zone of the Alpine Belt) {{in order to determine}} both the importance of fluids in this thrust zone and the timing of thrusting. A systematic decrease in the delta(18) O values (up to 6 parts per thousand) of calcite, quartz, and white mica exists within a 10 - to 70 -m-wide zone over a distance of 37 km along the thrust, and they become more pronounced toward the root of the nappe. A similar decrease in the delta(13) C values of calcite is observed only in the deepest sections (up to 3 parts per thousand). The delta D-SMOW (SMOW = standard mean ocean water) values of white mica are - 54 parts per thousand +/- 8 parts per thousand (n = 22) and are independent of the distance from the thrust. These variations are interpreted to reflect syntectonic solution reprecipitation during fluid passage along the thrust. The calculated delta(18) O and delta D values (versus SMOW) for the fluid in equilibrium with the analyzed minerals is 12 parts per thousand to 16 parts per thousand and - 30 parts per thousand to + 5 parts per thousand, respectively, for assumed temperatures of 250 to 450 degrees C. The isotopic and structural data are consistent with fluids derived from the deep-seated roots of the Helvetic nappes where large volumes of Mesozoic sediments were metamorphosed to the amphibolite facies, It is suggested that connate and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>waters,</b> overpressured by rapid tectonic burial in a subductive system escaped by upward infiltration along moderately dipping pathways until they reached the main shear zone {{at the base of the}} moving pile, where they were channeled toward the surface, This model also explains the mechanism by which large amounts of fluid were removed from the Mesozoic sediments during Alpine metamorphism. White mica Ar- 49 /Ar- 39 ages vary from 27 Ma far from the Diablerets thrust to 15 Ma along the thrust. An older component is observed in micas far from the thrust, interpreted as a detrital signature, and indicates that regional metamorphic temperatures were less than about 350 degrees C. The;plateau and near plateau ages nearest the thrust are consistent with either neocrystallization of white mica or argon loss by recrystallization during thrusting, which may have been enhanced in the zones of highest fluid flow.

Fluid {{inclusion}} {{analyses of}} quartz veins of various generations {{from the outer}} margin of the southern Gariep Belt reveal the presence of two chemically distinct fluid populations: the pre-orogenic, rift-related Rosh Pinah ore-forming fluid and the orogenic fluids. The oreforming fluid is more saline and chemically {{more complex than the}} orogenic fluids, probably representing hot, chemically evolved hypersaline brines induced by rift-related magmatism. Four generations (D₁/D₂, D₃, D₄ and D₅) of orogenic veins are recognised {{on the basis of their}} structural relationships. The orogenic fluids are chemically similar, dominantly aqueous and generally of moderate to low salinities (D₁/D₂>D₃>D₅) is developed within the orogenic fluids, with the exception of those fluids related to the emplacement of the Kuboos Pluton, which yielded the highest temperatures. The D₁/D₂ fluids from the northern and Vanrhynsdorp areas were hotter than the fluids from the central area, whereas the D₃ and D₅ fluids exhibit no apparent temperature variation as a function of area. D₄ fluids show a decrease in temperature further away from the pluton. Estimates of the maximum metamorphic pressure recorded in the outer margin of the belt have been further constrained, using microthermometry results in conjunction with mineral assemblages, to 2. 9 - 3. 6 kbar, 2. 9 - 3. 1 kbar and 1. 8 - 3. 1 kbar for the northern, central and Vanrhynsdorp areas, respectively. Field observations and fluid inclusion analyses suggest channeled fluid flow on a regional rather than on an intra-formational scale, even though a rock-buffered system is suggested by oxygen isotope results. A different, largely rock-dominated fluid system was developed within the relatively impermeable carbonate units compared with the fluid system developed within the rest of the outer margin of the belt. The D₁/D₂ fluids probably represent circulating formation and <b>metamorphic</b> <b>waters</b> that were advectively forced out of the orogen and into the foreland, whereas channeled meteoric fluid flow most likely dominated during the transtensive phase of the orogeny. The D₄ fluids probably contain a magmatic component, in addition to the meteoric component. Comparisons between the ore-forming fluid and the orogenic fluids indicate that the latter have neither the required salinities, nor the required chemistry necessary in order to transport sufficient metals to produce a massive sulphide deposit the size of Rosh Pinah. The chemistry of the orogenic fluids are, however, similar to those associated with gold remobilisation and as such the potential for gold mineralisation related to these orogenic fluids should not be ruled out. Base metal sulphide exploration within the outer margin of the belt should be confined to rocks of the Hilda Subgroup.

However, in the field, thermal aureoles are often significantly thinner or wider than predicted by simple thermal models. Numerical models show that thermal aureoles are wider if the heat transfer in the magma is faster than {{in the country}} rock due to contrasts in thermal diffusivities or the effect of magma convection. Large thermal aureoles can also be caused by repeated injection close to the contact. Aureoles are thin when heat transfer in the country rock is faster than heat transfer within the magma or in case of incrementally, slowly emplaced magma. Absorption of latent heat due to <b>metamorphic</b> reactions or <b>water</b> volatilization also affects thermal aureoles but to a lesser extent. The way these parameters affect the thickness of a thermal aureole depends on the isotherm under consideration, hence on which metamorphic phase is used to draw the limit of the aureole. Thermal aureoles provide insight on the dynamics of intrusions emplacement. Although available examples are limited, asymmetric aureoles point to magma emplacement by over-accretion for mafic cases and by under-accretion for felsic cases, consistent with geochronological data...|$|R
40|$|Four definable feeding {{behaviors}} {{used during}} the metamorphic life history of tiger salamanders are terrestrial prey capture and transport (as adults) and aquatic prey capture and transport (as larvae). Previous studies have focused primarily on the first three of these behaviors and thus aquatic prey transport is poorly understood. These {{studies have indicated that}} terrestrial prey capture has unique kinematic and motor patterns, whereas the other behaviors are quite similar to one another. Using high-speed video analysis, the kinematics of aquatic prey transport in larval Ambystoma tigrinum are described using both lateral and ventral views. These kinematic patterns are statistically compared with the kinematic patterns of aquatic prey capture, terrestrial prey capture and terrestrial prey transport. Statistical analyses allow us to assess the similarities and differences among the four behaviors and to determine the effect of the <b>metamorphic</b> environmental transition (<b>water</b> to land) and morphological changes of the feeding mechanism (suction- to lingual-based) on feeding kinematics. Our data do not support the notion that lingual-based terrestrial prey capture uses unique kinematic patterns compared with the other three behaviors, which consist of similar movements. Rather, each of the feeding behaviors has unique kinematic features that distinguish it from the others. In addition, variation in tiger salamander feeding kinematics is more a function of the feeding event (whether it is capture or transport) than of the environment in which the feeding takes place or the morphology of the feeding mechanism. Finally, we encourage the use of parsimony-based methods of phylogenetic analysis to analyze shared traits (such as kinematic and/or electromyographic variables) in comparative studies of behavior within a single species...|$|R
40|$|Subduction {{zones are}} {{the place in}} the world where fluids are transported from the {{foredeep}} to the mantle and back-to-the-surface in the back-arc. The subduction of an oceanic plate implies the transportation of the oceanic crust to depth and its methamorphization. Oceanic sediments release water in the (relatively) shallower part of the subduction zone, while dehydration of the subducted basaltic crust allows fluid circulation at larger depths. While the water budget in oceanic subduction has been deeply investigated, less attention has been given to the fluids implied in the subduction of a continental margin (i. e. in continental subduction). In this study, we use teleseismic receiver function (RF) analysis to image the process of water migration at depth, from the subducting plate to the mantle wedge, under the Northern Apennines (NAP, Italy). Harmonic decomposition of the RF data-set is used to constrain both isotropic and anisotropic structures. Isotropic structures highlight the subduction of the Adriatic lower crust under the NAP orogens, from 35 – 40 km to 65 km depth, as a dipping low S-velocity layer. Anisotropic structures indicate the presence of a broad anisotropic zone (anisotropy as high as 7 %). This zone develops in the subducted Adriatic lower crust and mantle wedge, between 45 and 65 km depth, directly beneath the orogens and the more recent back-arc extensional basin. The anisotropy is related to the metamorphism of the Adriatic lower crust (gabbro to blueschists) and its consequent eclogitization (blueschists to eclogite). The second <b>metamorphic</b> phase releases <b>water</b> directly in the mantle wedge, hydrating the back-arc upper mantle. The fluid migration process imaged in this study below the northern Apennines could be a proxy for understanding other regions of ongoing continental subduction...|$|R

Granitic {{transport and}} emplacement [...] 6. Conclusion. The Moonbi Adamellite is a Permo-Triassic 'I'-type pluton which has intruded {{into the upper}} crust in the New England Orogen, N. S. W. The wall rocks covered in this study make up part of the Tamworth Terrane. They consist of argillites, arenites, conglomerates and limestones. The limestones have been separated into autochthonous or allochthonous deposits. The mafic igneous rocks {{are considered to be}} intrusive. They include an as yet unrecognised intrusion: the Oaky Creek andesite, which is found {{to the north of the}} Tamworth area. [...] Contact metamorphism has been recognized within an aureole 3 - 4 kms wide. Rocks of the upper hornblende hornfels fades are found at the highest grades along the contact. The biotite isograd was seen as the boundary between the contact metamorphic rocks and the regional Tamworth Terrane. The regional geology in the Tamworth Terrane indicates a confining pressure of approximately 1 kbar at the time of emplacement of the adamellite. Prograde metamorphic assemblages indicate that the contact <b>metamorphic</b> fluids were <b>water</b> rich (XcO 2 < 0. 25). The source of the fluids is from prograde reactions and from meteoric water. The precursor magma rose through the crust as a water under-saturated magma. The magma is considered to have absorbed fluids from the contact rocks through fractures and permeable units. The water is hypothesised to have been then released through pegmatite dykes as the magma crystallised. [...] A model of transport and emplacement of the Moonbi Adamellite involves a twostage mechanism. Initial space was made through roof lifting along faults and fractures in the cold country rocks. Then as the rocks became hot and infiltrated by fluids they became susceptible to deformation as increasing magma joined the intrusion through a feeder dyke. This caused weak syn-intrusive deformation in the wall rocks. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 98 pages illustrations (some colour), map...|$|R
40|$|The Mt Isa–McArthur {{region is}} renowned {{for a range}} of {{commodities}} and deposit types of world-class proportions. The region is described here {{in the context of a}} ‘mineral system,’ through consideration of processes that operate across a range of scales, from geodynamics and crustal architecture, to fluid sources, pathways, drivers and depositional processes. The objective is to improve targeting of Pb–Zn, Cu and Cu–Au deposits. Repeated extension and high heat flow characterise much of the history prior to 1640 Ma. The pre-Barramundi Orogeny (pre- 1. 87 Ga) metamorphic basement was the substrate on which a volcanic arc developed, focussed along the Kalkadoon-Leichhardt Belt. This is related to an inferred east-directed subduction between 1870 and 1850 Ma. From 1755 to 1640 Ma, three successive volcano-sedimentary basins developed, the Leichhardt, Calvert and Isa Superbasins, in an interpreted distal back-arc environment. The Isan Orogeny, from 1640 to 1490 Ma, overlapped with Isa Superbasin sedimentation, suggesting a transition from back-arc to a foreland basin setting. Most crustal thickening occurred in the Eastern Fold Belt, an area earlier characterised by thinned crust and deep marine environments. This region was deformed into nappe-like structures with high-temperature–low-pressure regional metamorphism and associated granites; the latter are absent from the Western Fold Belt. Metal deposition mainly occurred late in the history, with all known (and preserved) major base metal occurrences either hosted by Isa Superbasin rocks or formed during the Isan Orogeny. Earlier superbasins were potential fluid source regions. Sedimentary formation <b>waters,</b> <b>metamorphic</b> and magmatic fluids were present at prospect scale, while meteoric and possibly mantle sources are also implicated. The spatial distribution of metallogenic associations (i. e. iron oxide–copper–gold, Pb–Zn–Ag, U, Au) across the inlier may result from differences in the geodynamic make-up and evolution of the pre- 1. 87 Ga tectonic elements. Penetrative faults are interpreted as predominantly steeply dipping and to have acted as pathways for fluids, both in extension and compression. Fluid mixing was a potentially significant ore deposit control. Examples are drawn from the Ernest Henry iron oxide–copper–gold-related hydrothermal breccias in the east and from the Mt Isa Copper deposit in the west. Stress switching during late-stage deformation appears to have triggered a fluid mixing event that led to formation of the major copper deposits...|$|R
40|$|Marble-hosted ruby {{deposits}} {{represent the}} most important source of colored gemstones from Central and South East Asia. These deposits {{are located in the}} Himalayan mountain belt which developed during Tertiary collision of the Indian plate northward into the Eurasian plate. They are spatially related to granitoid intrusions and are contained in platform carbonates series that underwent high-grade meta morph ism. All occurrences are located close to major tectonic features formed during Himalayan orogenesis, directly in suture zones in the Himalayas, or in shear zones that guided extrusion of the Indochina block after the collision in South East Asia. Ar-Ar dating of micas syngenetic with ruby and U-Pb dating of zircon included in ruby gives evidence that these deposits formed during Himalayan orogenesis, and the ages document the extensional tectonics that were active, from Afghanistan to Vietnam, between the Oligocene and the Pliocene. The petrography shows that ruby-bearing marbles formed in the amphibolite facies (T= 610 to 790 degrees C and P- 6 kbar). A fluid inclusion Study defines the conditions of gem ruby formation during the retrograde metamorphic path (620 <T< 670 degrees C and 2. 6 <P< 3. 3 kbar) for the deposits of Jegdalek, Hunza and northern Vietnam. Whole rock analyses of non-ruby-bearing marbles indicate that they contain enough aluminum and chromiferous elements to produce all the ruby crystals that they contain. In addition, (C, O) -isotopic analyses of carbonates from the marbles lead {{to the conclusion that the}} marbles acted as a metamorphic closed fluid system that were not infiltrated by externally-derived fluids. The carbon isotopic composition of graphite in marbles reveals that it is of organic origin and that it exchanged C-isotopes with the carbonates during metamorphism. Moreover, the O-isotopic composition Of ruby was buffered by metamorphic CO 2 released during devolatilisation of marble and the H-isotopic composition of mica is consistent with a <b>metamorphic</b> origin for <b>water</b> in equilibrium with the micas. The (C, 0, H) -isotopic compositions of minerals associated with marble-hosted ruby are all in agreement with the hypothesis, drawn from the unusual chemistry of CO 2 -H 2 S-COS-S- 8 -AlO(OH) -bearing fluids contained in fluid inclusions, that gem ruby formed at P- 3 kbar and 620 <T< 670 degrees C, during thermal reduction of evaporite by organic matter, at high temperature-medium pressure metamorphism of platform carbonates during the Tertiary India-Asia collision, The carbonates were enriched in Al- and chromiferous-bearing detrital minerals, such as clay minerals that were deposited on the platform with the carbonates, and in organic matter. Ruby formed during the retrograde metamorphic path, mainly by destabilization of muscovite or spinel. The metamorphic fluid system was rich in CO 2 released from devolatilisation Of Carbonates, and in fluorine, chlorine and boron released by molten salts (NaCl, KCl, CaSO 4). Evaporites are key to explaining the formation of these deposits. Molten salts mobilized in situ Al and metal transition elements contained in marbles, leading to crystallization Of ruby...|$|R
40|$|The western Qinling, {{belonging}} to {{the western part of}} the Qinling–Dabie–Sulu orogen between the North China Block and South China Block, is one of the most important gold regions in China. Isotopic dates suggest that the Mesozoic granitoids in the western Qinling region emplaced during the Middle-Late Triassic, and the deposits formed during the Late Triassic. Almost all gold deposits in the western Qinling region are classified as orogenic, Carlin-type, and Carlin-like gold deposits, and they are the products of Qinling Orogenesis caused by the final collision between the North China Block and the South China Block. The early subduction of the Mian-Lue oceanic crust and the latter collision between South Qinling Terrane and the South China Block along the Mian-Lue suture generated lithosphere-scale thermal anomalies to drive orogen-scale hydrothermal systems. The collision-related magmatism also provided heat source for regional ore-forming fluids in the Carlin-like gold deposits. Orogenic gold deposits such as Huachanggou, Liziyuan, and Baguamiao lie between the Shang-Dan and Mian-Lue sutures and are confined to WNW-trending brittle-ductile shear zones in Devonian and Carboniferous greenschist-facies metasedimentary rocks that were highly-deformed and regionally-metamorphosed. These deposits are typical orogenic gold deposits and formed within a Late Triassic age. The deposits show a close relationship between Au and Ag. Ores contain mainly microscopic gold, and minor electrum and visible gold, along with pyrite. The ore-forming fluids were main metamorphic fluids. Intensive tectonic movements caused by orogenesis created fluid-migrating channels for precipitation locations. Although some orogenic gold deposits occur adjacent to granitoids, mineralization is not synchronous with magmatism; that is, the granitoids have no genetic relations to orogenic gold deposits. As ore-forming fluids converged into dilated fractures during the extension stage of orogenesis, changes of physico-chemical conditions resulted in fluid immiscibility that played a key role in gold and sulfide deposition. The geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of the Carlin-type deposits in the western Qinling region are similar to those in the Carlin trend, Nevada, USA. Gold deposits such as La’erma and Jinlongshan occur mostly in the southeastern margin of the western Qinling regionic region whereas some deposits occur in its eastern part. These deposits are hosted in slightly metamorphosed Cambrian to Triassic sedimentary rocks, showing structurally- and stratigraphically-controlled features. The deposits mainly contain submicroscopic and microscopic gold in arsenian pyrite and arsenopyrite, with characteristic ore-forming elements of Au–As–Sb–Ba. The ore-forming fluids are early-stocked formation water and later-recharged meteoric water. Meteoric water apparently evolved in ore-forming fluids by circulation, indicating the extensional setting, and led to the deposition of Au and other elements in cool reactive permeable rocks at shallow levels, forming the disseminated ores. Carlin-like gold deposits occur between the Shang-Dan suture and the Fengxian-Zhen’an fault. The host rocks are mainly sedimentary rocks that underwent reconstruction through reworking by structural metamorphism. These deposits are structurally controlled by brittle-ductile shear zone and occur adjacent to granitoid plutons. The most important characteristic that differ to the orogenic and Carlin-type gold deposits is the genetic relationship with the synchronous magmatism. Gold occurs mainly as microscopic gold. Pyrite and arsenian pyrite can be recognized as gold-bearing minerals. The ore-forming fluids are main magmatic <b>water</b> mixed with <b>metamorphic</b> and/or formation <b>water.</b> Similar to orogenic gold deposits, fluid immiscibility caused the deposition of gold Carlin-like gold deposits...|$|R

Lizardite-chrysotile serpentines in alpine ultramafic bodies from North America show latitudinal variations in [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] which indicate that meteoric ground waters were important in their formation. In per mil relative to SMOW they exhibit the following geographic variations in [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], respectively: British Columbia - 205 to - 150, 1. 9 to 8. 2; Washington-Oregon - 142 to - 107; 4. 1 to 8. 0; California - 108 to - 82, 6. 6 to 8. 8; Caribbean-Central America - 97 to - 59, 3. 3 to 8. 7. The [ [...] . ]-latitude correlation is exceedingly good, but the [ [...] . ]-values {{appear to be}} in large part dependent upon the [ [...] . ] of the country rock. This suggests that the waters involved in serpentinization had previously exchanged [ [...] . ] with these country rocks. For example, the Cassiar, British Columbia, serpentinite body has [ [...] . ]- 195 to - 162 and [ [...] . ] = 8. 0 to 8. 2, whereas the serpentines in zoned ultramafic bodies of SE Alaska have [ [...] . ] = - 127 to - 140, [ [...] . ] = - 5. 0 to - 1. 6; the former body lies in a terrane of abundant [ [...] . ]-rich limestones, whereas the zoned bodies are surrounded by low-[ [...] . ] igneous rocks. All antigorites, irrespective of geographic location, have very uniform isotopic compositions ([ [...] . ] = - 66 to - 39, [ [...] . ] = 4. 7 to 8. 8). This is practically identical to the range exhibited by metamorphic chlorites,. indicating, that a deep-seated or <b>metamorphic</b> type <b>water</b> was involved in. antigorite-type serpentinization. This isotopic uniformity further indicates that little or no isotopic exchange has occurred subsequent to formation of the antigorites, because many samples were collected from northerly regions where the ground waters are very low in [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. Five lizardite-chrysotile type serpentinites-from California, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic show oxygen isotope fractionations of 15. 1 to 12. 9 per mil between coexisting serpentine and magnetite ([ [...] . ] magnetite = - 7. 6 to - 4. 6 per mil relative to SMOW). Nine antigorites (mainly from Vermont and SE Pennsylvania) show distinctly smaller fractionations of 8. 7 to 4. 8 per mil ([ [...] . ] magnetite = - 2. 6 to + 1. 7 per mil). Two lizardite and chrysotile serpentinites dredged from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge exhibit fractionations of 10. 0 and 12. 5 per mil ([ [...] . ] magnetite - - 6. 8 and - 7. 9 per mil, respectively), whereas antigorite from this area shows a value of 8. 2 per mil ([ [...] . ] magnetite = - 6. 2). These data all clearly indicate that the antigorites formed at higher temperatures than the chrysotile-lizardites. Electron microprobe analyses of magnetites from the above samples show that they are chemically homogeneous and essentially pure [ [...] . ]. A few magnetite samples from serpentinites in near proximity to later granitic intrusions showa a wide variation of Cr content, and also give erratic oxygen isotopic results, suggesting non-equilibrium. A rough serpentine-magnetite geothermometer curve was constructed by extrapolation of (1) observed [ [...] . ]-values of chlorite and Fe-Ti oxides in low-grade pelitic schists whose isotopic temperatures are known from the quartz-muscovite geothermometer, and (2) estimates of the [ [...] . ] fractionation between chlorite and serpentine (assumed to be zero). This serpentine-magnetite geothermometer suggests approximate equilibrium temperatures as follows: continental lizardite-chrysotile, [ [...] . ]; oceanic lizardite and chrysotile, [ [...] . ], respectively; continental antigorites, [ [...] . ]; and oceanic antigorite, [ [...] . ]. The isotopic compositions of the waters involved in serpentinization of various ultramafic rocks have been estimated, utilizing the above "temperatures". These calculations indicate that most lizardite-chrysotile serpentinization probably involved exchanged meteoric waters, and thus must have occurred at relatively shallow levels in the earth's crust, consistent with the proposed isotopic "temperatures". However, this type of serpentinization is clearly not a weathering phenomenon taking place at the earth's surface. Isotopic evidence for such low temperature serpentinization ([ [...] . ] of + 11. 8 to + 12. 5) has been discovered only for several “deweylite" samples from Pennsylvania and Delaware. Serpentines from the ocean floor (Mid Atlantic Ridge, Puerto Rican trench, and Blanco Fracture zone in the Pacific ocean) form a unique isotopic grouping, with [ [...] . ] = - 68 to - 31, [ [...] . ] = + 0. 8 to + 6. 7. The waters that would have coexisted with these serpentines (at the temperatures inferred from serpentine-magnetite 018 fractionations) have calculated isotopic compositions that cluster around SMOW. This strongly suggests that ocean water is the major component of the waters responsible for sub-oceanic serpentinization. A few of the low-[ [...] . ] oceanic serpentines are, however, consistent with formation from magmatic waterocean water mixtures. No serpentines presently found in continental areas give any isotopic evidence of ever having been serpentinized in oceanic environments. This statement also applies to the serpentines in a typical ophiolite sequence, the Vourinos Complex, Greece. Serpentine from this body is unique, however, in that it exhibits remarkably large [ [...] . ] variation, from + 2. 1 to + 12. 7. All other bodies that were examined in detail were found to have very uniform isotopic compositions...|$|R
