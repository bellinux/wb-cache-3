First, through an online survey experiment, I study the impact of campaign messages and ideological cues on voters as they make inferences on candidates. Next, through a field experiment, I test whether <b>microtargeted</b> messages or general messages on the economy have any effect on turnout. Lastly, using online survey data, I examine how cross-pressured voters behave electorally when holding an opposing party's position on social issues. These three studies indicate that different messages do, in fact, matter. Furthermore, voters are not fools [...] they are reasoning and rational. While partisanship does continue to heavily impact voting decisions, voters do consider issue positions and different voting dimensions (i. e., social, economic, moral).

40|$|Social media offers new {{opportunities}} for politicians to mobilize and persuade a large pool of potential supporters, but also allows voters to select whose messages they get directly exposed to. Knowing the factors that make individuals more likely to follow particular politicians may help understand the communication strategies of politicians and also the effects of social media on political polarization. However, information about the offline attributes of individuals in social media is not directly observable. Using a unique database with survey data about the sociodemographic characteristics and political attitudes of 5, 580 Twitter users, we show that voters exposed to messages from the Members of Congress are more politically motivated and ideologically extreme {{than the rest of}} the Twitter users and that ideological distance between the user and the politician plays a major role in determining following behavior.

40|$|In {{radiation}} pressure dominated laser ion acceleration schemes, transverse target deformation and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) -like instability always develop quickly, break the acceleration structure, limit the final accelerated ion energy, {{and lower the}} beam quality. To overcome these issues, we propose a target design named dual parabola targets consisting of a lateral thick part and a middle thin part, each with a parabolic front surface of different focus positions. By using such a target, through interactive laser and target shaping processes, {{the central part of}} the thin target will detach from the whole target and a <b>microtarget</b> is formed. This enables the stable acceleration of {{the central part of the}} target to high energy with high quality since usual target deformation and RT-like instabilities with planar targets are suppressed. Furthermore, this target design reduces the laser intensity required to optimize {{radiation pressure}} acceleration by more than 1 order of magnitude compared to normal flat targets with similar thickness and density. Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations indicate that a quasimonoenergetic proton beam with peak energy over 200  MeV and energy spread around 2 % can be generated when such a solid target (with density 400 n_{c} and target thickness 0. 5 λ_{ 0 }) is irradiated by a 100  fs long circularly polarized laser pulse at focused intensity I_{L}∼ 9. 2 × 10 ^{ 21 }[*][*]W/cm^{ 2 }...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of sub-picosecond pulses of high intensity laser light with micron, and sub-micron scale objects is currently highly topical. These targets {{are in a}} size regime that is intermediate between atomic cluster targets (100 Angstrom) and macro- scopic solids which, unlike <b>microtargets,</b> {{have been the subject}} of many studies over recent years. Mass-limited objects can couple very strongly to an intense laser field due to transient plasma resonances or Mie scattering processes and absorb substan- tial amounts of laser energy. These targets off er a unique geometry and size that can potentially produce significantly higher x-ray photon energies than compared to interactions with bulk materials of the same atomic number, and under the same irradiation conditions. This thesis describes, for the first time, the design, construction and character- isation of a new class of in-vacuo optical levitation trap optimised for use in high- intensity, high-energy laser interaction experiments. The optical trapping of 10 micron oil droplets in vacuum was demonstrated, over time-scales of > 1 hour at extended distances of 40 mm from the final focusing optic. A high speed (10 kHz) optical imaging and signal acquisition system was implemented for tracking the levitated droplets position and dynamic behaviour under atmospheric and vacuum conditions, with 5 micron spatial resolution. The stability of the levitated droplet was such that it would stay in alignment with a 7 micron irradiating beam focal spot for up to 5 minutes without the need for re-adjustment. The performance of the trap was assessed in a series of trial high-intensity laser experiments using a hybrid optical parametric neodymiun:glass Chirped Pulse Am- plifi cation (CPA) laser system, with focused peak intensities in excess of 10 ^ 17 Wcm- 2. X-ray knife-edge measurements, using image plate, and single-hit CCD photon energy spectroscopy demonstrated the creation of a spatially symmetric, micron scale x-ray source (< 22 microns), with a measured two electron temperature distribution of between 0. 4 and 2. 3 keV. These relatively low values were thought to arise from low laser- plasma coupling efficiencies with the droplet, due to the high contrast of the laser system. Initial tests also demonstrated very low integrated RF signals produced from laser-droplet interactions, x 9 smaller than wire targets of comparable atomic com- position, highlighting the potential of this technique when extended to kJ, petawatt class lasers for use in probing of material science and high energy density plasma experiments.

5000|$|Media and Politics scholar Jayson Harsin in 2015 {{coined the}} term [...] "regime of post-truth" [...] that {{encompasses}} many aspects of post-truth politics. He argues that a convergent set of developments have created the conditions of post-truth society: the development of professional political communication informed by cognitive science, which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like <b>microtargeting</b> (which includes the strategic use of rumors and falsehoods); the fragmentation of modern more centralized mass news media gatekeepers that largely repeated one another's scoops and their reports; the fierce attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration, prolific user-generated content and fewer society-wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies, accurate and inaccurate; the algorithms that govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings, sometimes {{based on what the}} algorithm thinks users want and not on what is necessarily factual; and news media that has itself been marred by scandals of plagiarism, hoaxes, propaganda, and changing news values, all of which some scholars say issue from economic crises resulting in downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditionally tabloid stories and styles of reporting, known as tabloidization and infotainment. While some of these phenomena (such as a more tabloidesque press) may suggest a return to the past, the whole effect of the convergences creates a socio-political phenomenon that exceeds a mere return to earlier forms of journalism. It is not that truth and facts have disappeared but that they are the object of deliberate distortion and struggle. Fact-checking and rumor-busting sites abound, but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences (attention-wise) and their respective trustful-/distrustfulness. Since the condition is manipulated competitively by professional pan-partisan political communication, Harsin calls it a [...] "regime of post-truth" [...] instead of merely post-truth politics.|$|E
