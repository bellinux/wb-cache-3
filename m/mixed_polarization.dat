40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} {{a new twist}} on stereoscopic displays—one that has similarities to existing methods in that it utilizes both polarization and color to present different stereo 3 D perspectives to each eye, but by combining the use of polar-ization and color, it avoids weaknesses associated with previous methods. This new method is named <b>Mixed</b> <b>Polarization</b> 3 D. Color imbalance artifacts associated with anaglyph methods of 3 D are avoided by alternating the colors presented to each eye. Flicker, associated with polarization-sequential 3 D, or the need to increase the frame rate to at least 120 Hz to avoid this perceived flicker, is avoided in <b>mixed</b> <b>polarization</b> 3 D by presenting both eyes with 3 D information in every single frame. It is particularly aimed at use in scanned laser projectors where all three primary colors (R, G, B) are already polarized and simultaneously displayed.

40|$|Presented in {{this work}} is a {{modified}} geometric optics of smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium, which takes into account weak anisotropy introduced by inhomogeneity. Pointed out is the common nature of two fundamental phenomena: Berry’s geometrical phase and the optical Magnus effect, that is, propagation of rays of right and left circular polarization along different trajectories. Shown is that the former phenomenon {{can be explained by}} the difference in phase velocity of waves of right-hand and left-hand polarizations, while the latter one is the result of the difference in their group velocity.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess SAR compact polarimetry (CP) architectures based on <b>mixed</b> <b>polarization</b> basis measurements allowing for an implementation on satellite at reduced cost. The potential applications include Earth observation or planetary Science. The performance assessment both concerns the level of information preserved in comparison with full polarimetry (FP), and the concurrent space segment complexity. The CP architectures considered here address a mixed basis measurement where the transmitter polarization is either circular or orientated at 45 °, and the receivers are at horizontal and vertical polarizations. After a general overview of this CP concept, the paper focuses on a P band option, including FP information reconstruction from CP and assessment of Faraday effects. The FP information reconstruction is shown to perform well at P band (especially regarding the P band HV term which is a key parameter for biomass estimation), although calibration and Faraday corrections remain subjects for further studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves in isotropic dielectric media with local dispersion is studied {{under the assumption}} of small but nonvanishing λ/l, where λ is the wavelength, and l is the characteristic inhomogeneity scale. It is commonly known that, due to nonzero λ/l, such waves can experience polarization-driven bending of ray trajectories and polarization dynamics that {{can be interpreted as}} the precession of the wave "spin". The present work reports how Lagrangians describing these effects can be deduced, rather than guessed, within a strictly classical theory. In addition to the commonly known ray Lagrangian featuring the Berry connection, a simple alternative Lagrangian is proposed that naturally has a canonical form. The presented theory captures not only eigenray dynamics but also the dynamics of continuous wave fields and rays with <b>mixed</b> <b>polarization,</b> or "entangled" waves.
