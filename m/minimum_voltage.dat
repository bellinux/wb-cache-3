25|$|Rv {{provides}} a bias current {{for both the}} Zener diode and the transistor. The current in the diode is minimum when the load current is maximum. The circuit designer must choose a <b>minimum</b> <b>voltage</b> that can be tolerated across Rv, bearing {{in mind that the}} higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage, Uin, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of Rv lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to staying below the arcing voltage, the ignition system keep the voltage across the points below the breakdown voltage for an air gap {{to prevent a}} glow discharge across the points. Such a glow discharge would quickly transition to an arc, and the arc would prevent the spark plug from firing. The <b>minimum</b> <b>voltage</b> for a glow discharge in air is about 320V. Consequently, the capacitor value is chosen to also keep the voltage across the points {{to be less than}} 320V. Keeping the points from arcing when they separate is the reason the ignition coil includes a secondary winding rather than using just a simple inductor. If the transformer has a 100:1 ratio, then the secondary voltage can reach 30kV.|$|E

40|$|Ultra-low {{sub-threshold}} voltage {{research has}} become increasingly important with the recent shift in consumer electronics towards low power designs for mobile, wearable, and implantable technologies. These applications are able to trade-off speed for reduced power consumption and reduced <b>minimum</b> operating <b>voltage.</b> This thesis studies circuit design solutions that focus on achieving the lowest <b>minimum</b> operating <b>voltages.</b> These applications {{are likely to be}} ones where the supply voltage may come from energy harvesting sources that are only able to source ultra-low voltages. The logic circuit presented in this thesis is a modified implementation of differential cascade voltage switch logic (DCVSL). Differential logic has improved ultra-low voltage performance over static CMOS logic and the modification to DCVSL offers a logic structure that can implement multi-input AND/NAND and OR/NOR gates while maintaining a stack height of one. This logic circuit is referred in this thesis as MOD-DCVSL. The modification requires the use of capacitive boosting to allow for normal logic operation. The results of this thesis show that differential logic styles are able to perform at lower <b>minimum</b> operating <b>voltages</b> compared to static CMOS logic styles but at the cost of larger delay and power compared to static CMOS. On average the differential implementations could operate at a <b>minimum</b> supply <b>voltage</b> 5 mV lower than CMOS for two input implementations and 10 mV lower for three input implementations. The delay of differential implementations was approximately double for both two and three input implementations. The power of the differential implementations are approximately 20 % higher than static CMOS for two input implementations but this gap is narrowed to approximately 10 % for three input implementations, here the lower <b>minimum</b> operating <b>voltages</b> allowed for decreased power consumption. Due to the consistently lower delay, static CMOS had a lower power delay product than the differential logic. When comparing only the differential logic, MOD-DCVSL offered negligible difference for two input implementations but was able to improve delay by 7 % and power by 11 % in the three input implementations...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main {{specifications}} that characterize a current mirror. The {{first is the}} transfer ratio (in {{the case of a}} current amplifier) or the output current magnitude (in the case of a constant current source CCS). The second is its AC output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage applied to the mirror. The third specification is the <b>minimum</b> <b>voltage</b> drop across the output part of the mirror necessary to make it work properly. This <b>minimum</b> <b>voltage</b> is dictated by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in active mode. The range of voltages where the mirror works is called the compliance range and the voltage marking the boundary between good and bad behavior is called the compliance voltage. There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability.|$|E
