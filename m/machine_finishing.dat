50|$|This mode {{features}} mining for gold, treasures and crystals. Dirt {{and rock}} squares {{appear in the}} bottom five rows of the board, and a line appears between the sixth and seventh rows of the board. A dirt square is cleared {{when one of the}} gems immediately adjacent to it is matched or detonated. Rock squares are cleared similarly but require multiple matches or detonation by a special gem. Extremely hard rock can only be removed by detonation. Points are earned by clearing squares with treasures or precious metals. The game starts with a time limit of ninety seconds. Clearing all the earth above the line will add thirty seconds to the ttimerwhile clearing all the earth on the board will add ninety seconds. After the time bonus is awarded, any remaining earth moves up the screen until the top of it reaches the fifth row, and new earth appears at the bottom to simulate digging deeper into the ground. Existing gems in the upper rows are pushed {{off the top of the}} board when this happens. A depth indicator increases by ten meters for each line of new earth added to the bottom. Digging deeper yields higher value treasure but also more of the harder to remove rock squares. The game ends when time runs out, which breaks the digging <b>machine.</b> <b>Finishing</b> four minigames in Quest mode unlocks this mode.|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneous {{computing}} (HC) is the coordinated use {{of different}} types of machines, networks, and interfaces to maximize the combined performance and/or cost effectiveness of the system. Heuristics for allocating resources in an HC system have different optimization criteria. A common optimization criterion is to minimize the completion time of the last to finish machine (makespan). In some environments, it is useful to minimize the finishing times of the other machines in the system, i. e., those machines that are not the last to finish. Consider a production environment where a set of known tasks are to be mapped to resources off-line before execution begins. Minimizing the finishing times of all the machines will provide the earliest available ready time for these machines to execute tasks that were not initially considered. In this study, we examine an iterative approach that decreases <b>machine</b> <b>finishing</b> times by repeatedly running a resource allocation heuristic. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate whether this iterative procedure can reduce the finishing time of some machines compared to the mapping initially generated by the heuristic. We show that the effectiveness of the iterative approach is heuristic dependent and study the behavior of the iterative approach for each of the chosen heuristics. This work which identifies heuristics can and cannot attain improvements in the completion time of non-makespan machines using this iterative approach...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of different ceramic surface treatments after machining grinding on the biaxial flexural strength (BFS) of machinable dental ceramics with different crystalline phases. Materials and Methods: Disk-shape specimens (10 mm in diameter and 1. 3 mm in thickness) of machinable ceramic cores (two silica-based and one zirconia-based ceramics) were prepared. Each type of the ceramic surfaces was then randomly treated (n= 15) with different treatments as follows: 1) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> as control, 2) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and sandblasting with alumina, and 3) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and hydrofluoric acid etching for the leucite and lithium disilicate-based ceramics, and for the zirconia; 1) <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> and post-sintered as control, 2) <b>machined</b> <b>finish,</b> post-sintered, and sandblasting, and 3) <b>machined</b> <b>finish,</b> post-sintered, and Nd;YAG laser irradiation. The BFS were measured in a universal testing machine. Data based were analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons post-hoc test (α= 0. 05). Results: The mean BFS of <b>machined</b> <b>finish</b> only surfaces for leucite ceramic {{was significantly higher than}} that of sandblasted (P= 0. 001) and acid etched surfaces (P= 0. 005). A significantly lower BFS was found after sandblasting for lithium disilicate compared with that of other groups (P< 0. 05). Sandblasting significantly increased the BFS for the zirconia (P< 0. 05), but the BFS was significantly decreased after laser irradiation (P< 0. 05).     Conclusions: The BFS of the machinable ceramics was affected by the type of ceramic material and surface treatment method. Sandblasting with alumina was detrimental to the strength of only silica-based ceramics. Nd:YAG laser irradiation may lead to substantial strength degradation of zirconia.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The ultrasonic-aided {{electrochemical}} finishing following traditional turning by a turning-form electrode {{for several}} die materials is demonstrated. Design/methodology/approach: A guide {{line for the}} design process is followed a scientific method including the design requirement, design development, detail design, and experimental analysis is adopted in the current study. The proposed design of turning-form electrode combined with the ultrasonic-aided electrochemical finishing is presented. Findings: Smaller end radius and smaller declination angle are associated with higher current density and provides larger discharge space and better polishing effect. The plate-shape electrode with small end radius and decreasing the surface area of top-view performs the best. The ultrasonic assistance can avoid the difficulty of dreg discharge in the electrochemical finishing, thus increasing the finishing effect. Research limitations/implications: The potential for electrode design and using ultrasonic energy transmitted to the electrolyte to assist discharging dregs out of electrode gap during the electrochemical finishing {{is yet to be}} explored. Practical implications: This process can be used for various turning operations including end turning, form turning, and flute and thread cutting. Through simple equipment attachment, the electrochemical finishing can follow the cutting on the same machine and chuck. Originality/value: It is a great contribution that the ultrasonic-aided electrochemical finishing after turning process just needs quite short time than manual or <b>machine</b> <b>finishing</b> to make the surface of workpiece smooth and bright. An effective and low-cost finishing method after turning process is presented...|$|E
40|$|The study investigates {{questions}} and considerations emerging when stone in historic buildings {{needs to be}} replaced. The {{focus is on the}} surface treatment of stone in sandstone façades in pre-industrial buildings. That means buildings constructed by traditional methods and craftsmanship without the use of modern technology. The research issue originates from the extensive stonework that is planned for the façades of the Stockholm Palace. The project includes the replacement of large quantities of damaged stone to newly cut stone. This raises the questions about the use of modern and rational methods for surface treatment on the replacement stone. The purpose of the study is to investigate the demands on the stone in large scale restoration projects and to find out what methods for finishing are available. In order to make observations from a recent project involving vast amounts of newly cut sandstone the reconstruction of the Dresden Frauenkirche is investigated. By conducting interviews with representatives from the current project at the Stockholm Palace and with persons involved in the planning and execution of the reconstruction of the Dresden Frauenkirche the considerations that emerge from a large scale project containing sandstone façades is exemplified. Literature on traditional methods for stone finishing is studied and the various stone finishes on the Stockholm Palace and on the Dresden Fraunekirche is investigated. Methods and technology of the modern stone industry is examined by visiting two large German stone producers, in addition a small Swedish workshop is also studied. The findings of the study indicates that important qualities of the traditional carved stone might be lost if modern <b>machine</b> <b>finishing</b> is used. Modern technology can however facilitate the shaping out of the stone. If such rational production methods is chosen it requires that the detailing of the stonework {{must be taken into account}} and the handwriting of the individual craftsman has to be allowed to appear in the finished result. The conclusion of the study points to that the best result for surface treatment of sandstone on historic buildings is achieved through traditional methods preformed by skilled craftsmen...|$|E

Economy of machining operation plays a key role in competitiveness in the market. All CNCmachines produce finished components from cylindrical bar. Finished profiles consist of straight turning, facing, taper and circular <b>machining.</b> <b>Finished</b> profile from a cylindrical bar is done in two stages, rough <b>machining</b> and <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> Numbers of passes are required for rough machining and single pass is required for the <b>finished</b> pass.
