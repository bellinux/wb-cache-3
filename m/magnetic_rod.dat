40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{rheological properties}} of stable and weakly aggregated two-dimensional suspensions are studied experimentally using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> interfacial rheometer. Particle monolayers with well controlled structures were prepared. Charged polystyrene particles create two-dimensional colloidal crystals at the water-decane interface {{over a wide}} range of concentrations. Under similar conditions a predominantly liquid structure is obtained at the water-air interface for the same particles. The addition of appropriate combinations of the anionic surfactant sodiumdodecylsulfate (SDS) and sodium chloride (NaCl) to the aqueous subphase leads to a destabilization of these monolayers with the formation of fractal aggregates at low concentrations and a heterogeneous gel forming as the surface coverage is increased. After the structures have been built up a reproducible structure can be obtained, of which the interfacial rheological properties can be investigated using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> stress rheometer. In all cases, numerical calculations were used to assess the importance of instrumental artifacts and the effect of the coupling between surface and subphase flows. The rheology of aggregated suspensions was compared to the reference case of a colloidal crystal. The two-dimensional aggregated suspensions display rheological features which are similar to their three-dimensional counterparts. These include an elastic response with small linearity limits, a power law dependence on surface coverage and a dependence on the strength of attraction. The results shed some light on the possible role of interfacial rheology on the stability of particle laden high interface systems. Additionally, the 2 D suspensions could present fundamental insights in the rheological properties of dense colloidal suspensions. status: publishe...|$|E

Using computer simulations we investigate the translational and rotational diffusion of dilute suspensions of magnetic nanorods with and without a (homogeneous) external magnetic field. The <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> are represented as spherocylinders with a longitudinal point dipole at their center and length-to-breadth ratios L/D = 3 or L/D = 9. In {{the absence of a}} field, the rods tend to form compact clusters with antiparallel ordering and thus behave very differently to dipolar spheres (L/D = 0), which tend to form head-to-tail chains. Furthermore, for rod-like particles the external field tends to destabilize rather than to support cluster formation. We show that these differences in the aggregation behavior have profound consequences not only in static material properties such as the field-induced magnetization and the zero-frequency susceptibility, but also in the dynamics. In particular, for <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> the translational diffusion constant parallel to the field is larger than the perpendicular one, in contrast to the behavior observed for magnetic spheres. Moreover, the rod-like character greatly affects the shape and the density dependence of the single-particle and collective dipole–dipole time correlation functions and their counterparts in the frequency domain...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} and rheological properties of viscoelastic films at the air-water interface. Our aim is to tailor the rheological properties of fluid in¬terfaces and link them with their structure at the molecular scale. Langmuir quasi-monolayers were built by employing three different types of molecular systems, a series of semifluorinated alkanes that consist of two hydrophobic segments, a homopolymer, Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and block copolymers of PEO-PDMS with differ¬ent molecular architectures. The techniques employed in this thesis include Langmuir-Pockels trough, to measure surface pressure/ area isotherms, and the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> in-terfacial stress rheometer, double wall ring fixture and bi-conical device in commercial rheometers for interfacial rheology studies. For structural studies of the films at the air-water interface we performed neutron reflectivity measurements and scanning force microscopy. We observed great tunability of the structural and rheological properties of the semifluorinated alkanes moving from simple linear molecules to more complex and branched architectures, showing that molecular modification can change dramatically the viscoelastic response of the layers. Regardless of the molecular architecture effect, the external light stimulus effect was investigated for photo-sensitive semifluorinated alkanes that could change their conformation reversibly from trans to cis. One of the main {{findings of this study}} was the transition from ordered to mixed (disordered) struc¬tures whose onset is signaled by the drop of the interfacial storage modulus of about one order of magnitude. The predominantly elastic layers of PMMA were used to investigate the presence of even harmonics among different rheometry techniques. By analysing the strain signal in the Fourier space, {{it was found that the}} bi-conical and the double wall ring fixture do not generate even harmonics while the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> showed the presence of 2 nd harmonics that are connected with asymmetry in the stress-strain profile, apparently stemming from ununiformity in flow and the subphase contribution. Finally, the diblock and triblock copolymers of PEO-PDMS exhibit perfectly re¬versible layers at the air-water interface showing a reproducible PDMS phase transition for all the different molecular weights. Moreover, the average Flory radius of the poly¬mers scale as RF~NV, with ν= 0. 56 ± 0. 01. Such result are in agreement with predicted scaling for 2 D-polymers in bad solvent conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the equilibrium equations for a conducting elastic rod {{placed in a}} uniform magnetic field, motivated by the problem of electrodynamic space tethers. When expressed in body coordinates the equations are found {{to sit in a}} hierarchy of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems involving an increasing number of vector fields. These systems, which include the classical Euler and Kirchhoff rods, are shown to be completely integrable {{in the case of a}} transversely isotropic rod; they are in fact generated by a Lax pair. For the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> this gives a physical interpretation to a previously proposed abstract nine-dimensional integrable system. We use the conserved quantities to reduce the equations to a four-dimensional canonical Hamiltonian system, allowing the geometry of the phase space to be investigated through Poincaré sections. In the special case where the force in the rod is aligned with the magnetic field the system turns out to be superintegrable, meaning that the phase space breaks down completely into periodic orbits, corresponding to straight twisted rods.

The development of 2 D colloidal structures {{is a key}} stepping stone towards three-dimensional (3 D) structures in relation to controlled chemical composition, morphology, assembly and so on. Nowadays, uniform colloidal structures with complexity in both shape and interactions have become a popular topic in fundamental colloid science and applications. Being motivated by this, in this thesis, micro-scale colloidal rods and self-assembled dipeptides have been studied experimentally at the air-water interface. Monolayers containing these colloidal materials were created in a Langmuir trough. Surface pressure measurements, microscopic observations and many other techniques were combined for the investigation. The aim of this work is to understand the phase behaviours in complex monolayers, including the phase transitions during compression, the flipping dynamics of micro-rods, the contribution of dipole-dipole interactions between <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods,</b> and the interfacial self-assembly process of dipeptide molecules. Iron oxide micro-rods (β-FeOOH @silica) with different aspect ratios have been synthesized to create the monolayers at an air-water interface. Microscopic observations reveal a sequence of phase transitions by compressing the monolayers. It has been proved that the aspect ratio of the rods {{plays an important role}} in the phase transitions, —short rods flip into a perpendicular position relative to the interface to relieve the compressional stress, while longer rods form multilayers under compression. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> (Fe 3 O 4) were converted from the synthesized FeOOH rods. They can be aligned in an external field, which further induces the reorganization at the interface. To study these <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods,</b> differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) was carried out to measure the magnetic moment. Their interfacial properties were investigated in an external field applied perpendicular and parallel to the interface, respectively. A magnetic field-induced flipping process has been observed, which proves the theoretical prediction. Besides rod-like particles, naphthalene dipeptides have been successfully trapped at the interface of a low pH subphase, self-assembling into a hydrogel film. The mechanism of interfacial self-assembly has been studied. Both FTIR spectra and AFM images are used to investigate the fibrous structures of the film.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that an electron vortex beam can be generated by the magnetic field surrounding {{the tip of a}} dipole-like magnet.

We highlight the analogies between the magnetic and electrostatic cases and use simulations of in-focus, Fresnel and Fraunhofer images to show that a device based on two parallel, oppositely charged lines that each have a constant charge density can be used to generate a tuneable electron vortex beam.

The control actuators employed are 3 -axis <b>magnetic</b> torquer <b>rods</b> and reaction wheels. During initial detumbling and safe mode operations a simple new magnetic control law is used to bring the satellite to a sun-pointed Y-spinning attitude for maximum solar power collection.

During the intermediate mode the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rods</b> are used to maintain the momentum vector size and direction and to do nutation damping. The pitch angle is also controlled using the Y-wheel, to keep the main imager payload {{as close as possible}} to an earth-pointed attitude and to thermally stabilise the imager telescope.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} interfacial needle stress rheometer is {{a device}} capable of sensitive rheological interfacial measurements. Yet even for this device, when measuring interfaces with low elastic and viscous moduli, the system {{response of the}} instrument contributes significantly to the measured response. To determine the operation limits of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod</b> rheometer, we analyze the relative errors that are introduced by linearly subtracting the instrument contribution from the measured response. An analysis of the fluid mechanics demonstrates the intimate coupling between the flow field at the two-dimensional interface and in the bulk at low Boussinesq number. A nonzero Reynolds number is observed to have a similar order of magnitude effect. The resulting nonlinear interfacial deformation profiles lead to an error, which depends on {{the magnitude of the}} interfacial modulus, {{as well as on the}} phase angle. The conditions under which reliable measurements can be obtained are identified. Based on the analysis of the effects of system response, the Boussinesq and Reynolds numbers, small modifications to the measurement probe are proposed. A reduction of the mass and localization of the magnetic material result in even further improved instrument sensitivity.

Measurements with a replica of the famous Coler “Magnetstromapparat” were conducted. In order to tune the acoustic, magnetic and electric resonance circuits of the Coler device the magneto-acoustic resonance was measured with a frequency scan through a function generator and a lock-in amplifier. The frequency generator was powering a driving coil, while the lock-in was connected to a pickup coil. Both coils were placed on a <b>magnetic</b> <b>rod.</b> Resonances were observed up to the 17 th harmonic. The quality Q of the observed resonances was 270. To study the magneto-acoustic resonance in the time domain a pair of Permendur rods were employed. The magneto-acoustic resonances of the Permendur rods were observed with an oscilloscope. Spectra of the magneto acoustic resonance were measured for the Permendur rods and for a Coler replica magnet in the frequency range from 25 kHz to 380 kHz. The next step was to bring the resonances of the Permendur rods close together so that they overlap. The 10 thharmonic was chosen because it was close to the 180 kHz that Hans Coler related to ferromagnetism. Further more magneto-acoustic coupling between the Permendur rods was studied. Finally the question was explored if Hans Coler converted vacuum fluctuations via magnetic and acoustic resonance into electricity.
