Feeders move individual components to a fixed location and also assist the pickup head in removing components from their packaging.As the flexibility and placement rate of systems has increased, so have the demands made on the component feeder systems.

40|$|Machine tool owners require {{knowledge}} of their machine’s capabilities, and the emphasis increases with areas of high accuracy manufacturing. An aspect of a machine’s capability is its geometric accuracy. International Standards and best-practice guides are available to aid understanding of the required measurements and to advise on how to perform them. However, there is an absence of any intelligent method capable of optimising the duration of a calibration plan, minimising <b>machine</b> <b>down-time.</b> In this work, artificial intelligence {{in the form of}} automated planning is applied to the problem of machine tool pseudo-static geometric error calibration. No prior {{knowledge of}} Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning is required throughout this paper. The authors have written this paper for calibration engineers to see the benefits that automated planning can provide. Two models are proposed; the first produces a sequential calibration plan capable of finding the optimal calibration plan. The second model has the additional possibility of planning for concurrent measurements, adding the possibility of further reducing <b>machine</b> <b>down-time.</b> Both models take input regarding a machine’s configuration and available instrumentation. The efficacy of both models is evaluated by performing a case study of a five-axis gantry machine, whereby calibration plans are produced and compared against both an academic and industrial expert. From this, the effectiveness of this novel method for producing optimal calibration plan is evaluated, stimulating potential for future work...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{a machine}} tool’s {{capability}} is fundamental for applications where {{a high level}} of accuracy is required, such as aerospace manufacturing. Therefore, calibrating machine tools to International Standards is an important process and should be executed thoroughly. The calibration process requires firstly identifying the errors component of a machine tool, followed by the selection of an appropriate test method and instrumentation. The emphasis on minimising <b>machine</b> <b>down-time</b> requires expert knowledge to ensure that the calibration process is both complete and optimal. The paper shows the process of planning a machine tool calibration and is followed by a description of how using automated planning techniques will improve machine too calibration planning...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Most rotating-machine {{failures}} {{are often}} linked to bearing failures. Proper condition monitoring on bearings is therefore essential {{to reduce the}} duration of <b>machine</b> <b>down-times.</b> This paper introduces feature extraction methodologies that can facilitate early detection of bearing faults. The time-domain vibration signals of a rotating machine with normal and defective bearings are processed for feature extraction. Both linear and non-linear features are extracted using Multi-Scale Fractal Dimension (MFD), Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients and kurtosis. The extracted features are then used to classify faults using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and hidden Markov Models (HMM). Results demonstrate that HMM outperforms GMM in classification of bearing faults. However, the disadvantage of HMM {{is that it is}} computationally expensive to train compared to GMM.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} {{technology}} are {{leading to a}} need for ever smaller and more complex featured surfaces. The techniques for manufacturing these surfaces are varied but are tied together by one limitation; the lack of useable, on-line metrology instrumentation. Current metrology methods require the removal of a workpiece for characterisation which leads to <b>machining</b> <b>down-time,</b> more intensive labour and generally presents a bottle neck for throughput. In order {{to establish a new}} method for on-line metrology at the nanoscale investigation are made into the use of optical fibre interferometry to realise a compact probe that is robust to environmental disturbance. Wavelength tuning is combined with a dispersive element to provide a moveable optical stylus that sweeps the surface. The phase variation caused by the surface topography is then analysed using phase shifting interferometry. A second interferometer is wavelength multiplexed into the optical circuit in order to track the inherent instability of the optical fibre. This is then countered using a closed loop control to servo the path lengths mechanically which additionally counters external vibration on the measurand. The overall stability is found to be limited by polarisation state evolution however. A second method is then investigated and a rapid phase shifting technique is employed in conjunction with an electro-optic phase modulator to overcome the polarisation state evolution. Closed loop servo control is realised with no mechanical movement and a step height artefact is measured. The measurement result shows good correlation with a measurement taken with a commercial white light interferometer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of manufacturers can be significantly enhanced through implementation of Setup Reduction (SUR) initiatives. This paper presents a simplified SUR approach which was trialed and fully implemented in an injection molding facility.

The detailed analysis of the operations carried out by employees were investigated by using the Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) philosophy.

40|$|Supergen, Sustainable Power Generation and Supply, is an {{initiative}} lead {{and run by}} the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council {{with the aim of}} improving the sustainability off the UK's power generation and supply along with improving emission targets. Part of the initiative has involved a research into conventional power plant lifetime extension in order to maintain reliability and availability of power. Integral to lifetime evaluation and extension is structural integrity assessment, which knowledge of residual stresses plays a major role. This thesis discusses research undertaken to improve and understand residual stress measurements for power plant components. This was done using non-destructive/non-invasive techniques, as these techniques can reduce the otherwise costly need for <b>machine</b> <b>down-time</b> and the stripping-down of components. In the present work, emphasis has been placed on the role of oxides and the associated residual stresses. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|During {{high-pressure}} die-casting (HPDC) {{of aluminium}} alloys, {{there is a}} tendency for the molten alloy to react with the tool steel die, core pins and inserts. This occurrence within the high pressure die casting (HPDC) industry is referred to as ‘soldering’. It is of concern to high-pressure die casters because of down-time due to the regular removal of the soldered layer and its detrimental affect on die life and casting quality. In this investigation, several physical vapour deposited (PVD) coatings, namely, TiN, CrN and TiCN, were evaluated for their ability to eliminate soldering during HPDC of aluminium alloys. Accelerated semi-industrial trials were carried out in a 250 -t Toshiba HPDC machine using a specially designed die made of P 20 tool steel with removable core pins. The results from these trials showed that PVD coatings can act as a physical barrier coating preventing any reaction between the molten aluminium alloy and the tool steel. Thus the problem of soldering on such tools as core pins can be eliminated in high HPDC of aluminium alloys. In the accelerated trials, it was found that soldering was replaced by a built-up layer of cast aluminium alloy, which was less detrimental to tool life and reduced <b>machine</b> <b>down-time</b> due to the reduced need for tool polishing. The experimental results were confirmed by conducting in-plant HPDC trials...|$|E
40|$|The {{priorities}} of executing the manufacturing orders generated by an MRP system {{are often in}} operational conflicts with {{the dynamics of the}} manufacturing floor. It is not uncommon for a given manufacturing order to reach the shop floor several weeks or longer after being 2 ̆ 2 opened 2 ̆ 2 by an MRP system where it may face a chaotic case of large queues, <b>machine</b> <b>down-time,</b> parts shortage, scrap problems and other resource management constraints. Many companies have resorted to the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) software solution to resolve these problems. This method first gained popularity in mid- 90 ’s within the semiconductor industry. An MES approach is an on-line, real-time data gathering, analysis and storage to assist in short-interval scheduling (shift or day) manufacturing operations with an emphasis on revising scheduling priorities. It is essentially an information system tool for the shop floor and if designed properly, it may be used as an advisory system for effective decision-making. However, in implementation MES faces several challenges including the proper software platform/architecture, integration within ERP or a stand-alone best-of-breed, amount and type of data/information to be exchanged with the MRP engine, and a user-centered interface for various layers of decision making. This paper will provide a detailed background on various technical, software, and organizational factors that the use of an MES implementation may impose upon the practitioner. Furthermore, and as a case study, it will discuss a systematic implementation strategy for MES at a high-tech company in California. The discussion of the critical success factors in implementation planning will hopefully be of value to both practitioners and researchers in similar projects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop condition monitoring techniques {{that could be used to}} characterize the nominal condition of an industrial CO 2 laser and observe any changes that might occur over time for use with preventive maintenance. ^ In this research, both a static and dynamic model have been developed to characterize the power distribution of a high power transverse-flow DC-excited CO 2 laser. Both models linked the input discharge power of the laser to the output power, as well as, the heat losses in the system. The dynamic model is an extension of the static power distribution model to account for dynamic effects such as continuously ramping up and down the laser output power and the cyclic nature of the laser 2 ̆ 7 s chiller. The models were used to characterize the nominal laser behavior during production and observe any changes that occurred over time. A method called the parametric diagnostic technique based on the dynamic laser power distribution model was used to monitor the condition of several components on an industrial laser used in actual production. The results showed that this technique can be used to monitor the laser 2 ̆ 7 s condition and isolate fault signatures caused by contamination successfully. Control charts were also successfully generated that showed the deterioration of the laser 2 ̆ 7 s condition between maintenance intervals. It is believed that the models and the monitoring techniques developed in this research can be practically implemented and used to help reduce <b>machine</b> <b>down-time</b> and to improve the quality of parts produced with the device. With the results obtained in this research, an on-line user-friendly monitoring system that indicates the condition of the laser and warns the user of any abnormalities can be developed. Such a monitoring system can also be used to determine when and what maintenance is required to keep the laser functioning properly. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided {{in two parts}} which are {{strongly}} connected. Part one deal with disruptions occurring in connection with <b>machine</b> <b>down-time,</b> quality losses and increased cycle time. The analysis is based on 10 studies, in which down-time losses in Swedish industry have been registered. In part two, the Japanese lean production concept is analysed {{with the aid of}} literature studies and studies of lean production companies in Japan and the USA. DISRUPTION ANALYSIS: The analysis of the ten field studies showed that the machines were utilised for operative work during 59 % of the planned production time. Of the remaining time, 39 % was taken up by maintenance related work, 24 % by setting-up procedures and 20 % by material-related down-time. Altogether, down-time losses represented 80 % of the total losses in connection with disruptions. Cycle and quality losses constituted 14 % and 6 % of the total losses, respectively. Based on the down-time analysis, a general model, describing how different technical and organisational events together lead to disruptions in any manufacturing system was also developed. This model has been further developed to include a description of how connections between various disruptions arise. As an example, it is described how a quality loss automatically leads to a down-time loss. Finally, a model has been developed to simulate how reduced disruption losses effect the manufacturing capacity of a specifik manufacturing system. LEAN PRODUCTION: It is no coincidence that companies that practice lean production are successful in disruption reduction. This is a logical consequence of their industrial concept which, to a large extent, is based on the effiency gains made possible with low disruption levels. A necessary, and previously disregarded, factor within the lean production concept consists of the support systems around the more well-known tools such as "Kaizen", "SMED" (Single-Minute Exchange of Die), "QC-circles", etc. In this work, these support systems have been divided into staff-related systems, which aim at developing the competence, flexibility and motivation of the staff and visualisation systems aimed at identifying possible and actual disruptions in the manufacturing process. In conclusion, a model has been develped describing how continuous improvements, according to the Kaizen philosophy, arise from the dynamic co-operation between the support systems and the well-known improvement tools...|$|E
40|$|Project CPR/ 88 / 054 was {{successful}} in strengthening China's quality development and assurance system for wood-based panels, through the realization of its stated objectives. However, {{the achievements of the}} project would be further consolidated and strengthened through the implementation of the following recommendations. While the Chinese Research Institute of Wood Industry CRIWI has been revising/formulating newer standards and codes for end- products, {{more needs to be done}} to cover such areas as input standards, on-line specifications for process control, codes/specifications for wood dyes and pigments, product packaging codes, etc. Development/revision of two specific types of standards are of immediate importance. These relate primarily to standards/specifications of raw materials entering the production lines, particularly to significant <b>machine</b> <b>down-time</b> due to improper feed-stock, and, secondly, to revision of building codes to encourage expanded usage of wood-based panels products. The project identified four regional substations and formulated draft regulations for the introduction of a regional network of quality testing and monitoring stations for wood-based panels. The actual implementation of the system has, however, yet to come into force. Since the rationale for the introduction of the regional network is of a fundamental nature, its early implementation cannot be overstressed. The proposed regional stations should be delegated increasing responsibilities for both quality monitoring and extensions services and research. The frequency of independent inspection of producing units could be expanded to internationally acceptable standards by making the regional centres responsible for such activities. In addition, the current product certification system could be upgraded by making use of the regional stations. Thus, the early establishment of the regional stations and delegation of authority to these centres would serve to bring about further quality improvements on a national scale. Further work should be done at CRIWI to continue the development of wet-formed wood-plastic composites to consistently reproduce a high-quality panel over a range of wood-plastic compositions. Further testing could be done to determine the limits to which wood-plastic composites can be post-formed after pressing. These composites have very good potential for being used on the interior panels of automobiles and for other non-structural applications, such as safety guards for machinery, door skins, packaging and shipping. In addition work should focus on determining which compatabilizers would improve the bond strength between wood-fibre and plastic. Additional laboratory equipment would help facilitate research in this area, including (i) a laboratory-scale wet-process forming line, (ii) additional dies to test the formability of the composites, and (iii) test equipment to determine physical properties of composite panels. Computer-based technology needs to be significantly upgraded in CRIWI and other forestry institutions, to strengthen research activities and informatics. Computer-based in-process quality control in operating mills also requires significant upgrading to enable real-time analysis during successive production stages. The latter is important for both productivity and profitability of mills. There are certain areas that require strengthening: a module-based developmental plan could be designed and implemented over a period of time. To do this, however, China would need international assistance in the form of additional external consultants, more fellowships (one fellowship was provided under this project), equipment and hands-on training. While extension services aimed at dissemination of research technologies, user-related information and technical advisory assistance were developed under the current project, inculcation of the fundamentals of value engineering will go a long way in expanding the use of wood-based panels, and recycled products in diverse areas. In essence, this implies advisory services to users in the application of the correct material (and not necessarily material of the highest specifications) for the desired job. Such activities would reduce costs as well as serve to demonstrate the varied uses of panel products. In this context, the training workshop and related activities envisaged under the current project are crucial and need to be implemented at the earliest...|$|E
