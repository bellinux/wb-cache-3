50|$|The unique {{appearance}} was a design first for satellite antennae, its flat plate measured {{only a few}} millimetres thick and the LNB unit protruded another 3 cm from the rear. It was built to a very high standard, featuring good quality plastics, weather resistant coatings and stainless steel <b>mounting</b> <b>arm.</b> Compared with the Amstrad-manufactured setups offered by Sky — made from cheap metal — the Squarial offered a much more attractive setup.|$|E
50|$|Tumbling hammers, {{typically}} {{used in conjunction}} with rigid frame discharge electrodes, are highly efficient but require a lot of maintenance when employed in a moving gas stream. Hammers are connected to a rotating shaft. As they revolve, the hammers collide with a beam, causing a vibratory shock to dislodge caked-on dust. The hammer’s weight and <b>mounting</b> <b>arm</b> length control the intensity of the rapping. Adjusting the speed of the rotating shaft alters the frequency of rapping.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid having}} {{the entire system}} go dark if a single lamp burned out, each street lamp was {{equipped}} with a device that ensured that the circuit would remain intact. Early series street lights were equipped with isolation transformers. that would allow current to pass across the transformer whether the bulb worked or not. Later the film cutout was invented. The film cutout was a small disk of insulating film that separated two contacts connected to the two wires leading to the lamp. If the lamp failed (an open circuit), the current through the string became zero, causing the voltage of the circuit (thousands of volts) to be imposed across the insulating film, penetrating it (see Ohm's law). In this way, the failed lamp was bypassed and power restored {{to the rest of}} the district. The street light circuit contained an automatic current regulator, preventing the current from increasing as lamps burned out, preserving the life of the remaining lamps. When the failed lamp was replaced, a new piece of film was installed, once again separating the contacts in the cutout. This system was recognizable by the large porcelain insulator separating the lamp and reflector from the <b>mounting</b> <b>arm.</b> This was necessary because the two contacts in the lamp's base may have operated at several thousand volts above ground/earth.|$|E

40|$|A {{mounting}} mechanism {{was designed}} and built to satisfy requirements specific to a developmental head-up display (HUD) {{to be used by}} pilots in a Boeing 757 airplane. This development was necessitated by the fact that although such mounting mechanisms were commercially available for other airplanes, there were none for the 757. The mounting mechanism supports a miniature electronic camera that provides a forward view. The mechanism was designed to be integrated with the other HUD instrumentation and to position the camera so that what is presented to the pilot is the image acquired by the camera, overlaid with alphanumeric and/or graphical symbols, from a close approximation of the pilot s natural forward perspective. The mounting mechanism includes an L-shaped <b>mounting</b> <b>arm</b> that can be adjusted easily to the pilot s perspective, without prior experience. The mounting mechanism is lightweight and flexible and presents little hazard to the pilot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a simple, safe, and inexpensive image overlay system to assist surgical interventions inside a conventional CT scanner. The overlay system is mounted non-invasively on the gantry of the CT scanner and {{it consists of}} a seven degrees-of-freedom passive <b>mounting</b> <b>arm,</b> a flat LCD display, and a light brown acrylic plate as a half mirror. In a pre-operative calibration process, the display, half-mirror, and imaging plane of the scanner are spatially registered by imaging a triangular calibration object. Following the calibration, the patient is brought into the scanner, an image is acquired {{and sent to the}} overlay display via DICOM transfer. Looking at the patient through the half-mirror, the CT image appears to be floating inside the patient in correct size and position. This vision enables the physician to see both the surface and the inside of the patient at the same time, which can be utilized in guiding a surgical intervention. The complete system fits into a carry-on suitcase (except the mounting adapter), it is easy to calibrate, mounts non-invasively on the scanner, without utilizing vendor-specific features of he scanner. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{present the}} {{prototype}} of an image-guided robotic system for accurate and consistent placement of percutaneous needles in soft-tissue targets under CT guidance inside the gantry of a CT scanner. The couch-mounted system consists of a seven-degrees-of-freedom passive <b>mounting</b> <b>arm,</b> a remote center-of-motion robot, and a motorized needle-insertion device. Singleimage-based coregistration of the robot and image space is achieved by stereotactic localization using a miniature version of the BRW head frame built into the radiolucent needle driver. The surgeon plans and controls the intervention in the scanner room on a desktop computer that receives DICOM images from the scanner. The system does not need calibration, employs pure image-based registration, and does not utilize any vendor-specific hardware or software features. In the open air, {{where there is no}} needle–tissue interaction, we systematically achieved an accuracy better than 1 mm in hitting targets at 5 – 8 cm from the fulcrum point. In the phantom, the orientation accuracy was 0. 6 °, and the distance between the needle tip and the target was 1. 04 mm. Experiments indicated that this robotic system is suitable for a variety of percutaneous clinical applications. Comp Aid Surg 6 : 370 – 383 (2001). © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words...|$|E
