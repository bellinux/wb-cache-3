5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates {{many of the}} <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> of {{the rest}} of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.|$|E
5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This is perhaps most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, {{as well as a}} desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. Working within the social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|The game draws {{heavily from}} both the plot and {{aesthetic}} elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. The game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option {{to play the game}} in black and white. Various plot elements refer to the <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the various}} {{patterns}} and motifs found in Delian mosaics is the triple-colored lozenge {{that creates a}} three-dimensional illusion of cubes in perspective for the viewer. This pattern appears in fifteen different locations, {{making it one of}} the most common. Other motifs include waves and stepped triangles, while <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> include maritime, theatrical, natural, or mythological objects and figures. The single wave pattern, a common motif in Hellenistic art, is the most predominant type of border design for mosaics at Delos and appear in mosaics of Arsameia (albeit arranged in the opposite direction). The rosette motif, which is found in the mosaics of various Hellenistic sites across the Mediterranean, is often coupled with single-wave borders in Delian mosaics. The typical Hellenistic palmette motif is used in a mosaic of Delos to fill the four corners around a central rosette motif. The illusion of three-dimensional relief in the figured scenes of Delian mosaics was usually achieved by the use of polychrome, with white, black, yellow, red, blue and green hues.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel The English Patient, which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|The Jana Sangh's {{first major}} campaign, begun in early 1953, centred on {{a demand for}} the {{complete}} integration of Jammu and Kashmir into India. Mookerjee was arrested in May 1953 for violating orders from the state government restraining him from entering Kashmir. He {{died of a heart}} attack the following month, while still in jail. Mauli Chandra Sharma was elected to succeed Mookerjee; however, he was forced out of power by the RSS activists within the party, and the leadership went instead to Upadhyaya. Upadhyay remained the General Secretary until 1967, and worked to build a committed grassroots organisation in the image of the RSS. The party minimised engagement with the public, focusing instead on building its network of propagandists. Upadhyaya also articulated the philosophy of integral humanism, which formed the official doctrine of the party. Younger leaders, such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani also became involved with the leadership in this period, with Vajpayee succeeding Upadhyaya as president in 1968. The <b>major</b> <b>themes</b> on the party's agenda during this period were legislating a uniform civil code, banning cow slaughter and abolishing the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir.|$|E
