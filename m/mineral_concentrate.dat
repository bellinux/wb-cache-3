40|$|BACKGROUND n {{regions with}} {{intensive}} livestock systems, {{the processing of}} manure into liquid <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrates</b> {{is seen as an}} option to increase the nutrient use efficiency of manures. The agricultural sector anticipates that these products may in future be regarded as regular mineral fertilisers. We assessed the agronomic suitability and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions of using liquid <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrates</b> on arable farms. RESULTS The phosphate requirements on arable farms were largely met by raw pig slurry, given its large regional availability. After the initial nutrient input by means of pig slurry, the nitrogen/phosphate ratio of the remaining nutrient crop requirements determined the additional amount of liquid <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrates</b> that can be used. For sandy soils, liquid <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrates</b> could supply 50 % of the nitrogen requirement, whereas for clay soils the concentrates did not meet the required nitrogen/phosphate ratio. The total GHG emissions per kg of plant available nitrogen ranged from - 65 to 33 ¿kg CO 2 -equivalents. It increased in the order digestates...|$|R

50|$|Tiwest's {{corporate}} office (sales/marketing/accounting/administration/IT/etc) {{was located in}} Bentley, five minutes drive south of the Perth central business district. During the joint-venture phase of operations, from 1988 through 2012, heavy <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> was trucked from Cooljarloo, 1 hour and 15 minutes south to the Chandala mineral sands processing plant, near Muchea, 70 km north of Perth. The concentrate was then separated in a facility known as a dry mill, using a magnetic separation-process. Ilmenite was further processed on-site into synthetic rutile, which is used by pigment plants to manufacture paints and similar products. Additional minerals, produced as a byproduct of the rutile production process, were sold as-is. Most synthetic rutile from Chandala was then trucked to Kwinana, 30 km south of Perth, to the Tiwest-owned pigment plant, which produces titanium dioxide a.k.a. TiO2. A $100M upgrade to this Kwinana pigment plant {{was approved by the}} boards of both Tronox and Exxaro, and was expected to increase TiO2 pigment production by up to 50% before 2013.

5000|$|The {{machines}} utilise {{the principles}} of a centrifuge to enhance the gravitational force experienced by feed particles to effect separation based on particle density. The key components of the unit are a cone shaped [...] "concentrate" [...] bowl, rotated at high speed by an electric motor and a pressurized water jacket encompassing the bowl. Feed material, typically from a ball mill discharge or cyclone underflow bleed, is fed as a slurry toward {{the centre of the}} bowl from above. The feed slurry contacts the base plate of the vessel and, due to its rotation, is thrust outward. The outer extremities of the concentrate bowl house a series of ribs and between each pair of ribs is a groove. During operation the lighter material flows upward over the grooves and heavy mineral particles (usually of economic value) become trapped within them. Pressurized water is injected through a series of tangential water inlets along the perimeter of each groove to maintain a fluidized bed of particles in which heavy mineral particles can be efficiently concentrated. The Knelson concentrator typically operates as a batch process, with lighter gangue material being continuously discharged via overflow and a heavy <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> periodically removed by flushing the bowl with water.|$|E

40|$|Processing {{of manure}} intends to {{increase}} the use efficiency of nutrients. A concentrated solution of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) (‘mineral concentrate’) {{is one of the}} possible products resulting from manure processing. A study is carried out in the Netherlands to determine the agronomic and environmental effects of the production and use of such mineral concentrates. This concentrate is produced by reverse osmosis of the liquid fraction of separated livestock slurry. On average 92 % of the N in <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> is present as ammonium-N, the other 8 % as organic N. Pot experiments with different soils and crops showed that the Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV) of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> compared to calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) ranged from 76 – 97 %. The NFRV of injected <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> compared to CAN ranged in the field experiments from 72 – 84 % for arable land and 54 – 80 % for grassland. NFRV of injected <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> was similar to that of injected liquid ammonium nitrate. <b>Mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> is an ammonium (NH 4) containing fertiliser with a high pH (about 8). Experiments showed that application of mineral concentrates may result in ammonia (NH 3) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Injection or incorporation of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> strongly decreased NH 3 emission. The N 2 O emission from <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> is probably related to the presence of organic carbon in concentrates and/or high NH 3 concentration in the soil. The risk of nitrate leaching from applied mineral concentrates was similar or lower than that from CAN, for both grassland and arable land. Obviously, NH 3 emission and denitrification were the dominant N loss pathways after application of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate.</b> There is scope to decrease N losses and increase NFRV of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> by use of low NH 3 emission application techniques, and a further decrease of the organic N content of concentrate. Scenario analyses on national scale showed that large scale use of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> and the attending solid fraction in the Netherlands decreased the need for mineral N and P fertilisers up to 15 % and 82 %, respectively. Moreover, the manure surplus in Netherlands decreases up to 84 % and therefore this manure has not to be exported. The total NH 3 and N 2 O emissions and N leaching in the Netherlands hardly changed in the scenarios. Large scale use of <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> increases the N and P use efficiency on a national scale.

40|$|Abstract: Deep {{sea water}} (DSW), {{originally}} pumped from the Pacific Rim {{off the coast}} of Hualien County (Taiwan), and its mineral constituents, were concentrated by a low-temperature vacuum evaporation system to produce a hardness of approximately 400, 000 mg/L of seawater <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate.</b> The primary composition of this seawater <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> was ionic magnesium (Mg 2 +), which was approximately 96, 000 mg/L. Referring to the human recommended daily allowance (RDA) of magnesium, we diluted the <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> to three different dosages: 0. 1 × DSW (equivalent to 3. 75 mg Mg 2 + /kg DSW); 1 × DSW (equivalent to 37. 5 mg Mg 2 + /kg DSW); and 2 × DSW (equivalent to 75 mg Mg 2 + /kg DSW). Additionally, a magnesium chloride treatment was conducted for comparison with the DSW supplement. The study indicated that 0. 1 × DSW, 1 × DSW and 2 × DSW decreased the systolic and diastolic pressures in spontaneous hypertensive rats in an eight-week experiment.

40|$|Intensification of {{livestock}} production {{in combination with}} a decline in arable land {{has resulted in a}} discrepancy between excess load of nutrients from livestock production and the possibility to apply these nutrients in an environmental way on agricultural land. Consequently, the mineral input and output in livestock intensive regions is not balanced. The crop production systems rely on synthetic fertilizers for fertilization, whereas livestock production systems face problems in manure disposal. This dissertation aimed towards efficient use of resources by re-connecting crop and livestock production through animal manure processing. The processing results in animal manure derivatives such as liquid fraction (LF) of digestate, <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> and air scrubber water, that might have potential to be used as alternatives for synthetic nitrogen (N) fertilizers. The dissertation investigated N fertilizer performance of these materials with regard to crop yield and soil properties on laboratory, greenhouse and field scale. Results showed that LF of digestate, air scrubber water and <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> can be used as synthetic N fertilizer substitutes without adverse effects on crop yield. With regard to environmental aspects, it seems that these materials should not additionally increase the risk of nitrate leaching as compared to conventional fertilization practices. Some of their characteristics (e. g. form, nutrient concentration, stability) differ from the characteristics of synthetic N fertilizers, however their N performance indicates the potential of labelling LF of digestate, ASW and <b>mineral</b> <b>concentrate</b> as processed mineral fertilizers on European fertilizer market...|$|E
