40|$|Scaffolds for tissue {{engineering}} {{can be either}} natural or synthetic materials. The latter allow control of chemical, physical and mechanical properties and also provide support and shape, however they are not of biological origin, and therefore could not promote cell adhesion. This problem does not occur in natural materials however, they have the drawback of having non-suitable mechanical properties and tend to deteriorate too fast. In this work we study the influence of different substrate on the metabolic as well as proliferative cells activity. In particular 4 substrates have been considered: (i) <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> StageFlexer (<b>silicone</b> elastomer), (ii) Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), (iii) PDMS {{with a layer of}} carbon nanotubes (CNT’s) and (iv) PDMS with a layer of ceramic whiskers. The results of both tests (metabolic and proliferative capacity) showed that the PDMS without any surface treatment, is the worst of the tested substrates. The reason {{is to be found in}} the fact that the PDMS is highly hydrophobic and therefore cells have low adhesion to the substrate. This represents a major limitation of PDMS and its functionalization is necessary to improve cell adhesion. Cells placed on PDMS samples with CNT’s show higher metabolic activity and proliferative capacity, compared to the PDMS and PDMS treated with fibronectin. However, the best outcomes have occurred with the PDMS substrate coated with ceramic whiskers...|$|R
40|$|Background: Substrates {{in medical}} science are {{hydrophilic}} polymers undergoing volume expansion {{when exposed to}} culture medium that influenced on cell attachment. Although crosslinking by chemical agents could reduce water uptake and promote mechanical properties, these networks would release crosslinking agents. In order to overcome this weakness, silicone rubber is used and reinforced by nanoclay [...] Objectives: Attempts {{have been made to}} prepare nanocomposites based on <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> HTV <b>silicone</b> rubber (SR) and organo-modified montmorillonite (OMMT) nanoclay with varying amounts of clay compositions [...] Materials and Methods: Incorporation of nanocilica platelets into SR matrix was carried out via melt mixing process taking advantage of a Brabender internal mixer. The tensile elastic modulus of nanocomposites was measured by performing tensile tests on the samples. Produced polydimetylsiloxane (PDMS) composites with different flexibilities and crosslink densities were employed as substrates to investigate biocompatibility, cell compaction, and differential behaviors [...] Results: The results presented here revealed successful nanocomposite formation with SR and OMMT, resulting in strong PDMS-based materials. The results showed that viability, proliferation, and spreading of cells are governed by elastic modulus and stiffness of samples. Furthermore, adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) cultured on PDMS and corresponding nanocomposites could retain differentiation potential of osteocytes in response to soluble factors, indicating that inclusion of OMMT would not prevent osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, better spread out and proliferation of cells was observed in nanocomposite samples [...] Conclusions: Considering cell behavior and mechanical properties of nanobiocomposites it could be concluded that silicone rubber substrate filled by nanoclay are a good choice for further experiments in tissue engineering and medical regeneration due to its cell compatibility and differentiation capacity...|$|R

40|$|Patients who {{undergo a}} total {{laryngectomy}} usually receive a silicone rubber voice prosthesis for voice rehabilitation. Unfortunately, biofilm formation on the esophageal side of voice prostheses limits their lifetime to 3 - 4 mon on average. The effects of repeated argon plasma treatment of <b>medical</b> <b>grade,</b> hydrophobic <b>silicone</b> rubber on in vitro adhesion {{and growth of}} bacteria and yeasts isolated from voice prostheses, {{as well as in}} vivo biofilm formation are presented here. In vitro experiments demonstrated that initial microbial adhesion over a 4 h time span to plasma-treated, hydrophilized, silicone rubber was generally less than on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber, both in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film on the biomaterial. Growth studies over a time period of 14 d at 37 degrees C in a modified Robbins device, showed that fewer Candida cells adhered on plasma-treated, hydrophilized silicone rubber as compared to on original, hydrophobic silicone rubber. For the in vivo evaluation of biofilm formation on plasma-treated silicone rubber voice prostheses, seven laryngectomized patients received a partly hydrophilized "Groningen Button" voice prosthesis for a planned evaluation period of 4 wk. After removal of the voice prostheses, the border between the hydrophilized and the original, hydrophobic side of the prostheses was clearly visible. However, biofilm formation was, unexpectedly, less on the original, hydrophobic sides, although the microbial compositions of the biofilms on both sides were not significantly different. Summarizing, this study demonstrates that in vitro microbial adhesion and growth on silicone rubber can be reduced by plasma treatment, but in vivo biofilm formation on silicone rubber voice prostheses is oppositely enhanced by hydrophilizing the silicone rubber surface. Nevertheless, from {{the results of this study}} the important conclusion can be drawn that in vivo biofilm formation on voice prostheses is controlled by the hydrophobicity of the biomaterials surface used.

50|$|In 2011, {{concerns}} were expressed as information arose {{in regards to}} the quality of the material being used in silicone breast implants. Industrial <b>grade</b> <b>silicone</b> was being utilised in the replacement of <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> supplies by a French firm by the name of Poly Implant Prothese (PIP). The silicone being used was found to be suitable for uses within the production of mattresses. In 2011, it was reported that in twelve years of production, more than 300,000 PIP implants were sold globally. In the case of rupture the dispute around safety risks arose with parties debating the increase cancer risks due to the poor grade materials. To date there has been no scientific evidence proving the implants should cause safety concerns linking to toxicity or cancer. The debate surrounds whether the removal of the implants is required due to safety concerns around rupture and toxicity.|$|R

50|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) is a potentially fatal bacterial illness. Scientists have recognized {{an association between}} TSS and tampon use, although the exact connection remains unclear. TSS caused by menstrual cup use appears to be very rare to virtually nonexistent. The probable {{reason for this is}} that menstrual cups are not absorbent, do not irritate the vaginal mucosal tissue, nor do they change the vaginal flora in any measurable amount. Conversely, vaginal dryness and abrasions may occur when women use tampons which are more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Research has shown that the cup has no impact on the vaginal flora, which means there is no effect on the presence of S. aureus, the bacterium that can cause TSS. The risk of TSS associated with cervical caps used for contraception in the female barrier method is also very low. Cervical caps are similar to menstrual cups with regards to the material used: mostly <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> <b>silicone</b> or latex.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Rehabilitation of the congenitally malformed {{external}} ear (microtia) with <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> <b>silicone</b> {{in a young}} 21 year old male. Background: Loss of an auricle {{may be due to}} congenital disease, trauma, or surgical removal of benign or malignant tumors. Auricular defects can be repaired, or reconstructed with autogenous tissue, but this has its own limitations and additional surgical co morbidities. A good alternative is to develop an auricular prosthesis. To obtain an accurate morphology of prosthetic ear various methods have been used making use of technology. However, still the most commonly used method involves manual sculpting of the prosthetic ear and final prosthesis fabrication using medical grade silicon. Case Report: Patient presented with microtia involving right ear. Impression of defective and normal ear was made followed by sculpting of defective ear replicating the normal morphologic contours using clay. Room temperature vulcanizing <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> <b>silicone</b> colour was matched as per the patient’s skin tone and packed in a three piece mold for converting.

40|$|Background A {{perforation}} in {{the nasal}} septum can cause {{symptoms such as}} bleeding, obstruction, crusts and pain, and {{can be a challenge}} to treat. Surgery is the treatment of choice, but disease, size of the perforation, or the patient’s wish may contradict surgery. A custom-made silicone obturator is a successful treatment option, but little is known how this treatment affects the microbial flora. The purposes of this thesis were (i) to investigate the microbial flora around symptomatic nasal septal perforations before treatment, (ii) during and after a 12 -month treatment period with a custom-made obturator, (iii) to compare the microbial flora around symptomatic perforations with the flora from the same area of the septum in healthy individuals, (iv) to investigate the microbial colonization of the silicone obturator, and (v) also to investigate the water sorption, solubility and if the wettability of silicones are affected by water. The hypotheses were (i) that the bacterial flora around symptomatic perforations would not differ from that found in healthy individuals, apart from a possible presence of Helicobacter pylori; (ii) the bacterial flora would change in composition during the course of treatment and that microorganisms and proteins could be seen {{on the surface of the}} silicone obturators; (iii) a material that has adsorbed water would also show an increase in wettability and the surface free energy of the material.  Methods Twenty-seven patients and 101 healthy individuals volunteered. Swabs were made around the rim of the perforation, or on the septum in the locus Kisselbachi area in the healthy individuals. Bacteria and fungi were isolated and identified with standard laboratory techniques. A biopsy of the granulated tissue at the perforation was taken and cultivated for Helicobacter pylori. Swabs were also taken three, six and twelve months after inserting the obturator. The obturator was analysed after being used twelve months in the nose.  Seven silicones were tested for water sorption and solubility according to ISO standards 1567 : 1999 and ISO 10477 : 2004. The change in wettability was examined by measuring the contact angle with a contact goniometer at various stages of the sorption/solubility test. Results Staphylococcus aureus was present in 88 % of the untreated patients. With treatment a significant reduction of S. aureus occurred to 54. 5 % (p< 0. 05). In the healthy group S. aureus was present in 13 % of the subjects. No Helicobacter pylori could be cultivated from the biopsies taken of the granulated tissue at the perforation. The flora round the untreated perforation was dominated by S. aureus with few other bacterial species detected. In the healthy group there was a diversified flora with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. SEM revealed a rough surface on the silicone obturator and crazing of the silicone surrounding the pigment granules. Both bacteria and proteins could be seen on the obturators in SEM. Candida albicans was detected in one obturator, but not in the mucosal swab at the corresponding time. That patient had, however, been treated for Candida in the nose six months prior to the last visit in the study. Wettability was affected but did not increase with amount of adsorbed water. Some materials showed an increase and some a decrease in the surface-free energy. The tested addition silicones showed little sorption and solubility. Conclusions The patients with symptomatic perforations of the nasal septum had a bacterial flora totally dominated by S. aureus. The massive presence of S. aureus around symptomatic perforations may have an impact on the persistence of the granulated and inflamed tissue present in symptomatic perforations, thus forming a vicious circle with bleeding and crustation. S. aureus dominance in the mucosa surrounding symptomatic perforations was diminished by using a custom-made obturator. The microbial flora became more diversified with the treatment, although not resembling the flora in healthy individuals. The microbial flora of the obturators was similar, but not the same as the corresponding mucosal flora. The discovery of Candida in the obturator of a patient who had been treated for Candida in the nose six months earlier suggests that obturators need to be exchanged when fungal infections are being treated to prevent the fungus from re-infecting the patient at a later stage. The silicone had a rough surface and a poor wettability, both aspects favours colonization of microorganisms. The silicone was negatively affected by the colouring pigments, this should be considered when colouring is not necessary. The slight, but existing solubility of silicones emphasises the importance of using <b>medical</b> <b>grade</b> <b>silicones</b> that are more purified than industrial silicones. ...|$|R
