40|$|<b>Mirincamycin,</b> a {{lincomycin}} derivative with unequivocal but limited activity {{against the}} pre-erythrocytic and persisting exoerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium cynomolgi, has been evaluated for capacity {{to enhance the}} radical curative potential of the conventional primaquine-chloroquine combination. Established infections with sporozoites of the above plasmodium in rhesus monkeys served this evaluation. The {{results showed that the}} dose of primaquine required for cure of 50 % of active infections was reduced by one-half to two-thirds by coadministration with 2. 5 mg of <b>mirincamycin</b> per kg, 1 / 16 the 50 % curative dose of this lincomycin derivative when used in a mono-drug regimen. The dimensions of the enhancement of the curative activity of primaquine were inversely related {{to the size of the}} sporozoite inoculum. The smallest dose of <b>mirincamycin</b> productive of enhancement was 2. 5 mg/kg; whether doses larger than 2. 5 mg/kg would have been more effective was not determined. There is much to be done before it is known whether a mirincamycin-primaquine combination is useful for suppressive cure or radical cure of the human malarias. Irrespective of that result, the current study serves to focus attention on a somewhat novel approach to the development of more effective and better-tolerated regimens for radical cure, an alternative to the empirical chemical synthesis and screening approach that has dominated searches heretofore...|$|E

40|$|We {{assessed}} the in vitro activity of <b>mirincamycin,</b> a lincosamide antibiotic, against Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates from Gabon. Growth {{was determined by}} HRP 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using an adapted protocol with a prolonged incubation time (6 days) to account for antibiotic-induced delayed death. Mirincamycin's cis and trans isomers are more active (median 50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50 s], 3. 2 nM and 2. 6 nM) than the comparator drugs clindamycin (IC 50, 12 nM) and doxycycline (IC 50, 720 nM), and therefore, further clinical development is promising...|$|E
40|$|The pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and ex vivo {{antimalarial}} {{activity of}} <b>mirincamycin</b> isomers {{in a healthy}} rhesus monkey model were assessed to support lead optimization of novel nonhemolytic drugs for radical cure and causal prophylaxis of malaria. Fourteen male rhesus monkeys were randomized to four groups, which included cis and trans isomers by the oral and intravenous routes, with vehicle-only controls for each dosing route. Concentration-time data were collected for 7 days and were analyzed by noncompartmental analysis. cis-Mirincamycin had an absolute oral bioavailability of 13. 6 %, which was slightly {{higher than that of}} trans-mirincamycin (11. 7 %), but this difference was not statistically significant. There was a statistically significant difference between the area under the concentration-time curve from zero to 48 h (AUC 0 â€“ 48) of cis-mirincamycin and that of trans-mirincamycin after oral dosing. When cultured in vitro with the W 2 clone of Plasmodium falciparum, the 50 % inhibitory concentrations for cis-mirincamycin, trans-mirincamycin, and dihydroartemisinin were 11, 300, 12, 300, and 2. 30 nM, respectively. However, when dosed primate plasma was cultured ex vivo against the W 2 clone, both isomers had much greater relative potencies than their in vitro activities relative to results for dihydroartemisinin, an increase of approximately 100 -fold for the cis isomer and 150 -fold for the trans isomer. Further, oral ex vivo activity was significantly higher than intravenous activity for both isomers, particularly during the first 90 min following dosing, suggesting the first-pass formation of one or more metabolites with blood-stage antimalarial activity. Identification of the metabolic pathways and metabolites may help to further delineate the properties of this class of drugs with previously demonstrated liver-stage antimalarial activity...|$|E
