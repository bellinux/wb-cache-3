25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} internal baffles which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a <b>monitoring</b> <b>instrument</b> before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E

Detailed investigation in to the factors responsible for roof fall was carried out in an underground coal mine situated in Central India. The investigation was supplemented by In-situ stress assessment by drilling yield measurements and convergence recording by strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments.</b> It was observed that strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> gives early indications about initiation of strata movement and potential roof fall. The proper analysis and interpretation of the readings from strata <b>monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> is very much helpful in updating the risk assessment and preventing the roof fall by risk management...|$|R

Flight activity at Jakarta's airport was normal, and Yogyakarta's airport was closed until Monday 15 November. On the morning of 11 November, the volcano was ejecting ash [...] into the air. High-level clouds were observed over the Indian Ocean and {{were thought to be}} volcanic ash-bearing. A code-red aviation alert was continued, and at 16:41 a volcanic ash plume was seen to be extending to , FL250 extending to [...] to the west. It had been observed earlier that day travelling 150 nautical miles to the north west as it had the day prior. The volcano was observed on 4–8 November by the Ozone <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Instrument</b> (OMI) on NASA's Aura spacecraft and imagery indicated that a sulfur dioxide plume had been released into the upper troposphere. Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas that can harm human health and cool earth's climate. Besides elevating the risk of acid rain, the ions can also react to form particles that reflect sunlight. On 9 November 2010, the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre in Darwin, Australia, also reported a sulfur-dioxide cloud over the Indian Ocean between , in the upper troposphere.|$|E

40|$|In sports, the {{importance}} of optimizing the recovery–stress state is critical. Effective recovery from intense training loads often faced by elite athletes can often determine sporting success or failure. In recent decades, athletes, coaches, and sport scientists have been keen to find creative, new methods for improving {{the quality and quantity}} of training for athletes. These efforts have consistently faced barriers, including overtraining, fatigue, injury, illness, and burnout. Physiological and psychological limits dictate a need for research that addresses the avoidance of overtraining, maximizes recovery, and successfully negotiates the fine line between high and excessive training loads. <b>Monitoring</b> <b>instruments</b> like the Recovery–Stress Questionnaire for Athletes can assist with this research by providing a tool to assess their perceived state of recovery.
