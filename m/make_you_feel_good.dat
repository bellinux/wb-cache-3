500|$|Along with {{a talking}} drum, Badu used tuning forks when {{recording}} New Amerykah Part One to evoke a certain feeling through its frequency, a practice {{she had done}} on her previous albums: [...] "Each tuning fork has a certain vibrational energy that is conducive to a feeling or a color or a smell. They're related to different chakras in the body, too. Some may <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> or sexy or conscious of what you're saying." [...] The album was mastered at Electric Lady Studios in February 2008. Before it was edited down to 11 tracks, New Amerykah Part One was originally intended as a double album, with 18 songs over two discs.|$|E
500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> to see me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Erotica is {{a concept}} album about sex and romance, on which she {{incorporated}} an alter-ego named Mistress Dita, heavily inspired by actress Dita Parlo. Musically, it is a pop and dance record which incorporates elements from classic disco, modern house, techno and new jack swing. Lyrically, the album played on innuendos and double entendres instead of explicit words. [...] "Erotica" [...] is the opening track from the album. Starting with Madonna saying [...] "My name is Dita", she invites her lover to be passive, while she tells him to [...] "do as I say" [...] and leads him to explore boundaries between pain and pleasure. It deals with sex hang-ups, and {{has been described as}} [...] "an ode to S". Her cover version of [...] "Fever" [...] follows the title track. It is described as a [...] "sassy, house-style remake" [...] of the pop standard. The third track, [...] "Bye Bye Baby," [...] starts with the declaration, [...] "This is not a love song," [...] and goes on to ask questions of a lover she is about to abandon. At one point, Madonna asks angrily: [...] "Does it <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> to see me cry?" [...] The fourth track from Erotica, [...] "Deeper and Deeper," [...] is described as one of the [...] "pure disco" [...] moments of the album. Its bridge features a flamenco guitar, and its lyrics talk about sexual obsession.|$|E

2500|$|Unterberger {{concluded}} that the song [...] "is about a relationship that’s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about {{to keep it going}} just the same…until the chorus, at which point he decides that it’s not worth the trouble. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it’s still stirring, beautiful in its own weird way, and undeniably unforgettable. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way." [...] Kevin Richardson, member of the band, explained in an interview that, [...] "Ultimately the song really doesn't make much sense." [...] Richardson also wrote that Max Martin, who co-wrote and co-produced the song, barely spoke English. [...] "His English has gotten much better, but at the time...," [...] said Richardson. [...] "There are a lot of songs out there like that don't make sense," [...] he continues, [...] "but <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> when you sing along to them, and that's one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adele Reinhartz {{writes that}} the [...] "depth of Jules's transformation" [...] is {{indicated}} by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: [...] "In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness... In the second... {{he appears to be}} a different sort of man altogether... n true postmodern fashion, [...] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation." [...] Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him [...] "that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life"; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture. Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: [...] "he spiritual awakening at the end of Pulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may <b>make</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good,</b> but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser." ...|$|E
