5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E

5|$|Reactive {{arthritis}} {{occurs in}} 1% of people following infections with Campylobacter species, and Guillain–Barré syndrome occurs in 0.1%. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) may occur due to infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli or Shigella species, causing low platelet counts, poor kidney function, and low {{red blood cell}} count (due to their breakdown). Children are more predisposed to getting HUS than adults. Some viral infections <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> benign infantile seizures.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> a roaring sound.|$|E
5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity. A further environmental advantage is that algae grow in such ponds and consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, although algae <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> toxic chemicals that make the water unusable.|$|E

5|$|The main {{treatment}} for obesity consists of dieting and physical exercise. Diet programs <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> weight loss over the short term, but maintaining this weight loss is frequently difficult and often requires making exercise {{and a lower}} food energy diet a permanent part of a person's lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|There {{is as yet}} no {{explanation}} for why similar abnormal parenting <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited. The issue of temperament and its influence {{on the development of}} attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment vary widely.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E

5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until weaned around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Like Profit making organisations, nonprofits {{and governments}} will produce Consolidated Financial Statements. These are {{generated}} {{in line with}} the reporting requirements in the country they are based or if they are large enough they <b>may</b> <b>produce</b> them under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), an example of this is the UK based charity Oxfam. If the organisation is small it may use a cash basis accounting but larger ones generally use accrual basis accounting for their funds.|$|E
