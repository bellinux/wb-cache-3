It can accomplish this despite what initially {{appears to be a}} violation of conservation of energy because it {{can take advantage of the}} energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to [...] "require" [...] a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner. Ram pumps do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a new valving mechanism for portable pressurized spraying devices is described, where the propellant in the device is a safe gas (so-called compressed gas) propellant rather than the current liquefied gases {{all of which are}} either volatile organic compounds or greenhouse gases. The valve sprays a fixed volume of liquid when the spraying actuator is depressed, as is essential used medical sprays, such as pressurized metered dose inhalers and nasal sprays, and also for automatic (wall-mounted) aerosol delivery systems for air-fresheners, insecticides and disinfectants. For ‘compressed gas ’ aerosol formats, there is no flash vaporization of propellant so that pumping liquid from a <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> and atomization to form a spray must be achieved entirely by designing some means of using the pumping action of the gas in the container to act upon the liquid in the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber.</b> The new design utilizes a loosely fitting spherical piston element and a simple arrangement of a concentric housing and a moveable valve stem, such that liquid flow paths between the different elements are automatically closed and opened in the correct time sequence when the valve stem is depressed and released. Spraying data show excellent repeatability of liquid sprayed per pulse throughout the lifetime of device and drop sizes that are acceptable for devices such as air-fresheners and nasal sprays. The valve has only one additional component compared with liquefied gas metered valves and can be straightforwardly injection moulded. As will be explained, previous attempts failed due to expense, complexity and unreliability...|$|E

40|$|Conventional aerosol {{delivery}} {{systems and the}} availability of new technologies have {{led to the development of}} “intelligent” nebulizers such as the I-neb Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) System. Based on the AAD technology, the I-neb AAD System has been designed to continuously adapt to changes in the patient's breathing pattern, and to pulse aerosol only during the inspiratory part of the breathing cycle. This eliminates waste of aerosol during exhalation, and creates a foundation for precise aerosol (dose) delivery. To facilitate the delivery of precise metered doses of aerosol to the patient, a unique <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> design has been developed. Through the vibrating mesh technology, the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> design, and the AAD Disc function, the aerosol output rate and metered (delivered) dose can be tailored to the demands of the specific drug to be delivered. In the I-neb AAD System, aerosol delivery is guided through two algorithms, one for the Tidal Breathing Mode (TBM), and one for slow and deep inhalations, the Target Inhalation Mode (TIM). The aim of TIM is to reduce the treatment time by increasing the total inhalation time per minute, and to increase lung deposition by reducing impaction in the upper airways through slow and deep inhalations. A key feature of the AAD technology is the patient feedback mechanisms that are provided to guide the patient on delivery performance. These feedback signals, which include visual, audible, and tactile forms, are configured in a feedback cascade that leads to a high level of compliance with the use of the I-neb AAD System. The I-neb Insight and the Patient Logging System facilitate a further degree of sophistication to the feedback mechanisms, by providing information on long term adherence and compliance data. These can be assessed by patients and clinicians via a Web-based delivery of information in the form of customized graphical analyses...|$|E
40|$|A {{correlation}} equation for {{the mass}} median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol emitted by solution metered dose inhalers (MDIs) is presented. A content equivalent diameter is defined and used to describe aerosols generated by evaporating metered dose inhaler sprays.

Using dimensional analysis, the mass median content equivalent diameter is correlated with formulation variables. Based on this correlation in combination with mass balance considerations and {{the definition of the}} aerodynamic diameter, an equation for prediction of the MMAD of an inhaler given the pressure of the propellant in the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> of the MDI valve and the surface tension of the propellant is derived.

In order to use straw-bales as a building material, the characteristic values of the thermal performances should be determined.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fraction}} of the emitted dose from an inhaler {{that has the potential}} to be deposited into the lungs is known as the fine particle dose (also the respirable dose). During inhalation all dry powder inhalers require a ‘force’ to be created inside the device so that a fine particle dose is generated from the formulation in the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber.</b> This ‘force’ is formed by the inhalation rate used together with the resistance (and hence design) inside an inhaler. Studies have shown that the fine particle dose is related to the clinical effect whilst other studies have reported that this dose can be dependent on the inhalation rate used. The inhalation technique recommended by the manufacturer of an inhaled device should, therefore, be used. For those dry powder inhalers that demonstrate significant flow dependent dosage emission it is important that patients use the most desirable rate that has been reported. The In-Check Dial is a simple and ease to use meter that can be used to measure the inhalation rate of a patient when they use each of the commonly prescribed inhalers that are currently available. This meter can be used to identify the most suitable inhaler for each individual...|$|E

Changes may {{have been made to}} this work since it was submitted for publication. A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] many drug dispensing devices, such as syringes and inhalers, a rubber disk is used as a seal. During device actuation the seal is subjected to friction which in turn causes its deformation. This can lead to suboptimal performance of the device and consequent variability in delivered dose. Seal friction is complex, arising from adhesion of rubber in contact with the moving interface, viscous action of a thin film of fluid and deformation of seal asperities. Therefore, the first step in understanding the conjunctional behaviour of rubber seals is the fundamental study of mechanisms of friction generation. A developed model can then be validated against measurements. The validated model can then be used to predict product performance, robustness and variability due to manufacturing tolerances. A friction model, based on the aforementioned mechanisms, for prediction of seal friction has been developed and validated against measured friction tests performed on both nano and component level scales. Pressure changes in the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> have been taken into account in the model. Friction data are presented for nitrile rubber, using a silicon nitride AFM tip for nano-scale interactions and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) for asperity interactions at a component level, where a traditional friction test apparatus is utilised. Reasonable agreement is found between measurements and model predictions for the nano-scale coefficient of friction of rubber against silicon nitride. Similarly, good agreement has been obtained for the mean coefficient of friction of rubber against PBT. It was found that the model was capable of predicting static friction coefficient reasonably well and the contribution to the coefficient of friction was mostly due to adhesive friction. The inputs of viscous and ploughing friction were negligible...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, Calibrated Hot Box {{measurements}} {{on two different}} types of fenestration systems (one window and one glazing unit) are presented. The research program included: renovation of the University of Massachusetts Hot Box test facility, an analysis of measurement uncertainty, experimental refinements to the test method ruggedness 2 ̆ 7, calibration of the extraneous heat transfer of the Hot Box, and a numerical analysis of the two-dimensional heat transfer in the Hot Box. The finite element method was also used to analyze the heat transfer (thermal transmittance) for each of the fenestration systems tested. These analytical results are then compared with experimental results obtained from Hot Box measurements. ^ Renovation consistent with existing ASTM standards aimed at improving the precision of test method with the University of Massachusetts Calibrated Hot Box test facility were conducted and documented. The uncertainty of the Hot Box measurement results was estimated from an uncertainty analysis of the thermal transmittance. Ruggedness experiments consistent with ASTM test method E 1169 – 89 (1999) were performed, and results enabled the researcher to refine the hot box measurement methodology and reduce the variability of the measurements. Finally, hot box calibration experiments were designed and performed in order to account for the various heat transfer losses in the hot box so that the more accurate measurements of the net heat transfer through a fenestration system may be produced. ^ Using a finite element method, two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical heat transfer analyses of the calibrated hot box and fenestration systems were conducted.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) poses a critical, yet historically understated {{threat to}} global public health. Recent mutations in the enterobacteriaceae genome that confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, {{have made some}} virtually untreatable. Currently, antibiotics are prescribed largely on guesswork, {{with little or no}} prior evidence as to their efficacy. This not only accelerates the spread of AMR, but endangers patient's lives in the process. To counter this, new tools are required which can rapidly identify a pathogen's susceptibility to an antibiotic prior to administration. Traditional procedures are labour-intensive, taking several days - with sample preparation and cell-culture being the primary bottlenecks. A novel, proof-of concept system was developed to rapidly determine antibiotic resistance in pathogens using nucleic acid analysis. The system comprised of a plastic microfluidic cartridge, control software, optical reader and *control hardware*. E. coli were captured, concentrated and lysed within the device; DNA could be amplified on-chip using rapid, isothermal DNA amplification (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification). The assay identified samples containing the CTX-M resistance gene; the limit of detection was 500 copies (in 50 l), as measured by the reader's integrated fluorescence microscope. Each component was validated prior to integration into the final system. Concentrations of E. coli equivalent to a urinary-tract-infection (100, 000 Colony Forming Units/ mL) were captured with up to 98 % efficiency from 1 ml suspensions onto functionalised, 0. 5 m magnetic, ion-exchange beads. These were isolated on-chip by a NdFeB magnet, providing up to 96 % bead-capture and a 100 x volume reduction. An oil compartmentalised the aqueous samples within the chip, while thermal control was achieved by coupling a resistive heater to an IR camera. Fluid routing was managed by bespoke, in-line, solenoid-controlled valves, which could operate at 5 -bar and for over 4000 cycles without degrading. Bacteria were thermally or chemically lysed post-concentration, and an on-chip <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> aliquoted fixed-volumes of buffer (1 % uncertainty for 400 nl). DNA from lysed bacteria was amplified on-chip with a limit of detection of 250 E. coli per sample in the final assay. Both sample-preparation and DNA amplification performed well on the prototype system. However, inefficient bacterial elution on-chip post-capture prevented the steps being run sequentially, as insufficient bacteria were released to the lysis region. Future development would fully integrate sample transfer and automate the fluid actuation so as to enable complete sample-in, answer-out capability...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Many factors {{contribute}} to the high variability of doses delivered to the lungs of patients using metered dose inhalers (MDIs). Relatively {{little attention has been}} paid to the contribution to this variability of the way in which the MDI is handled before the inhalation manoeuvre. Instruction leaflets often recommend procedures at odds with those used for in vitro testing of the device. The standard protocol for in vitro assessment of salbutamol MDIs involves shaking the MDI vigorously for 30 seconds and wasting the first two actuations. Subsequent actuations are introduced into the testing device at five second intervals. Patient instructions do not include a recommendation to waste the first two actuations and recommend a delay of one minute between actuations. A series of experiments was performed to determine whether such differences might be important. METHODS [...] The total and "respirable" doses delivered by a salbutamol MDI (Ventolin, Allen & Hanburys) under various conditions were assessed with a multistage liquid impinger. The quantity of drug deposited on each stage was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method. The effect on the delivered dose of not shaking the canister, not wasting the first two doses, waiting 30 seconds between actuations, and using multiple rapid actuations was assessed by comparing the results with those obtained using the standard in vitro testing protocol. RESULTS [...] Compared with a standard protocol, it was found that not shaking the MDI before use reduced the total and "respirable" dose by 25. 5 % and 35. 7 %, respectively. The dose delivered when actuating the MDI at 30 second intervals was no different from that when intervals was no different from that when intervals of five seconds were used. Two actuations separated by one second had no effect on the total dose but reduced the "respirable" dose by 15. 8 %, while four rapid actuations reduced the total and "respirable" doses by 8. 2 % and 18. 2 %, respectively. Storing the MDI stem down reduced the total and "respirable" dose delivered in the first actuation by 25. 0 % and 23. 3 % despite shaking the MDI before use. CONCLUSIONS [...] MDIs containing drug in suspension must be shaken before use to resuspend the drug contained in the MDI, but shaking does not alter the composition of the suspension in the <b>metering</b> <b>chamber</b> and hence the dose in the first actuation remains low. Very rapid actuations can reduce the dose delivered per actuation, but salbutamol MDIs can be actuated immediately after a 10 second breath holding pause without affecting the dose delivered...|$|E

Documentation of the Plant Growth Module was discussed. The last day's discussion focused on the organization of the research group to be involved in the development and use of a two to three cubic <b>meter</b> sealed <b>chamber</b> and ancillary equipment...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are {{challenging}} and efficient {{in a large}} field of applications like object location or distance determination between sensor nodes. In this paper are presented some considerations concerning the method of distance estimation between WSN nodes using the RF power level received by one sensor node. The experimental determinations were made using a WSN system composed of ten wireless modules (one coordinator module and nine WSN nodes). The RF power level received by a sensor node was measured at variable distances, and the dBm values recorded were then used in the distance determination formula. The tests were made in a 3 <b>meters</b> semi-anechoic <b>chamber</b> - in order the results not {{to be affected by}} other radio frequency emissions from the surrounding environment - using a 20 Hz- 26. 5 GHz EMI Test Receiver, a log-periodic antenna and RF cables...|$|R
40|$|The {{high energy}} bubble chamber {{experiments}} performed at DPhPE {{are devoted to}} the K/sup -/p interaction at 14. 3 GeV/c, K/sup +or-/p at 32 GeV/c and pp at 69 GeV/c. The pictures are taken in the 2 <b>meters</b> bubble <b>chamber</b> at CERN and in the 4. 5 meters, Mirabelle, at Serpukhov. The reactions which are studied are on one hand, two body or quasi two body reactions, {{and on the other}} hand, the multibody reactions. The first ones are dominated by diffractive processes in which one of the incident particle remains in its initial state while the other one is fragmented into a few particles. The second kind of reactions, whose contribution increases with energy, are studied by means of the momentum distributions of a single well defined particle; these distributions are compared to the theoretical scaling predictions.

40|$|In many drug {{dispensing}} devices, such as syringes and inhalers, an elatomeric gasket is used {{to prevent}} the formulation from leaking from the chamber. During device actuation, the seal is subjected to friction, which in turn causes its deformation and can cause unintentional leakage, thus dose variability. Additionally, friction of seal is responsible {{for a host of}} potential problems such undue effort required for actuation and potential wear. The mechanism of friction generation in the seal conjunction is complex, arising from adhesion of rubber in contact with the moving interface, viscous action of a thin film of fluid and deformation of seal asperities. Therefore, the first step in understanding the conjunctional behaviour of rubber seals is a fundamental study of mechanisms of friction generation. A developed model can then be validated against measurements and used at a later stage to predict product performance, robustness and variability due to manufacturing tolerances. A friction model, based on the aforementioned mechanisms, for prediction of seal friction has been developed and validated against measured friction tests performed at both nano and component level scales. Pressure changes in the <b>metered</b> <b>chamber</b> have been taken into account in the model. Friction data are presented for nitrile rubber, using a silicon nitride AFM tip for nano-scale interactions and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) for asperity interactions at a component level, where a traditional friction test apparatus is utilised. Reasonable agreement is found between measurements and model predictions for the nano-scale coefficient of friction of rubber against silicon nitride. Similarly, good agreement has been obtained for the mean coefficient of friction of rubber against PBT. It is found that dominant mechanism of friction is adhesion. For the typical asperity geometry of such seals and the usual low sliding speeds the other friction contributions, viscous shear and asperity deformation are negligible. However, {{this is not the case}} in many other seals or gaskets in other applications such as in hydraulic actuators...|$|R
40|$|The role {{which the}} ocean plays {{with respect to}} the {{atmospheric}} sulfur budget is still unclear. It is known that the ocean is an important source of sulfat-containing particles, but opinions differ on the question: Is the ocean a sink or a source of SO, and H,S? In this paper, on the basis of laboratory investigations, the absorption and desorption of SO, by sea water is discussed. The results of our measurements show that the ocean is an SO,-sink and presumably cannot be a direct SO,-source. The possibility of an indirect source of SO, is considered in a discussion of current literature on H,S-oxidation in ocean water. It is often assumed that cloud and rain drops, wet soils, rivers, lakes, and oceans are important sinks of the SO, emitted into the atmosphere. Although cloud and rain drops can indeed absorb SO, to a great extent, Hales et al. (1970) have shown that, under certain circumstances, some of the SO, can also be desorbed. Less well known is the absorption-desorption behavior of wet soils and oceans. Despite the fact that the oceans contain much sulfate and are an import-an t source of sulfate-containing particulates, the question of the ocean being a source or a sink of SO, and H,S remains open. I n order to balance the terrestrial sulfur budget some authors have considered the oceans to be a source (Kellog et al., 1972). Further investiga-tions of this matter are indicated. I n this paper the absorption-desorption characteristics of sea water are considered on the basis of simple bubble column experiments. Fig. 1 shows the essentials of the experimental set-up. As the bottled air passes through a large (2 x 1 x 1 <b>meters)</b> <b>chamber</b> containing sulfurous acid, it picks up SO, and water vapor. The mix-ture is then bubbled continuously through two absorption columns connected in series. The concentration of SO, is monitored constantly by a Picoflux electroconductivity meter. I n the first column, containing 40 ml of ocean water...|$|R
