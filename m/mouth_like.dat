5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the <b>mouth.</b> <b>Like</b> other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
25|$|The {{polymers}} {{that make}} up the main component of chewing gum base are hydrophobic. This property is essential because it allows for retention of physical properties throughout the mastication process. Because the polymers of gum repel water, the water-based saliva system in a consumer’s mouth will dissolve the sugars and flavorings in chewing gum, but not the gum base itself. This allows for gum to be chewed {{for a long period of}} time without breaking down in the <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> conventional foods. Chewing gum can be classified as a product containing a liquid phase and a crystalline phase, providing gum with its characteristic balance of plastic and elastic properties.|$|E

Parrotfishes eat algae growing on reef surfaces, utilizing <b>mouths</b> <b>like</b> beaks well adapted to scrape off their food.

The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".|$|E

He co-founded and served as the media spokesman for National Association for Change (NAC) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei in early 2010. The NAC's stated purpose is push for democratic and other reforms in Egypt. In May Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit brought a lawsuit for libel against Qandil {{in response to a}} critical column about Aboul Gheit and Egyptian foreign policy that Qandil wrote for Al-Shorouk, called [...] "The Homeland’s Disgrace and that of the Citizen." [...] In the column Qandil lambasted the contradictory statements made by Aboul Gheit and Egypt's ambassador to Israel, in which the latter said Israel was a friendly state, while Aboul Gheit had just previously stated that Israel was an enemy. Qandil wrote that the ambassador sought to cover up Aboul Gheit's statement, and that Aboul Gheit's words [...] "usually ... fall from his <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> droppings of a torn rubbish bag." [...] The matter was transferred to the criminal court. His relationship with Al-Shorouk consequently ended {{as a result of the}} controversy.|$|E

[...] "Partition" [...] was conceived as a two-part song, {{the first part of}} which is called [...] "Yoncé". The latter's original drumbeat was created by Timberlake on a bucket. Mike Dean then added the dropping 808's lead synths, claps and strings. Beyoncé described the sound that he created as [...] "organic" [...] and said, [...] "It reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you just start free-styling." [...] The trio decided to keep the buckets as Beyoncé wanted an organic production. Then The-Dream started writing some of the lyrics including, [...] "Yoncé all on his <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> liquor". Beyoncé found it awkward at the beginning but she soon loved the phrase, which lead to the birth of her new alter ego, Yoncé.

Andrew Barker of Variety magazine highlighted that among the songs that discuss sexuality on Beyoncé, [...] "none hold a candle to the absolutely scorching 'Partition'". He also praised how Beyoncé [...] "toss off a few old-school battle rhymes" [...] with the line, [...] "I sneezed on the beat, and the beat got sicker", being a standout. Similarly, Miles Marshall Lewis of Ebony magazine noted that lines like, [...] "I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker / Yoncé all on his <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> liquor", would make listeners smile.

2500|$|The {{description}} of the beast is found primarily in Revelation chapters thirteen and seventeen. Chapter thirteen gives the fullest description. John saw it [...] "rise {{up out of the}} sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy." [...] (...) It was like a leopard, with feet like the feet of a bear, and had a <b>mouth</b> <b>like</b> a lion. One of its heads had a mortal wound which healed itself, causing people to wonder at it and follow it. (...) This description draws many parallels with a vision in the Book of Daniel where four beasts symbolizing a succession of kingdoms come out of the sea in the forms of a lion, bear, leopard and a beast with ten horns. In Revelation chapter seventeen we learn of a third beast, scarlet in color and some of the symbols are explained. The prevailing view is that the scarlet beast is another, distinct, visualisation of the same subject as the beast of the sea, which is pictured with crowns on its horns, unlike the scarlet beast. The scarlet beast is shown being ridden by a harlot who [...] "reigns over the kings of the earth", (...) whereas the beast of the sea is not described as being ridden, and is given [...] "power and great authority." [...] The seven heads represent both seven mountains and seven kings, and the ten horns are ten kings who have not yet received kingdoms. Of the seven kings, five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come. The beast itself is an eighth king who is of the seven and was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition." ...|$|E

From the Torah, Rabban Gamaliel cited [...] "And the Lord said to Moses, ‘Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers and rise up [...]'" [...] But the sectarians replied that perhaps [...] reads, [...] "and the people will rise up." [...] From the Prophets, Rabban Gamaliel cited [...] "Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out its dead." [...] But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps [...] refers to the dead whom Ezekiel resurrected in [...] From the Writings, Rabban Gamaliel cited Song of Songs [...] "And the roof of your <b>mouth,</b> <b>like</b> the best wine of my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips {{of those who are}} asleep to speak." [...] (As the Rabbis interpreted Song of Songs as a dialogue between God and Israel, they understood [...] to refer to the dead, whom God will cause to speak again.) But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps [...] means merely that the lips of the departed will move. For Rabbi Johanan said that if a halachah (legal ruling) is said in any person's name in this world, the person's lips speak in the grave, as [...] says, [...] "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak."

[...] Rabban Gamaliel noted that God swore to give the land not [...] "to you" [...] (the Israelites whom Moses addressed) but [...] "to them" [...] (the Patriarchs, who had long since died).
