The American Rally was discontinued in 1977 {{along with all}} other Hornet-based VAM Americans. It would find a successor in the 1978 American Rally AMX model (VAM's version of the 1978 AMC Concord AMX), meaning the production in Mexico {{for the first time}} of AMC's hatchback coupe body style. Unlike the AMC Hornet X models, both the Hornet-based Rambler American Rally and American Rally were never available with V8 engines, automatic transmissions or column-mounted shifters.

25|$|Maggie is a {{character}} that appears in Arthur Miller's partially autobiographical play, After the Fall. She is both {{one of his most}} criticised and controversial characters, and one of his most famous ones. She is a thinly veiled version of Marilyn Monroe, Miller's former wife, and thus her suicide attempts after her and Quentin's divorce, and her depression is from reality. This {{is one of the reasons}} that reviews upon its first release were generally negative, owing to the similarities between fact and fiction. However, academic scholars find her to be one of the best, if not the best, of Miller's creations, as the play presents readers with a superb portrait of a woman facing a mental crisis. It also shows Monroe in comparison to the reasons for her marriage to Miller- for example, the fact that Miller took her seriously, and was ready to treat her as <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> object, like everybody else. Miller also highlights his own feelings after Monroe's death by showing Quentin's, and his regret that he had been unable to save her from herself.|$|E
25|$|Martha Nussbaum {{discusses}} how {{education is}} one of the fertile functions that is important {{for the development of a}} person and their ability to achieve a multitude of other capabilities within society. Autism causes many symptoms that interfere with a child’s ability to receive a proper education such as deficits in imitation, observational learning, and receptive and expressive communication. Of all disabilities affecting the population, autism ranks third lowest in acceptance into a postsecondary education institution. In a study funded by the National Institute of Health, Shattuck et al. found that only 35% of autistics are enrolled in a 2 or 4 year college within the first two years after leaving high school compared to 40% of children who have a learning disability. Due to the growing need for a college education to obtain a job, this statistic shows how autistics are at a disadvantage in gaining many of the capabilities that Nussbaum discusses and makes education more than just a type of therapy for those with autism. According to the study by Shattuck, only 55% of children with autism participated in any paid employment within the first two years after high school. Furthermore, those with autism that come from low income families tend to have lower success in postsecondary schooling. Due to these issues, education has become <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> issue of therapy for those with autism but also a social issue.|$|E

The Observer declared it [...] "one of the outstanding theatrical events not only of this year, but of the decade". The Independents critic described it as [...] "the most extraordinary piece of community-specific theatre I've ever beheld".

Asides attention to detail, Babalola paid as {{much attention to the}} script trying to relive the experience of the 1960s and tying it perfectly to the British way of governing us, our tribal issues and our eventual independence. It [...] was pieced together wonderfully and creatively executed. October 1 is a must see for all". Wilfred Okiche of YNaija praised its production design, and concluded: [...] "In many ways, October 1 is a typical Kunle Afolayan film, what with the ensemble cast, big budget, period setting, ambitious story and dark psychological suspense. But where he does not leave an indelible mark on the film, one that will in future days be identified as the Afolayan touch. He proves once again and maybe {{for the first time in}} film this year, that ambition is good and no one can represent Nigeria better than Nigerians. Nollywood is rising indeed, and October 1 is a shining example". Amarachukwu Iwuala of Pulse NG praised the subtle themes in the film, while noting Kayode Olaiya as the highlight performance, and concluded that although [...] "October 1 is not fast-paced, the action nonetheless unravels at a rate that keeps everyone in suspense. The film aptly integrates several interesting subplots; smartly employing subtext and irony. This 140-minute picture is another feat for Nollywood". Augustine Ogwo of News Wire comments: [...] "October 1 is brilliant, thought-provoking and timeless. October 1 preaches the truth and it does so from an artistic point of view. Kudos must be given to Tunde Babalola for writing such an amazing script and also to the producer/director of this movie for breathing life into the story. October 1 is such a good movie that it has the power to plunge every well meaning Nigerian into a reflective mood and possibly positive action".|$|E
