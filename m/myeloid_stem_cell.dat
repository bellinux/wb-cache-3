40|$|SUMMARY In {{order to}} {{determine}} the prevalence and percentage distribution of ringed sidero-blasts in primary myelodysplastic syndromes, the results of Prussian blue staining were analysed in 133 cases. Ringed sideroblasts ranging from 1 to 86 % of cells were found in 76 (57 %) cases. The cases of primary myelodysplastic syndrome corresponding to the group entitled "acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia " had between 21 and 86 % ringed sideroblasts; these were also found in 40 % (26 / 65) cases corresponding to refractory anaemia with excess of blasts. Seven of the 22 cases having morphological features of refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in trans-formation had ringed sideroblasts. It would appear that cases of acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anaemia have at least 20 % ringed sideroblasts; they also seem to occur frequently in refractory anaemia with excess of blasts.

The natural history of these syndromes may range from a chronic course, spanning many years, to a rapid course of leukemic progression [1], and 30 % of cases of MDS eventually transform into acute leukemia (AL) [2]. In myelodysplasia, malignant transformation at the level of a <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> can result in chromosomal locytes, monocytes, red cells, and platelets [3]. For the development of the leukemic clone, further genetic events are required for the rapid expansion of leukemic blasts [4]. Many people regard MDS as the first stage of a hematological myeloid malignancy and consider MDS as the best intermediate stage research model for AL. MDS pathogenesis and its frequent progression to AL are associated with aberrant cell clones with little ability for differentiation but with a high ability to proliferate [5, 6].

The drug administered orally at a dose of 250 micrograms and 400 micrograms on day 14 and 24 following i. m. inoculation of MOPC- 315 plasmacytoma cells resulted in cure of the mice. Their spleen cells showed a permanent impairment of MLR activity, T-cell number and IL- 2 production as well as a mild suppression of NK activity for one year after cessation of melphalan therapy. The number of B cells was elevated. In contrast, plasmacytoma-free mice treated with melphalan retained long term normal immune functions, although shortly after melphalan therapy a temporary suppression was noted. On the other hand, melphalan was responsible for bone marrow <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> damage since the number of myeloid progenitor cell (CFU-GM) colonies was reduced in both melphalan-treated groups compared to untreated normal controls.

For the 3 drugs, an exponential relationship between colony survival and drug concentration was found, but was much steeper for mitoxantrone (slope = - 195. 2 +/- 8. 8 /micrograms/ml) than for ametantrone (slope = 5. 1 +/- 1. 0 /micrograms/ml, p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001) and bisantrene (slope = 7. 1 +/- 0. 3 /micrograms/ml, p less than or equal to 0. 001). The difference of slope between ametantrone and bisantrene was of borderline significance (p less than or equal to 0. 05). The ratios of concentrations inducing a 50 % growth inhibition for mitoxantrone versus bisantrene and for ametantrone versus bisantrene were close to the corresponding ratios of concentrations inducing a 90 % growth inhibition. The relative in vitro toxicities reproduce very well the relative myelosuppression observed in clinical trials with mitoxantrone versus bisantrene but the results were less satisfactory for the comparison of these 2 agents with ametantrone. In addition, our data suggest that, for these 3 compounds, intrinsic myeloid progenitor sensitivity is a major determinant of leukopenia.

The early stages of this process are difficult to study {{because of the lack}} of sensitive and specific markers of clonal evolution in an experimental system. We have developed a cat model using cellular mosaicism for glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G- 6 PD). Our findings confirm that the structural locus for feline G- 6 -PD is on the X-chromosome and demonstrate that it is randomly inactivated in somatic cells. Heterozygous cats have balanced ratios of G- 6 -PD enzyme types in peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic progenitors that remain stable over time. In our initial studies, we used the model to analyze the events surrounding marrow failure experimentally induced by selected strains of feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Two G- 6 -PD heterozygous cats, one F 1 male hybrid and one domestic cat were infected with FeLV (C or KT) and developed pure red cell aplasia (PRCA). Colonies arising from the more mature erythroid colony-forming cell were not detected in marrow culture of anemic animals although erythroid bursts persisted, suggesting that the differentiation of early erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) was inhibited in vivo.

40|$|The {{mononuclear}} phagocyte {{has been}} implicated in regulating the functions of lymphoid and hematopoietic cells and in most cases, these effects are mediated by soluble factors produced by circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages. In the same context, the E-series prostaglandins (PGE) {{have been shown to}} have significant physiological effects on the same functions of lymphoid and hematopoietic cells as does the macrophage. For example, both macrophages and PGE affect lymphocyte proliferatioh (1 - 6), facilitate thymocyte differentiation (7, 8), enhance erythropoiesis (9; Kurland et al., unpublis-hed observations), limit <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation (10 - 12) and are involved in various aspects of the inflammatory response. The possibility therefore exists that the modulation of immune and hematopoietic functions by macrophages may be mediated by PGE.

However, cells other than macrophages can adhere to a plastic surface, {{and in the absence of}} additional morphological, histochemical, or physical criteria, no definitive conclusions can be drawn concerning the actual cellular origin of PGE. Furthermore, no demonstration has heretofore been made of a similar PGE-producing cell in human peripheral blood.

40|$|Abstract Background We report herein a {{rare case}} of primary omental {{gastrointestinal}} stromal tumor (GIST). Case presentation A 65 year-old man {{was referred to}} our hospital with a huge abdominal mass occupying the entire left upper abdomen as shown by sonography. On computed tomography (CT), this appeared as a heterogeneous low-density mass with faint enhancement. Abdominal angiography revealed that the right gastroepiploic artery supplied the tumor. With such an indication of gastric GIST, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma or mesothelioma laparotomy was performed and revealed that this large mass measured 20 × 17 × 6 cm, arising from the greater omentum. It was completely resected. Histopathologically, it was composed of proliferating spindle and epithelioid cells with an interlacing bundle pattern. Immunohistochemically, the tumor was positive for <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> antigen (CD 34), weakly positive for c-KIT (CD 117) and slightly positive for neuron-specific enolase (NSE), but negative for cytokeratin (CK), alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and S- 100 protein. A mutation was identified in the platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) juxtamembrane domain (exon 12, codon 561) and the tumor was diagnosed as an omental GIST. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is treated by Glevec ® and is alive well {{with no sign of}} relapse. Conclusion Our case demonstrated a weak immunohistochemical expression of c-kit (CD 117) and a point mutation in PDGFRA exon 12 resulting in an Asp for Val 561 substitution. Imatinib therapy as an adjuvant to complete resection has been carried out safely. Because of the rarity of primary omental GISTs, it is inevitable to analyze accumulating data from case reports for a better and more detailed understanding of primary omental GISTs. </p...|$|E

This case-control study, nested in a cohort of members of a meatcutters ' union in Baltimore, Maryland, investigated whether occupational exposures are associated with death from tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems. Cases of these tumors represent all deaths which occurred in the cohort between 1949 and 1980. Excess risks of tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems were observed throughout the meat industry, except in meatpacking plants. Slaughtering activities involving heavy exposure to oncogenic viruses were strongly associated with these tumors, espe-cially with lymphomas. Thus, elevated risks were observed for butchers who killed animals (odds ratio (OR) = 5. 3, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 0 - 27. 0); workers in chicken-slaughtering plants (OR = 3. 3, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 13. 1); and workers in cattle/sheep/pig abattoirs (OR = 2. 8, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 9. 5). Among supermarket workers, wrapping meat (mainly a female activity) was associated with increased risk of tumors of the hemopoietic and lymphatic systems (OR = 3. 8, 95 % C 11. 0 - 14. 3), with the odds of both lymphomas and tumors of the <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> being elevated. On the other hand, meatcutting in supermarkets (almost exclusively a male activity) was associated with multiple myeloma; the odds ratio for men was 18. 0 (95 % C 11. 6 - 207. 5), with no myeloma cases being recorded in women.

Eleven cases were de novo ANLL-M 7, of whom three presented with acute myelofibrosis. Four cases were megakaryoblastic transformations of chronic myelogenous leukemia (two cases), refractory anemia with excess of blasts (one case), and polycythemia vera (one case). Four patients showed a minority of granular blasts, with occasional Auer rods in one.

Morphologic evidence of associated myelodysplastic features was detected in all evaluable patients with de novo ANLL-M 7. These cytologic findings indicate that ANLL-M 7 may frequently represent a multilineage proliferation. Cytogenetic studies revealed - 7 / 7 q- and + 8, alone or in combination with additional aberrations, in three cases each. Rearrangements involving bands 3 q 21 or 3 q 26 were seen in two patients and + 21, as an additional aberration, in one. Other structural rearrangements all observed in a single patient were inv(16) (p 13 q 22) at megakaryoblastic relapse with bone marrow eosinophilia, t(13; 20) (q 13 or 14;q 11), del(20) (q 11), and der(7) t(7; 17) (p 14;q 22).

40|$|The {{strength}} and integrity of the human skeleton depends on a delicate equilibrium between bone resorption and bone formation. Bone resorption is an elementary cellular activity in the modelling of the skeleton during growth and development. Later in life a most important physiological process in the skeleton is bone remodelling, which is locally initiated by resorption. During remodelling bone resorption is coupled to new bone formation that ensures renewal of bone with only minor local and temporary bone loss. Cells responsible for bone resorption and subsequent bone formation are the osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The osteoclast {{is derived from the}} pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, which gives rise to a <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> that can further differentiate into megakaryocytes, granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages and osteoclasts. The respective bone resorbing and forming actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are finely coupled, so that bone mass remains remarkably stable in a healthy adult. Imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast activities can arise {{from a wide variety of}} hormonal changes or perturbations of inflammatory and growth factors resulting in postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease, lytic bone metastases, or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to increased bone resorption and crippling bone damage. In view of the critical role of osteoclasts in diverse pathology, there has been immense effort aimed at understanding the biology of this unique cell. The present review is focused on the current knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the functional links between bone turnover and the immune system helping us to understand the main factors that lead to bone loss observed in osteoporosis, cancer and in rheumatoid arthritis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} why increasing myelosuppression accompanies increasing age in patients treated for oesophageal cancer by chemoradiation. Weekly neutrophil and platelet counts were obtained throughout treatment in 86 patients undergoing chemoradiation without surgery for oesophageal cancer. One or two cycles of cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) /day followed by 5 -fluorouracil 800 mg/m(2) /day for 4 - 5 days were administered during the first and fourth or fifth week of radiotherapy using 2 Gy daily fractions. 44 of the patients underwent 5 -fluorouracil pharmacokinetic studies. Multiple regression procedures were used to determine the strength of factors that contribute to initial and nadir neutrophil and platelet counts. The kinetics of myeloid response were evaluated from the rates of disappearance and re-appearance of neutrophils and platelets during treatment. Age, fluorouracil dose (or AUG), baseline body weight and neutrophil (or platelet) count were found to be powerfully and independently predictive of both first neutrophil and platelet nadir count. Baseline neutrophil and platelet counts were also found to correlate negatively with advancing age independently of other factors. The rate of descent of both indices, however, was independent of age, baseline count and fluorouracil dose suggesting that variations in the size of the myeloproliferative compartment prior to treatment were responsible for interpatient variations. In addition, the rate of recovery of both indices was not influenced by age amongst patients in whom data was assessable suggesting that proliferation of surviving marrow elements is not compromised by age. These data are compatible with the hypothesis that a progressive depletion of the <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> compartment accompanies advancing age, and that this is responsible for increasing myelotoxicity.

40|$|Myeloproliferative {{neoplasms}} (MPNs) are {{a heterogeneous}} group of leukemias with defective regulation of <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation. They include four distinct diseases: chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). 1, 2 In 2005, four independent studies have concurred to the identification in MPN patients {{of a specific}} mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK 2) protein (1849 G-T in exon 14; 617 Val-Phe) {{in the majority of}} MPNs. 1, 2 Indeed, this JAK 2 V 617 F variant was identified in 95 % of PV, 55 % of ET and 65 % of PMF patients. The amino-acid change triggers a constitutive activation of the JAK 2 protein, independently of cytokines. Whether JAK 2 V 617 F is the initiating event in these MPNs remains under debate; however, JAK 2 V 617 F seems to drive the phenotype of the disease. JAK 2 gene is located on human chromosome 9, at p 24. 1 locus. It is composed of 25 exons and encodes a 1132 amino-acid protein of 130. 7 kDa apparent molecular weight. The gene is expressed only in blood cells, bone marrow and lymph nodes. Occurrence of JAK 2 V 617 F in association with phenotypically different classes of MPNs raised a controversy as to the real function of the mutated JAK 2 and the possible involvement of additional genetic determinants in these phenotypic discrepancies. Recent whole genomic studies have identified few single-nucleotide polymorph-isms (SNPs) in the vicinity of exon 143 – 5 (Figure 1 a). Notably, it has been anticipated that the 46 / 1 haplotype predisposes to the JAK 2 V 617 F mutation. 5 Other studies have suggested that several SNPs could be implicated in MPN phenotype disparity. 6 The question remains as to the possible role of these SNPs in MPN phenotypic discrepancies.

In addition, percutaneous coronary angioplasty was successfully performed with stent placement at the right coronary artery without hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications...|$|R
40|$|It has {{previously}} been reported that rabbit antisera prepared with papain digests of human malignant spleen cell membranes recognize antigens expressed by normal and neoplastic human B lymphocytes (1 - 3). The antigens recognized by these antisera appear to be similar to, and may be identical with, the p 23, 30 antigen identified by Humphreys and colleagues and by Schlossman and colleagues on normal B cells, 15 - 20 % of null cells, {{and the majority of}} acute leukemia cells (4, 5). A surprising and unexplained observation was the frequent detection of similar antigens on acute and chronic myeloid (granulocytic) leukemia cells. It was not clear why neoplastic myeloid cells should express an antigen found on mature B cells but not mature granulocytes. To answer this question, we examined the effects of similar antisera on normal human <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> These cells, colony-forming unit-culture (CFU-C), were assayed for their ability to form granulecyte and macrophage colonies in agar, in vitro (6, 7) in {{the presence or absence of}} antiserum and complement (C). It is now clear that the antigens recognized by such antisera also occur on normal myeloid progenitors...|$|R

40|$|Mouse c-myb gene {{transcripts}} {{in various}} cells of haemopoietic origin were analysed using S 1 nuclease and RNase mapping techniques and by Northern blotting. It {{was found that}} the prevalent 3. 8 -kb c-myb mRNA present in thymocytes, T cell leukaemias, myelomonocytic leukaemias, erythroleukaemias and <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> was initiated at several cap sites mapping within a region 97 - 244 bp upstream from the protein coding sequence. Utilization of additional cap sites mapping further upstream was also observed in certain cells, most notably thymocytes, and this gave rise to RNA species (4. 3 - 5. 6 kb) larger than the presumptive mRNA. In contrast, myeloma cell c-myb transcripts, which are much less abundant than those in more immature haemopoietic cells, were found to be initiated at a restricted set of cap sites mapping 244 - 277 bp upstream of the coding sequence. Hence, these data suggest that the abundance of the c-myb mRNA may be regulated by a process involving selective utilization of mRNA cap sites. Sites hypersensitive to DNase I were associated with mRNA cap sites in cells that expressed c-myb...|$|R
40|$|To assess {{cooperation}} between G-CSF signals and C/EBP, we characterized Ba/F 3 pro-B cell lines expressing C/EBPWT-ER and the G-CSF receptor (GCSFR). In these lines, GCSFR signals can be evaluated independent of {{their effect on}} C/EBP levels. G-CSF alone did not induce the MPO, NE, LF, or PU. 1 RNAs, and C/EBPWT-ER alone stimulated low-level MPO and high-level PU. 1 expression. Simultaneous activation of the GCSFR and C/EBPWT-ER markedly increased MPO and NE induction at 24 h, and LF mRNA was detected at 48 h. G-CSF did not increase endogenous GCSFR, endogenous C/EBP or exogenous C/EBPWT-ER levels, and C/EBPWT-ER did not induce endogenous or exogenous GCSFR. Several GCSFR mutants were also co-expressed with C/EBPWT-ER. Mutation of all four cytoplasmic tyrosines prevented NE induction but enhanced MPO induction. Mutation of Y 704 was required for increased MPO induction. Consistent with this finding, removing IL- 3 without G-CSF addition enabled MPO, but not NE, induction by C/EBPWT-ER. GCSFR signals or related signals from other receptors may cooperate with C/EBP to direct differentiation of normal <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mouse bone marrow-derived {{dendritic}} cells (BMDCs) {{are being}} employed {{as an important}} model for translational research into the development of DC-based therapeutics. For such use, the localization and specialized mobility of injected BMDCs within specific immune tissues are known to define their immunity and usefulness in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that IL- 4, a key driving factor for in vitro propagation and differentiation of BMDCs, when added during a late culture stage can enhance the in vivo trafficking activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) -induced BMDCs. It suggests that the temporal control of IL- 4 stimulation during the in vitro generation of DCs drastically affects the DC trafficking efficiency in vivo. With this modification of IL- 4 stimulation, we also show that much less cytokine was needed to generate BMDCs with high purity and yield that secrete {{a high level of}} cytokines and possess a good capacity to induce proliferation of allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells, as compared to the conventional method that uses a continuous supplement of GM-CSF and IL- 4 throughout cultivation. These results provide us with an important know-how for differentiation of BMDCs from <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> and for use of other immune cells in related medical or <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> applications.

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> cells that can self-renew and differentiate, was {{initially}} postulated by Pappenheim in 1917 and their existence {{has since been}} shown in many different tissues [1]. The original ideas for cancer <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> came in remarkable papers by Southham et al and Hamburger et al which showed that cancer cells had varying tumor-initiating capacities [2, 3].

40|$|Clinical {{preparations}} {{of horse}} antilymphocyteglobulin (ALG) {{were found to}} inhibit human bone marrow granulocyte colony growth. This effect was enhanced by complement and was dose dependent, being almost complete at ALG concentrations of 100 microgram/ml. Inhibition was a property of ALG but not of normal horse globulin. However, short incubation of ALG with bone marrow cells occasionally stimulated colony growth and normal horse globulin regularly stimulated it. Three hours' incubation of bone marrow cells with ALG was needed to produce consistent colony inhibition, which was measurable as {{a reduction in the}} expected number of colonies and as a fall in the colony: cluster ratio of surviving cell aggregates. Absorption of ALG on acute myeloid leukaemia blast cells removed the inhibiting property of the ALG while preserving its lymphocytotoxic action. Serum from two patients receiving ALG treatment inhibited colony growth for up to 48 hours after ALG administration. The results suggest the presence in ALG of antibodies specifically cytotoxic to <b>myeloid</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which may relate to its myleosuppressive properties in vivo, and also indicate that {{it should be possible to}} remove antimyeloid antibodies from ALG by absorption. The use of such purified ALG would have advantages in clinical bone marrow transplantation...|$|R
