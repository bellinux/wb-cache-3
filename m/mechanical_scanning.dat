5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear dipole array antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning.</b> This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual scanning system {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning</b> systems were a better solution.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning</b> of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the x-ray tube with an electro-magnetic field. This causes {{the projection of}} the object {{to move in the}} opposite direction, and also causes a relative movement between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that the projection of the object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} such systems were being used {{experimentally}} in the 1920s. The best-known was John Logie Baird's, which was actually used for regular public broadcasting in Britain for several years. Indeed, Baird's system was demonstrated {{to members of the}} Royal Society in London in 1926 in what is generally recognized as the first demonstration of a true, working television system. In spite of these early successes, all mechanical television systems shared a number of serious problems. Being mechanically driven, perfect synchronization of the sending and receiving discs was not easy to ensure, and irregularities could result in major image distortion. Another problem was that the image was scanned within a small, roughly rectangular area of the disk's surface, so that larger, higher-resolution displays required increasingly unwieldy disks and smaller holes that produced increasingly dim images. Rotating drums bearing small mirrors set at progressively greater angles proved more practical than Nipkow discs for high-resolution <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning,</b> allowing images of 240 lines and more to be produced, but such delicate, high-precision optical components were not commercially practical for home receivers.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} American iconoscope was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning</b> systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This {{was the first time that}} anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|E

Simple sonars generally use the former with a filter wide enough to cover possible Doppler changes due to target movement, while more complex ones generally include the latter technique.

[...] Military sonars often have multiple beams to provide all-round cover while simple ones only cover a narrow arc, although the beam may be rotated, relatively slowly, by <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The P-19 shares {{many of the}} {{physical}} features of the previous P-15 radar, the P-19 is a high mobility radar and with the antenna mounted on the single truck (Zil-131) with the electronic equipment contained in a second truck. The P-19 uses two open frame elliptical parabolic antenna accomplishing both transmission and reception, each antenna being fed by a single antenna feed {{in a similar fashion}} to the P-15. The radar can rapidly shift its frequency to one of four pre-set frequencies to avoid active interference with passive interference being removed by a coherent doppler filter. Azimuth was determined by <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning</b> with an associated accompanying PRV-11 (NATO reporting name [...] "Side Net") used to determine elevation. A secondary radar for IFF is generally used in conjunction with the P-15, generally the 1L22 [...] "Parol". The armed forces of the Czech Republic described the P-19 as having [...] "outstanding mechanical parameters, simple maintenance, overall reliability and multifunctionality". This evaluation was mirrored by a French evaluation of a radar captured in Chad in 1987 during the Chadian–Libyan conflict, describing the P-19 as sturdy, with good low altitude detection and high resistance to countermeasures.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, {{another great}} {{advancement}} was {{the transfer of}} the grating-based technique to conventional laboratory X-ray tubes by Franz Pfeiffer and co-workers, which fairly enlarged the technique's potential for clinical use. About two years later the group of Franz Pfeiffer also accomplished to extract a supplementary signal from their experiments; the so-called [...] "dark-field signal" [...] was caused by scattering due to the porous microstructure of the sample and provided [...] "complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometer and submicrometer length scale". At the same time, Han Wen and co-workers at the US National Institutes of Health arrived at a much simplified grating technique to obtain the scattering (“dark-field”) image. They used a single projection of a grid and a new approach for signal extraction named [...] "single-shot Fourier analysis". Recently, a lot of research was done to improve the grating-based technique: Han Wen and his team analyzed animal bones and found out that the intensity of the dark-field signal depends on the orientation of the grid and {{this is due to the}} anisotropy of the bone structure. They made significant progress towards biomedical applications by replacing <b>mechanical</b> <b>scanning</b> of the gratings with electronic scanning of the X-ray source. The grating-based phase-contrast CT field was extended by tomographic images of the dark-field signal and time-resolved phase-contrast CT. Furthermore, the first pre-clinical studies using grating-based phase-contrast X-ray imaging were published. Marco Stampanoni and his group examined native breast tissue with [...] "differential phase-contrast mammography", and a team led by Dan Stutman investigated how to use grating-based imaging for the small joints of the hand.|$|E

40|$|A {{monolithic}} silicon integrated optical micro-scanner is presented. The device {{consists of}} a mirror located an {{the tip of a}} thermal bimorph actuator beam. The fabrication process is very simple and compatible with IC fabrication techniques. The device is excited electrothermomechanically at its resonance frequency, enabling large angular deflections at low power consumption. The technological process consists of basic frontside silicon micromachining steps requiring only three mask levels. The moving part is defined by selective silicon bulk etching. The bimorph beam is made of silicon dioxide and a thin film conductor. The residual stress in the two layers is used to achieve a 45 degrees out-of-plane rest position of the mirror. This allows optical components (e. g, laser diode, collimating lens) to be placed directly on the silicon substrate. Mirrors of 500 * 300 and 1000 * 500 mu m(2) with resonant frequencies at 300 and 100 Hz respectively were realized. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>scan</b> angles of above 90 degrees were acheived.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 3 -D imaging technique for an ultra-wideband (UWB) {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR) with a single transmit antenna and a linear receive array. The video impulse GPR working in the frequency band of 0. 3 – 3 GHz has been designed in IRCTR for landmine detection, i. e., for a near-field application. Installed on a vehicle it can image in one <b>mechanical</b> <b>scan</b> a strip of 84 cm width due {{to the length of}} array aperture. The imaging is done by software means only. The developed imaging technique combines a real aperture focusing in the array plane with a synthetic aperture focusing in the <b>mechanical</b> <b>scan</b> direction. To compensate for parasitic time delays in the array channels, a calibration procedure is also described. Owing to directional properties of transmit antenna, the distribution of signal strength over the array is nonuniform that requires an amplitude correction when focusing the real aperture. The authors analyzed how this affects the footprint of the focused array, its cross-range resolution capability and the image quality of antipersonnel plastic landmines which were buried under different array channels. The analysis bases on experimental data sets acquired in the facilities of IRCTR and TNO-DSS. As a result, the authors propose a weighted array focusing that improves the cross-range resolution and provides proper imaging of typical buried landmines.
