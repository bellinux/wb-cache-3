40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{application}} of multivariate calibration techniques to multicomponent analysis by UV-VIS <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> {{is a powerful}} tool for simultaneous determination of several chemical species. However, when this methodology is accomplished manually, it is slow and laborious, consumes high amounts of reagents and samples, is susceptible to contaminations and presents a high operational cost. To overcome these drawbacks, a flow-batch analyser is proposed in this work. This analyser was developed for automatic preparation of standard calibration and test (or validation) mixtures. It was applied to the simultaneous determination of Cu 2 +, Mn 2 + and Zn 2 + in polyvitaminic and polymineral pharmaceutical formulations, using 4 -(2 -piridilazo) resorcinol as reagent and a UV-VIS spectrophotometer with a photodiode array detector. The results obtained with the proposed system are in good agreement with those obtained by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, which was employed as reference method. With the proposed analyser, the preparation of calibration and test mixtures can be accomplished about four hours, while the manual procedure requires at least two days. Moreover, it consumes smaller amounts of reagents and samples than the manual procedure. After the preparation of calibration and test mixtures, 60 samples - 1 can be carried out with the proposed flow-batch analyser...|$|E

For calculations, the non-equilibrium thermodynamic system, which was realized in the graphite furnace, was divided into the thermodynamic subsystems that correspond to the main stages of time-temperature program: drying of the sample, pyrolysis, vaporization and formation of gaseous diatomic molecules. The composition of the condensed sample residues after drying and pyrolysis stages, the composition of the gas phase in the analytical zone of the graphite furnace during vaporization and the formation of molecules stages were determined by the calculations.

To evaluate the feasibility of a simple procedure for the determination {{of chlorine}} in food samples present in our daily lives, two different digestion methods were applied, namely (A) an acid digestion method using HNO 3 only at room temperature, and (B) a digestion method with Ag, HNO 3 and H 2 O 2, where chlorine is precipitated as a low-solubility salt (AgCl), which is then dissolved with ammonia solution. The experimental results obtained with method B were in good agreement with the certified values and demonstrated that the proposed method is more accurate than method A. This is because the formation of silver chloride prevented analyte losses by volatilization.

Developments in instrumentation included new sampler designs for the collection of nanoparticles, the coupling of FFF and hydrodynamic chromatography to ICP-MS for the sizing and compositional analysis of such particles and the ongoing development of aerosol mass spectrometry. In the field of water analysis, new procedures for the detection and quantification of emerging pollutants in water such as MRI contrast agents have been developed. Instrumental developments reported include the use of <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry,</b> by exploiting the CS-AAS technique, for measuring halogen species in water. Numerous articles involving the application of atomic spectrometry to plants, soils and related materials appeared in this review period but, as usual, most were concerned with the environmental significance of the results, rather than the methodology used to obtain them. Nevertheless, there have been some interesting developments. Both LIBS and PXRF spectrometry have been used more widely, variants such as LA-LIBS and microwave assisted LIBS have appeared, and PXRF spectrometry has been applied {{for the first time in}} the analysis of plants. Developments in geochemical analysis include the production and (re) certification of new geological RMs for bulk, isotopic and microspatial analysis.

40|$|Atrazine (ATZ) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} as an herbicide, mainly due to its relatively low cost and ease of application. Previous {{studies have shown that}} many pollutants are redox active being able to enter microorganisms, causing a univalent reduction of dioxygen with reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. These products can severely attack cell membranes causing lipid peroxidation. Many cells have developed antioxidative defence system, consisting of ROS-scavenging enzymes, e. g. glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or catalases (CTT 1, CTA 1), and antioxidants, e. g. glutathione (GSH). Catalases and GPx can catalyze H 2 O 2 reduction to H 2 O and GPx can also scavenge lipid hydroperoxides, converting them in correspondent alcohols. ROS can be produced in cells not only as by-products of normal cellular metabolism but also under stress situations as contact with xenobiotics. So far, the oxidative stress responses to several pollutants as atrazine have been examined in bacteria plants and animals, but few studies have shown the response of antioxidant enzymes in S. cerevisiae to herbicides stress. So, {{the purpose of the present}} work was to evaluate the antioxidant response by yeast to atrazine exposure. Saccharomyces cerevisiae UE-ME 3 a wild-type yeast deposited in the collection of laboratory of Enology, University of Evora, at mid-exponential phase were inoculated in YEPD medium, 2 % (w/v) glucose, at 28 °C, and shaken 150 rpm for 72 h in presence of 5 or 50 M ATZ and compared with control (YEPD). Yeasts were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min and washed with ultra-pure sterile water. The obtained cells were suspended in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7. 0, and disrupted by sonication. The post- 12 000 g supernatants were used for ROS, malondialdheyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) determination by fluorescence as well as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), CTT 1, CTA 1, glutathione reductase (GR), GPx and glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) activities by <b>molecular</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry.</b> The statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA I and Duncan test (p < 0. 01), using SPSS for Windows, version 22.

40|$|Summary: Commercially {{available}} control sera were analysed by {{the reference}} methods for caicium, lithium and magnesium. Calcium: The mean deviation {{of the target}} values for routine flame atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> from the reference method values was — 1. 2 %, {{in the case of}} flame atomic emission spectrometry — 0. 1 %. The assigned values of determinations by methylthymol blue and cresolphthalein showed a positive bias: + 2. 3 and + 2. 2 %. Lithium: Target values for routine flame atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> and flame atomic emission spectro-metry were in generally good Agreement with the reference method values (deviation + 1. 7 % and + 0. 7 %), although the differences were dependent on concentration. Magnesium: The assigned values for routine flame atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> yielded a mean bias of — 0. 4 % from the reference method value. The target values for <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> after reaction with Magon and Calmagite, however, differed by + 8. 2 % and + 9. 3 % on average. These methods seem to be less suitable for the detennination of magnesium in serum than FAAS and would have failed several times to meet the requirements of quality assessment.

30|$|Atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (AAS), flame atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (FAAS), and {{graphite}} furnace atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (GFAAS) {{analytical methods}} {{were used to}} detect different elements. GAAS {{is based on the}} same principles as FAAS with the main difference in the atomization of the samples. Instead of the flame in FAAS, the GFAAS uses an electro thermal atomizer (a small graphite tube). The samples were prepared for both analyses by digesting the samples with HNO 3 –H 2 O 2 in a ratio of 4 : 1 using microwave assisted acid digestion process. For FAAS analytical method, different standard solutions were used like Fe [(p/n 8003 - 0906), Zn (p/n 8003 - 0942)], Cu (p/n 5190 - 8280). In GFAAS analytical method, stock standard solutions are prepared from analytical reagent grade high purity metals, oxides, or nonhygroscopic salts using reagent water and redistilled HNO 3 or HCl.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{treating}} fresh and processed meat with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) is {{proposed for the}} determination of Ca, Fe and Mg by flame atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (FAAS) and Cu by graphite furnace atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (GFAAS). The accuracy was evaluated by comparison of the results by using two other sample preparation procedures and by the analysis of certified reference materials. No {{significant differences between the}} results were found at the 95 % confidence level. Limits of detection for Ca, Cu, Fe and Mg were 45. 0, 0. 2, 16. 0 and 0. 3 µg g- 1, respectively. High-resolution continuum source graphite furnace atomic <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrometry</b> (HR-CS GFAAS) was employed to evaluate the spectral interference in the determination of Cu. However, no interference was found. The proposed method is simple, fast and reliable for meat products analysis and does not require especial equipment, neither strong acid for sample preparation...|$|R
