5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in <b>MS,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the same time}} it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|Formation of the {{complexes}} of {{the type}} Cm(n-C3H7-BTP)3, where BTP stands for 2,6-di(1,2,4-triazin-3-yl)pyridine, in solutions containing n-C3H7-BTP and Cm3+ ions has been confirmed by EXAFS. Some of these BTP-type complexes selectively interact with curium and therefore are useful in its selective separation from lanthanides and another actinides. Dissolved Cm3+ ions bind with many organic compounds, such as hydroxamic acid, urea, fluorescein and adenosine triphosphate. Many of these compounds are related to biological activity of various microorganisms. The resulting complexes exhibit strong yellow-orange emission under UV light excitation, which is convenient not only for their detection, but also for studying the interactions between the Cm3+ ion and the ligands via changes in the half-life (of the order ~0.1 <b>ms)</b> <b>and</b> spectrum of the fluorescence.|$|E
5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 <b>ms</b> <b>and</b> 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} yield ratio for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the study is to find the most {{effective}} model for public procurement of medicines (<b>M)</b> <b>and</b> medical devices (MD) in Ukraine. The objectives of the study are: the analysis of legislation developed for public procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD in Ukraine; the historic study of public procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD in Ukraine; the development of relationship between public procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD with the state budget and state programs; the determination of advantages and disadvantages of centralized and decentralized procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD; argumentation of my choice of the model for public procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD in Ukraine. The study found that the purchase of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD in Ukraine is carried out in a centralized and a decentralized manner. The centralized approach to procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD dominates with respect to the decentralized approach. This {{can be explained by the}} history of the country, as the part of former Soviet Union. Centralized and decentralized approaches to public procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD have both disadvantages and advantages. The best option for the country will be a combination of centralized and decentralized approach to procurement of <b>M</b> <b>and</b> MD...|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span of six months. Runup heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The tsunami was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or <b>Ms,</b> <b>and</b> the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes.

It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 <b>ms</b> <b>and</b> 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies the MS was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, the <b>MS</b> <b>and</b> the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and the MS The MS was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. The MS wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E
