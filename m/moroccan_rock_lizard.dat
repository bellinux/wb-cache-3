40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} {{can limit}} {{the distribution of}} species along altitudinal gradients. It {{has been suggested that}} Western European <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (genus Iberolacerta) are restricted to mountains due to the expansion of wall lizards (Podarcis), but there is no experimental evidence to corroborate this hypothesis. This study examines if interference competition with Podarcis muralis is a plausible explanation for the alpine confinement of Iberian <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> Iberolacerta cyreni. In a first experiment, we used an enclosure with four types of microhabitats to investigate whether adult <b>rock</b> and/or wall <b>lizards</b> shifted microhabitat or refuge preferences {{in the presence of the}} other species, and to detect aggressive interactions between them. In a second experiment, we staged heterospecific encounters between naïve, laboratoryborn juveniles to identify behavioural differences and agonistic interactions. In the enclosure, neither <b>rock</b> nor wall <b>lizards</b> changed their microhabitat preferences in the presence of the other species. Nevertheless, <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> increased the diversity of microhabitats and nocturnal refuges used in the single species trials, which had twice the number of conspecifics. Aggressive interactions involved mainly large <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> males. Juveniles did not show any interspecific agonistic behaviour, but <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> spent more time basking and less time moving. Thus, we found no evidence of competition between both species in terms of habitat shifts or agonistic interactions, although intraspecific interactions seemed to explain the behaviour of adult <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> We conclude that other factors are currently determining the alpine confinement of <b>rock</b> <b>lizards.</b> This paper is a contribution to the project CGL 2007 - 02744 /BOS, funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN).

50|$|The <b>Moroccan</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Teira perspicillata) is {{a species}} of lizard in the Lacertidae family. Its {{classification}} is uncertain {{and it has been}} placed in the genera Teira, Podarcis, Lacerta or Scelarcis. It is found in Algeria and Morocco and has been introduced to the island of Menorca in Spain. Its natural habitats are Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, rocky areas, sea coasts and urban areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Moroccan</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> is an agile {{species and}} is found {{climbing}} on rocks, walls, cliffs and boulders, on tree trunks, {{on the ground}} among scrub and around buildings. It forages {{on the ground as}} well as on rocks. Its tail is rather fragile and individuals with regenerating tails can often be found. Females lay small clutches of one to three measuring 12 to 17 mm by 6 to 8 mm.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} species of amphibia: green toad (Bufo viridis), marsh frog and stripeless tree frog (Hyla meridionalis).The common lizard seen {{all over the}} island is the Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus) {{although}} the <b>Moroccan</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> (Scelaris perspicillata) also occurs. The Balearic endemic Lilford's wall lizard (Podarcis lilfordi) {{can be found on}} many of the offshore islands. Two species of gecko can be found on Menorca, the Moorish (Tarentola mauritanica) and the Turkish (Hemidactylus turcicus) also called the Mediterranean house gecko.Four species of snake occur: the viperine snake (Natrix maura), grass snake, false smooth snake (Macroprotodon cucullatus) and the ladder snake (Rhinechis scalaris).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Moroccan</b> <b>rock</b> <b>lizard</b> is a medium-sized, rather {{flattened}} species {{growing to}} a snout-to-vent length of 6 cm with a tail about 1.7 times its body-length. Various colour forms exist. In Morocco {{it is usually}} greyish-brown often with two broad, pale stripes slong the back. In Minorca the colour is buff, grey or greyish-green densely covered with dark, net-like markings. In all areas, the tail is often bluish, particularly in smaller individuals. It can be distinguished from other similar lizards {{by the presence of}} a transparent [...] "window" [...] in its lower eyelid. The underparts are white or bluish. Occasional completely dark-coloured individuals occur.|$|E

40|$|Many animals produce {{elaborated}} sexual {{signals to}} attract mates, {{among them are}} common chemical sexual signals (pheromones) with an attracting function. Lizards produce chemical secretions for scent marking that may {{have a role in}} sexual selection. In the laboratory, female <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> (Iberolacerta cyreni) prefer the scent of males with more ergosterol in their femoral secretions. However, it is not known whether the scent-marks of male <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> may actually attract females to male territories in the field. In the field, we added ergosterol to rocks inside the territories of male lizards, and found that this manipulation resulted in increased relative densities of females in these territories. Furthermore, a higher number of females were observed associated to males in manipulated plots, which probably increased mating opportunities for males in these areas. These and previous laboratory results suggest that female <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> may select to settle in home ranges based on the characteristics of scent-marks from conspecific males. Therefore, male <b>rock</b> <b>lizards</b> might attract more females and obtain more matings by increasing the proportion of ergosterol when scent-marking their territories.
