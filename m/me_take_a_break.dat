40|$|The mosaic is {{relatively}} old form of art. The computer as an artistic device {{is relatively}} new. The recent {{combination of these}} two disciplines has furthered {{the evolution of the}} mosaic as an art form. The main goal of this thesis is to continue this evolution by extending the image mosaic into the third dimension, that of time, by melding the image mosaic with the discipline of the filmmaking. Specifically, this thesis provides a detailed background of the mosaic art form, then extends the image mosaic by adding the dimension of time. This results in a new mosaic form, the Temporal Image Mosaic(TIM). Respecting the artistic nature of this thesis, the use of the Temporal Image Mosaic in an artistic setting is demonstrated {{in the form of a}} short motion picture. i Acknowledgments I would like to take this opportunity to thank my advisors. Thank you, James, for your grateful help over the coarse of this thesis, and especially for letting <b>me</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> when I needed it. Thank you, Clarke, for helping to make this interdisciplinary thesis a reality, and for your help on all film aspects of the thesis. Thanks also to my thesis committee for their help, time and valuable suggestions — from both the technical and artistic perspectives. The committee consisted o...|$|E

She states: [...] "I made the decision for selfish reasons, but I'm going public here because I realized I {{might be able to help}} other girls, too. I know the kind of drama that being sexually active brings to your life. I felt that if it was good for <b>me</b> to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> it might be good for other young girls, too. You see, I think I would be a whole different person if I hadn't had sex so early. Everybody was saying, 'Do it!' but nobody ever said, 'You don't have to do it'. I think hearing that would have made a huge difference in my life." ...|$|R
500|$|In early 2013, Gosling {{announced}} that he was taking <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from acting, stating,“I’ve lost perspective on what I’m doing.

The [...] "fantasy noir", written by Gosling, stars Christina Hendricks, Ben Mendelsohn, and Matt Smith. The film received largely unfavorable reviews. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found it [...] "insufferably conceited" [...] and remarked that Gosling had lost [...] "any sense of proportion or humility." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Lost River as [...] "mind-bogglingly pleased with itself", while Varietys Justin Chang dismissed the [...] "derivative" [...] film as a [...] "train-wreck." ...|$|R

40|$|I {{would first}} {{like to thank}} my advisor Professor Akhoury for his generous {{guidance}} over my graduate career. This thesis {{would not have been}} possible without his constant mentoring and encouragement. I am truly lucky to have gained not just a great advisor but also a great friend. I would also like to thank all of my collaborators, especially Professor Garfinkle and Professor Sterman, for their tutelage and support in the research projects that make up this thesis. I will always appreciate the fortune I had in being able to have enlightening discussions with such experts in the field. I am also very grateful for all of the great friends and colleagues I met over the past five years. Their support was so extensive and varied that it would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> second dissertation to properly express my gratitude, so in short: thank you for everything. I would also like to thank Michelle for all of the support she has given me over my graduate studies. Without her pushing me to work when I needed to work and encouraging <b>me</b> to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> when I needed <b>a</b> <b>break,</b> this thesis {{would not have been possible}}. Lastly, I would like to thank my father, mother, and brother for all their help over th...|$|R
40|$|I’ve {{reached the}} final door, it’s hard to believe. Way back when {{starting}} this process, I remember being told I’d repeatedly <b>take</b> <b>a</b> few steps forward, {{a few steps}} backward, a few more step forward, and occasional I’d walk though doors. This was all true, and now as I think back {{over the past two}} years, I believe the saying is ” hindsight is always easier”. It’s also true that “the whole is equal to the sum of its parts”. (I’d give credit where credit is due, but when I Googled these phrases, it seems there is no one owner) I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the parts who were influential in the whole of this thesis. Topping the list is my husband, Dan, without his support, encouragement, patience, and love I would not have finished. He’s took on both roles of parenthood and picked up the slack around the house so that I could become a student. He is truly the better half of this union, and proved so repeatedly during this process. The words “Thank You ” cannot adequately express the appreciation and respect I feel for my better half. Next on the list are my children, Patrick, Erin, Christopher and Kathleen their patience and support has allowed <b>me</b> to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>break</b> from many of the responsibilities o...|$|R
