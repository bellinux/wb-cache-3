The bigots and slanderers; wild beasts of the desert, and fanatic intriguers, who, in {{the words}} of Him they call their <b>master,</b> <b>compass</b> heaven and earth to make one proselyte, and when they have found him, make him {{two-fold}} more the child of hell than themselves. Go--I forgive you: you are young, and know not yet the mystery of the world. Science will teach you some day that the outward frame is the sacrament of the soul's inward beauty. Such a soul I had fancied your face expressed; but I was mistaken. Foul hearts alone harbour such foul suspicions, and fancy others to be what they know they might become themselves. Go! Do I look like--? The very tapering of these fingers, if you could read their symbolism, would give your dream the lie.' And she flashed full on him, like sun-rays from a mirror, the full radiance of her glorious countenance.|$|E
50|$|However to {{describe}} Lady Loadstone's domestic world as 'feminocentric' is argued {{by some to}} be completely inaccurate. The very fact that Lady Loadstone is guided constantly by the advice of <b>Master</b> <b>Compass,</b> who is described by Parson Palate as 'the perfect instrument your Lady should sail by' indicates her dependence upon her male friend's guidance, as a widow in a male dominated society. She is also counselled by the Parson and the Doctor and the dowry is controlled by Sir Moth Interest. It is the machinations of <b>Master</b> <b>Compass,</b> who exposes Mistress Polish's plot and effectively wins the day in the final reveal and his supremacy of the situation. The female characters in the play are outnumbered by the male and ultimately are 'subdued' at the end in one way or another. The character of Mistress Polish is arguably one of Jonson's more interesting female characters and a challenge for any actress.|$|E
50|$|From 1903 to 1905 Helmer Hanssen {{participated in}} Roald Amundsen's {{successful}} {{search for the}} Northwest Passage, as second mate on board the ship Gjøa. On the expedition he learned from the Inuit how to drive sled dogs. In 1910 he headed south with Amundsen to conquer the South Pole. This time as an expert dog driver. He was also in charge of navigation, carrying the <b>master</b> <b>compass</b> on his sledge.|$|E
60|$|The {{simplicity}} and innocence and sincerity and unconsciousness {{of the old}} farmer are perfectly simulated, {{and the result is}} a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious. This is art and fine and beautiful, and only a <b>master</b> can <b>compass</b> it; but a machine could tell the other story.|$|R

50|$|The {{play was}} first {{performed}} in 1632 and came under severe critical attack from Jonson's literary enemies namely Alexander Gill, Inigo Jones and Nathaniel Butter, who had long-standing feuds with Jonson. The work {{does not appear}} again until 1987, in a BBC Radio 3 adaptation to mark 350 years since Jonson's death produced by Ian Cotterell and adapted by Peter Barnes with Dilys Laye as Mistress Polish, Dinsdale Landen as <b>Master</b> <b>Compass</b> and Peter Bayliss as Sir Moth Interest. The play received its first modern stage performance in Autumn 2010 {{as part of the}} White Bear Theatre’s Lost Classics Project.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Gyrocompass is an {{important}} instrument which provides course to vessels, but its complex three-dimensional structure and principle of pointing towards the North is a bottleneck of studying gyrocompass. The <b>master</b> <b>compass</b> of Anschütz 4 gyrocompass are simulated by virtual reality modeling language VRML, so that using three-dimensional interactive to show {{the structure of the}} gyrocompass and the work principle is implemented and learners will have a direct cognition to each part of the gyrocompass and its work principle. The realization process of simulation in the virtual reality environment is described in detail and the relevant source codes is given...|$|E
50|$|Dower's Prairie is a 14-acre native prairie remnant {{located in}} {{southwest}} Wisconsin, United States. Originally a dairy cow pasture, {{it was originally}} discovered to be home to an abundance of rare plant species by a man hunting {{in the area in}} 1989. After being fenced off from cattle, the parcel of land owned by dairy farmer Steve Dower has grown and diversified with over 150 different species.Notable plant species include Prairie Bushclover (federally threatened), Rattlesnake <b>master,</b> Blazing Star, <b>Compass</b> Plant, Showy Goldenrod, Coneflower, Big Bluestem, Little Bluestem, Indian Grass, Side Oates, Pale Purple Coneflower, and Aster.|$|R
5000|$|Ted Briggs, on {{the compass}} {{platform}} near the bridge, recalls, not hearing the initial explosion, {{but only a}} huge sheet of flame that shot around Hood's compass platform, followed by a heavy list. When the list reached 30 degrees Briggs realized that [...] "she was not coming back". Briggs states that no order was given to abandon ship [...] "It just wasn't necessary," [...] and that {{he found himself in}} the water about 50 yd from Hood as her B-Turret went under after he made it only halfway down the ladder leading to the bridge. As Briggs and the remaining crew on compass platform struggled to escape, Briggs remembered [...] "The flag Lieutenant who was just in front of me stood to one side to let me go through... I'll never forget that." [...] He also could remember how the <b>compass</b> <b>master</b> had stood on the platform [...] "tall and fearless" [...] as the water pulled him down. Briggs himself attempted to swim away from the vessel but was pulled under by her as she started toward the ocean bottom. Briggs remembers struggling to stay afloat, giving up hope, and then miraculously being propelled to the surface. This was probably the result of air escaping from the ship, possibly the bridge windows collapsing and releasing trapped air or a boiler explosion. He then remembered that [...] "When I reached the surface, 50 yards away I saw her bows, vertical out of the water. That image would haunt me in nightmares for the next 40 years. When I swam clear of the ship, seconds later I turned back, she was gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Take from Wordsworth all {{which an}} honest {{criticism}} cannot but allow, {{and what is}} left will show how truly great he was. He had no humor, no dramatic power, and his temperament was of that dry and juiceless quality, that in all his published correspondence you shall not find a letter, but only essays. If we consider carefully where he was most successful, we shall find {{that it was not}} so much in description of natural scenery, or delineation of character, as in vivid expression of the effect produced by external objects and events upon his own mind, and of the shape and hue (perhaps momentary) which they in turn took from his mood or temperament. His finest passages are always monologues. He had a fondness for particulars, and there are parts of his poems which remind us of local histories in the undue relative importance given to trivial matters. He was the historian of Wordsworthshire. This power of particularization (for it is as truly a power as generalization) is what gives such vigor and greatness to single lines and sentiments of Wordsworth, and to poems developing a single thought or sentiment. It was this that made him so fond of the sonnet. That sequestered nook forced upon him the limits which his fecundity (if I may not say his garrulity) was never self-denying enough to impose on itself. It suits his solitary and meditative temper, and it was there that Lamb (an admirable judge of what was permanent in literature) liked him best. Its narrow bounds, but fourteen paces from end to end, turn into a virtue his too common fault of giving undue prominence to every passing emotion. He excels in monologue, and the law of the sonnet tempers monologue with mercy. In [...] "The Excursion" [...] we are driven to the subterfuge of a French verdict of extenuating circumstances. His mind had not that reach and elemental movement of Milton's, which, like the tradewind, gathered to itself thoughts and images like stately fleets from every quarter; some deep with silks and spicery, some brooding over the silent thunders of their battailous armaments, but all swept forward in their destined track, over the long billows of his verse, every inch of canvas strained by the unifying breath of their common epic impulse. It was an organ that Milton <b>mastered,</b> mighty in <b>compass,</b> capable equally of the trumpet's ardors or the slim delicacy of the flute, and sometimes it bursts forth in great crashes through his prose, as if he touched it for solace in the intervals of his toil. If Wordsworth sometimes puts the trumpet to his lips, yet he lays it aside soon and willingly for his appropriate instrument, the pastoral reed. And it is not one that grew by any vulgar stream, but that which Apollo breathed through, tending the flocks of Admetus,--that which Pan endowed with every melody of the visible universe,--the same in which the soul of the despairing nymph took refuge and gifted with her dual nature,--so that ever and anon, amid the notes of human joy or sorrow, there comes suddenly a deeper and almost awful tone, thrilling us into dim consciousness of a forgotten divinity.|$|R
