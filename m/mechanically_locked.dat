I do not doubt but that I shall find her in the house." [...] Then he turned to the door, {{intending}} to leave the room. He had been very near to her while they were talking, so that he had some paces to traverse before he could put his hand upon the lock,--but in doing so his back was turned on her. In one respect it was better for her purpose that it should be so. She could open the door of the compartment and put her hand upon the pistol without having his eye upon her. But, as it seemed to her at the moment, the chance of bringing her purpose to its intended conclusion was less {{than it would have been}} had she been able to fire at his face. She had let the moment go by,--the first moment,--when he was close to her, and now there would be half the room between them. But she was very quick. She seized the pistol, and, transferring it to her right hand, she rushed after him, and when the door was already half open she pulled the trigger. In the agony of that moment she heard no sound, though she saw the flash. She saw him shrink and pass the door, which he left unclosed, and then she heard a scuffle in the passage, as though he had fallen against the wall. She had provided herself especially with a second barrel,--but that was now absolutely useless to her. There was no power left to her wherewith to follow him and complete the work which she had begun. She did not think that she had killed him, though she was sure that he was struck. She did not believe that she had accomplished anything of her wishes,--but had she held in her hand a six-barrelled revolver, as of the present day, she could have done no more with it. She was overwhelmed with so great a tremor at her own violence that she was almost incapable of moving. She stood glaring at the door, listening for what should come, and the moments seemed to be hours. But she heard no sound whatever. A minute passed away perhaps, and the man did not move. She looked around as if seeking some way of escape,--as though, were it possible, she would get to the street through the window. There was no mode of escape, unless she would pass out through the door to the man who, as she knew, must still be there. Then she heard him move. She heard him rise,--from what posture she knew not, and step towards the stairs. She was still standing with the pistol in her hand, but was almost unconscious that she held it. At last her eye glanced upon it, and she was aware that she was still armed. Should she rush after him, and try what she could do with that other bullet? The thought crossed her mind, but she knew that she could do nothing. Had all the Lovels depended upon it, she could not have drawn that other trigger. She took the pistol, put it back into its former hiding-place, <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> the little door, and then seated herself in her chair.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Energetic {{efficiency}} and stability are the fundamental criteria which {{can improve the}} autonomy and task performance capabilities of humanoid robots. The scope {{of this paper is}} to investigate the energetic effects of knee locking and addition of torsional springs to different joints of a sevenlink fully actuated planar bipedal robot. The focus is on the reduction of energy consumption during walking. The energetic cost of walking is determined without joint stiffness and knee locking as a baseline for the comparison of results. In the first approach, the gait trajectory is optimized by adding springs to different joints and energetic cost of walk is then calculated at different walking speeds. The second approach presented in this paper is to <b>mechanically</b> <b>lock</b> the support knee and then optimize the gait and calculate the walking cost. The energetic cost of walking determined for the above two cases is then compared to the baseline cost. It is observed that addition of torsional springs at both hips reduce the walking cost up to 50 %, support hip up to 85 % with spring stiffness as an optimization variable for both cases while <b>mechanically</b> <b>locking</b> the support knee reduces the cost of walking up to 25 % with gait and knee locking angle optimized.

The cold-hammer-forged conventional rifled barrel is locked to the slide {{by means of a}} single rectangular lug around the barrel chamber that recesses into the ejection port in the slide. When fired, the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge drives the barrel and slide back, locked together until the bullet leaves the barrel and pressures drop to a safe level. A locking block integrated into the frame then engages a lug {{at the base of the}} chamber and drives the barrel downward, separating it from the slide and terminating any further rearward movement while the slide continues back in a straight line.|$|E
50|$|The {{gravity knife}} uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever {{to release the}} blade from both the open and the closed positions, and may use a side-folding or {{telescoping}} (out-the-front, or OTF) blade. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not <b>mechanically</b> <b>lock</b> open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against {{the interior of the}} handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions.|$|R

50|$|Thermoplastic staking, {{also known}} as heat staking, is the same process except that it uses heat to deform the plastic boss, instead of cold forming. A plastic stud {{protruding}} from one component fits into {{a hole in the}} second component. The stud is then deformed through the softening of the plastic to form a head which <b>mechanically</b> <b>locks</b> the two components together. It is a versatile technique benefiting from being quick, economical and consistent. Unlike welding techniques, staking has the capacity to join plastics to other materials (e.g. metal, PCB's) in addition to joining like or dissimilar plastics, and it has the advantage over other mechanical joining methods in eliminating the need for consumables such as rivets and screws.|$|R
5000|$|The Borg-Warner {{system was}} {{replaced}} with a [...] "New Process Gear" [...] NP219-based system in 1980 The NP219 Quadra-Trac transfer case was available in full-size Jeep Cherokee, Wagoneer, and Grand Wagoneer from 1980 through 1982. It offered the following modes: 4H LK, 4H, N, and 4L. In 4H (full-time 4WD High) a center differential with a viscous limited-slip coupling is used between {{the front and rear}} output shafts. A 2.61:1 low range was engaged in 4WD Lo mode. And in both '4H LK' (4WD Hi Locked) and '4L' modes the center differential is <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked.</b> The 'N' mode disengages the transfer case, transmission, and engine from the axles, thus enabling flat-towing the Jeep behind another vehicle. In 1983, the NP219-based Quadra-Trac system was replaced by the NP228/229-based Selec-Trac, adding a fuel-saving 2WD mode to the full- and part-time 4WD modes of Quadra-Trac.|$|E
50|$|A {{railroad}} car's {{wheels are}} guided along the tracks by coning of the wheels. Only {{in extreme cases}} does it rely on the flanges located on the insides of the wheels. When the wheels reach the switch, the wheels are guided along the route determined by {{which of the two}} points is connected to the track facing the switch. In the illustration, if the left point is connected, the left wheel will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will diverge to the right. If the right point is connected, the right wheel's flange will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will continue along the straight track. Only one of the points may be connected to the facing track at any time; the two points are <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> together to ensure that this is always the case.|$|E
50|$|Everyday manual wheelchairs come in {{two major}} varieties, folding or rigid. Folding chairs are {{generally}} low-end designs, whose predominant advantage {{is being able to}} fold, generally by bringing the two sides together. However this is largely an advantage for part-time users who may need to store the wheelchair more often than use it. Rigid wheelchairs, which are increasingly preferred by full-time and active users, have permanently welded joints and many fewer moving parts. This reduces the energy required to push the chair by eliminating many points where the chair would flex and absorb energy as it moves. Welded rather than folding joints also reduce the overall weight of the chair. Rigid chairs typically feature instant-release rear wheels and backrests that fold down flat, allowing the user to dismantle the chair quickly for storage in a car. A few wheelchairs attempt to combine the features of both designs by providing a fold-to-rigid mechanism in which the joints are <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> when the wheelchair is in use.|$|E
50|$|The Paratrooper Gravity Knife is a {{knife with}} a blade {{contained}} in its handle, made by Paul Weysersberg, Solingen, and which opens its blade {{by the force}} of inertia or gravity. The main purpose of this opening method is that it allows opening and closing to be done one handed, in situations where the other hand is occupied. A major historical use has been in issue to parachutists to cut off their parachutes when tangled in a tree or similar. The gravity knife uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions, and may use a side-folding or telescoping mechanism. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not <b>mechanically</b> <b>lock</b> open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against the interior of the handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions.|$|R
50|$|Park (P): This {{selection}} <b>mechanically</b> <b>locks</b> {{the output}} shaft of transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, {{and therefore the}} vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases {{the life of the}} transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling.|$|R
5000|$|The various {{boxes on}} {{this section of}} the railway used Sykes {{electromechanical}} [...] "Lock and Block" [...] interlocking, which used treadles to detect the presence of trains on the line rather than electrical track circuits, and prevented unsafe signal indications by <b>mechanically</b> <b>locking</b> the signal slides in the box, rather than interrupting an electrical circuit. A feature of the Sykes system was that the various actions needed to set up a route for a train and clear the appropriate signals had to be completed in the correct order, otherwise the apparatus would lock up and require releasing. On the boxes to the south of Battersea Park, the apparatus could be released by the signalman alone using a key, but Battersea Park and the boxes to the north required the signalman to request a release from the next box in the chain - for Battersea Park, this was Battersea Pier box. This procedure required the signalman making the request to send a bell signal, then for both signalmen to press the appropriate button in their respective boxes - the interlocking would only be released if both buttons were pressed simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Skid-steer loaders are {{typically}} four-wheel vehicles with the wheels <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> in synchronization on each side, {{and where the}} left-side drive wheels can be driven independently of the right-side drive wheels. The wheels typically have no separate steering mechanism and hold a fixed straight alignment {{on the body of}} the machine. By operating the left and right wheel pairs at different speeds, the machine turns by skidding, or dragging its fixed-orientation wheels across the ground. The extremely rigid frame and strong wheel bearings prevent the torsional forces caused by this dragging motion from damaging the machine. As with tracked vehicles, the high ground friction produced by skid steers can rip up soft or fragile road surfaces. They can be converted to low ground friction by using specially designed wheels such as the Mecanum wheel. Skid-steer loaders are capable of zero-radius, [...] "pirouette" [...] turning, which makes them extremely maneuverable and valuable for applications that require a compact, agile loader. Skid-steer loaders are sometimes equipped with tracks instead of the wheels, and such a vehicle is known as a multi-terrain loader.|$|E
50|$|The NP242 Selec-Trac {{transfer}} case debuted alongside the Fuel-Injected 4.0L Inline-6 in the compact Jeep Cherokee in 1987. The shifter has modes 2WD - 4WD Hi Part-Time - 4WD Hi Full-Time - N - 4WD Low. There is a center differential {{that is open}} in 4WD Hi Full-Time mode and distributes torque 48/52% front-to-rear. This mode {{can be used on}} dry pavement or slippery surfaces with only a small fuel mileage penalty compared to 2WD mode. In 4WD Hi Part-Time and 4WD Low, the center differential is <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked,</b> so these modes are for slippery surfaces only. Low range engages a 2.72:1 planetary gear ratio for increased torque and low speeds. Overall, this system functions very much like the NP228 {{transfer case}} above, just with all of the mode and range controls via a single, console-mounted shift lever. It was available in the 1987 to 2001 XJ Cherokee and Wagoneer, the 1987 to 1992 MJ Comanche, the 1993 to 2004 ZJ and WJ Grand Cherokees, the 2002 to 2007 KJ Liberty, and the 1998 to 2000 Dodge Durango. It was replaced in the 2005 Grand Cherokee by the Quadra-Trac II system featuring the NV245 transfer case with 4WD Auto mode and in the 2008 KK Liberty by Selec-Trac II using the MP3022 transfer case.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the octal base, the B8G loctal base or lock-in base (sometimes spelled [...] "loktal" [...] - trademarked by Sylvania), was {{developed}} by Sylvania for ruggedized applications such as automobile radios. Along with B8B (a British designation out of date by 1958), these eight-pin locking bases are almost identical and the names usually taken as interchangeable (although there are some minor differences in specifications, such as spigot material and spigot taper, etc.). The pin geometry {{was the same as}} for octal, but the pins were thinner (although they will fit into a standard octal socket, they wobble and do not make good contact), the base shell was made of aluminium, and the center hole had an electrical contact that also <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> (hence [...] "loctal") the tube in place. Loctal tubes were only used widely by a few equipment manufacturers, most notably Philco, which used the tubes in many table radios. Loctal tubes have a small indexing mark {{on the side of the}} base skirt; they do not release easily from their sockets unless pushed from that side. Because the pins are actually the Fernico or Cunife lead-out wires from the tube itself, they are prone to intermittent connections caused by the build-up of electrolytic corrosion products due to the pin being of a different metallic composition to the socket contact.|$|E

50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked</b> breech {{using the}} short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|E
50|$|The Pedersen rifle {{operated}} on the hesitation blowback principle: energy released by firing a cartridge immediately caused the breech to start moving rearward, but mechanical leverage {{built into the}} mechanism caused the actual opening of the breech to be delayed long enough so that pressure within the barrel would fall to a safe level. This was achieved with a bearing surface machined onto {{the front end of}} the crank. As the case head pressed on the breech block head and forced it to move rearward (as guided by contact surfaces in the receiver), pressure was exerted on the body, which in turn exerted pressure on the crank. The crank had contact surfaces on its rear end which would transmit pressure to corresponding surfaces in the rear of the receiver, thus relieving the hinge pin of excessive stress. As the rear surface of the body continued to exert pressure on the bearing surface on the front of the crank, the leverage exerted would cause the crank to move about 95 degrees upward from the horizontal on the fulcrum formed by it being attached to the rear of the receiver by the hinge pin. The breech block mechanism thus operated in a manner resembling the operation of the Luger pistol, but unlike that pistol the Pedersen mechanism was at no time <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked.</b> The operating principle was the same as that used in the Model 07/12 Schwarzlose machine gun used by Austria-Hungary during the First World War.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a novel fast charging topology for electric vehicles (EVs). Instead of being {{made as a}} separate unit, the proposed on-board charger utilizes power electronics components that already exist inside the vehicle, namely an asymmetrical six-phase propulsion motor and a six-phase inverter. The charger can operate at unity power factor, and is capable of vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) operation as well. Additional degrees of freedom of the six-phase machine are employed in order to transfer a part of excitation from the torque producing to non-torque/flux producing plane of the machine. Consequently, electromagnetic torque is not produced in the machine during the charging/V 2 G process, so that the rotor {{does not have to}} be <b>mechanically</b> <b>locked.</b> A theoretical analysis of the operating principles is reported, and simulation results are given for both charging and V 2 G mode of operation...|$|E
40|$|Strippable {{coatings}} are polymer mixtures, such as water-based organic polymers, {{that are}} applied to a surface by paintbrush, roller, or spray applicator. As the polymer reacts, it attracts, absorbs, and chemically binds the contaminants; then, during the curing process, it <b>mechanically</b> <b>locks</b> the contaminants into the polymer matrix. Incorporating fiber reinforcement (such as a cotton scrim) into the coating may enhance the strength of these coatings. Once the coating dries, it can be stripped manually from the surface, In the case of auto-release coatings, the mixture cracks, flakes, and is collected by vacuuming. The surface properties of these coatings may be modified by applying a thin top coat (e. g., polyvinyl alcohol), which may provide a smoother, less permeable surface that would become less severely contaminated. In such a duplex, the thicker basis layer provides the required mechanical properties (e. g., strength and abrasion resistance), while the top layer provides protection from contamination. Once the strippable coating is removed, the loose surface contamination is removed with the coating, producing a dry, hard, non-airborne waste product. The use of strippable coatings during D&D operations has proved a viable option. These coatings {{can be used in}} the following three functions: As a protective coating, when applied to an uncontaminated surface in an area where contamination is present, so that on its removal the surface remains uncontaminated; As a decontamination agent, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that on its removal a significant decontamination of loose particulate activity is achieved; and As a fixative or tie-down coating, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that any loose contamination is tied down, thus preventing the spread of contamination during subsequent handling...|$|R
40|$|The model {{presented}} in this paper is the first step towards explaining the mechanisms of ice adhesion. Considerable work, however, remains to validate each term included in the model {{due to the lack of}} physical constants and parameters related to rough surfaces. The ice adhesion model at the ice-substrate interface is based on water behavior before and after freezing, substrate roughness and ice type. Within nanoseconds following impact, water occupies the substrate surface either partially before freezing when drops or rivulets form, or totally when a film is formed. The ice surface area in contact with the substrate is reduced due to the space between drops and rivulets. Due to the electrostatic attraction between water and substrate molecules, ice sticks to the substrate. The electrostatic force depends on the intensity of this bond, which is related to the work needed to maintain the drop shape over the surface and the distance between the water and substrate molecules. The water can also sink in and fill the cavities formed by adjacent surface roughness peaks when the surface tension force is less than the water pressure force. Following the phase change, on the order of microseconds for rime ice, and milliseconds for glaze ice, the ice <b>mechanically</b> <b>locks</b> onto the surface and must be broken down to be shed. This paper shows the development of a phenomenological model to predict the cohesive failure of ice, one that does not take into consideration rime ice porosity. The model assumes that ice near its freezing point is subject to internal and external strains, and that its cohesive strength corresponds to the failure stress. The failure stress is dependent on grain size and creep involving grain boundary sliding in a polycrystalline material at elevated temperatures. The next steps in the development of the model are to quantify the physical parameters, validate an idealized rough surface, as well as evaluate the effects of rime ice porosity and small grain sizes...|$|R
