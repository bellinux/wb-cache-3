5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were {{transferred}} to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there. The women were initially held in the hospital building, and then in their own walled-off section of the prison, with cells in the kitchen and wash house buildings. The women were tasked with washing and <b>mending</b> prisoners' clothing, which was considered hard work.|$|E
5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict. The conflict that ensues ends up being three-sided, among the Pandawas, Kurawas and the ogre-kingdom, whose evil ogre-king Barandjana plans to kidnap Titisari. The confusion that follows results in the outwitting and humiliation of the Kurawas. Siti Sendari, the eldest daughter of Kresna and the estranged wife of Abhimanju, {{takes advantage of the}} situation and schemes to bring Irawan and Titisari together, while also <b>mending</b> her relationships with her husband. Though officially Irawan and Titisari are the hero and heroine of the lakon, in reality they are mere spectators, not the movers, in the play. Brandon describes Irawan as a minor character. Irawan is also depicted as unassertive and manipulated by others, which is common in South Asian theatre. Another lakon called Serat Lampahan Pregiwa Pregiwati also relates a tale about the love of Irawan and Titisari.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} rapid massive endocytosis (<b>MEND)</b> of > 50 % of the plasmalemma in baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK 293 {{cells in}} response to large Ca transients. Constitutively expressed Na/Ca exchangers (NCX 1) are used to generate Ca transients, whereas capacitance recording and a membrane tracer dye, FM 4 – 64, are used to monitor endocytosis. With high cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate (ATP; > 5 mM), Ca influx causes exocytosis followed by <b>MEND.</b> Without ATP, Ca transients cause only exocytosis. <b>MEND</b> can then be initiated by pipette perfusion of ATP, and multiple results indicate that ATP acts via phosphatidylinositol-bis 4, 5 -phosphate (PIP 2) synthesis: PIP 2 substitutes for ATP to induce <b>MEND.</b> ATP-activated <b>MEND</b> is blocked by an inositol 5 -phosphatase and by guanosine 5 ′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS). Block by GTPγS is overcome by the phospholipase C inhibitor, U 73122, and PIP 2 induces <b>MEND</b> {{in the presence of}} GTPγS. <b>MEND</b> can occur in the absence of ATP and PIP 2 when cytoplasmic free Ca is clamped to 10 µM or more by Ca-buffered solutions. ATP-independent <b>MEND</b> occurs within seconds during Ca transients when cytoplasmic solutions contain polyamines (e. g., spermidine) or the membrane is enriched in cholesterol. Although PIP 2 and cholesterol can induce <b>MEND</b> minutes after Ca transients have subsided, polyamines must be present during Ca transients. <b>MEND</b> can reverse over minutes in an ATP-dependent fashion. It is blocked by brief β-methylcyclodextrin treatments, and tests for involvement of clathrin, dynamins, calcineurin, and actin cytoskeleton were negative. Therefore, we turned to the roles of lipids. Bacterial sphingomyelinases (SMases) cause similar <b>MEND</b> responses within seconds, suggesting that ceramide may be important. However, Ca-activated <b>MEND</b> is not blocked by reagents that inhibit SMases. <b>MEND</b> is abolished by the alkylating phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, whereas exocytosis remains robust, and Ca influx causes <b>MEND</b> in cardiac myocytes without preceding exocytosis. Thus, exocytosis is not prerequisite for <b>MEND.</b> From these results and two companion studies, we suggest that Ca promotes the formation of membrane domains that spontaneously vesiculate to the cytoplasmic side...|$|R

25|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear {{frequently in the}} film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror <b>mending</b> itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.|$|E

25|$|However, simple {{husbandry}} {{changes and}} practical midge control measures may help break the livestock infection cycle. Housing livestock {{during times of}} maximum midge activity (from dusk to dawn) may lead to significantly reduced biting rates. Similarly, protecting livestock shelters with fine mesh netting or coarser material impregnated with insecticide will reduce contact with the midges. The Culicoides midges that carry the virus usually breed on animal dung and moist soils, either bare or covered in short grass. Identifying breeding grounds and breaking the breeding cycle will significantly reduce the local midge population. Turning off taps, <b>mending</b> leaks and filling in or draining damp areas will also help dry up breeding sites. Control by trapping midges and removing their breeding grounds may reduce vector numbers. Dung heaps or slurry pits should be covered or removed, and their perimeters (where most larvae are found) regularly scraped.|$|E
