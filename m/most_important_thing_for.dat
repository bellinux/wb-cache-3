25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, {{to the point that it}} seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished {{to be as good as}} him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

New informa-tion about the science and treatment of HIV infection becomes available almost daily. Staying current with it can feel overwhelming. At The Center for AIDS, a non-profit organization that tries to prevent HIV infection from becoming HIV disease, it’s our job to keep on top of new developments. In fact, that’s most of what we do. We don’t provide social services, counseling, or financial assistance. Instead, we pour over medical journals, Internet sites, and other sources looking for information that can keep people with HIV alive and healthy. In early 2000, we produced the first edition of this pamphlet after asking our-selves a simple question: “If we knew only 25 things about the treatment of HIV infection, what would be the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us to know? ” In 2011, when we decided to update the pamphlet, we put a twist on the question: “In the opinion of leading experts in the field, what would be the 25 <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> us to know? ” Consequently, not only is all the informatio...|$|R

2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff had in {{this building}} process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter.

[...] He also often went swimming during breaks, which he dubbed [...] "the ultimate purifier." [...] He followed a mantra of [...] "give the song what it deserves," [...] which entailed creating music without [...] "any sensible or logical decisions." [...] Parker recorded dozens of vocals takes; according to him, for one song, he performed over 1,056 partial vocal takes.
