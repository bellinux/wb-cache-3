25|$|First {{instance}} {{in cases of}} acknowledgment of responsibility: In cases where responsibility is acknowledged, {{this section of the}} tribunal would evaluate the correspondence between the acknowledged acts (and those responsible for them) with the sanctions proposed by the Chamber of Acknowledgment's resolution of conclusions. It would then impose the appropriate sanctions, establish the conditions and modalities for implementing them and supervise compliance with the sentence in cooperation with the <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> bodies and mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|A {{tripartite}} <b>Monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>Verification</b> Mechanism (MM) would {{monitor and}} verify {{implementation of the}} agreement and compliance with the rules governing the ceasefire and decommissioning of weapons. The MM would be integrated by representatives of the Colombian government, the FARC and an International Component made up of unarmed United Nations (UN) observers from Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) member states. The mechanism would have three instances or levels: one national, eight regional verifying structures and 'some' local monitoring structures. The International Component would preside over {{all levels of the}} mechanism, resolve disagreements (such as incidents and violations of the ceasefire or disarmament), present recommendations and present written reports.|$|E
25|$|The June 23 {{agreement}} {{laid down}} the modalities for the bilateral and definite ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, which would begin following the signature of the final agreement. Five days following the signature of the final agreement and following the redeployment of troops, the FARC would begin moving to 23 transitory rural settlement normalization zones (Zonas Veredales Transitorias de Normalización) and 8 encampments {{for the purposes of}} delivering their weapons to the UN mission and prepare for their reincorporation into civilian life. While the normal functioning of unarmed elected civilian authorities within these zones would not be impeded, no civilian population would be allowed to reside in the zones and access would be restricted. A 1 kilometre wide security zone, off limits to both soldiers and guerrilla, would surround each zone. The FARC would designate a group of 60 members to travel throughout the national territory in performance of tasks related to the peace agreement; likewise, within each zone, a group of 10 members of the guerrilla would travel within the municipality and department for the same reasons. The UN would collect and store all weapons received from the FARC, which would later be used to build three monuments. The guerrilla would surrender their weapons gradually in three phases over 180 days from the signature of the final agreement, and the UN mission would certify the process. The announcement offered further details about the tripartite <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> mechanism, with the international component (the UN political mission) presiding the mechanism, resolving controversies and presenting recommendations and reports about the ceasefire and surrender of weapons.|$|E

2500|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{of weapons}} is a [...] "technical, traceable and verifiable procedure through which the UN receives all the weapons of the FARC to destine them {{to the construction of}} 3 monuments" [...] The FARC's decommissioning would involve the following technical procedures: registration, identification, <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> of possession, collection, storage, disablement, removal and final disposition. In short, after the UN registers, identifies and verifies possession of weapons, it would collect all of the FARC's weapons, store them in specific containers, remove them from the zone and disposes of them by building three monuments.|$|E
2500|$|The ZVTN {{would be}} located in {{mutually}} agreed veredas, or rural settlements, within municipalities and be accessible by land or water. They would be of 'reasonable size' to allow <b>monitoring</b> <b>and</b> <b>verification</b> by the MM and compliance with the stated objectives of the ZVTN. Once all of its men have moved to their ZVTN, the FARC would provide the government {{with a list of}} its members present in each ZVTN and the government would suspend arrest warrants for all FARC members located in the zones. [...] While in these zones, the FARC, in coordination with the government, would be allowed to perform any type of training or education for its members. FARC combatants and militiamen would be allowed to leave the zones only in civilian clothing and without weapons.|$|E

CO2CRC is a non profit research collaboration supported by government and industry. The project has stored and monitored over 65,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide-rich gas which was extracted from a natural gas reservoir via a well, compressed and piped 2.25km to a new well. There the gas has been injected into a depleted natural gas reservoir approximately two kilometers below the surface. The project has moved to a second stage and is investigating carbon dioxide trapping in a saline aquifer 1500 meters below the surface.
