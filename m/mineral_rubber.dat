40|$|Within {{recent years}} silica gel has {{received}} considerable attention {{because of its}} use as a sorbent, catalyst and catalyst support. The sorption of about fifty materials on silica has been recorded (2). There is an analogy between gelation of silica sols and many physiological functions; such as, deposition of bone and cartilage, formation of mucus, etc. (3). The reverse of gelation, i. e., the peptization of silica gel, {{is involved in the}} disease known as silicosis. Gelation is also involved in the setting of concrete and cements, solidification of many <b>minerals,</b> <b>rubber,</b> plastics and foods (e. g. jellies). The structure of a gel when formed might, by analogy, give an insight into the structure of many of these substances. [ [...] . ] The study of bound water in silica gels should contribute information on the structure of not only silica but other gels. Little is known about the factors governing bound water in gels in general and less is known about bound water in silica gels in particular. A survey of the literature will show some of the factors governing the gelation process and will give an insight into some of the factors that may affect bound water in silica gels. There are no satisfactory theories of gelation and gel structure {{because of the lack of}} adequate knowledge in this field. Theories of silica gel structure will not be discussed here as the information is available elsewhere (1). [ [...] . ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{historical}} {{issue of}} tire pyrolysis {{has been the}} solid mineral stream, which accounts for about 40% of the output.

40|$|Noise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} environmental problems related to road traffic. During the last decades, the noise emitted by the engines and powertrains of vehicles was greatly reduced and tires became a clearly dominant noise source. The article describes the concept of low noise poroelastic road surfaces that are composed of <b>mineral</b> and <b>rubber</b> aggregate bound by polyurethane resin. Those surfaces have a porous structure and are much more flexible than standard asphalt or cement concrete pavements due to high content of rubber aggregate and elastic binder. Measurements performed in several European countries indicate that such surfaces decrease tire/road noise between 7 dB and 12 dB with respect to reference surfaces such as dense asphalt concrete or stone matrix asphalt. Furthermore, poroelastic road surfaces ascertain the rolling resistance of car tires, which is comparable to classic pavements. One of the unforeseen properties of the poroelastic road surfaces is their ability to decrease the risks related to car fires with fuel spills. The article presents the road and laboratory results of noise, rolling resistance, and fire tests performed on a few types of poroelastic road surfaces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and evaluation of EPDM blends used in the automotive industry. In {{order to reduce the}} conductivity of the EPDM blend, the formula composition of the blend was modified. The carbon black content was reduced and basic types of <b>rubber</b> <b>mineral</b> fillers (Sillitin Z 86, Talc, Mistron R 10 C, Omyacarb 2 VA) and newly developed types of white fillers (WERBALINK® KK 20 R, MPK- 2, VPK 76, IL) were added into rubber compounds. The prepared EPDM blends were submitted to measurements of Mooney viscosity, vulcanizing characteristics (MH, ML, t 10, t 90), mechanical and physical properties (tensile strength, elongation at break, hardness) as well as surface and volume resistivity. The obtained results were compared to values of reference model blend with addition of Sillitin N 85 filler. The processing performance of the EPDM blends were studied by Garvey die extrusion.

50|$|Disadvantages: SMA {{mixtures}} {{typically have}} a higher initial cost compared to other mixtures. SMA mixtures contain more asphalt (6% minimum) compared to conventional mixtures. The asphalt used in SMA mixtures contains a high amount of polymers (or asphalt rubber as an option). In addition to the polymers, SMA mixtures {{require the use of}} fibers (not required with asphalt <b>rubber),</b> <b>mineral</b> filler and may require the use of lime. All of these additives not only add to the initial cost but they often require that the producer make modifications to their typical HMA production processes. SMA mixtures may also require higher quality aggregates than conventional mixtures. SMA mixtures usually require a significant compactive effort; however, they also produce a pavement layer with a higher density compared to conventional mixtures. Generally speaking, it is not good to place any type of hot mix in cool or cold weather. SMA mixtures can be particularly difficult to place in cool weather because they are placed in thin lifts and they contain a high amount of polymer modified binder. They also do not lend themselves well to applications that require a significant amount of hand work.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} behaviour of rubberised concrete members subjected to asymmetric four-point shear loading. A detailed account of tests on 15 prismatic members using conventional concrete as well as rubberised concrete, with relatively high replacement ratios of both fine and coarse <b>mineral</b> aggregates with <b>rubber</b> particles, is given. The results enable direct assessment of strength and complete deformation characteristics including the post-peak response for ultimate behaviour governed both by shear and mixed-mode tensile-shear. After describing the material properties, mix designs and member details, the main observations from detailed measurements of the crack kinematics through a digital image correlation monitoring system, with focus on members developing shear-governed response, are reported. Complementary numerical studies are undertaken using nonlinear finite element procedures which are validated against tests developing shear-governed failures. In order to provide further insight into the key response characteristics, particularly those related to ultimate strength, a number of numerical sensitivity studies employing various constitutive parameters are also carried out. Moreover, comparative assessments in terms of shear resistance, toughness and force transfer across the cracked interfaces are performed and discussed. The detailed test measurements, coupled with the results obtained from the numerical simulations, permit the definition of expressions for representing the shear resistance {{as a function of}} the rubber content and concrete compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} the present work was to {{consider}} the effect of different samples thicknesses on the acoustic absorption coefficient. Materials and Methods: An impedance tube was built with two microphones accordance to ISO- 10534 and the American Society for Testing Materials-E 1050 standards. For the measurement of absorption, the study was carried for 25 and 30 mm thicknesses of closed cell polyurethane foam, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), <b>rubber,</b> <b>mineral</b> wool, carpet, and glass samples. Measurements were performed by impedance tube and VA-lab 4 software. Results: In carpet and mineral wool with more thickness, the absorption was increased but, the carpet with less thickness showed more sound absorption in the frequency range of 1500 - 3600 Hz. The peak of the absorption coefficient of 25 mm glass was 0. 36 that the amount was reduced to 0. 2 in the 30 mm thickness. Furthermore, the difference between the peak absorption of two thicknesses in polystyrene sample was equal to 0. 29. In fact, polystyrene with less thickness had better sound absorption. The same situation was happened for glass in frequencies of below 4500 Hz with less thickness. Conclusion: Incident sound energy, which is not absorbed, must be reflected, transmitted, or dissipated. The porous materials had a higher absorption coefficient. Carpet and mineral wool samples had the highest absorption coefficient, but the materials such as polyurethane foam, PVC, and rubber had lower sound absorption...|$|R
40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Chemical and Process Engineering for the degree of Master of Science in Sustainable Process Development. CD-ROM Included. To find alternative environmental friendly methods for disposing waste glazed tiles, a detailed scientific study was carried out on evaluating techno-economical feasibility of utilizing waste glazed tiles as a raw material/ additive. Economical feasibility of size reduction of waste glazed tiles and technical feasibility of utilizing ceramic tile dust as non-black <b>mineral</b> filler in <b>rubber</b> were studied in this regard. Pilot-scale hammer mill and pot mill were utilized for size reduction process. Particle size distribution was analyzed according to standard testing methodologies by use of standard sieve analyzer and particle size analyzer. Rubber compounding was done for three master batch designs by use of pilot scale internal mixture having 1 kg capacity and two roll mill. Curing characteristics of the test samples and physical properties including hardness, tensile strength, tear strength and abrasion were analyzed. Moreover, literature review and baseline survey were carried out to collect information on waste tile generation index, available waste tile management practices, required particle size ranges to use waste glazed tiles as a raw material/ additive etc. Results of the pilot studies revealed that use of ceramic floor tile waste as recycled aggregate in concrete production and application of this waste (ceramic tile dust) as non-black mineral filler in natural rubber is both technically and economically feasible in Sri Lanka. However, utilizing this waste as an alternative raw material in cement industry for clinkerization is not technically feasible for the currently available only cement kiln at Puttalam, Sri Lanka.

40|$|Import price {{elasticity}} {{tends to be}} under-estimated due to the omission of quality effects. This dissertation aims to fill this gap by analyzing 1) how quality effects affect the estimation of import {{price elasticity}}, 2) the impact of quality innovation in the various goods sectors of an economy and 3) the limitations pertaining to the estimation of the true import price elasticity {{as well as the}} policy implications of quality innovation on trade. In order to adjust for quality effects, a quality proxy is constructed. This proxy considers the role of product innovation in the form of Research and Development (R&D) expenditure as well as externalities arising from the knowledge acquired in other sectors and countries. A gravity model is formulated to isolate the price effect from the quality effect in estimating the import price elasticity. A panel analysis is used, covering 9 European countries (Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and United Kingdom) over the period of 1996 to 2003. The empirical results indicate that the import price elasticities are higher with adjustments for quality, although they do not reach unity as predicted by the theoretical elasticity of substitution. The high values of price elasticity show that quality innovation not only encourages trade but also encourages domestic consumption of local and better quality products. In particular, the sectors which recorded an import price elasticity superior to 1 are those which produce homogeneous and non-industrialized products like metal products, non-metallic <b>mineral</b> products, textiles, <b>rubber</b> and plastics. Exporting countries that gain the most through quality innovation are Spain, Finland and the UK. The role of quality innovation has a significant effect of increasing overall trade for the region. Quality innovation of 1 % {{on the part of the}} exporters increases their exports by a range of 0. 2 to 1. 2 percentage points. As such, quality innovation should be strongly encouraged to increase trade flows of the countries so as to increase the economy‟s overall growth. import price elasticity, quality, innovation, elasticity of substitution, international trade, product differentiation...|$|R
