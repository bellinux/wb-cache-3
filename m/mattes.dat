5|$|In July 1978, Lucas {{revealed}} that Radioland Murders {{was still in}} development, and that both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams were approached for the two leads. The script was being rewritten and the planned start date was early 1979. However, throughout the 1970s to early 1990s, Radioland Murders remained in development hell. Between this time, Lucas commissioned Theodore J. Flicker to perform a rewrite. In early 1993 Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital <b>mattes,</b> would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million.|$|E

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) made an {{instrumental}} {{version of the}} song for the 1998 album Material Girl: RPO Plays Music of Madonna. German actress Eva <b>Mattes</b> covered the song for her 2006 album Language of Love. In 2007, The Bubonic Plague recorded a cover of the song that was included on the tribute album Through the Wilderness.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use existing equipment such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin <b>Mattes</b> was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

5|$|George Lucas began {{development}} for the film in the 1970s, originally attached as director for Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz's script. Universal Pictures commenced pre-production and both Steve Martin and Cindy Williams had already been approached for the two leads before Radioland Murders languished in development hell for over 20 years. In 1993, Lucas told Universal that advances in computer-generated imagery from Industrial Light & Magic (owned by Lucasfilm), particularly in digital <b>mattes,</b> would help bring Radioland Murders in for a relatively low budget of about $10 million, which eventually rose to $15 million. Mel Smith was hired to direct and filming lasted from October to December 1993. Radioland Murders was released on October 21, 1994, to negative reviews from critics and bombed at the box office, only grossing $1.37 million in US totals.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different <b>mattes</b> for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E

40|$|Wear {{resistance}} of synthetic graphite against liquid industrial platinum group metals furnace <b>matte</b> (Cu–Fe–Ni–S) was investigated from 800 °C to 1450 °C at a contact time of 1 hour. Graphite resistance {{was measured by}} the extent of liquid-matte penetration through the graphite, using Xray microtomography. The <b>matte</b> was molten at 900 °C, and it penetrated through cracks in the graphite wall. The <b>matte</b> penetration depth into the graphite did not increase with temperature. The <b>matte</b> loss in the gas phase increased with temperature. During melting, the volume of the industrial <b>matte</b> expanded. As the <b>matte</b> expanded, it pushed {{against the wall of the}} graphite and penetrated through cracks in the graphite wall. Where the crucible volume was large enough to accommodate the expanded <b>matte,</b> the <b>matte</b> did not penetrate through the graphite. Graphite exhibited poor resistance against penetration by the liquid industrial platinum group metals furnace <b>matte.</b> Anglo American Platinum and Lonmin.

40|$|Penetration of <b>matte</b> into tap-hole bricks causes {{detrimental}} refractory wear, {{which can}} lead to furnace breakouts. The ability of the tap-hole clay to form a protective layer on the brick, thereby limiting <b>matte</b> penetration was investigated by examining the interaction between platinum group metal (PGM) <b>matte,</b> tap-hole clay, and alumina-chrome refractory bricks on a laboratory scale. Samples containing clay and brick as well as samples containing clay, brick, and <b>matte</b> were heated to different temperatures to establish the clay-brick interaction and the extent of <b>matte</b> penetration. The greatest degree of physical contact between the brick and clay was achieved at curing temperatures of 600 °C. Poor clay-brick contact was observed in the sample that was heated to 900 °C. <b>Matte</b> displaced the clay in the clay-brick-matte sample that was heated to 1350 °C, with significant <b>matte</b> penetration into the brick. Less <b>matte</b> penetration was observed when the clay-brick-matte sample was heated to 1500 °C. Less <b>matte</b> penetration was also observed in the claybrick- <b>matte</b> sample in which the clay and brick were pre-baked at 800 °C, and the sample then reacted with <b>matte</b> at 1350 °C.

25|$|Travel diminished after 1860, as the Civil War caused {{considerable}} disruptions on the trail. Many of {{the people}} on the trail in 1861–1863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail historian Merrill J. <b>Mattes</b> has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861–1867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.|$|E

50|$|<b>Matte</b> polish is like regular polish, {{but has a}} {{purposely}} {{dull finish}} rather than a shine.

25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera <b>mattes,</b> and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will Be OK films.|$|E
25|$|The {{precursor}} sciences to {{the development}} of modern computer graphics were the advances in electrical engineering, electronics, and television that took place {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the Lumiere brothers' use of <b>mattes</b> to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first cathode ray tube, the Braun tube, was invented in 1897 - it in turn would permit the oscilloscope and the military control panel - the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-World War II period - during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure university and laboratory academic research into more advanced computers and the United States military's further development of technologies like radar, advanced aviation, and rocketry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading {{to the development}} of computer graphics as a discipline.|$|E
