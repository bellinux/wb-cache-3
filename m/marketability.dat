5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game ever played. The game further increased football's <b>marketability</b> to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over <b>marketability,</b> e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international <b>marketability.</b> Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been held back by his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|The {{profile of}} the sport reached a new high in the 1980s, {{with a number of}} athletes {{becoming}} household names (such as Carl Lewis, Sergey Bubka, Sebastian Coe, Zola Budd and Florence Griffith-Joyner). Many world records were broken in this period, and the added political element between competitors of the United States, East Germany, and the Soviet Union, in reaction to the Cold War, only served to stoke the sport's popularity. The increase in the commercial capacity of track and field was also met with developments in the application of sports science, and there were many changes to coaching methods, athlete's diet regimes, training facilities and sports equipment. This was also accompanied by an increase in the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and prominent cases, such as those of Olympic gold medallists Ben Johnson and Marion Jones, damaged the public image and <b>marketability</b> of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced <b>marketability</b> of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E
25|$|The {{discount}} {{for lack}} of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount {{for lack of}} <b>marketability.</b> It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of <b>marketability</b> of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, {{and the owner of}} that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of <b>marketability</b> is appropriate.|$|E
25|$|The {{referenced}} studies {{establish a}} reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s {{to the low}} 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of <b>marketability</b> discount is the Quantifying <b>Marketability</b> Discounts Model (QMDM).|$|E
25|$|However, if {{the subject}} company is privately owned, its value must be {{adjusted}} for lack of <b>marketability.</b> This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction {{in the value of}} the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of <b>marketability.</b> This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of <b>marketability</b> can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to measure the}} <b>marketability</b> discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in initial public offerings (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks {{for a period of}} three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the <b>marketability</b> discount.|$|E
25|$|Farm-raised salmon are fed the {{carotenoids}} astaxanthin and canthaxanthin {{to match}} their flesh colour to wild salmon to improve their <b>marketability.</b>|$|E
25|$|Valuation {{discounts}} are multiplicative, so {{they must}} be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before <b>marketability</b> discounts are applied.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor to}} be {{considered}} in valuing closely held companies is the <b>marketability</b> of an interest in such businesses. <b>Marketability</b> is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and {{with a high degree of}} certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC Regulation S, enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting {{from the lack of}} <b>marketability.</b> These discounts are similar to the <b>marketability</b> discounts inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.|$|E
25|$|Constraints {{may include}} {{available}} resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, safety, <b>marketability,</b> productivity, and serviceability. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive specifications for the limits within which a viable object or {{system may be}} produced and operated.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, newly {{appointed}} CEO Steve Rosich {{confirmed that the}} Fremantle Football Club would undergo a thorough review of all areas, including the club's team name, song, guernsey, and logo {{in a bid to}} boost its <b>marketability.</b> However he later confirmed that the purple colour will be maintained as it had become synonymous with Fremantle.|$|E
25|$|The Champions League {{expanded}} to 32 clubs in 2009 with direct {{entry to the}} top ten Asian leagues. Each country received up to 4 slots, though no {{more than one-third of}} the number of teams in that country's top division, rounded downwards, depending on the strength of their league, league structure (professionalism), <b>marketability,</b> financial status, and other criteria set by the AFC Pro-League committee.|$|E
25|$|The {{underlying}} data {{by which}} these studies arrived at their conclusions {{has not been}} made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a <b>marketability</b> discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} teams that each {{association}} enters into the AFC Champions League is determined annually through criteria as {{set by the}} AFC Competitions Committee. The criteria, which is {{a modified version of}} the UEFA coefficient, measures such thing as <b>marketability</b> and stadia to determine the specific number of berths that an association receives. The higher an association's ranking as determined by the criteria, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in.|$|E
25|$|This is {{when the}} mining company makes the {{decision}} whether to develop the mine or {{to walk away from}} the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the metallurgy and ore recoverability, <b>marketability</b> and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.|$|E
25|$|Baer {{has said}} that playing Jethro Bodine sank his acting career. When Paul Henning asked him to reprise the role for a 1981 {{television}} movie, he declined. Yet when the feature film The Beverly Hillbillies was made 22 years later, reports cited Baer's dissatisfaction that only Ebsen was asked to do a cameo. He appeared in the 1993 television special The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies, reprising his role as Jethro. By 2004, Baer had recognized the <b>marketability</b> of The Beverly Hillbillies and appeared with actress Donna Douglas at the annual TV Land Awards.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} {{overpricing}} {{is also an}} important consideration. If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay, the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell shares. Even if they sell all of the issued shares, the stock may fall in value {{on the first day of}} trading. If so, the stock may lose its <b>marketability</b> and hence even more of its value. This could result in losses for investors, many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriters. Perhaps the best known example of this is the Facebook IPO in 2012.|$|E
25|$|New Japan's {{dominance}} in the feud injured the <b>marketability</b> of the UWFi promotion, which had pressed the perception that their athletes boasted legitimate skill in catch wrestling and kickboxing. In a bid to regain credibility, Yoji Anjoh travelled to California to challenge Rickson Gracie in the latter's own dojo, only to be swiftly and brutally defeated before the assembled Japanese press that had followed him there. With the UWFi's formerly fearsome reputation in tatters, its attendance numbers swiftly decreased, with the federation closing its doors {{once and for all}} in December 1996. In their final show it was Sakuraba who at long last headlined, defeating Anjoh by submission.|$|E
25|$|The Whalers were {{hampered}} by numerous off-ice factors. Hartford was the smallest American {{market in the}} NHL and was located on the traditional dividing line between the home territories for Boston and the two New York area teams, the Rangers and Islanders. This limited the team's <b>marketability.</b> Additionally, {{for most of the}} Whalers' tenure as an NHL team, the Hartford Civic Center was one of the smallest arenas in the league. At its maximum, it seated just 15,635 for hockey. The team averaged over 14,000 fans only twice in its 15 years at the Civic Center. They averaged only 13,867 from 1980 to 1997. Most of their sellouts came when the Bruins or New York Rangers played in Hartford, bringing thousands of their own fans with them.|$|E
25|$|The MiG-21 was {{exported}} {{widely and}} remains in use. The aircraft's simple controls, engine, weapons, and avionics were typical of Soviet-era military designs. The {{use of a}} tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the flight envelope, enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots; this in turn enhanced its <b>marketability</b> in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools. While technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced, low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying Eastern Bloc military hardware. Several Russian, Israeli and Romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to MiG-21 operators, designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard, with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{practices}} of manipulation and adulteration {{have gone through}} stages of being considered fraudulent and later accepted as common practice. One {{of these is the}} practice of blending other grape varieties in order to add a characteristic that is lacking in the original wine. This most often occurred {{in the case of a}} wine lacking color. A wine with a deep dark color is often associated with being of a higher quality, so blending a darker color variety (or a teinturier) into a lighter wine could enhance the <b>marketability</b> of the wine. Today the practice of blending grape varieties together is commonly accepted (such as blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot), except where such blending is against the regulation of a particular appellation (such as the controversy over the Brunellopoli scandal in Brunello di Montalcino).|$|E
25|$|Restricted {{stocks are}} equity {{securities}} of public {{companies that are}} similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded {{on the open market}} for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of <b>marketability,</b> is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 the {{government}} enacted the Real Estate Investment Trust Act {{to allow the}} creation of the real estate investment trust (REIT) to encourage real estate investment, and in 1977 Bank of America issued the first private label pass-through. In 1983 the Federal Reserve Board amended Regulation T to allow broker-dealers to use pass-throughs as margin collateral, equivalent to over-the-counter non-convertible bonds. In 1984 {{the government}} passed the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act to improve the <b>marketability</b> of private label pass-throughs, which declared nationally recognized statistical rating organization AA-rated mortgage-backed securities to be legal investments equivalent to Treasury securities and other federal government bonds for federally charted banks (such as federal savings banks and federal savings associations), state-chartered financial institutions (such as depository banks and insurance companies) unless overridden by state law before October 1991 (which 21 states did), and Department of Labor–regulated pension funds.|$|E
25|$|Player safety {{has become}} a major issue within the past five years and concussions, which result from a hard hit to the head, have been the biggest cause. With recent studies showing how concussions can affect retired players and how it has {{decreased}} their quality of life after retirement, concussions have become a very important topic of debate when it comes to player safety issues. This had significant effects on the league as elite players were being taken out of the game, such as Sidney Crosby being sidelined for approximately 10 and a half months, which adversely affected the league's <b>marketability.</b> As a result, in December 2009, Brendan Shanahan was hired to replace Colin Campbell and given the role of Senior Vice-President of Player Safety. Shanahan began to hand out suspensions on high-profile perpetrators responsible for dangerous hits, such as Raffi Torres receiving 25 games for his hit on Marian Hossa.|$|E
25|$|The {{transition}} from gruit to hops throughout Europe in the Middle Ages was a piecemeal, region-by-region process that lasted at least 500 years. It took time for farmers {{to learn of}} the existence of hops, how to farm them, when to cultivate them, and their value in brewing beer. Brewers had to learn the favourable and unfavourable characteristics of hops, and how to use hops to craft commercially successful beer. Even in the Middle Ages beer was an international commodity, and major brewing cities developed distinctive styles and reputations. Brewers had to consider the <b>marketability</b> of their beer, and competition from imports. Furthermore, regulations limited brewing ingredients in some jurisdictions. Even when a monarch permitted hop brewing, the hops might be taxed. What steps John took to institute hops in Flemish brewing is not documented, but he lived during a time when hops were being legalised in nearby jurisdictions. He was age 20 or 21 in 1392, when Duke Albert I granted the Dutch cities of Haarlem and Gouda permission to brew beer with hops.|$|E
25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. She likes the town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the <b>marketability</b> of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of training {{applicable to the}} field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The University of Southern California {{was one of the first}} schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the Indiana State University who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the University of North Carolina's online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often don’t have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing <b>marketability</b> in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the University of Connecticut's online OSH Certificate, provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health through their NIOSH Education and Research Centers.|$|E
