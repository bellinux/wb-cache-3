50|$|Limited normal {{functions}} and movements {{are caused by}} osteochondromas growing slowly and inwardly. The majority of osteochondromas are symptomless and are found incidentally. Each individual with osteochondroma may experience symptoms differently {{and most of the}} time individuals will experience no symptoms at all. Some of the most common symptoms are a hard immobile painless palpable mass, adjacent muscle soreness, and pressure or irritation with heavy exercising.Major symptoms arise when complications such as fractures, bone deformity or <b>mechanical</b> <b>joint</b> problems occur. If the occurrence of an osteochondroma is near a nerve or a blood vessel, the affected limb can experience numbness, weakness, loss of pulse or color change. Periodic changes in the blood flow can also take place. Approximately 20% of patients experiencing nerve compression commonly acknowledge vascular compression, arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm. Formation of pseudoaneurysm and venous thrombosis lead to claudication, pain, acute ischemia, and symptoms of phlebitis. If the tumor is found under a tendon, it can cause pain during movement causing restriction of joint motion. Pain can also occur due to bursal inflammation, swelling or fracture at the base of the tumor stalk. Some of the clinical signs and symptoms of malignant osteochondroma are pain, swelling, and mass enlargement.|$|E
5000|$|Bolger's first {{generation}} of [...] "chine log instant boats" [...] for home building {{was followed by a}} generation of [...] "stitch and glue" [...] (aka [...] "tack and tape") boats. This technique was made possible by the evolution of glues and the massification of polyester and epoxy resins combined with fiberglass tape. The new technique basically did away with the chine logs and mechanical fasteners and all the problems associated with their use (mainly the limitation of shape in the design phase, the carpentry challenge in the construction phase and damp/rot in the medium to long term). Instead of using a chine to join the precut panels, in stitch and glue, the preshaped panels are wrapped around bulkheads and/or frames {{in the same way as}} before. However, the panels are only temporarily held in place using nails, duct tape, cable ties, masking tape, wire or other mechanical means, while the seams are filled (both inside and outside the hull) with a resin and filler paste covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth or tape which in turn is saturated in resin. Once the resin hardens, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joint</b> is stronger than the joined plywood and therefore structurally sound. Payson again popularised the technique in his book Build the New Instant Boats (1984, 160 pages, 8" [...] × 11", 110 illustrations - Also still in print). In this book Payson introduces what he termed [...] "Tack and tape" [...] to the greater American public. The book includes plans for Gypsy (15' sail/oar/outboard), Nymph (7'9" [...] dinghy with sail option), Diablo (15' motor boat for up to 25 HP outboard) as well as 8 more [...] "traditional instant boats" [...] using the chine log method: 16' Lug-rigger Windsprint, 6'5" [...] Tortoise, 8' Skimmer, Dynamite Sailboard, 16'June Bug, Madeline a 19'6" [...] Pedal-driven sidewheeler and the 23'6" [...] Light Schooner.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the hydroelastic response of multiple floating beams connected together by <b>mechanical</b> <b>joints</b> with rotational spring stiffness under wave action. A frequency domain approach is developed for the hydroelastic analysis. The fluid is assumed to be incompressible, inviscid and its motion irrotational so that a velocity potential exists and thus the fluid motion is governed by the Laplace 2 ̆ 7 s equation. The floating beams are modelled by the Timoshenko beam theory which allows for the effects of transverse shear deformation and rotary inertia. The boundary element method (BEM) is used to solve the governing equation and boundary conditions of the fluid domain. The finite element method (FEM) is employed for solving beam equation of motion. The study investigates the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia, relative beam stiffnesses, rotational stiffness of <b>mechanical</b> <b>joints,</b> and the varying seabed profile on the hydroelastic responses of the interconnected floating beams.

The effect of applied bolt torque, the contribution of adhesive bonding, and the number and configuration of bolts on the load capacity and failure mode of the double-lap bolted joints were investigated. The results showed that {{at different levels of}} applied bolt torque (10, 15, 20 and 25 N-m), little friction resistance developed.

On the other hand, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>joints</b> using bolts accompanied by adhesive bonding provided resistance against slipping. The flexural behavior of full-scale fibre composite beams with joints at midspan connected with bolts alone and a combination of bolts and epoxy was further examined. The beams connected using bolts and epoxy exhibited the same strength and stiffness as the beams without joints while using bolts alone resulted to a beam with only 65 % of the stiffness of those without joints. This showed that the combination of bolts and epoxy adhesives could provide a reliable connection method for fibre reinforced composite beams. ...|$|R
