Part II of Linna's work markedly opened the larger view and the tales of the Reds in the 1918 war, and it had a significant <b>mental</b> <b>effect</b> in Finland. At the same time, a new point of view for the war was opened by the books of Paavo Haavikko [...] "Private matters"(Finnish: Yksityisiä asioita), by Veijo Meri [...] "The events of 1918" [...] (Finnish: Vuoden 1918 tapahtumat) and Paavo Rintala [...] "My grandmother and Mannerheim" [...] (Finnish: Mummoni ja Mannerheim), all published in 1960.|$|E

2500|$|The pioneer British {{psychiatrist}} Henry Maudsley asserted much [...] "evidence that organic morbid poisons bred in {{the organism}} {{or in the}} blood itself may act in the most baneful manner upon the supreme nervous centers. The earliest and mildest <b>mental</b> <b>effect</b> by which a perverted state of blood declares itself {{is not in the}} production of positive delusion or incoherence of thought, but in a modification of mental tone", then perhaps [...] "a chronic delusion of some kind", though [...] "its more acute action is to produce more or less active delirium and general incoherence of thought". Famed British surgeon William Hunter incriminated oral sepsis in 1900, and lectured to a Canadian medical faculty in Montreal in 1910. Two years later, Chicago physician Frank Billings termed it focal infection. Within the English-speaking world, the lectures of Hunter and of Billings [...] "ignited the fires of focal infection", whose theory converged with the autointoxication principle.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is expected to}} produce secondary <b>mental</b> health <b>effects</b> that may increase suicide and alcohol death rates. However, the <b>mental</b> health <b>effects</b> of the {{economic crisis}} can be offset by social welfare and other policy measures. For example, active labour market programmes aimed at helping people retain or regain jobs counteract the <b>mental</b> health <b>effects</b> of the economic crisis. Family support programmes contribute to counteracting the <b>mental</b> health <b>effects</b> of the crisis. Increasing alcohol prices and restricting alcohol availability reduce the harmful <b>effects</b> on <b>mental</b> health and save lives. Debt relief programmes will help to reduce the <b>mental</b> health <b>effects</b> of the economic crisis and accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and prevent <b>mental</b> health <b>effects...</b>|$|R

60|$|But not to sleep. Perhaps the {{responsibility}} towards these solitary children, which Johnson had so lightly shaken off, devolved upon me as I lay there, for I found myself imagining a dozen emergencies of their unprotected state, {{with which the}} elder girl could scarcely grapple. There was little to fear from depredatory man or beast--desperadoes of the mountain trail never stooped to ignoble burglary, bear or panther seldom approached a cabin--but there was the chance of sudden illness, fire, the accidents that beset childhood, {{to say nothing of}} the narrowing moral and <b>mental</b> <b>effect</b> of their isolation at that tender age. It was scandalous in Johnson to leave them alone.|$|E
6000|$|But, as a rule, {{he deals}} with his {{impressions}} of the work as an artistic whole, and tries to translate those impressions into words, to give, as it were, the literary equivalent for the imaginative and <b>mental</b> <b>effect.</b> He {{was one of the}} first to develop what has been called the art-literature of the nineteenth century, that form of literature which has found in Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning, its two most perfect exponents. His description of Lancret's Repas Italien, in which 'a dark-haired girl, [...] "amorous of mischief," [...] lies on the daisy-powdered grass,' is in some respects very charming. Here is his account of 'The Crucifixion,' by Rembrandt. It is extremely characteristic of his style:- ...|$|E
60|$|It was, indeed, Miss Cassandra Hopkins, {{daughter}} of that Honorable Alva who--according to Mr. Bixby was all ready {{with a certain}} sum {{of money to be}} the next governor. Miss Cassandra was arrayed fluffily in cool, pink lawn, and she carried a fringed parasol, and she was gazing upward with telling effect into the face of the gentleman by her side. This would have all been very romantic if the gentleman had been young and handsome, but he was certainly not a man to sweep a young girl off her feet. He was tall, angular, though broad-shouldered, with a long, scrawny neck that rose out of a very low collar, and a large head, scantily covered with hair--a head that gave a physical as well as a <b>mental</b> <b>effect</b> of hardness. His smooth-shaven face seemed to bear witness that its owner was one who had pushed frugality to the borders of a vice. It was not a pleasant face, but now it wore an almost benign expression under the influence of Miss Cassandra's eyes. So intent, apparently, were both of them upon each other that they did not notice the group on the bench at {{the other side of the}} grove. William Wetherell ventured to ask Jethro who the man was.|$|E

60|$|The {{same feeling}} it was too, that {{led her to}} spend long {{hours of the day}} and even of the night, when by rights she should have been asleep, {{immersed}} in endless mathematical studies, and in solving, or attempting to solve, almost impossible problems. She found that the strenuous effort of the brain acted as a counter-irritant to the fretting of her troubles, and though it may seem an odd thing to say, mathematics alone, owing to the intense application they required, exercised a soothing effect upon her. But, as one cannot constantly sleep induced by chloral without paying for it in some shape or form, Angela's relief from her cares was obtained at no small cost to her health. When the same brain, however well developed it may be, has both to study hard and suffer much, there must be a waste of tissue somewhere. In Angela's case the outward and visible result of this state of things was to make her grow thinner, and the alternate <b>mental</b> <b>effect</b> to increasingly rarefy an intellect already too ethereal for this work-a-day world, and to plunge its owner into fits of depression which were rendered dreadful by sudden forebodings of evil that would leap to life in the recesses of her mind, and for a moment cast a lurid glare upon its gloom, such as at night the lightning gives to the blackness which surrounds it.|$|E
