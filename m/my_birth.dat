500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting <b>My</b> <b>Birth.</b> Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E

2500|$|Despite her {{dislike of}} Detroit and her medical problems, Kahlo's {{time in the}} city was {{beneficial}} for her artistic expression. She experimented with different techniques, such as etching and frescos, and her paintings began to show a stronger narrative style. She also began placing emphasis on the themes of [...] "terror, suffering, wounds, and pain". Despite {{the popularity of the}} mural in Mexican art at the time, she adopted a diametrically opposed medium, votive images or retablos, religious paintings made on small metal sheets by amateur artists to thank saints for their blessings during a calamity. Amongst the works she made in the retablo manner in Detroit are Henry Ford Hospital (1932), <b>My</b> <b>Birth</b> (1932), and Self-Portrait on the Border of Mexico and United States (1932).

2500|$|While in Belgrade, Kočić met {{the writer}} Janko Veselinović, whose popular {{short stories and}} novels romanticized Serbian peasant life. Kočić shared several of his poems with Veselinović.

His behaviour became extremely volatile, as seen in a letter he wrote his childhood friend and future wife Milka Vukmanović, threatening to kill her and then himself if she married another. Letters to his father, pressing for money, also struck an abusive and manipulative tone. The thought of committing suicide began to appear more frequently in his notes.

[...] When he was five, [...] his family moved from Somerville to Arlington, Massachusetts.

[...] He stated the name change from the original Chakmakjian reflected the desire to simplify his name because [...] "nobody ever pronounced it right". However, Hovhaness' daughter Jean Nandi has written in her book Unconventional Wisdom, [...] "My father's name at the time of <b>my</b> <b>birth</b> was 'Hovaness', pronounced with accent on the first syllable.

2500|$|On August 8, the {{opportunity}} to express himself was presented when incidents began in Monastir upon the forced internment in a Muslim cemetery of {{the son of a}} naturalized citizen. A fight erupted between the population and law enforcement, ending with one person dead and numerous injured. Bourguiba soon convinced Monastirian notables who were victims of police brutality, to choose him as their lawyer. On September 4, without informing the Destour of his initiative, Bourguiba led a protest delegation to the bey. They were welcomed by a man of confidence, who listened to their requests. Nevertheless, the party leadership, seeing in this the pretext {{to put a stop to}} activism that displeased them, decided to blame to the young nationalist: [...] "It was he [...] who announced me that a blame motion had been decided against me. I was outraged. Because my procedures at the head of this delegation protesting to the bey was not on the party's behalf, but on the behalf of a lawyer who intervened to defend his clients, all originating in Monastir, <b>my</b> <b>birth</b> city. Therefore, nothing justified this blame motion. My membership in the executive committee of the Destour should not prohibit me from other activity. Should it be so, there was no option left for me but to resign. Materi and the other members of L'Action Tunisienne wanted to do the same. But I dissuaded them, their presence in the executive committee could have been useful", he recalled years later.|$|E
