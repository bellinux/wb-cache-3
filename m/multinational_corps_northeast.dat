The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I.

50|$|<b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast</b> {{was formed}} on 18 September 1999 at Szczecin, Poland, which became its headquarters. It evolved {{from what was}} for many years the only {{multinational}} corps in NATO, Allied Land Forces Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland (LANDJUT) (in its turn, a part of Allied Forces Northern Europe). From 1962 LANDJUT had {{been responsible for the}} defence of the Baltic Approaches from a headquarters at Rendsburg, Germany. It comprised the 6th Panzergrenadier Division and the Danish Jutland Division.|$|E
50|$|The IV Corps was {{headquartered}} at Potsdam {{in eastern}} Germany and controlled two Panzer-Grenadier Divisions, the 13th and 14th. The 14th Panzergrenadier Division also {{took control of}} units in Western Germany re-subordinated from the 6th Panzergrenadier Division when it lost its command function. It would have made up the German contribution to the <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast</b> in time of war. IV Corps also used to have under its command the Military District Command I, the 1st Airmobile Brigade, and the Berlin Command (:de:Standortkommando Berlin).|$|E
50|$|After {{the flight}} and {{expulsion}} of Germans from Poland {{during and after}} World War II and Polish settlement in the newly acquired territories, Szczecin became the administrative and industrial centre of Polish Western Pomerania. It is now {{the site of the}} University of Szczecin, Pomeranian Medical University, Maritime University of Szczecin, West Pomeranian University of Technology, and Art Academy of Szczecin, and the see of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Szczecin-Kamień. From 1999 onwards, Szczecin has served as the site of the headquarters of NATO's <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast.</b>|$|E
50|$|All corps {{have now}} been disbanded or {{transferred}} to a multinational level such as <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> North East. IV Corps was reorganized and on 31 March 2002 became an overseas deployment command, the Einsatzführungskommando der Bundeswehr, like the British Permanent Joint Headquarters. An army reorganisation {{in recent years has}} seen the disbandment of the 13th Mechanized Infantry Division headquarters, a merge of the Airmobile Operations Division and Special Operations Division headquarters, the disbandment of the 1st Airmobile Brigade, and reshuffling of units between divisions. No heavy brigades were disbanded, but the two remaining heavy divisions command three rather than two brigades.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Patton is a {{managing}} partner with Pinnacle Five, LLC, {{a group of}} former senior enlisted members from the DoD services who served with him during his tenure as Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard; and is the President and National Commander of the Non Commissioned Officers Association (NCOA).

50|$|Westover Field {{was created}} by a war-readiness {{appropriation}} signed by president Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939. The site used to be tobacco crop fields east of and part of Fairview, east of Aldenview, and northern Willimansett. It {{was assigned to the}} United States Army Air <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast</b> Air District. It was renamed Westover Air Force Base in 1948 after that Air Force's creation as a separate service. In 1974 SAC leadership turned the base over to the Air Force Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Formerly {{organised}} {{according to}} Warsaw Pact standards, {{the armed forces}} are currently being reorganised according to NATO standards. 'Eagle Guardian' is apparently the NATO planning designation for contingency plans to deploy and defend Poland and the Baltic States. Poland is also playing an increasingly larger role as a major European peacekeeping {{power in the world}} through various UN peacekeeping actions, and cooperation with neighbouring nations through multinational formations and units such as the <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast</b> and POLUKRBAT. As of 1 January 2010, the Armed Forces of the Republic of Poland have transitioned to a completely contract-based manpower supply system.|$|E
50|$|The 14th Panzergrenadier Division (14. Panzergrenadierdivision) was a German {{mechanized}} infantry formation. It {{was part}} of the <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> <b>Northeast,</b> a NATO corps that includes German, Polish, and Danish troops. In the wake of military restructuring aimed at reducing the size of the German land forces, the 14th Panzergrenadier Division was disbanded in 2008. The division's formation was notable in that it was a Bundeswehr formation created after the reunification of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, and which was formed in part from soldiers who had served in the National People's Army (NVA) of the GDR.|$|E

50|$|He {{has held}} {{numerous}} command positions {{at various levels}} both on active duty and in the U.S. Army Reserve. General McLaren most recently served as {{the commander of the}} Iraq Assistance Group within <b>Multinational</b> <b>Corps</b> - Iraq. As the commander of the group, he directed the military transition teams assigned to Iraqi army units at the battalion, brigade and division level—coaching, mentoring, and partnering with them in fighting the Counter Insurgency Battle in Iraq. During this mission, then Brigadier General McLaren, was the senior representative of the largest mobilization call up of 80th Division Soldiers since World War II. Prior to his deployment to Iraq, General McLaren served as the Assistant Division Commander- Operations for the 80th Division (Institutional Training) as well as numerous brigade and battalion level command and staff positions within the Division.|$|R
50|$|In July 1913, Carranza {{divided the}} country into seven areas for {{military}} operations. Each area was, at least in theory, the responsibility of a general commanding an Army corps. These <b>corps</b> were: <b>Northeast,</b> Northwest, Central, East, West, South and Southeast. However the last four existed only on paper and in reality the Constitutionalist army {{was made up of}} only the Northwest Corps (renamed the Army of Operations) under Álvaro Obregón, the <b>Northeast</b> <b>Corps</b> under Pablo González, and the Central Corps under Pánfilo Natera.|$|R
50|$|Netheravon Airfield {{is largely}} in Fittleton parish but extends southwards into Figheldean. A grass strip {{airfield}} {{was created for}} the Royal Flying <b>Corps</b> <b>northeast</b> of Coulston Camp (later called Airfield Camp) in 1913 and later became RAF Netheravon, an operational and training base. It was the home of No. 1 Flying Training School RAF from 1919 until 1931, and during the Second World War was used again for training and as a short-term base for operational squadrons, with glider and parachute activity from 1941. In 1963 the airfield and camp were transferred to the Army, and became AAC Netheravon (Army Air Corps) from 1966 until 2012.|$|R
