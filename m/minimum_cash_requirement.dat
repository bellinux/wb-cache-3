Cash generated from sales is used by AWCF to cover its expenses such as paying employees. In light of the Army's changing role in the Middle East, GAO was asked to determine whether (1) AWCF's monthly cash balances fell within the Department of Defense's (DOD) cash requirements for fiscal years 2000 through 2009, (2) the cash transfers resulted in AWCF's monthly cash balances falling below the minimum amount required by DOD, and (3) the AWCF's projected monthly cash balances are expected to fall below DOD's <b>minimum</b> <b>cash</b> <b>requirement</b> for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 and actions the Army can take to manage those balances. To address these objectives, GAO (1) reviewed relevant DOD guidance, (2) obtained and analyzed AWCF budget and accounting reports containing cash information, and (3) interviewed DOD and Army officials. ...|$|E
5000|$|Beyond this guideline, {{the next}} most common rule is a <b>minimum</b> <b>cash</b> {{injection}} <b>requirement.</b> Even if, for example, a business {{might be able to}} afford a monthly payment of a loan high enough to pay for the entire construction project, many lenders would require them to instead use a certain minimum portion of their own cash to complete the project. The reason for this is both to psychologically and economically tie in the owner with the project (hopefully making it less likely that they would walk away from the project if something goes wrong), and to give the lender a cushion whereby if something goes wrong {{they are more likely to}} be able to sell the real estate at a value that would better cover the loan amount. This guideline is often termed a [...] "loan to cost" [...] requirement, i.e. the lender will only loan up to 85% of the project costs.|$|R
40|$|Generally, land {{fragmentation}} {{is a universal}} trait of all agricultural systems which affects farmland productivity {{and no one had}} documented a rural society where there was no {{land fragmentation}}. Hence, this study sought to ascertain the effects of land fragmentation on farmland productivity in the highland districts of Northwestern Ethiopia by using cross-sectional data collected from 240 respondents during 2015 / 16 production seasons and analyzed by using linear and Cobb-Douglass production functions. In land productivity model, 38 % of variations in farmland productivity are explained by variations in independent variables including land fragmentation parameters. Average farmland size of 1. 25 [*]ha was obtained as minimum size that can generate <b>minimum</b> food and <b>cash</b> <b>requirement</b> of an average family of five adult equivalents. Hence, the government should come up with land use policy and population growth controlling program, which enables determining minimum economic farmland size, improving land productivity, and finding ways to strengthen off-farm activities and livestock sector to absorb more labor and enhance means of generating more income so as to decrease minimum farmland size required...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} into homeownership {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult for first-home buyers. In this paper we measure the deposit requirements and the transaction costs associated with purchasing {{a home for the}} first time, and whether a reduction in stamp duty obligations will help potential first-home owners&# 039; bridge the gap between their savings and the up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> that must be met on purchase. We conclude that those with low-to-moderate permanent earnings have particularly large gaps between savings and up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements.</b> A key finding is that stamp duties typically account for 23 per cent of total up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements,</b> and their formal incidence among potential homebuyers is highly regressive. If all potential homeowners were granted exemption from stamp duties, we estimate that <b>cash</b> <b>requirement</b> gaps are immediately bridged for only 9 % of those who cannot currently meet up-front <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> from savings...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> of {{many firms}} follow a {{seasonal}} pattern. These firms may obtain short term cash {{to cover their}} seasonal needs {{from a variety of}} sources: e. g., lines of credit, delaying of accounts payable, term loans, pledging or factoring receivables, etc. Each of these alternative sources of cash may have different costs as well as special restrictions. Given the set of <b>cash</b> <b>requirements</b> and the costs and constraints relating to alternative sources of cash, {{it is often difficult to}} determine the optimum manner of meeting the short-term cash needs. In this paper, this short-term financing problem under certainty is formulated as a mathematical model and solved through the use of a general linear programming routine. Optimum solutions are determined for a number of cases and the general form of the solution is discussed. The paper includes an analysis based on marginal costs and a discussion of the short-term financing problem under uncertainty. ...|$|R

30|$|As we {{mentioned}} before, the central {{aim of this}} paper is to optimize the bank cash inventories across its branches. For this, our proposal is that the bankťs company must impose some restrictions to its branches cash movements. These restrictions are imposed in the shape of some formulae which help the branches to calculate their needs of cash, before they make a <b>cash</b> <b>requirement</b> to the <b>cash</b> central. These formulae accurately adjust the demand for money to the real needs of the branches, avoiding a surplus of money and, hence, minimizing the opportunity costs.|$|R

Financial capital is made up of available stocks (anything that can be liquidated to meet <b>cash</b> <b>requirements)</b> and regular inflows of cash (income from farm produce sales, wages and remittances from household members working away from the homestead).|$|R

When the British granted self-government to the former Boer republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1906 and 1907, respectively, the pressure for emigration decreased.

5000|$|The {{financial}} mathematics behind the 0% finance scheme is somewhat complex, as the calculation differs {{with respect to}} the type of product and the country. These deals are offered by finance companies or banks in conjunction with a manufacturer or dealer network. The schemes offer [...] "zero percent" [...] finance, where a customer pays for the financing cost in an indirect manner. The indirect cost will include paying a processing fee, a significant amount as advance EMIs (equated monthly installments), as well as a <b>minimum</b> <b>cash</b> down payment. Often, the biggest cost may involve forfeiting a cash discount which might otherwise be available on a cash purchase.|$|R

Larger and longer cash flow shortages give rise to more equity than debt finance. After the shocks, firms gradually adjust their leverage back to pre-shock levels by retiring debt and issuing equity. Financing patterns during a shock are consistent with a pecking-order theory of finance, whereas the adjustment afterwards is consistent with a trade-off theory.
