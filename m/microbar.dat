5|$|Trujillo {{and colleagues}} have placed upper limits in Sedna's surface {{composition}} of 60% for methane ice and 70% for water ice. The presence of methane further supports {{the existence of}} tholins on Sedna's surface, because they are produced by irradiation of methane. Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices. From these observations, they suggested the following model of the surface: 24% Triton-type tholins, 7% amorphous carbon, 10% nitrogen, 26% methanol, and 33% methane. The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared photometry. The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that, {{at least for a}} short time, Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere. During a 200-year period near perihelion, the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed , the transition temperature between alpha-phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton. At 38 K, the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 <b>microbar</b> (1.4 Pa or 0.000014 atm). However, its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface, and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna's surface is ancient, rather than freshly deposited. This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow, which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} the microtensile bond strength between two all-ceramic systems; lithium disilicate glass ceramic and zirconia core ceramics bonded with their corresponding glass veneers. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Blocks of core ceramics (IPS e. max ® Press and LavaTM Frame) were fabricated and veneered with their corresponding glass veneers. The bilayered blocks were cut into microbars; 8 mm {{in length and}} 1 mm 2 in cross-sectional area (n = 30 /group). Additionally, monolithic <b>microbars</b> of these two veneers (IPS e. max ® Ceram and LavaTM Ceram; n = 30 /group) were also prepared. The obtained <b>microbars</b> were tested in tension until fracture, and the fracture surfaces of the <b>microbars</b> were examined with fluorescent black light and scanning electron microscope (SEM) to identify the mode of failure. One-way ANOVA and the Dunnett’s T 3 test were performed to determine significant differences of the mean microtensile bond strength at a significance level of 0. 05. RESULTS. The mean microtensile bond strength of IPS e. max ® Press/IPS e. max ® Ceram (43. 40 ± 5. 51 MPa) was significantly {{greater than that of}} LavaTM Frame/LavaTM Ceram (31. 71 ± 7. 03 MPa) (P<. 001). Fluorescent black light and SEM analysis showed that most of the tested <b>microbars</b> failed cohesively in the veneer layer. Furthermore, the bond strength of LavaTM Frame/LavaTM Ceram was comparable to the tensile strength of monolithic glass veneer of LavaTM Ceram, while the bond strength of bilayered IPS e. max ® Press/IPS e. max® Ceram was significantly greater than tensile strength of monolithic IPS e. max ® Ceram.

40|$|Effects of {{irradiance}} on photosynthetic {{characteristics were}} examined in senescent leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Two irradiance treatments (100 and 20 % natural sunlight) were imposed after the full expansion of the 13 th leaf through senescence. The photosynthetic rate was measured {{as a function of}} intercellular CO 2 pressure with a gas-exchange system. The amounts of cytochrome f, coupling factor 1, ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), and chlorophyll were determined. The coupling factor 1 and cytochrome f contents decreased rapidly during senescence, and their rates of decrease were much faster from the 20 % sunlight treatment than from the full sunlight treatment. These changes were well correlated with those in the photosynthetic rate at CO 2 pressure = 600 <b>microbars,</b> but not with those under the ambient air condition (350 <b>microbars</b> CO 2) and 200 <b>microbars</b> CO 2. This suggested that the amounts of coupling factor 1 and cytochrome f from the full sunlight treatment cannot be limiting factors for the photosynthetic rate at ambient air conditions. The Rubisco content also decreased during senescence, but its decrease from the 20 % sunlight treatment was appreciably retarded. However, this difference was not reflected in the photosynthetic rates at the ambient and 200 <b>microbars</b> CO 2. This implied that in vivo Rubisco activity may be regulated in the senescent leaves from the 20 % sunlight treatment. The chlorophyll content decreased most slowly. In the 20 % sunlight treatment, it remained apparently constant with a decline in chlorophyll a/b ratio. These photosynthetic characteristics of the senescent rice leaves under low irradiance were discussed in relation to acclimation of shade plants...|$|R

Some plants were transplanted from small pots into large pots after 20 days. Reduction of root biomass resulting from growth in small pots {{was accompanied by}} decreased shoot biomass and leaf area. When root growth was less restricted, plants exposed to higher CO 2 partial pressures produced more shoot and root biomass than plants exposed to lower levels of CO 2. In small pots, whole plant biomass and leaf area of plants grown in 270 and 350 <b>microbars</b> of CO 2 were not significantly different. Plants grown in small pots in 650 <b>microbars</b> of CO 2 produced greater total biomass than plants grown in 350 <b>microbars,</b> but the dry weight gain {{was found to be}} primarily an accumulation of leaf starch. Reduced photosynthetic capacity of plants grown at elevated levels of CO 2 was clearly associated with inadequate rooting volume. Reductions in net photosynthesis were not associated with decreased stomatal conductance. Reduced carboxylation efficiency in response to CO 2 enrichment occurred only when root growth was restricted suggesting that ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity may be responsive to plant source-sink balance rather than to CO 2 concentration as a single factor. When root-restricted plants were transplanted into large pots, carboxylation efficiency and ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate regeneration capacity increased indicating that acclimation of photosynthesis was reversible. Reductions in photosynthetic capacity as root growth was progressively restricted suggest sink-limited feedback inhibition as a possible mechanism for regulating net photosynthesis of plants grown in elevated CO 2...|$|R

The initial slope of the photosynthetic CO 2 response curve was dependent on light intensity at reduced light levels only (less than 450 micromoles per square meter per second in C. album and below 200 micromoles per square meter per second in P. vulgaris). Modeled simulations indicated that the initial slope of the CO 2 response of photosynthesis exhibited light dependency when the rate of RuBP regeneration limited photosynthesis, but not when rubisco capacity limited photosynthesis. Measured observations closely matched modeled simulations. The activation state of rubisco was measured at three light intensities in C. album (1750, 550, and 150 micromoles per square meter per second) and at intercellular CO 2 partial pressures (C 1) between the CO 2 compensation point and 500 <b>microbars.</b> Above a C 1 of 120 <b>microbars,</b> the activation state of rubisco was light dependent. At light intensities of 550 and 1750 micromoles per square meter per second, it was also dependent on C 1, decreasing as the C 1 was elevated above 120 <b>microbars</b> at 550 micromoles per square meter per second and above 300 <b>microbars</b> at 1750 micromoles per square meter per second. The pool size of RuBP was independent of C 1 only under conditions when the activation state of rubisco was dependent on C 1. Otherwise, RuBP pool sizes increased as C 1 was reduced.

40|$|Most current {{photosynthesis}} models, {{and interpretations}} of many wholeleaf CO 2 gas exchange measurements, {{are based on}} the often unstated assumption that the partial pressure of CO 2 is nearly uniform throughout the airspaces of the leaf mesophyll. Here we present measurements of CO 2 gradients across amphistomatous leaves allowed to assimilate CO 2 through only one surface, thus simulating hypostomatous leaves. We studied five species: Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb. ex Spreng., Brassica chinensis L., Gossypium hirsutum L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., and Spinacia oleracea L. For Eucalyptus, maximum CO 2 pressure differences across the leaf mesophyll were 73 and 160 <b>microbar</b> when the pressures outside the lower leaf surface were 310 and 590 <b>microbar,</b> respectively.

For ambient CO 2 pressures near 320 <b>microbar,</b> the average and minimum pressure differences across the mesophyll were 45 and 13 <b>microbar.</b> The corresponding mean intercellular CO 2 pressures would then be roughly 8 and 2 <b>microbar</b> less than those in the substomatal cavities.

In ex situ methods, both the nanoparticles and beads are preformed prior to the encoding process. However, in in situ strategies, either the beads or nanoparticles are simultaneously formed in situ during the encoding process. Currently, UCNPs-encoded beads are prepared by swelling-based ex situ method. In this strategy, porous beads are dispersed in a swelling solvent containing UCNPs. Based on the concentration gradient, these UCNPs diffuse into the porous beads. Upon removal of the swelling solvent, the beads shrink and retain the UCNPs inside it [16]. However, UCNPs-encoded beads prepared by this strategy were found to have non-uniform distribution of UCNPs inside the beads. Moreover, some of the UCNPs were confined on the beads surface, thereby hampering surface modification of these beads. Additionally, the swelling strategy is rather laborious and, along with the above-mentioned drawbacks, is considered unfavorable for use in high-throughput synthesis of UCNPs-encoded beads. Another strategy was reported to use stop-flow lithography producing UCNPs-encoded <b>microbars</b> [29].

The bilayered specimens were cut into <b>microbars</b> and the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was evaluated. 'As-sintered' zirconia discs served as a control (α = 0. 05). The broken <b>microbars</b> were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: The combination of selective infiltration etching with experimental zirconia primers significantly improved (F = 3805, P < 0. 0001) the MTBS values (41 ± 5. 8 MPa) compared to the 'as-sintered' surface using the same primers which demonstrated spontaneous failure and very low bond strength values (2. 6 ± 3. 1 MPa). SEM analysis revealed that selective infiltration etching surface treatment resulted in a nano-retentive surface where the zirconia primers were able to penetrate and interlock which explained the higher MTBS values observed for the treated specimens. © 2008 Academy of Dental Materials. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objectives Establishing a {{reliable}} bond to zirconia-based materials {{has proven to}} be difficult which is the major limitation against fabricating adhesive zirconia restorations. This bond could be improved using novel selective infiltration etching conditioning in combination with engineered zirconia primers. Aim of the work was to evaluate resin-to-zirconia bond strength using selective infiltration etching and novel silane-based zirconia primers. Methods Zirconia discs (Procera Zirconia) received selective infiltration etching surface treatment followed by coating with either of five especially engineered experimental zirconia primers. Pre-aged resin-composite discs (Tetric Ivo Ceram) were bonded to the treated surface using an MDP-containing resin-composite (Panavia F 2. 0). The bilayered specimens were cut into <b>microbars</b> and the microtensile bond strength (MTBS) was evaluated. ‘As-sintered’ zirconia discs served as a control (α = 0. 05). The broken <b>microbars</b> were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results The combination of selective infiltration etching with experimental zirconia primers significantly improved (F = 3805, P < 0. 0001) the MTBS values (41 ± 5. 8 MPa) compared to the ’as-sintered’ surface using the same primers which demonstrated spontaneous failure and very low bond strength values (2. 6 ± 3. 1 MPa).

50|$|The {{secondary}} drying phase aims to remove unfrozen water molecules, since the ice was removed {{in the primary}} drying phase. This part of the freeze-drying process is governed by the material's adsorption isotherms. In this phase, the temperature is raised {{higher than in the}} primary drying phase, and can even be above 0 °C, to break any physico-chemical interactions that have formed between the water molecules and the frozen material. Usually the pressure is also lowered in this stage to encourage desorption (typically in the range of <b>microbars,</b> or fractions of a pascal). However, there are products that benefit from increased pressure as well.|$|R
