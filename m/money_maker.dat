Variety {{reported}} that Thunderball was the number-one <b>money</b> <b>maker</b> of 1966 at the North American box office by a large margin, with a net profit of $26,500,000. The second-highest <b>money</b> <b>maker</b> of 1966 was Doctor Zhivago at $15,000,000; in third place was Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at $10,300,000. It eventually grossed $63.6 million in the United States, equating to roughly 58.1 million admissions. In total, the film has earned $141.2 million worldwide, surpassing the earnings of the three preceding films in the series—easily recouping its $9 million budget—and remained the highest-grossing Bond film until Live and Let Die (1973) assumed the record. After adjusting its earnings to 2011 prices, it has made around $1 billion, making it the second-most financially successful Bond film after Skyfall.|$|E

25|$|The Mongol {{administration}} had issued paper currencies from 1227 on. In August 1260, Kublai {{created the first}} unified paper currency called Chao; bills were circulated throughout the Yuan domain with no expiration date. To guard against devaluation, the currency was convertible with silver and gold, and the government accepted tax payments in paper currency. In 1273, Kublai issued {{a new series of}} state sponsored bills to finance his conquest of the Song, although eventually a lack of fiscal discipline and inflation turned this move into an economic disaster. It was required to pay only in the form of paper money. To ensure its use, Kublai's government confiscated gold and silver from private citizens and foreign merchants, but traders received government-issued notes in exchange. Kublai Khan is considered to be the first fiat <b>money</b> <b>maker.</b> The paper bills made collecting taxes and administering the empire much easier and reduced the cost of transporting coins. In 1287, Kublai's minister Sangha created a new currency, Zhiyuan Chao, to deal with a budget shortfall. It was non-convertible and denominated in copper cash. Later Gaykhatu of the Ilkhanate attempted to adopt the system in Iran and the Middle East, which was a complete failure, and shortly afterwards he was assassinated.|$|E

500|$|The Black Crowes {{began writing}} songs for the {{follow-up}} to their 1999 album By Your Side as free agents, having left Columbia Records through a loophole in their contract. [...] The {{decision to leave}} was driven by Columbia's promotion of By Your Side. According to band member Rich Robinson, [...] "That record was destined to fail because... just said, 'It's {{not going to do}} well... It's no use wasting time or money.'" [...] The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's Shake Your <b>Money</b> <b>Maker.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Black Crowes {{promoted}} By Your Side {{by performing}} on numerous television programs in North America and Europe. [...] The album debuted {{at its peak}} position of number26 on the Billboard 200 and generally received positive reviews.

[...] Rich said, [...] "It's cool that Columbia Records is backing us on an artistic level and they're being open to all the hassles that come with moving an album into the new year. [...] I know we're driving them insane with these last-minute changes, but we know it's all for the right reasons." [...] After finishing the album, Chris noted that it [...] "has {{the same sort of}} energy" [...] as Shake Your <b>Money</b> <b>Maker,</b> [...] "...but there is much more to it.

500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is the first guy that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your <b>Money</b> <b>Maker,</b> which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters.

500|$|By Your Side was {{generally}} well received by critics. [...] Regarding the songwriting, most reviewers praised The Black Crowes for {{returning to the}} straightforwardness of Shake Your <b>Money</b> <b>Maker</b> (1990) following the more adventuresome Amorica (1994) and Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] Gemma Tarlach of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel welcomed the album [...] "because it represents a great band's return to what it does best", calling it [...] "45 minutes of good, dirty fun". [...] Wall of Sound's Russell Hall found that the band's emergence from [...] "the jam-band haze that's infected" [...] their recent work resulted in a [...] "laser-sharp focus". [...] Mark Falkner of The Florida Times-Union said that beyond the band's mastery of their influences' musical styles, what prevents them [...] "from being just another tribute act {{is that they have}} (also) mastered the power, the passion and the fun that made the mix work". Some critics, also noting the change in approach, derided the band for returning to mine the same influences perceived in their debut album. [...] Jim Farber of the Daily News thus described By Your Side as [...] "a copy-of-a-copy-of-a-copy" [...] and marked [...] "Go Faster" [...] a sped-up version of Humble Pie's [...] "Hot 'n' Nasty". [...] The Times Nigel Williamson called [...] "HorseHead" [...] "Zeppelinesque" [...] and labeled [...] "By Your Side" [...] "a kicking boogie half way between [...] 'Cindy Incidentally' and [...] 'Tumbling Dice'".

500|$|Film noir, {{to which}} lower budgets lent themselves, became {{something}} of a house style at the studio, indeed, the RKO B Stranger on the Third Floor (1940) is widely seen as initiating noir's classic period. Its cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, who began at FBO in the 1920s and stayed with RKO through 1954, is a central figure in creating the look of classic noir. Design chief Albert D'Agostino—another long-termer, who succeeded Van Nest Polglase in 1941—and art director Walter Keller, along {{with others in the}} department, such as art directors Carroll Clark and Jack Okey and set decorator Darrell Silvera, are similarly credited. The studio's 1940s list of contract players was filled with noir regulars: Robert Mitchum (who graduated to major star status) and Robert Ryan each made no fewer than ten film noirs for RKO. Gloria Grahame, Jane Greer, and Lawrence Tierney were also notable studio players in the field. Freelancer George Raft starred in two noir hits: Johnny Angel (1945) and Nocturne (1946). Tourneur, Musuraca, Mitchum, and Greer, along with D'Agostino's design group, joined to make the A-budgeted Out of the Past (1947), now considered one of the greatest of all film noirs. Nicholas Ray began his directing career with the noir They Live by Night (1948), the first of a number of well-received films he made for RKO. [...] A big <b>money</b> <b>maker</b> were the dark and moody Dick Tracy detective film series; [...] Dick Tracy, Detective [...] (1945), Dick Tracy vs. Cueball (1946) (as [...] "Filthy Flora", character actress Esther Howard chewed up the scenery in this one), Dick Tracy's Dilemma (1947), and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (1947), (RKO wanted to title this feature [...] "Dick Tracy vs Karloff", but Boris Karloff nixed that idea, even though he did play the part of Gruesome).|$|E
