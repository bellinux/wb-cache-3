40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{graphical}} user interface that allows an artist to virtually design and visualize net sculptures. Net sculptures consist of net pieces that are seamlessly connected {{to each other and}} to fixed rails. They are flexible and hence dynamic under external forces such as gravity and wind. The interface that we describe allows an artist to create <b>net</b> sculptures <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of multiple <b>net</b> pieces. Simple operations such as clicking on points and click-and-drag gestures are used to create and modify individual net pieces, and drag-and-drop gestures are used to connect net pieces to multiple rails. The effect of gravity on the net sculpture is simulated, allowing the artist to simultaneously design and visualize net sculptures as they would appear once installed in a real setting.

50|$|The game {{describes}} the United States in the mid-21st century, after {{a nuclear war}} started by a cybernetic revolt, which molded the continent into a barren wasteland. It seems {{that the reason for}} the war to break out was a sentient Artificial Intelligence commonly referred to as Moloch and <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of interconnected <b>net</b> of military computers: automated factories, military facilities, power plants and alike, that now cover the whole north of the U.S., from Oregon to the Great Lakes. On the south, there is another creation, called the Neojungle, that poses a threat to those who survived the war. It is a semi-intelligent carnivorous vegetation that grows very quickly, advancing north from Latin America. Right in the middle, there are humans. They are surrounded by mutant creatures, some bred by Moloch and hostile towards humans, and some simply animals and humans misshapen by nuclear fallout. On top of that there are Moloch's deadly machines lurking to complete the picture. But what is stressed in the book is that the worst enemy of humans is within them: hatred, indifference, greed.|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{as it is}} {{all over}} the world, finding and {{acquiring}} equity capital {{is one of the major}} problems facing entrepreneurs who are starting or growing entrepreneurial ventures. The informal venture capital market, <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of high <b>net</b> worth non-institutional private equity investors (or ‘business Angels’) provides risk capital directly to new and growing businesses and has been shown to be considerably more significant than institutional providers as a source of finance for entrepreneurial businesses. Building upon and comporting with Angel research undertaken overseas, this study generated and evaluated data resulting from an investigation of Australian business Angels which focused upon three primary research questions: (i) Who are Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Informal Venture Capitalists (Business Angels) ? (ii) How do they behave? (iii) What are their investment criteria? Analysis of answers resulting from a survey of 36 carefully screened respondents produced a descriptive profile, depicted in twelve key graphs, of Australian Angels 2 ̆ 7 identifying characteristics, patterns of investment behaviour and investment criteria. The study initiates Australian Angel research into the developing international continuum of formal Angel research and can serve as the generator of empirically sensible hypotheses for future research and theory development. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A size-based {{ecosystem}} {{model was}} modified to include periodic upwelling events {{and used to}} evaluate the effect of episodic nutrient supply on the standing stock, carbon uptake, and carbon flow into mesozooplankton grazing and sinking flux in a coastal upwelling regime. Two ecosystem configurations were compared: a single food chain <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of <b>net</b> phytoplankton and mesozooplankton (one autotroph and one heterotroph, A 1 H 1), and three interconnected food chains plus bacteria (three autotrophs and four heterotrophs, A 3 H 4). The carbon pathways in the A 1 H 1 simulations were under stronger physical control than those of the A 3 H 4 runs, where the small size classes are not affected by frequent upwelling events. In the more complex food web simulations, the microbial pathway determines the total carbon uptake and grazing rates, and regenerated nitrogen accounts {{for more than half of}} the total primary production for periods of 20 days or longer between events. By contrast, new production, export of carbon through sinking and mesozooplankton grazing are more important in the A 1 H 1 simulations. In the A 3 H 4 simulations, the turnover time scale of the autotroph biomass increases as the period between upwelling events increases, because of the larger contribution of slow-growing net phytoplankton. The upwelling period was characterized for three upwelling sites from the alongshore wind speed measured by the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and the corresponding model output compared with literature data. This validation exercise for three upwelling sites and a downstream embayment suggests that standing stock, carbon uptake and size fractionation were best supported by the A 3 H 4 simulations, while the simulated sinking fluxes are not distinguishable in the two configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmitted}} radiation {{into the}} conventional net-houses {{is very low}} {{in the early morning}} and late afternoon that may not fulfill the crop growth requirements. To solve this problem, two types of nethouse models (polygon and curved-arch net-houses) were newly designed, each having seven surfaces <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of different <b>net</b> types. The spectral radiative properties of 32 nets were examined and three nets were selected to cover the surfaces of each model. The two designs showed high transmittance in the morning and afternoon, and low at around noon (U shape). The polygon style was scaledup and an experiential net-house was constructed with a floor area of 28 m 2. An evaporatively-cooled greenhouse with a floor area of 28 m 2 was used for comparison; each floor was planted with 500 potted Chrysanthemum plant. The results showed that the PAR and microclimate in the net-house and cooled greenhouse were similar. The net-house reduced water consumption by 13 kg m- 2 day- 1 in summer and by 0. 94 kg m- 2 day- 1 in winter; and reduced electric energy consumption by 0. 26 kwh m- 2 day- 1 in summer and by 0. 18 kw-h m- 2 day- 1 in winter compared to the greenhouse...|$|R
