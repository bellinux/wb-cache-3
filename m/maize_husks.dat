40|$|The {{mobilization}} of heavy metals {{in the environment}} due to industrial activities is of serious concern due to the toxicity of these metals in humans {{and other forms of}} life. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms of Cd(II), Pb(II) and Zn(II) ions, detoxification from waste water using unmodified and EDTA-modified <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> have been studied. <b>Maize</b> <b>husk</b> was found to be an excellent adsorbent for the removal of these metal ions. The amount of these metal ions adsorbed increased as the initial concentration increased. Also, EDTA-modification enhanced the adsorption capacity of <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> due to the chelating ability of ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA). Among the three adsorption isotherms tested, Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm gave the best fit with R² value ranging from 0. 7646 to 0. 9988 and an average value of 0. 9321. This is followed by Freundlich and then Langmiur isotherms. The sorption process was found to be mostly a physiosorption process as seen from the apparent energy of adsorption which ranged from 1. 03 KJ/mol to 12. 91 KJ/mol. Therefore, this study demonstrates that <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> which is an environmental pollutant could be used to adsorb heavy metals and achieve environmental cleanliness...|$|R
40|$|In {{the search}} for {{alternatives}} to sawdust as growing media in commercial mushroom cultivation, three organic substrates obtainable as crop residue, <b>maize</b> <b>husk,</b> <b>maize</b> cob, and maize stalk, with each being supplemented with rice bran, were evaluated as growth media for the oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus (Kummer). For the tested alternatives to sawdust, the harvested weight of fruiting bodies that sprouted on a kilogram <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> media per crop (32. 99 [*]g) was the highest. Sawdust media supported significantly (P< 0. 001) heavier fruiting bodies (42. 18) than the maize residues. The peak mushroom harvests for the various substrates were obtained {{between the first and}} seventh fruiting body flushes. The biological efficiency of the substrates, which measured usable nutrients indicated that maize stalk supplemented with rice bran, was 39 % compared to that of the sawdust media (60 %). The <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> media and the maize cob media had biological efficiencies of 32 % and 9. 5 %, respectively. These results indicate that two of the tested growing media (<b>maize</b> stalk or <b>husk)</b> produced mushrooms with yield characteristics that were comparable to the well-used sawdust in the cultivation of oyster mushrooms.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} utilize {{saponins}} from papaya leaves as antifungal on <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> packaging. Crude and semi-pure saponins were extracted from papaya leaves using Soxhlet and Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction (UAE) methods. The total saponin contents were determined using UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Their ability to inhibit Aspergillus niger was tested by macrodillution method. The extracts were also applied to <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> by soaking it for 5 minutes at concentration of 10, 20 and 25 mg/mL. The parameters observed were physical and mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation), {{water vapor transmission}} rate (WVTR), total plate count (TPC) and mold and yeast counts (MYC) after 25 days of storage at room temperature (± 28 ºC). Drying of young papaya leaves using cabinet dryer resulted in the highest yield of crude saponin (12. 96 ± 0. 26 %). Total saponin content in crude saponin extract was 115. 43 mg/g, while in semi-pure saponin extract was 480. 19 mg/g. Crude saponin and semi-pure saponin extract at concentration of 25 mg/mL could inhibit the growth of A. niger for 1. 35 and 0. 36 log CFU/mL, respectively after 24 hours. The WVTR test indicated that treatment with a concentration of 25 mg/mL of crude saponin extracts showed the lowest transmission. The addition of crude saponin and semi-pure saponin extract to the <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> at the concentration of 10, 20 and 25 mg/mL was able to inhibit the microbial growth, represented by constant number in TPC and MYC for 25 days storage.

30|$|<b>Maize</b> <b>husk,</b> an {{abundant}} agricultural waste {{was used to}} prepare a biosorbent for the biosorption of Mn(II) and Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution in a batch process. Equilibrium and kinetics of biosorption of the metals ions were studied at 25  °C. The adsorbtion data were treated with common kinetic and isotherm models. The equilibrium data fitted well with Langmuir isotherm with maximum capacity of 8.52 and 7.38  mg g− 1 for Mn(II) and Pb(II), respectively on raw biomass (UTCS). The capacity of 9.00 and 9.33  mg g− 1 was observed for Mn(II) and Pb(II), respectively on acid modified biomass (ATCS). The study also revealed that the sorption process in both cases depend on biomass dosage, temperature, pH and initial metal ion concentration, respectively.

Eight fresh orange maize hybrids were boiled with and without intact husk at 100 oC using atmospheric cooking method and evaluated for proximate components. The results of analysis of variance [ANOVA] revealed that maturity [harvesting time] and method had significant effects [p ≤ 0. 001] on all proximate components. There was a general decrease in dry matter [DM], ash and total sugar contents across harvest maturity stages. Protein and fat increased at 20 DAP and 27 DAP and then decreased at 34 DAP. The unprocessed maize had optimum sugar content at 20 DAP and optimum protein and fat contents at 27 DAP.

40|$|The husk {{surrounding}} {{the ear of}} corn/maize (Zea mays) has widely spaced veins {{with a number of}} interveinal mesophyll (M) cells and has been described as operating a partial C 3 photosynthetic pathway, in contrast to its leaves, which use the C 4 photosynthetic pathway. Here, we characterized photosynthesis in <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> and leaf by measuring combined gas exchange and carbon isotope discrimination, the oxygen dependence of the CO 2 compensation point, and photosynthetic enzyme activity and localization together with anatomy. The CO 2 assimilation rate in the husk was less than that in the leaves and did not saturate at high CO 2, indicating CO 2 diffusion limitations. However, maximal photosynthetic rates were similar between the leaf and husk when expressed on a chlorophyll basis. The CO 2 compensation points of the husk were high compared with the leaf but did not vary with oxygen concentration. This and the low carbon isotope discrimination measured concurrently with gas exchange in the husk and leaf suggested C 4 -like photosynthesis in the husk. However, both Rubisco activity and the ratio of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to Rubisco activity were reduced in the husk. Immunolocalization studies showed that phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is specifically localized in the layer of M cells {{surrounding the}} bundle sheath cells, while Rubisco and glycine decarboxylase were enriched in bundle sheath cells but also present in M cells. We conclude that <b>maize</b> <b>husk</b> operates C 4 photosynthesis dispersed around the widely spaced veins (analogous to leaves) in a diffusion-limited manner due to low M surface area exposed to intercellular air space, with the functional role of Rubisco and glycine decarboxylase in distant M yet to be explained...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{processing}} and harvesting time on the physical and sensory characteristics of micronutrient biofortified yellow maize varieties have been investigated using standard procedures. Freshly harvested eight biofortified yellow maize hybrids and eight open pollinated varieties (OPV) with various endosperm textures were used for this research. Selected fresh harvested yellow maize ears at three maturity stages (20, 27 and 34 days after pollination) were boiled and roasted with or without husk and sensory evaluation was carried out on the boiled and roasted fresh yellow maize samples. Physical characteristics determinations were carried out on the grain of fresh yellow maize samples. The maize samples for colour properties were freeze-dried,pulverized and sieved to pass through 500 μm sieve. The fresh yellow maize flour samples were analysed for colour properties (L*, a* and b*). The results of the physical characteristic of fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes showed highly significant (P 0. 001) for the variety and maturity, while only kernel weight, kernel volume, bulk density, kernel size index (KSI), showed significant differences for both fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes. There was highly significant effect (P 0. 001) for variety, maturity and processing methods (boiling and roasting), on the colour properties for fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes. There were increase in the mean values of L*, a* and b* across the maturity stages for fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes. The results of the sensory characteristics showed that methods of processing and maturity were important factors in the rating of the sensory attributes of fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes. Optimum overall acceptability rating was attained at 20 DAP and had the best maturity stages. Consumers slightly preferred boiled OPV <b>maize</b> with <b>husk</b> to that boiled OPV <b>maize</b> without <b>husk.</b> However, consumers showed little or no difference in likeness for boiled hybrid maize with or without <b>husk.</b> However, roasted <b>maize</b> without <b>husk</b> was preferred to roasted <b>maize</b> with <b>husk</b> for fresh yellow hybrid and OPV maizes.
