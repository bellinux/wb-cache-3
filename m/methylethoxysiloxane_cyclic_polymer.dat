40|$|The {{motion and}} {{relaxation}} of linear and <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> under entangled conditions are investigated {{by means of}} a newly developed single-molecule tracking technique, cumulative-area (CA) tracking. CA tracking enables simultaneous quantitative characterization of the diffusion mode, diffusion rate, and relaxation time that have been impossible with a widely used conventional single-molecule localization and tracking method, by analyzing cumulative areas occupied by the moving molecule. Using the novel approach, we investigate the motion and relaxation of entangled <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers,</b> which have been an important but poorly understood question. Fluorescently labeled 42 kbp linear or cyclic tracer dsDNAs in concentrated solutions of unlabeled linear or cyclic DNAs are used as model systems. We show that CA tracking can explicitly distinguish topology-dependent diffusion mode, rate, and relaxation time, demonstrating that the method provides an invaluable tool for characterizing topological interaction between the entangled chains. We further demonstrate that the current models proposed for the entanglement between <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> which are based on cyclic chains moving through an array of fixed obstacles cannot correctly describe the motion of the cyclic chain under the entangled conditions.

The dilute solution properties, such as intrinsic viscosity ([η]), of the resulting <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> were routinely examined using GPC coupled with a triple detecting (light scattering/differential viscometer/differential refractometer) system to obtain the Mark-Houwink-Sukurada plot and the elution volume vs time.

Interestingly, all types of <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> tested were found to have lower dn/dc values than their linear analogues, but dn/dc decreased as [M/Ru] 0 decreased (Table 1).

By introducing 1, 4 -bis(acetoxy) - 2 -butene as chain transfer agent (CTA) during a Ruthenium mediated ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of norbornene (NBE), the respective end-functionalized polymers with molecular weights controllable up to 30 kDa could be obtained in high yield.

40|$|An {{efficient}} synthetic pathway toward <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> {{based on}} the combination of thiolactone and disulfide chemistry has been developed. First, heterotelechelic linear polystyrene (PS) containing an alpha-thiolactone (TLa) and an omega-dithiobenzoate group was synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization, employing a newly designed TLa-bearing chain transfer agent (CTA). The subsequent reaction of this heterotelechelic polymer with an amine, which acts as a nucleophile for both the TLa and dithiobenzoate units, generated the alpha,omega-thiol-telechelic PS under ambient conditions {{without the need for}} any catalyst or other additives. The arrangement of thiols under a high dilution afforded single cyclic PS (c-PS) through an oxidative disulfide linkage. The cyclic PS (c-PS) disulfide ring formation was evidenced by SEC, MALDI-TOF MS and H- 1 -NMR characterization. Moreover, we demonstrated a controlled ring opening via either disulfide reduction or thiol-disulfide exchange to enable easy and clean topology transformation. Furthermore, to illustrate the broad utility of this synthetic methodology, different amines including functional ones were employed, allowing for the one-step preparation of functionalized <b>cyclic</b> <b>polymers</b> with high yields...|$|R

No entanglement plateau is observed. Their viscosity remains much smaller in comparison to linear polymers. Tiny amounts of linear chain contaminants (of the order of 0. 1 %, below their overlap concentration) dramatically alter the rheology of rings as they entropically penetrate them, forming a transient network of linear chains bridged by rings.

Chapters 2 and 3 summarize the performance of various Ru-based catalysts in ROMP. Chapter 2 focuses on complexes coordinated with various N-heterocyclic carbene ligands while Chapter 3 focuses on their phosphine ligated analogs and methods to improve their initiation efficiency. The scope and utility of these catalysts in various ROMP reactions are discussed. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the synthesis of acetoxy, hydroxy, and vinyl end-functionalized polybutadienes (PBDs) and polynorbornenes. By including allyl acetate, 1, 4 -bis(acetoxy) - 2 -butene, or 2 -butene- 1, 4 -diol as chain transfer agents (CTAs) during a Ru mediated ROMP of cyclooctadiene (COD) or norbornene (NBE), the respective end-functionalized polymers with molecular weights controllable up to 30 kDa could be obtained in high yield. Chapter 6 describes a one-pot synthesis of triblock copolymers composed of mechanistically incompatible segments. Bis(allyl chloride) and bis(2 -bromopropionate) end-functionalized telechelic PBDs were synthesized by the ROMP of COD {{in the presence of the}} corresponding difunctional CTAs. These telechelic PBDs were subsequently used as difunctional macroinitiators for the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene or methyl methacrylate (MMA) to form the respective block copolymers. Chapter 7 describes the synthesis of a multifunctional Ru complex which was found to be capable of mediated both the ROMP of COD and the ATRP of MMA to form diblock copolymers. Depending on the reaction conditions, the complex was found to catalyze both polymerizations either in tandem or simultaneously. Introduction of hydrogen at the conclusion of the polymerizations resulted in quantitative saturation of the polymer backbone.
