Tourist sites {{exist in the}} Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, Spain, the Fiji Islands, Thailand, Indonesia, Hawaii, Western Australia and the Maldives. Mantas are popular because of their enormous size {{and because they are}} easily habituated to humans. Scuba divers <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to watch mantas visiting cleaning stations and night dives enable viewers to see mantas feeding on plankton attracted by the lights.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E

For example, a new allele of B44 <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> serotype (i.e. B44) and allele ID i.e. B*44:65, {{as it is}} the 65th B44 allele discovered. Marsh et al.

Women have a 60–80% risk of getting the infection from a single act of vaginal intercourse with an infected man. A pregnant women can pass on the infection to her unborn infant.|$|E

The shareholders indirectly own the assets of the fund, and they will typically get an annual report. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the profits, such as interest or dividends, and they <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> residual value in case the fund is liquidated. Their ownership interest in the fund can easily be bought and sold.|$|E
25|$|In cryptography, {{electromagnetic}} {{attacks are}} side-channel attacks performed {{by measuring the}} electromagnetic radiation emitted from a device and performing signal analysis on it. These attacks are a more specific type of what is {{sometimes referred to as}} Van Eck phreaking, with the intention to capture encryption keys. Electromagnetic attacks are typically non-invasive and passive, meaning that these attacks are able to be performed by observing the normal functioning of the target device without causing physical damage. However, an attacker <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better signal with less noise by depackaging the chip and collecting the signal closer to the source. These attacks are successful against cryptographic implementations that perform different operations based on the data currently being processed, such as the square-and-multiply implementation of RSA. Different operations emit different amounts of radiation and an electromagnetic trace of encryption may show the exact operations being performed, allowing an attacker to retrieve full or partial private keys.|$|E

25|$|The 'through ball'(slide rule pass): Using {{the space}} behind the opponent's {{defensive}} line: Passes {{into this area}} {{have a number of}} pros: If an attacking player reaches the pass, taking care to avoid offside, he <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> 1-on-1 challenge with the goalkeeper, or be in an excellent position for a flank attack. Even if a defender reaches the pass first, the outcome could still be good for the attacking team. The defender will face his own goal, which could prompt him to give away a corner kick or a throw-in, make a risky pass to his team's goalkeeper, or being put under heavy pressure near the corner flag. Typically, teams with faster attackers than the opponent's defenders will try challenging this space, while the defending team in these cases will want to keep their defenders low when defending in order to give away as little space as possible between the defenders and the goalkeeper.|$|E

[...] Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek wrote positively of the episode, calling it [...] "an excellent backwards episode, {{in which the}} audience is left satisfied that the horrific event that sparked it off has been prevented, but the guest protagonist has to pay {{a high price for}} the happy outcome." [...] However, she was slightly critical that the episode [...] "barely features the regular characters at all". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode [...] "a double mystery: on one hand Martin's investigation of his wife's murder; and on the other, an investigation into the workings of his own soul."

500|$|Reviewing the Nintendo 64 {{version of}} Command & Conquer, Erik Reppen of Game Informer wrote that it [...] "has done an amazing job of {{completely}} reworking the old levels into a 3D polygonal format." [...] Although {{he said that}} the game [...] "offers plenty to keep you entertained", he disliked the heavy sound compression and the loss of the FMV cutscenes present in earlier versions. IGN's Aaron Boulding opened his review by saying: [...] "To their credit, Looking Glass developed Command & Conquer with all of the elements you want from a quality RTS." [...] Boulding praised the gameplay and the Special Ops missions, but noted that most of the units were distinct from the PC version. He was less happy with the port's graphics, calling them [...] "hit and miss", though he lauded the audio effects and voice work. Boulding also said the controls were well handled, though a bit complicated, and concluded: [...] "Command & Conquer is a fine game and <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little addictive for anyone who never got into the PC version of the game.

500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a plastic pipe. Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> few scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals actually like small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures."

2500|$|In cricket, chin {{music is}} a term for a bowling {{strategy}} where bouncers are aimed at the batsman's throat or chin. Rising rapidly off the pitch, the ball is difficult to play unless the batsman has quick footwork. If fended rather than avoided, it may yield a ballooned return catch to the bowler or to close-in fielders. This is a difficult ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball {{that can be easily}} put away {{on either side of the}} pitch. [...] It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this <b>may</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> warning from the umpire.
