5000|$|<b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> is an {{informal}} {{term for the}} most senior Member of a Parliament when that person is a woman.|$|E
50|$|Father of the House is a {{term that}} has been by {{tradition}} bestowed unofficially on certain members of some legislatures, most notably the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. In some legislatures the term refers to the oldest member, but in others {{it refers to the}} member longest-serving. (Recently, the term 'Mother of the House' or <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> has also been used, although the usage varies between countries; it is simply the female alternative to Father of the House, being applied when the relevant member is a woman).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliaments</b> is an {{expression}} coined by the British politician and reformer John Bright in a speech at Birmingham on 18 January 1865.|$|R
50|$|It was a {{reference}} to England. His actual words were: England is the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliaments.</b> This was reported in The Times on the following day.|$|R
40|$|Here in {{the land}} <b>of</b> the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> we are {{witnessing}} the bizarre spectacle of the House of Lords leading {{the debate on the}} future of news. The noble Lords on the communications committee on media ownership and the news are investigating the biggest issue in the British media industry right now...|$|R
2500|$|In September 2004, Staines {{began the}} [...] "Guido Fawkes Blog of plots, rumours and conspiracy". [...] The name is an {{alternative}} of Guy Fawkes, and continues that symbolism with the masthead slogan [...] "tittle tattle, gossip and rumours about Westminster's <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments.</b> Written {{from the perspective of}} the only man to enter parliament with honest intentions. The intention being to blow it up with gunpowder..." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 3 November 2016, the High Court of Justice {{ruled that}} Parliament had to legislate before the Government could invoke Article 50. Miller said outside the High Court: [...] "The judgment, I hope - when it's {{read by the}} Government and they {{contemplate}} the full judgment - that they will make the wise decision of not appealing but pressing forward and having a proper debate in our sovereign <b>Parliament,</b> our <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliaments</b> that we are so admired for all over the world".|$|R
5000|$|The British Parliament {{is often}} {{referred}} to as the <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that [...] "England is the <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> Parliaments") because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British [...] "three-tier" [...] model. Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house.|$|R
5000|$|Lesley Riddoch, noted that: The <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> is also {{overwhelmingly}} male, white, able-bodied, middle-class, {{and university}} educated. The people are generally not. That {{awareness of the}} unrepresentative nature <b>of</b> <b>Parliament,</b> together with recent allegations of sleaze, has switched {{a lot of the}} public off parliamentary politics. ... Now whether The People's Parliament manages to be more animated, more passionate and more open-minded than the other place on the Thames remains to be seen. As their Speaker, I'm obviously biased. But as a journalist, I'm also fascinated by the desire of many people to believe this whole escapade can become more than just another TV series.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{challenge}} Maclean faced {{was getting}} into military service at all. His Foreign Office job was a reserved occupation, so he {{was not allowed to}} enlist. [...] The only way around this was to go into politics, and on this stated ground Maclean tendered his resignation in 1941 to Alexander Cadogan, an FO mandarin. Maclean immediately enlisted, taking a taxi from Sir Alexander's office to a nearby recruiting station, where he joined the Cameron Highlanders, his father's regiment, as a private. Later, his erstwhile employers discovered that his resignation had been merely a ruse or legal fiction along the lines of taking the Chiltern Hundreds. Maclean was thus forced to run for office and, despite his self-confessed inexperience, was chosen as a Conservative candidate, and eventually elected MP. Prime Minister Winston Churchill jocularly accused him of using [...] "the <b>Mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> as a public convenience".|$|R
6000|$|The Federal Council would be, we may suppose, deliberative and {{executive}}, but we {{have not}} been told whence its executive would be taken. If from its own members, then London (if that is to be the seat of the Federal Government) would see not only two legislatures, but two cabinets, because it would certainly happen that the Federal Council would constantly give its confidence to men sent to it from the colonies, and not having seats in the British Parliament. In that case the <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>parliaments</b> would sink into the condition of a state legislature, though the contributions of Great Britain would certainly be many times larger than those of all the colonies put together. If, on the contrary view, Great Britain were {{to take the lead in}} the Council, to shape its policy, and to furnish its ministers, can anybody doubt that the same resentment and sense of grievance which was in old times directed against the centralisation of the Colonial Office, would instantly revive against the centralisation of the new Council? ...|$|R
50|$|His <b>mother,</b> his Member <b>of</b> <b>Parliament</b> (MP) Geraint Davies, {{and human}} rights lawyers and organisations worked against the US {{internment}} and military tribunal process. They also called on the British government to put greater pressure on their US counterparts to improve the tribunal process, detention conditions, and access for the family and lawyers. The British government pressured the US to release its citizens, reportedly leading to a rift between the two countries.|$|R
6000|$|The plain fact of {{the matter}} is, all the Second Chambers in the world are {{directly}} modelled upon the House of Lords, that Old Man of the Sea whom England, the weary Titan, is now striving so hard to shake off her shoulders. The <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> <b>Parliaments</b> is responsible for every one of them. Senates and Upper Houses are just the result of irrational Anglomania. When constitutional government began to exist, men turned unanimously to the English Constitution as their model and pattern. That was perfectly natural. Evolutionists know that evolution never proceeds on any other plan than by reproduction, with modification, of existing structures. America led the way. She said, [...] "England has a House of Commons; therefore we must have a House of Representatives. England has also a House of Lords; nature has not dowered us with those exalted products, but we will do what we can; we will imitate it by a Senate." [...] Monarchical France followed her lead; so did Belgium, Italy, civilisation in general. I believe even Japan rejoices to-day in the august dignity of a Second Chamber. But mark now the irony of it. They all of them did this thing to be entirely English. And just about the time when they had completed the installation of their peers or their senators, England, who set the fashion, began to discover in turn she could manage a great deal better herself without them.|$|R
40|$|Direct mayoral {{elections}} have {{in recent decades}} become an important and popular feature of many local governments across Europe. The direct election of the mayor enhances the accountability and transparency of local political leadership and gives voters the opportunity to gain important influence on local politics. This contrasts with councillors who choose the mayor in single-party private settings. This article provides a case study analysis of two directly elected mayors in contrasting political settings, namely England and Slovenia. Whereas England {{is regarded as the}} <b>mother</b> <b>of</b> all <b>Parliaments,</b> Slovenia’s democratic traditions are more recent. Yet nonetheless Slovenia displays all the features of a strong local democracy where an independent mayoral system operates within a nonpartisan political setting. By contrast, whereas England provides the longest-standing case of local democracy in Europe, directly elected mayors have only recently been introduced into the political system, the outcome of which has been mixed in terms of successfulness and acceptance by national political parties within municipalities...|$|R
5000|$|The {{response}} of architecture to industrialisation, {{in stark contrast}} to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. The railway stations built during this period are often called [...] "the cathedrals of the age". Architecture during the Industrial Age witnessed revivals of styles from the distant past, such as the Gothic Revival—in which style the iconic Palace of Westminster in London was re-built to house the <b>mother</b> <b>parliament</b> <b>of</b> the British Empire. Notre Dame de Paris Cathedral in Paris was also restored in the Gothic style, following its desecration during the French Revolution.|$|R
