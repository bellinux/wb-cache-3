50|$|In Pseudo-steady flows, {{the triple}} point {{moves away from}} the {{reflecting}} surface and the reflection is a direct-Mach reflection. In unsteady flows, {{it is also possible that}} the triple point remains stationary relative to the reflecting surface (stationary-Mach reflection), or moves toward the reflecting surface (inverse-Mach reflection).

50|$|In {{a steady}} flow situation, if a wedge is placed into a steady {{supersonic}} flow in sucha way that its oblique attached shock impinges on a flat wall parallel to the free stream,the shock turns the flow toward the wall and a reflected shock is required to turn the flowback to a direction parallel to the wall. When the shock angle exceeds a certain value, thedeflection achievable by a single reflected shock is insufficient to turn the flow back to adirection parallel {{to the wall and}} transition to <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection</b> is observed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mach</b> <b>reflection</b> {{can exist}} in steady, pseudo-steady and {{unsteady}} flows. When a shock wave, which is moving with a constant velocity, propagates over a solid wedge, the flow {{generated by the}} shock impingeson the wedge thus generating a second reflected shock, which ensures that the velocity ofthe flow {{is parallel to the}} wedge surface. Viewed in the frame of the reflection point, thisflow is locally steady, and the flow is referred to as pseudosteady. Whenthe angle between the wedge and the primary shock is sufficiently large, a single reflectedshock is not able to turn the flow to a direction parallel to the wall and a transition to Machreflection occurs.|$|E

A shock polar is plotted for the {{conditions}} before the incident shock, and a second shock polar is plotted for the conditions behind the shock, with its origin located on the first polar, at the angle through which the incident shock wave deflects the flow. Based on the intersections between the incident shock polar and the reflected shock polar, conclusions as to which reflection patterns are possible may be drawn. Often, it is used to graphically determine whether regular shock reflection is possible, or whether <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection</b> occurs.|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} an improved ghost-cell immersed boundary approach {{to represent a}} solid body in compressible flow simulations. In contrast to the commonly used approaches, in the present work ghost cells are mirrored through the boundary described using a level-set method to farther image points, incorporating a higher-order extra/interpolation scheme for the ghost cell values. A sensor is introduced to deal with image points near the discontinuities in the flow field. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is used to improve {{the representation of the}} geometry efficiently in the Cartesian grid system. The improved ghost-cell method is validated against four test cases: (a) double <b>Mach</b> <b>reflections</b> on a ramp, (b) smooth Prandtl-Meyer expansion flows, (c) supersonic flows in a wind tunnel with a forward-facing step, and (d) supersonic flows over a circular cylinder. It is demonstrated that the improved ghost-cell method can reach the accuracy of second order in L 1 norm and higher than first order in L∞ norm. Direct comparisons against the cut-cell method demonstrate that the improved ghost-cell method is almost equally accurate with better efficiency for boundary representation in high-fidelity compressible flow simulations.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Operational {{characteristics of a}} valveless pulse detonation engine system are being characterized by both experimental and computational efforts. The detonation diffraction process from a small "initiator" combustor to a larger diameter main combustor in a continuous airflow configuration was evaluated during multi-cycle operation of a pulse detonation engine. The multi-cycle detonation experiments were performed on an axisymetric engine geometry operating on both ethylene and propane fuel/air mixtures. The new design explored the effect of forward relief area on performance {{and its ability to}} isolate the detonation products from the incoming air flow during cyclic operation. The use of a small fuel-oxygen initiator to initiate a fuel/air detonation in a larger main combustor has been achieved and has demonstrated the benefit of generating an overdriven detonation condition near the diffraction plane for enhanced transmission to a larger combustor. <b>Mach</b> <b>reflections</b> have been observed on the outer wall downstream of the diffraction plane for the two-dimensional geometry and appear to be the primary re-initiation mechanisms for the re-established fuel-air detonations for this geometry.

40|$|In {{the process}} of deflagration-to-detonation {{transition}} (DDT) in reactive gases, the flame typically accelerates first to the choked flame condition (known as a Chapman-Jouguet deflagration), where it propagates at the sound speed {{with respect to the}} product gases. Subsequently, the choked flame may transit to a detonation. In the present study, the transition length from choked flames to detonations was measured experimentally in laboratory-scale experiments in methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, and propane with oxygen as oxidizer. The choked flames were first generated following the quenching of an incident detonation after its interaction with cylindrical obstacles with two different blockage ratios, 75 % and 90 %. Comparison with a recently proposed model confirms that these are Chapman-Jouguet deflagrations. The subsequent acceleration was monitored via large-scale time-resolved shadowgraphy. The mechanism of transition was found to be through the amplification of transverse waves and hot spot ignition from local <b>Mach</b> <b>reflections.</b> The transition length was found to correlate very well with the mixture's sensitivity to temperature and pressure fluctuations. These fluctuations could be connected to a unique parameter (X), introduced by Radulescu. The parameter is the product of the non-dimensional activation energy (Ea/RT) and the ratio of chemical induction to reaction time (ti/tr). Mixtures with a higher X were found to be more prompt to hot spot ignition and amplification of the fast flame into detonations. The run-up distance for unstable mixtures was found to be much shorter than anticipated from a model neglecting the fluctuations in a 1 -D framework. The run-up distance was also correlated to the detonation cell size, yielding LDDT 7 - 50 cells, with the proportionality coefficient depending on X and the obstacle blockage ratio. Finally, a unique correlation for the run-up distance is proposed, yielding LDDT 3000 c tr, where c is the sound speed in the shocked non-reacted gas, valid for large X...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} uses CFD {{to investigate}} the internal flow of two hypersonic engine inlets: the Hypersonic Research Engine (HRE), a dual-mode ramjet/scramjet, and the Sustained Hypersonic Flight Experiment (SHyFE), a ramjet developed by QinetiQ. Various interactions are considered, namely shock-expansion, shock-shock and shock-boundary layer interactions. To isolate the different interactions, both inviscid and viscous turbulent computations are considered. For the HRE, axisymmetric computations are performed at Mach numbers of 5, 6 and 7, consistent with ground testing conditions used by NASA. The HRE was designed to cruise at a range of Mach numbers; for a given set of freestream flow conditions, dramatically different internal flow characteristics have been found {{depending on whether the}} engine arrived at the flow conditions through either acceleration or deceleration. CFD surface data and throat profiles have been compared to, and agree well with, experimental data obtained by NASA. Two flow conditions are investigated for the SHyFE inlet. Firstly, the self-starting characteristics of the SHyFE intake are examined, where the effect of increased internal compression is considered. The findings show undesirable wave interactions, which lead to flow non-uniformities, and decreased shock stabilization properties have adverse effects on the performance of the engine. Secondly, the effect of freestream incidence on the inlet is examined. The SHyFE engine is designed to cruise at a mean incidence of between 2 ° and 3 °, however, it is conceivable that the engine will, at times, operate at 5 °. Fully three dimensional computations are performed at an angle of attack of 5 ° where the resulting flows show that <b>Mach</b> <b>reflections</b> on the inner surface of the cowl can lead to shock-detachment, as well as showing that shock-boundary layer interactions on the centrebody can cause centrebody flow separation which can unstart the engine.

Numerical simulations were conducted in this study which determined that these bifurcations occur when the Mach number is high, the ramp angle is high, and specific heat ratio is low.

This bifurcation phenomenon has also been observed after triple point collisions in detonation simulations. A triple point reflection was modelled as an inert shock reflecting off a wedge, and the accuracy of the model at early times after reflection indicates that bifurcations in detonations are a result of the shock reflection process.

40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] valveless pulse detonation engine geometry has been partially evaluated on a direct-connect test stand at simulated inlet flight conditions to the combustor. The geometry utilizes a enriched air initiator to initiate detonations in the main combustor and has been operated on ethylene, propane, and JP- 10. The initiator has been operated at frequencies up to 100 Hz. The main combustor of the engine has only been evaluated up to 30 Hz operation due to a current design constraint which will be modified to allow higher frequencies in subsequent tests. The use of an initiator required {{the evaluation of the}} diffraction limits between the initiator exit and the main combustor. The successful use of an initiator to detonate a mixture in a larger main combustor has been demonstrated. Furthermore, experimental data corroborated that tailoring the initiator to produce an overdriven detonation condition at its exit plane, enhanced the detonation transition into the larger combustor. Using imaging optical diagnostics, <b>Mach</b> <b>reflections</b> were observed at the combustor’s wall just a few centimeters downstream of the initiator’s plane. These appear to be the primary re-initiation mechanism for the re-establishment of fuel-air detonations for this geometry. Results show that a diameter ratio between the combustor and the initiator of at least will allow successful operation for ethylene and propane. Single-shot diffraction tests evaluated combustor to initiator diameter ratios up to 1. 58. The specific impulse was computed from experimental measurements using both ethylene and propane fuels at various equivalent ratios from 1. 0 to 1. 5. the results showed Isp values ranging from 850 to almost 1200 seconds, but these relative low values were anticipated due to the oversize initiator used in this study. Such a large initiator was required in order to characterize the aforementioned diameter ratios. Future tests will incorporate an optimally sized initiator, and extrapolation of the current data indicates possible Isp values as high as 1800 seconds with a stoichiometric propane - air mixture. This would indicate similar performance values to more conventionally valved PDE systems...|$|R
40|$|Summary We present {{numerical}} solutions of weak shock Mach reflections {{that contain}} a remarkably complex sequence of supersonic patches, triple points, and expansion fans immediately behind the leading triple point. This structure resolves the von Neumann triple point paradox of weak shock <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection.</b> During {{the second world}} war, von Neumann carried out an extensive study of shock reflection [5]. He suggested a number of criteria for the transition from regular to <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection,</b> and compared his theoretical results with observations. There was generally excellent agreement for strong shocks, but for weak shocks serious discrepancies were found. In particular, a pattern closely resembling simple <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection</b> is observed for weak shocks, but no standard triple point configuration {{is compatible with the}} jump relations across shocks and contact discontinuities. This discrepancy was called the ‘von Neumann triple point paradox ’ by Birkhoff [1]. Many different resolutions of this paradox have been suggested over the years [3]. In this paper, we present numerical solutions of initial and boundary value problems for the unsteady and steady transonic small disturbance equations that provide an asymptotic description of weak shock <b>Mach</b> <b>reflection.</b> These solutions contain a sequence of supersonic patches, shocks, expansion fans, and triple points in a tiny region behind the leading triple point.

The finite cascade of oscillating wedges is first solved numerically. When the thickness is very small, the general nonlinear solution agrees with results based on the linear theory of characteristics, while for the single wedge oscillating near shock detachment it agrees closely with Carrier's exact solution. There is some indication that thickness effects are reduced by cascading. Next, the finite cascade of oscillating flat plates is solved analytically, to the third power of oscillation frequency. The generalized surface pressure is shown to agree with exact numerical results for moderate blade index, but diverges in the far field of the cascade. For comparison with the finite cascade, there is presented finally an elementary periodic solution for the infinite cascade. A simple relationship between the two basic cascade models is developed.

With the dissipation term parameters in the model can be flexibly chosen so that the von Neumann stability condition is satisfied. The influence of the various model parameters on the numerical stability is analyzed and some reference values of parameter are suggested. The new scheme works for both subsonic and supersonic flows with a Mach number up to 30 (or higher), which is validated by well-known benchmark tests. Simulations on Riemann problems with very high ratios (1000 : 1) of pressure and density also show good accuracy and stability.
