Analysis of the temporal connectivity graph of such networks reveals the existence of hubs, a fraction of the nodes, which are collectively con-nected {{to the rest of the}} nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel forwarding strategy called HubCode, which seeks to use the hubs as message relays. The hubs employ random linear network coding to encode <b>multiple</b> <b>messages</b> <b>addressed</b> to the same destination, reducing the forwarding overheads. Further, the use of the hubs as relays, ensures that most messages are delivered to the destinations. Two versions of HubCode are presented, with each scheme exhibiting con-trasting behavior in terms of the computational costs and routing overheads. We simulate a large-scale vehicular DTN using empirically collected movement traces of a city-wide public transport network and demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions in comparison with other forwarding schemes...|$|R

50|$|There are {{scenarios}} {{in which}} a Push Initiator may want to send identical messages to multiple recipients. Rather than submitting multiple identical push messages, one to each recipient, the Push Initiator may submit a single push <b>message</b> <b>addressed</b> to <b>multiple</b> recipients. This section is intended to clarify behaviour related to operations on multiple recipients. When the PPG returns the push-response message, after a push submission to multiple recipients, the response corresponds to the message, regardless {{of the number of}} recipients specified in the push submission (there is one response for each push submission). When a Push Initiator requests status (section 9.8) with <b>multiple</b> <b>addresses</b> specified, the PPG MUST reply with a single statusquery-response (section 9.9) containing the individual statuses. The same is true when only a push-id is specified (no address specified) in the query for status of a multiple recipient message. Result notifications (section 9.6) MUST be sent by the PPG for each individual recipient, if result notification is requested by the Push Initiator during the submission of a message to multiple recipients. In cases where a message is sent to multiple recipients and later a cancel is requested by the initiator, the PPG MAY send back individual responses related to each of the multiple recipients or it MAY send responses related to many or all of the recipients. Support of <b>multiple</b> <b>addresses</b> is OPTIONAL in a PPG.|$|R
