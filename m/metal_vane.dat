40|$|Silicon-based {{ceramics}} {{have been}} proposed as component materials for gas turbine engine hot-sections. When the Navy s Harrier fighter experienced engine (Pegasus F 402) failure because of leading-edge durability problems on the second-stage high-pressure turbine vane, the Office of Naval Research came to the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field for test support in evaluating a concept for eliminating the vane-edge degradation. The High Pressure Burner Rig (HPBR) was selected for testing since it could provide temperature, pressure, velocity, and combustion gas compositions that closely simulate the engine environment. The study focused on equipping the stationary metal airfoil (Pegasus F 402) with a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) leading-edge insert and evaluating the feasibility and benefits of such a configuration. The test exposed the component, with and without the CMC insert, to the harsh engine environment in an unloaded condition, with cooling to provide temperature relief to the metal blade underneath. The insert was made using an AlliedSignal Composites, Inc., enhanced HiNicalon (Nippon Carbon Co. LTD., Yokohama, Japan) fiber-reinforced silicon carbide composite (SiC/SiC CMC) material fabricated via chemical vapor infiltration. This insert was 45 -mils thick and occupied a recessed area in the leading edge and shroud of the vane. It {{was designed to be}} free floating with an end cap design. The HPBR tests provided a comparative evaluation of the temperature response and leading-edge durability and included cycling the airfoils between simulated idle, lift, and cruise flight conditions. In addition, the airfoils were aircooled, uniquely instrumented, and exposed to the exact set of internal and external conditions, which included gas temperatures in excess of 1370 C (2500 F). In addition to documenting the temperature response of the <b>metal</b> <b>vane</b> for comparison with the CMC, a demonstration of improved leading-edge durability was a primary goal. First, the <b>metal</b> <b>vane</b> was tested for a total of 150 cycles. Both the leading edge and trailing edge of the blade exhibited fatigue cracking and burn-through similar to the failures experienced in service by the F 402 engine. Next, an airfoil, fitted with the ceramic leading edge insert, was exposed for 200 cycles. The temperature response of those HPBR cycles indicated a reduced internal metal temperature, by as much as 600 F at the midspan location for the same surface temperature (2100 F). After testing, the composite insert appeared intact, with no signs of failure on either the vane s leading or trailing edge. Only a slight oxide scale, as would be expected, was noted on the insert. Overall, the CMC insert performed similarly to a thick thermal barrier coating. With a small air gap between the metal and the SiC/SiC leading edge, heat transfer from the CMC to the metal alloy was low, effectively lowering the temperatures. The insert's performance has proven that an uncooled CMC can be engineered and designed to withstand the thermal up-shock experienced during the severe lift conditions in the Pegasus engine. The design of the leading-edge insert, which minimized thermal stresses in the SiC/SiC CMC, showed that the CMC/metal assembly can be engineered to be a functioning component...|$|E

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of microwave and millimetre-wave systems, the performance requirements for passive band-pass filters and diplexers, as essential parts in these systems, are steadily increasing. Both rectangular waveguide and substrate-integrated waveguide technologies help to satisfy various high-performance requirements. Rectangular waveguides offer {{the advantages of}} low loss and high power handling capabilities, while substrate-integrated waveguides have the advantages of low cost and easy integration into planar circuit technology. Besides, the miniaturisation of electronic devices is of great importance, especially for microwave or millimetre-wave systems whose volume is limited by system considerations. Hence, the two main aims of this thesis are firstly to develop efficient methods which can improve the design reliability and reduce the design cycle of such passive devices, and secondly to present novel structures of band-pass filters and diplexers whose dimensions are reduced. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a method based on the mode-matching technique is developed to rigorously and efficiently analyse the negative influence introduced by micromachining errors on the performance of band-pass H-plane iris filter. This analysis includes the effect on the centre frequency and 3 dB bandwidth caused by the round angles between waveguide walls and H-plane irises, or by the bevel angles on the H-plane irises. To remove these undesired influences, three approaches are proposed and verified with simulations performed with the finite-element method. In the next part, efficient approximation approaches are investigated in the framework of the mode-matching method to analyse the characteristics of cylindrical posts placed in the cross-section of a rectangular waveguide or substrate-integrated waveguide. Compared with the H-plane irises in rectangular waveguides, cylindrical posts are more promising for realising band-pass rectangular waveguide filters, because the geometries are easier to manufacture and less prone to machining errors. Thus, a general design procedure for band-pass post filters in rectangular waveguides and substrate-integrated waveguides is developed and verified with finite-element simulations and measurements on prototypes. The tolerance analysis for the band-pass filters is also explored quickly and accurately with the developed method, while the influence of realistic material losses on the insertion loss of various structures, is also quantitatively analysed with a full-wave simulation solver. Next, the characteristics of a shielded microstrip line for single-mode operation is investigated rigorously based on the mode-matching method. The research focuses on the influence of the metal enclosure dimensions on the fundamental mode, and the relationships between the cutoff frequency of the 2 nd-order mode and the geometrical variables of the cross-section of the shielded transmission line. A similar method is then applied to an E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide. The analysis demonstrates that the propagation characteristics for the first twenty modes in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide and its corresponding equivalent rectangular waveguide are almost identical if the width of the middle <b>metal</b> <b>vane</b> in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide is chosen reasonably. Exploiting this similarity property, a novel concept of band-pass post filter in E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology is developed to reduce the band-pass filter dimension further, together with an efficient specific design procedure. The validity of the approach is verified via finite-element simulations and measurements on a fabricated prototype. Finally, to reduce the sizes of common diplexers, four types of novel three-port junctions are proposed, including two improved Y-junctions in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a double-layer junction in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a Y-junction in T-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, and a junction with stairs in T-type and E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology. Exploiting the flexibility of the in-house developed mode-matching code or a commercial finite-element simulation solver, the characteristics for all presented junctions are shown to satisfy the constraints for optimum performance of diplexers when adjusting the relevant variables in the corresponding structures. Three types of these junctions are then utilised in realising diplexers whose performance is verified over the required operation bands with either numerical simulations or measurements on fabricated prototypes. In summary, this thesis has introduced novel concepts and realisations of compact band-pass filters and diplexers in unfolded or folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, as well as related structures. One of the crucial aspects emphasised throughout the research is the need for efficient and accurate modelling methods specifically tailored to support such developments. This has been demonstrated throughout the thesis with the combined use of powerful numerical methods and equivalent models based on symmetries or unfolded geometries. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} German seekers used a linear-scan solution, where vertical and horizontal slits were moved {{back and forth in}} front of the detector, {{or in the case of}} Madrid, two <b>metal</b> <b>vanes</b> were tilted to block off more or less of the signal. By comparing the time the flash was received to the location of the scanner at that time, the vertical and horizontal angle-off can be determined. However, these seekers also have the major disadvantage that their FOV is determined by the physical size of the slit (or opaque bar). If this is set too small the image from the target is too small to create a useful signal, while setting it too large makes it inaccurate. For this reason, linear scanners have inherent accuracy limitations. Additionally, the dual reciprocating motion is complex and mechanically unreliable, and generally two separate detectors have to be used.|$|R
50|$|The AS-30 has a {{two-stage}} solid-fuel rocket motor.

As with the AS-20, the AS-30 uses a simple MCLOS guidance with the pilot aligning the flares located near the missile's rear with the target and controlling the missile in flight after launch with a small joystick, sending steering commands to the missile via a radio link. The steering commands steer the missile back to the line-of-sight by thrust vectoring, by the movement of one of four <b>metal</b> <b>vanes</b> around the sustainer nozzle.

[...] The {{tests were}} made by {{replacing}} the existing centre six thick vanes at the first corner of the 4 x 3 -ft wind tunnel by <b>vanes</b> of sheet <b>metal.</b> The thin <b>vanes</b> reduced the-corner loss, estimated from a wake traverse behind one vane, without any deterioration in outflow, and are therefore recommended for use in future wind tunnels. 1.

Such vanes, whilst quite satisfactory in operation, are difficult and expensive to construct. A need, therefore, was felt for further information on the use of thin vanes made of sheet metal, under actual operating conditions, tests 1, 2 at low Reynolds number having shown that there is little difference in the corner loss for thick and thin vanes.
