5|$|Because of {{the great}} range of {{anatomical}} diversity among molluscs, many textbooks start the subject of molluscan anatomy by describing what is called an archi-mollusc, hypothetical generalized <b>mollusc,</b> or hypothetical ancestral <b>mollusc</b> (HAM) to illustrate the most common features found within the phylum. The depiction is visually rather similar to modern monoplacophorans, and some suggest it may resemble very early molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of <b>mollusc</b> shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells.

500|$|The {{phylogeny}} (evolutionary [...] "family tree") of <b>molluscs</b> is {{a controversial}} subject.

40|$|Abstract. Concentrations of metallothioneins (MT) were {{analysed}} in bivalve <b>molluscs</b> Anodonta spp. and Unio spp. from 6 {{lakes and}} watercourses of Latvia with different anthropogenic pressure. The {{aim of the}} study was to find the relationship between MT in <b>molluscs</b> and concentrations of heavy metals in sediments. Unio spp. and Anodonta spp. showed no significant differences in the concentrations of MT. High concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cu, Zn) were detected in the deepest parts of polluted water bodies, however their concentrations significantly decreased in near shore sediments inhabited by <b>molluscs.</b> Only Zn tends to accumulate in the <b>molluscs,</b> reaching 2 - 7 times higher concentrations in organisms than in sediments. There was statistically significant correlation between MT and Hg due to high affinity of Hg to MT-complex. Concentrations of Hg and MT in <b>molluscs</b> were related also to condition index of <b>molluscs,</b> suggesting that accumulation of heavy metals in <b>molluscs</b> depends on their physiological status...|$|R

5|$|The Snake River below Shoshone Falls {{is home to}} thirty-five native fish species, {{of which}} twelve are {{also found in the}} Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake: the relict sand roller (Percopsis transmontana) of the Percopsidae family, the shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), the maginated sculpin (Cottus marginatus), and the Oregon chub (Oregonichthys crameri). The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins. The lower Snake River also {{supports}} seven species of Pacific salmon and trout (Oncorhynchus). There are also high, often localized levels of <b>mollusc</b> endemism, especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River, Salmon River, and middle Snake River. The <b>mollusc</b> richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River.|$|E
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first <b>mollusc</b> shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth.

It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s.

5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed.

However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} <b>mollusc</b> species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List.

5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a <b>mollusc</b> taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot.

Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single adductor muscle or one adductor muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E
5|$|Most young {{octopuses}} hatch as paralarvae and are planktonic {{for weeks}} to months, {{depending on the}} species and water temperature.

Octopus species that produce larger eggs – including the southern blue-ringed, Caribbean reef, California two-spot, Eledone moschata and deep sea octopuses – do not have a paralarval stage, but hatch as benthic animals similar to the adults.|$|E
