25|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> {{involves}} the direct {{transmission of the}} same individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a syringe. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> of trypanosomes.|$|E

25|$|For hard (Ixodid) ticks it is {{virtually}} impossible for <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> to occur on its own (i.e. without some replication), as they tend to not take multiple blood meals from different hosts in the one stage.

40|$|International audienceTransmission of {{mechanical}} stimuli through the actin cytoskeleton {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism for rapid long-distance mechanotransduction in cells; however, a quantitative understanding {{of the dynamics of}} this transmission and the physical factors governing it remains lacking. Two key features of the actin cytoskeleton are its viscoelastic nature and the presence of prestress due to actomyosin motor activity. We develop a model of <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> through prestressed viscoelastic actin stress fibers that directly connect the cell surface to the nucleus. The analysis considers both temporally stationary and oscillatory mechanical signals and accounts for cytosolic drag on the stress fibers. To elucidate the physical parameters that govern <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission,</b> we initially focus on the highly simplified case of a single stress fiber. The results demonstrate that the dynamics of <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> depend on whether the applied force leads to transverse or axial motion of the stress fiber. For transverse motion, <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> is dominated by prestress while fiber elasticity has a negligible effect. Conversely, signal transmission for axial motion is mediated uniquely by elasticity due to the absence of a prestress restoring force. <b>Mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> is significantly delayed by stress fiber material viscosity, while cytosolic damping becomes important only for longer stress fibers. Only transverse motion yields the rapid and long-distance <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> dynamics observed experimentally. For simple networks of stress fibers, mechanical signals are transmitted rapidly to the nucleus when the fibers are oriented largely orthogonal to the applied force, whereas the presence of fibers parallel to the applied force slows down <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> significantly. The present results suggest that cytoskeletal prestress mediates rapid <b>mechanical</b> signal <b>transmission</b> and allows temporally oscillatory signals in the physiological frequency range to travel a long distance without significant decay due to material viscosity and/or cytosolic drag. © 2012 Hwang, Barakat...|$|R

25|$|Development of the {{autogyro}} {{continued in}} the search for a means to accelerate the rotor prior to takeoff (called prerotating). Rotor drives initially took the form of a rope wrapped around the rotor axle and then pulled by a team of men to accelerate the rotor – this was followed by a long taxi to bring the rotor up to speed sufficient for takeoff. The next innovation was flaps on the tail to redirect the propeller slipstream into the rotor while on the ground. This design was first tested on a C.19 in 1929. Efforts in 1930 had shown that development of a light and efficient <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> was not a trivial undertaking. But, in 1932, the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, United States, finally solved the problem with a transmission driven by the engine.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a blood-borne virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of Glossina genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|E

2500|$|In {{parallel}} hybrids, the ICE and {{the electric}} motor are both {{connected to the}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>transmission</b> and can simultaneously transmit power to drive the wheels, usually through a conventional transmission. Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) system as found in the Insight, Civic, Accord, {{as well as the}} GM Belted Alternator/Starter (BAS Hybrid) system found in the Chevrolet Malibu hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids. The internal combustion engine of many parallel hybrids can also act as a generator for supplemental recharging. [...] Currently, commercialized parallel hybrids use a full size combustion engine with a single, small (<20nbsp&kW) electric motor and small battery pack as the electric motor is designed to supplement the main engine, not to be the sole source of motive power from launch. Parallel hybrids are more efficient than comparable non-hybrid vehicles especially during urban stop-and-go conditions where the electric motor is permitted to contribute, and during highway operation.|$|E
