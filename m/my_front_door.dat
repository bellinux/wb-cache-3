5000|$|In Springsteen's autobiography, Born to Run, he {{describes}} Stefanko's photos as [...] "...stark. He managed to strip away your celebrity, your artifice....They were lovely and true....he naturally intuited the conflicts I {{was struggling to}} come to terms with."In September 2016, when Springsteen released his autobiography, he chose Stefanko's 1978 photograph titled [...] "Corvette Winter" [...] to be on the cover. It depicts Springsteen leaning on the front of his Corvette, with a Haddonfield, New Jersey, home and porch behind him. It seems to depict Springsteen's lyrics: [...] "From your <b>front</b> porch to <b>my</b> <b>front</b> seat, the <b>door</b> is open but the ride ain't free." [...] The Corvette image also appears on the CD Chapter and Verse, and on the Official 2017 calendar.|$|R
60|$|Some vague speculations {{passed through}} my mind as to how old the village might be. I had heard some person remark that it had {{formerly}} been much more populous, that many of its people had {{from time to time}} drifted away to the towns; their old empty cottages pulled down and no new ones built. The road was deep and the cottages on either side stood six to eight or nine feet above it. Where a cottage stood close {{to the edge of the}} road and faced it, the door was reached by a flight of stone or brick steps; at such cottages the landing above the steps was like a balcony, where one could stand and look down upon a passing cart, or the daily long straggling procession of children going to or returning from the village school. I counted the steps that led up to <b>my</b> own <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and landing place and found there were ten: I took it that each step represented a century's wear of the road by hoof and wheel and human feet, and the conclusion was thus that the village was a thousand years old--probably it was over two thousand. A few centuries more or less did not seem to matter much; the subject did not interest me in the least, my passing thought about it was an idle straw showing which way the mental wind was blowing.|$|R

60|$|Later in the {{afternoon}} a victoria drew up before <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> just as I was starting for the village. Lady Dennisford leaned forward as I approached. She was closely veiled, but her voice shook with anxiety.|$|E
60|$|There {{followed}} for me another {{three days of}} unremitting work. Then midway through one morning I threw my pen from me with {{a great sense of}} relief. They might come or send for me when they chose. I had finished. My eyes were hot and my brain weary. Instinctively I threw open <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> {{and it seemed to me}} that the sun and the wind and the birds were calling.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} said {{all they had to}} say, and seen all there was to see, these people went home to their breakfasts. I entered my house, but not by the front door, for to do that I would have been obliged to {{trespass}} upon Mrs. Carson's back porch. I got my hat, and was about to start for the town, when I heard my name called. Turning into the hall, I saw Miss Carson, who was standing at <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, a car {{drove into}} the {{original}} <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of Schaller’s. In the 1990s, a dump truck drove through the front façade of the building, destroying the second iteration of the <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R

6000|$|We all {{now stood}} upon the piazza, and Mrs. Aleshine, in calmer tones, {{but with her}} face still flushed from her recent excitement, turned to us and said: [...] "Now, isn't this a pretty comin' home? My front gate {{fastened}} in my very face; <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> painted red and white; {{the inside of the}} house, as like as not, turned upside down by that man jus' as much as the outside; an' where in the world, I'd like to know, is Elizabeth Grootenheimer?" ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{determined}} to make the cave my headquarters, and with it as a base make a systematic exploration of the surrounding country {{in search of the}} land of Sari. First I devoured the remainder of the carcass of the orthopi I had killed before my last sleep. Then I hid the Great Secret in a deep niche {{at the back of my}} cave, rolled the bowlder before <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and with bow, arrows, sword, and shield scrambled down into the peaceful valley.|$|E
60|$|He {{bowed and}} withdrew. Then as I lit my pipe and resumed my seat it {{suddenly}} {{occurred to me}} that the man who was chiefly concerned in this matter should at least be warned. I sat down at my desk and wrote to Ray. I had scarcely finished when I heard footsteps outside, followed by an imperious knocking at <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> I opened it at once. The Duke and Lady Angela entered. I saw at once from her disturbed expression that something had happened.|$|E

50|$|<b>Front</b> <b>doors</b> open on to {{pedestrian}} only area:In Cressingham Gardens the <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of dwellings open on to pedestrian only avenues and pathways. This allows {{efficient use}} of residential land area, as pathways can be much narrower than roads with pavements. Experience has shown that there are substantial social benefits form having <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> open on to a pedestrian area. The most important of these, is that the pedestrianized space provides a safe play area for small children.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not stop}} to investigate, however, from my window. I found my clothes huddled {{together}} with the furniture at {{the front end of}} the room, and as soon as I was dressed I went into the hall and then to <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> I quickly jerked this open and was about to step outside when, suddenly, I stopped. I was positive that my front porch had been destroyed. But there I saw a porch a little lower than mine and a great deal wider, and on the other side of it, not more than eight feet from me, was a window--the window of a house, and on the other side of the window was a face--the face of a young girl! As I stood staring in blank amazement at the house which presented itself at <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> the face at the window disappeared, and I was left to contemplate the scene by myself. I ran to my back door and threw it open. There I saw, stretching up the fields and far up the hillside, the wide path which my house had made as it came down from its elevated position to the valley beneath, where it had ended its onward career by stopping up against another house. As I looked from the back porch I saw that the ground still continued to slope, so that if my house had not found in its path another building, it would probably have proceeded somewhat farther on its course. It was lighter, and I saw bushes and fences and outbuildings--I was in a back yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are my friend," [...] she said, [...] "if any one is. I {{think that}} I will tell you. The man Hill has persecuted me for months--ever since I {{have been in}} England. He claimed me for his wife, and showed to every one a {{marriage}} certificate. He shot at me at the 'Unusual,' and the magistrates bound him over to keep the peace. I found him once in my rooms, and I believe {{that he had a}} key to <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Last night Mr. Brendon and I returned from the 'Unusual,' and found him lying in my room shot through the lungs. In the grate were some charred fragments of a marriage certificate. We fetched the doctor and the police. From the first I could see that neither believed my story. I am suspected of having shot the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{explained}} hastily that I had {{to leave}} my home, and so secured the dog cart. At the time {{it did not seem}} to me nearly so urgent that the landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then, drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on as I came out of <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> lugging my treasures, done up in a tablecloth. I shouted after him: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1800 a portico {{was built}} for the <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> In 1836 the shallow cellar was {{excavated}} to allow a vestibule and a room below for a Sunday School, the portico was removed and the center window above the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> was inserted.|$|R

50|$|Also, {{during the}} game, a Detective is waiting outside, slowly {{advancing}} toward the <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> His arrival signifies {{the reading of}} the will and the announcement of the winner. The Detective can only move one space at a time, and only when a Detective Card (hidden inside the Trap Card pile) is drawn. There are 13 steps to the <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> If the Detective makes it to the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> before all other characters have been eliminated, the game is over.|$|R
60|$|A faint {{prejudice}} may {{possess the}} mind that I have slightly exaggerated my rusticity and remoteness. And {{yet it is}} true as I came to that corner of the Park that, for some unreasonable reason of mood, I saw all London as a strange city and the civilization itself as one enormous whim. The Marble Arch itself, in its new insular position, with traffic turning dizzily all about it, {{struck me as a}} placid monstrosity. What could be wilder than to have a huge arched gateway, with people going everywhere except under it? If I took down <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and stood it up all by itself {{in the middle of my}} back garden, my village neighbours (in their simplicity) would probably stare. Yet the Marble Arch is now precisely that; an elaborate entrance and the only place by which no one can enter. By the new arrangement its last weak pretence to be a gate has been taken away. The cabman still cannot drive through it, but he can have the delights of riding round it, and even (on foggy nights) the rapture of running into it. It has been raised from the rank of a fiction to the dignity of an obstacle.|$|E
5000|$|... "I didn't go to {{galleries}} or museums. They weren't {{a part of}} my childhood. Yet all I had to do was {{walk outside}} <b>my</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> to see visual images all around me. Graffiti was everywhere and it helped me develop what I wanted to do." ...|$|E

5000|$|They are {{pairs of}} {{single-storey}} flats within a two-storey terrace, a {{common type of}} Victorian housing in urban England.

The game also takes inspiration from real locations and environments, with lead designer Barry L.
