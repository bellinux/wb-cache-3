30|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{an efficient}} Bayer CFA pattern identification method based on singular value decomposition. For a given image, we crop the square block {{located at the}} center of the image. For the three-color component of the cropped block, we construct two-color difference blocks, that is red (R) minus green (G) and blue (B) <b>minus</b> <b>G</b> blocks. Because both the original pixels and the interpolated pixels are assumed to have similar singular values in the background region, we use the truncated sum of the singular values for the color difference blocks. First, we determine the diagonal pair consisting of R and B in the Bayer CFA pattern by comparing the difference of the sum of singular values for the diagonal and anti-diagonal term pairs. Next, the CFA configuration is determined by estimating the R position because the type of Bayer CFA pattern is determined according to the R pixel location.|$|E
40|$|Study {{carried out}} to obtain some notion of the initial phasing and {{interactive}} effects among some hormones known to be responsive to vibration stress. Sprague-Dawley derived rats {{were exposed to the}} acute effects of confinement and confinement with lateral (plus or <b>minus</b> <b>G</b> sub y) vibration. The coincident monitoring of glucose, insulin, growth hormone, and corticosterone plasma levels, during and immediately subsequent to exposure to brief low level vibration, exhibits the effects of inhibition of insulin release by epinephrine. The ability of insulin (IRI) to return rapidly to basal levels, from appreciably depressed levels during vibration, in the face of elevated levels of glucose is also shown. Corticosterone responds with almost equal rapidity, but in opposite phase to the IRI. The immuno-assayable growth hormone (IGH) dropped from a basal level of 32 ng/ml to 7. 3 ng/ml immediately subsequent to vibration and remained at essentially that level throughout the experiment (60 min). Whether these levels represent a real fall in the rat or whether they merely follow the immuno-logically deficient form is still in question...|$|E

40|$|Photo{{heterotrophic}} and heterotrophic suspension {{cultures of}} tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) were grown with 1 mM glutathione (reduced; GSH) as sole source of sulfur. Addition of sulfate to both cultures did {{not alter the}} rate of exponential growth, but affected the removal of GSH and sulfate in different ways. In photoheterotrophic suspensions, addition of sulfate caused {{a decline in the}} net uptake of GSH, whereas sulfate was taken up by the green cells immediately. In heterotrophic suspensions, however, addition of sulfate did not affect the net uptake of GSH and sulfate was only taken up by the cells after the GSH supply in the medium had been exhausted. Apparently, GSH uptake in photoheterotrophic cells is inhibited by sulfate, whereas sulfate uptake is inhibited by GSH in heterotrophic cells. The differences in the effect of GSH on sulfate uptake in photoheterotrophic and heterotrophic tobacco suspensions cannot be attributed to differences in the kinetic properties of sulfate carri ers. In short-time transport experiements, both culture took up sulfate almost entirely by an activetransport system as shown by experiments with metabolic inhibitors; sulfate transport of both cultures obeyed monophasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics with similar app. Km (photoheterotrophic cells: 16. 0 plus minus 2. 0 myM; heterotrophic cells: 11. 8 plus minus 1. 8 myM) and V max (photoheterotrophic cells: 323 plus minus 50 nmol mal min <b>minus</b> 1 mal <b>g</b> <b>minus</b> 1 dry weight; heterotrophic cells: 233 plus minus 3 nmol mal min <b>minus</b> 1 mal <b>g</b> <b>minus</b> 1 dry weight) ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To compare an {{ultrasonic}} height {{measuring device}} (Gulliver) with mechanical stadiometry and the classical "book and tape measure" method. METHODS: Blinded duplicate measurements of height {{were made on}} each of 14 children {{by a pair of}} observers using a stadiometer (H) and Gulliver (G). Height was measured on a further 18 children by parents and an auxologist using Gulliver and the book and tape method (TM), and the results were compared with those obtained with a single stadiometry measurement. Finally, measurement of a rigid metal box was made on 10 occasions by the three methods. RESULTS: In the group of 14 children, the mean difference (range) in height (H <b>minus</b> <b>G)</b> was + 2. 8 cm (+ 0. 5 to + 4. 55 cm), with H giving a systematically higher value in 276 of 280 individual measurements. In the group of 18 children, height by H was greater than by G or TM in 47 of 52 individual measurements. The mean (SD) height of the box by H (61. 60 (0. 07) cm) was greater than by G (60. 96 (0. 15) cm; p 0. 05). G and TM produced three times less reliable estimations of height than H, but with a large difference in cost, and there was evidence of systematic underrecording of height by 0. 5 cm with G. CONCLUSIONS: Stadiometry is precise and reproducible, and can detect true changes in height over one month periods in mid-childhood, and should remain the standard way of observing growth. The book and tape method can produce clinically acceptable quarterly estimations of height that can be performed in the home...|$|E
40|$|We present Pleistocene {{oxygen and}} carbon isotope records from two planktonic {{foraminifer}} species (Globigerinoides sacculifer and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei) from Ocean Drilling Program Site 847 (0 ° 16 'N, 95 ° 19 'W; 3334 m water depth). An average sample resolution of 4500 yr {{was obtained by}} sampling at an interval of 15 cm through a continuous 35 -m section from 0 to 1. 15 Ma. Our d 18 O-based chronology {{is similar to that}} derived independently by astronomically tuning the gamma-ray attenuation porosity evaluator (GRAPE) record (Shackleton et al., 1995), though offsets as large as ± 30 k. y. occur on occasion. The surface waters at eastern equatorial Pacific Site 847, 380 km west of the Galapagos, are characterized by strong and constant upwelling, elevated nutrient concentrations, and high productivity. The isotopic composition of G. sacculifer (300 - 355 µm) reflects conditions in the thin-surface mixed layer, and the composition of N. dutertrei (355 - 425 µm) monitors the subsurface waters of the permanent shallow (10 - 40 m) thermocline. The Pleistocene d 18 O difference (N. dutertrei <b>minus</b> <b>G.</b> sacculifer, Dd 18 Od-s) averages 0. 9 per mil and ranges from 0 per mil to 1. 7 per mil. Neglecting species effects and shell size, the average Pleistocene d 13 C difference (G. sacculifer minus N. dutertrei, Dd 13 Cs-d) is 0. 0 per mil and ranges from - 0. 5 per mil to 0. 5 per mil. The Dd 18 Od-s and Dd 13 Cs-d records are used to infer vertical contrasts in upper ocean water temperature and nutrient concentration, though d 13 C may also be influenced by other factors, such as CO 2 gas exchange. Variations in the isotopic differences are often synchronous with glacial/interglacial climate change. Glacial periods are characterized by smaller vertical contrasts in both temperature and nutrient concentration, and by notably greater accumulation rates of N. dutertrei and CaCO 3. We attribute these responses to greater upwelling at the equatorial divergence. Superimposed on the glacial/interglacial Dd 18 Od-s pattern is a long-term trend possibly associated with the advection of Peru Current waters. The temporal fluctuations in the isotopic contrasts are strikingly similar to those observed at Site 851 (Ravelo and Shackleton, this volume), suggesting that the inferred changes in thermal and chemical profiles occurred over a broad region in the equatorial Pacific...|$|E

40|$|Future {{climate changes}} over East Asia are studied from {{ensemble}} simulations of the coupled climate model ECHO-G, {{based on the}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A 2 and B 2 scenarios. Three ensemble experiments are performed: the A 2 scenario experiment with greenhouse-gas (GHG) plus sulfate aerosol forcing (referred to as A 2), and the A 2 and B 2 scenario experiments, with GHG forcing only (A 2 G and B 2 G respectively). All experiments show that East Asian near surface temperature (T 2 m) and precipitation (PCP) will increase in the 21 st century with larger amplitudes than global means. Seasonally varying changes are found as a larger warming in winter and fall and a stronger PCP in summer. Relative roles of large-scale and convective precipitations (LSP and CP) are analyzed extensively. A mass flux scheme with an adjustment closure is used for cumulus parameterization. In the global mean, LSP dominates total PCP increase whereas CP controls PCP reductions near the equator in December-January-February (DJF) and 30 - 40 °S in June-July-August (JJA). The latter originates from a weakening of the northern winter Hadley circulation and an increased static stability in the Southern Hemi-sphere, supporting previous results. For the East Asian mean, the CP change explains most of the increase of total PCP in JJA while the LSP change plays a more critical role in DJF. The LSP increase over the North Pacific in DJF is well associated with strengthened [weakened] baroclinicity north [south] of 40 °N, i. e., a poleward shift of storm track. Aerosol effects on East Asian climate change (A 2 <b>minus</b> A 2 <b>G</b> patterns) are characterized by cooling and drying with patterns {{similar to those of}} the mean changes. This is inconsistent with localized features found in previous works, indicating large uncertainty in regional responses to aerosol forcing. A possible impact of GHG mitigation over the late 21 st century (A 2 <b>G</b> <b>minus</b> B 2 <b>G</b> patterns) is more pronounced in T 2 m than in PCP changes, with similar patterns as in aerosol effects. Simulated CP and LSP contributions to PCP changes are insensitive to the aerosol effect as well as that of GHG mitigations...|$|R

The application of pressure slows the internal motion such that the rigid lattice values of the 19 F second moment are obtained above 50 kbar...|$|R
40|$|A common bivalve: Freshwater mussel, Aspatharia sinuate was {{evaluated}} as a dietary protein supplement {{in the production}} diet for Heterobranchus longifilis fingerlings with mean body weight 8. 34 plus or <b>minus</b> 10 <b>g</b> reared in aquaria tanks. Four diets containing fishmeal protein {{at a rate of}} 25 %, 50 % and 75 % along with the freshwater mussel flesh were formulated. The diet without the freshwater mussel served as the control. The fish fingerlings were fed at 5 % body weight per day for 56 days. It was revealed {{at the end of the}} experiment that freshwater mussel was most suitable as a protein supplement when incorporated at 25 % replacement. The body weight gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ration values of 6. 83 g, 1. 06 % day and 0. 62 respectively were highest in diet with 25 % replacement closely followed by diet with 50 % replacement. Beyond 75 % inclusion level there was no significant growth (P> 0. 05). However, complete replacement of fishmeal by freshwater mussel decreases growth rates and should not be used in Heterobranchus longifilis diet...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to obtain accurate data from two three-legged spacecraft landing systems for purposes of validating current and future computer programs for legged landers. Two landing-gear systems were investigated: an inverted tripod system and a cantilever system. Tests were conducted for eight landing conditions chosen to obtain stability data, maximum loads, and maximum strokes for correlation with analytical results. Data from the two models are not directly comparable because of geometry and mass differences, but both {{are considered to be}} typical models of the respective landing-gear systems. Results indicate that maximum accelerations for both models, which occurred during a nearly flat landing on a horizontal surface, were nearly the same (approximately <b>minus</b> 18 <b>g).</b> Maximum primary strut forces occurred for landings into a 20 deg slope and were 40 kiloNewtons (9000 lbf) and 47 kiloNewtons (10 500 lbf) for the inverted tripod and cantilever models, respectively; and maximum primary strut strokes for both models were 19 cm (7. 4 in.). The inverted tripod model was slightly more stable than the cantilever model because of a larger ratio of footpad radius to center-of-gravity height...|$|R
5000|$|The attack order {{assigned}} the 2d LAI Battalion to screen the division's front and flanks on the Kuwaiti {{side of the}} berm, starting on <b>G</b> <b>minus</b> 3, 21 February. The battalion was to [...] "attempt to identify any gaps in the obstacle belt and locate an alternate breach site for Tiger Brigade in the Northwest." [...] This last task was especially important should the division's main breach effort fail or be held up by the enemy. An alternate breach site would permit the Tiger Brigade to move its heavy armored power around the division's flank and help to pull {{the remainder of the}} division through. Although this was not needed in the end, it was an important contingency to anticipate.|$|R
40|$|Members of the kinesin {{superfamily}} share {{a similar}} motor catalytic domain yet move either toward the plus end (e. g., conventional kinesin) or the <b>minus</b> end (e. <b>g.,</b> Ncd) of microtubules. The structural features that determine the polarity of movement have remained enigmatic. Here, {{we show that}} kinesin’s catalytic domain (316 residues) in a dimeric construct (560 resi-dues) can be replaced with the catalytic domain of Ncd and that the resultant motor moves in the kinesin direction. We also demonstrate that this chimera does not move processively over many tubulin subunits, {{which is similar to}} Ncd but differs from the highly processive motion of conventional kinesin. These findings reveal that the catalytic domain contributes to motor processivity but does not control the polarity of movement. We propose that a region adjacent to the catalytic domain serves as a mechanical transducer that determines directionality...|$|R
