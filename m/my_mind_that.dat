5|$|There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this brainy man was hoodwinked, and that his confidence was betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult that he could not, or would not, resist the influence.|$|E
5|$|There's no {{question}} in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that {{was presented to the}} Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way.|$|E
5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the disturbances I had observed {{might be due}} to an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I made up <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, Messrs. Wood and Street, from Richmond, Va., {{found their}} way to Kentucky. Friendly {{considerations}} led me to patronize them. This was done through the solicitations of a young friend from Virginia. They commenced a paper, published in 1806, called the 'Western World.' Imbibing strong prejudices against slavery, perhaps from my mother's repeating, in my infancy, the nurse's songs composed by Cowper, designed to make such impressions. In June 1806, to the great astonishment of my friends, I left Kentucky, with all the flattering prospects a youth could have, and hastened to Ohio. Connecting circumstances, and from hints that fell from Wood and others, a deep impression had been made on <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> an eventful period was fast approaching.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no doubt}} in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Adelaide {{represent}} the very nadir of the Australian tour...The reasons behind the ease of their successful loss were fourfold: unenterprising captaincy, bad England batting, a good Lillee bowling performance and a lack of penetration in the depleted touring attack.|$|E
5000|$|Geri Russo, {{a friend}} of Zimmerman's who had {{previously}} worked with him, testified that it was Zimmerman screaming for help on the 911 tape. She testified, “I recognize his voice, I’ve heard him speak many times, I have no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that’s</b> his voice.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{as it may}} be," [...] Mr. Bullsom admitted. [...] "To <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that's</b> {{where the}} art of the thing comes in. Any fool can work, but it takes a shrewd man to keep a lot of others working hard for him while he pockets the oof himself." ...|$|R

25|$|For 60 days, my {{body was}} used as a {{thoroughfare}} for all the hoodlums, militia men and soldiers in the district... Those men completely destroyed me; they caused me so much pain. They raped me in front of my six children... Three years ago, I discovered I had HIV/AIDS. There is no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> I was infected during these rapes.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, I have not had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
500|$|Berg {{served on}} Princeton University's Board of Trustees from 1999 to 2003. In 2000, he began researching a {{biography}} of Woodrow Wilson, of whom Berg says, [...] "I have an image of him in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> is unlike any picture I have seen anywhere else, based on material at Princeton and 35 years of researching and thinking about him". Wilson was published on September 10, 2013.|$|E

500|$|DeConcini later {{charged that}} McCain had {{leaked to the}} press {{sensitive}} information about the investigation that came {{from some of the}} closed proceedings of the Ethics Committee. McCain denied doing so under oath, although several press reports concluded that McCain {{had been one of the}} main leakers during that time. The GAO investigator later said, [...] "There is absolutely no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> McCain made those leaks." [...] Vice chair Rudman stated in his 1996 autobiography that McCain and his staff were responsible for some of the leaks, but later repudiated the assertion.|$|E
500|$|Intra-conference {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2007, when Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh {{was quoted as}} saying [...] "'s only got onemore year, though. He'll be there onemore year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff." [...] Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC. [...] At the Pac-10 Conference media day (July 26, 2007), Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating [...] "There is no question in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> USC is {{the best team in the}} country and may be the best team in the history of college football"; the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's initial {{reply was}} accommodating: [...] "I {{would like to}} fall in with your views as far as {{possible}} without creating a position that would be untenable to myself". However, Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. [...] "I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided [...] "what limits he puts on his own rights". To this Shackleton replied: [...] "There is no doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further".|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Szilard and Zinn {{conducted}} a simple experiment {{on the seventh}} floor of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. Initially nothing registered on the oscilloscope, but then Zinn realized that it was not plugged in. On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the world was headed for grief".|$|E
500|$|Wayne Kramer, a guitarist for MC5, {{suggested}} that Hendrix {{had been set}} up as part of a wide-scale crackdown on rock musicians: [...] "I don't have any doubt in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> the right-wing government forces were behind all of that... There was an effort, a movement, to stop this threat that rock and roll represented." [...] Hendrix was not the only prominent rock musician who found himself in legal trouble during May 1969. On May 16, the US embassy in London revoked John Lennon's visa in response to his 1968 drug conviction, describing him as [...] "an inadmissible immigrant". That same day, Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady was arrested for possession of marijuana, and on May 28, Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull were arrested at their London home for marijuana possession.|$|E

500|$|Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a {{fundamental}} {{weakness in the}} film: the [...] "overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because {{there are times when}} Licence to Kills narrative bogs down." [...] Berardinelli gave the film three out of a possible four stars, adding [...] "Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping, but it's not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public's rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture." [...] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: [...] "It boggles <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Licence to Kill is so controversial. There's really more of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies." [...] John Glen has said Licence to Kill [...] "is among my best Bond films, if not the best".|$|E
500|$|... "The Unnatural" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the series that Duchovny wrote by himself. He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>that</b> I could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E
500|$|Rangel was {{an early}} and strong {{supporter}} of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign for the Democratic nomination. His actions during 2007 included taking {{a shot at the}} marital histories of former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, then the Republican front-runner, and his wife Judith Giuliani, resulted in Rangel issuing a no-excuses apology. [...] As 2008 unwound, the Democratic primaries and caucuses turned into a historic battle between Clinton and Senator Barack Obama. Although Obama had a real chance of becoming the first African-American president, a development that Rangel viewed with pride, and although some racially tinged comments entered the contest and Clinton's support among African Americans plunged, Rangel stayed loyal to her, saying [...] "There’s just no question in <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> Hillary would be in a better position than a freshman senator. This ain’t no time for a beginner." [...] (Rangel's wife Alma, on the other hand, publicly supported Obama.) [...] Rangel did endorse Obama once he finally clinched the nomination in early June 2008.|$|E
