5|$|Ny-Ålesund is a {{permanent}} settlement based entirely around research. Formerly a mining town, {{it is still a}} company town operated by the Norwegian state-owned Kings Bay. While there is some tourism there, Norwegian authorities limit access to the outpost to minimize impact on the scientific work. Ny-Ålesund has a winter population of 35 and a summer population of 180. The Norwegian <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> has outposts at Bjørnøya and Hopen, with respectively ten and four people stationed. Both outposts can also house temporary research staff. Poland operates the Polish Polar Station at Hornsund, with ten permanent residents.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposals}} for an airport on Værøy were {{launched by the}} government in the late 1960s. A 1968 meteorological report concluded that the island was highly susceptible for strong winds, dominantly from the west, which could cause problems for air traffic. Three locations were considered: Kvalnes, Røssnesvågen og Nordlandet. The Norwegian <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> concluded in 1973 that Nordlandet was the most suitable location in terms of weather, but test flights showed otherwise. Nordlandet was the cheapest alternative. Estimates showed that the regularity at an airport would be significantly lower than at the existing heliport. This caused local politicians to wish to keep the existing service, but pressure from Røst caused Værøy politicians to support an airport. After initial protests against Nordlandet as a site, Mayor Asmund Berg accepted the location on 3 May 1984. There had not been conducted sufficient test flights to establish the wind conditions above the airport caused by Teisthammeren, a mountain next to the airport. Widerøe was opposed to the location of the airport.|$|E

25|$|The Arctic Coal Company, {{based at}} Longyear City on Spitsbergen, took {{contact with the}} Telegraphy Administration in 1910 and {{requested}} that there be established a radio telegraphy network between the archipelago and Norway. Svalbard was then terra nullus and not part of Norway. To avoid an American company establishing a station on territory the authorities hoped would become part of Norway, the proposal was passed after three weeks' administrative and political proceedings. This resulted in Spitsbergen Radio (from 1920 Svalbard Radio) and Ingøy Radio being established. The service made it popular to install radios on larger fishing vessels and allowed weather observations {{to be sent to}} the Norwegian <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute.</b>|$|E

30|$|The <b>Meteorological</b> Research <b>Institute</b> (MRI) has {{analyzed}} the environmental conditions when these tornadoes were generated by using JMA’s operational mesoscale analysis data (<b>Meteorological</b> Research <b>Institute</b> 2012). The water vapor distribution at 12 : 00 JST on 6 May {{showed that a}} moist airflow supplied the intense rainfall regions where the tornadoes were generated. In particular, a moist airflow with a water vapor mixing ratio that exceeded 12  g kg− 1 contributed to the generation of these tornadoes (<b>Meteorological</b> Research <b>Institute</b> 2012). To investigate the detailed structure of the convection cell that produced the southernmost tornado, MRI conducted a deterministic experiment using a model with a horizontal grid interval of 250  m. Although this experiment reproduced only the southernmost tornado, it showed that the rainfall system that generated the tornadoes had a supercell structure. In the present study, we performed ensemble experiments to further investigate these three tornadoes generated on the northern Kanto Plain.|$|R
25|$|Smith was {{promoted}} to first lieutenant on 12 January 1923. He {{became interested in the}} scientific study of oceanography and the movement of icebergs during his assignment aboard Seneca, and remained assigned as an Ice Patrol hydrographer until August 1924 when he was directed by Coast Guard Headquarters to work with Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Bergen School of Meteorology. Bjerknes was internationally known for his studies of how wind currents interact with ocean currents to produce weather patterns and Smith studied his methods of measuring ocean currents. In August 1925, Smith spent three months at the British <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Institute</b> collecting data for use with the Ice Patrol before returning the United States and Ice Patrol duties. He received permission to study at Harvard University when Seneca wasn't on Ice Patrol duties. In 1925, Smith published A Practical Means for Determining Ocean Currents, which was utilized as a work bulletin throughout the Coast Guard.|$|E
