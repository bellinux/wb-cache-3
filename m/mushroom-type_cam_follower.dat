50|$|The {{standard}} {{driving system}} for a stud type <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> and those used in blind holes. Hex socket <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower.</b> RBC Bearings' Hexlube <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> feature a relubrication fitting {{at the bottom of}} the hex socket.|$|R
50|$|A <b>cam</b> <b>follower,</b> {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or needle bearing designed to follow cam lobe profiles. <b>Cam</b> <b>followers</b> come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mounts to its mating part; stud style <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|R

50|$|A <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two {{specially}} shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism's energy is transferred from <b>cam</b> to <b>follower.</b> The <b>cam</b> shaft is rotated and, according to the <b>cam</b> profile, the <b>follower</b> moves up and down. Now slightly different types of eccentric <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> are also available in which energy is transferred from the <b>follower</b> to the <b>cam.</b> The main benefit of this type of <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|R

50|$|The <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> used in Sportster engines, K models, big twin {{side valve}} models, and the side-valve W model series were a {{slightly}} shorter {{version of the}} followers used in the larger motors, but with the same 0.731 in diameter body and 0.855 in diameter roller follower since 1929.

40|$|This {{research}} utilizes the repetitive control {{approach in}} morphing a high-speed cam mechanism {{so that its}} output displacement tracks the desired output trajectory. The main objective {{is to reduce the}} output tracking error, which is the difference between the actual and desired output displacements of the output mass. A 3 -degree of freedom mathematical model is used to analyze and represent the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. The output tracking error in <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> systems is generally caused by errors in cam profile manufacturing, variation in the speed of the driving motor and the dynamics of the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> system. Theoretical and experimental results show that the output tracking error is greatly reduced after repetitive control has been applied to the system. As a result, the actual output displacement tracks the desired output displacement very closely...|$|R

Proper design of <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> is required for perfect tuning between opening and closing of valves with cam shaft speed. In this paper, the complete kinematic analysis of <b>cam</b> and <b>follower</b> is done continued with simulation. Simulation involved with experimentation of computerized model {{of a system of}} process. Simulation is a very general method of studying problems. it generally involve complex problem in case where actual test may not be practical.

50|$|While roller <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> {{are similar}} to roller {{bearings}}, {{there are quite a}} few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce deformation. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the dynamic bearing capacity.|$|R

They are also used in turntable type applications to reduce skidding. Crowned followers can compensate for up to 0.5° of misalignment, while a cylindrical OD can only tolerate 0.06°. The only disadvantage is that they cannot bear as much load because of higher stresses.|$|R

25|$|Apart from {{a control}} that engaged the <b>cam</b> <b>follower</b> and fired {{the gun in}} one movement, this gear was based closely on the {{original}} Fokker Stangensteuerung gear. It was designed by Oberleutnant Guido Priesel, and became standard on Oeffag Albatros fighters in 1918.|$|R
50|$|For {{heavy-duty}} applications a roller design can be used.

5000|$|Cam timers {{and drum}} sequencers were {{primarily}} used with industrial machines to control repetitive sequencing operations.

50|$|Stud type <b>cam</b> <b>followers</b> are {{available}} with an eccentric stud. The stud has a bushing pushed onto it that has an eccentric outer diameter. This allows for adjustability during installation to eliminate any backlash. The adjustable range for an eccentric bearing is twice that of the eccentricity.|$|R
50|$|The modern stud type {{follower}} {{was invented}} and patented in 1937 by Thomas L. Robinson of the McGill Manufacturing Company. It replaced using a standard bearing and bolt.
