500|$|Although {{known as}} one of Hollywood's most {{exciting}} on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with [...] "warm brown eyes" [...] and [...] "extraordinary charm". In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings inside, later recalling, [...] "He never guessed I had a crush on him ... it never occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> smitten with me, too." [...] Flynn later wrote, [...] "By the time we made The Charge of the Light Brigade, I was sure that I was in love with her." [...] Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the Coronation Ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to [...] "Sweet Leilani" [...] at the hotel's Coconut Grove nightclub. [...] "I was deeply affected by him," [...] she later remembered, [...] "It was impossible for me not to be." [...] The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn reunited with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.|$|E

[...] This audacious man wasn't afraid to show who he was....

2500|$|The {{son of an}} English-born cabinet-maker of Polish heritage, Kopernik Joseph Boleslaw Stokowski, and his Irish-born wife Annie-Marion (n√©e Moore), Stokowski {{was born}} Leopold Anthony Stokowski, {{although}} on occasion in later life he altered his middle name to Antoni, per the Polish spelling. There is some mystery surrounding his early life. For example, he spoke with an unusual, non-British accent, though he was [...] {{born and raised in}} London. On occasion, Stokowski gave his year of birth as 1887 instead of 1882, as {{in a letter to the}} Hugo Riemann Musiklexicon in 1950, which also incorrectly gave his birthplace as Krak√≥w, Poland. Nicolas Slonimsky, editor of Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, received a letter from a Finnish encyclopaedia editor that said, [...] "The Maestro himself told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in Pomerania, Germany, in 1889." [...] In Germany there was a corresponding rumour that his original name was simply [...] "Stock" [...] (German for stick). However, Stokowski's birth certificate (signed by J. Claxton, the registrar at the General Office, Somerset House, London, in the parish of All Souls, County of Middlesex) gives his birth on 18 April 1882, at 13 Upper Marylebone Street (now New Cavendish Street), in the Marylebone District of London. Stokowski was named after his Polish-born grandfather Leopold, who died in the English county of Surrey on 13 January 1879, at the age of 49.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and said we would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would go by. And this is at Marlon's urging‚Äîand yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E
