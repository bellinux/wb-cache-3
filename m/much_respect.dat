5|$|Pryce's {{performances}} in a Formula One car earned him <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> amongst the F1 paddock. David Tremayne named his son after the Welshman. The Tom Pryce Award, {{also known as}} the Tom Pryce Trophy, was instigated, and is given annually to Welsh personalities who have made an outstanding contribution to motoring or transport.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} Shero {{decided that the}} team would be more successful if he coached them like he had coached his minor league teams. Upon being elevated to the NHL, he {{had decided not to}} employ systems like he did in the minors, stating that he had too <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> for NHL players. However, he decided that since he had the same kind of players on the Flyers as he did in the minors, he would use the same systems, becoming the first coach to employ systems.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must not touch the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E

5|$|The Hindu {{caste system}} was present and devadasis were {{recognised}} by the government. Some kings had concubines (ganikas) {{who were given}} <b>much</b> <b>respect,</b> and Sati was perhaps absent since widows like Vinayavathi and Vijayanka are mentioned in records. Devadasis were however present in temples. Sage Bharata's Natyashastra, the precursor to Bharatanatyam, the classical dance of South India, was popular and is seen in many sculptures and is mentioned in inscriptions. Some women from the royal family enjoyed political power in administration. Queen Vijayanka was a noted Sanskrit poet, Kumkumadevi, the younger sister of Vijayaditya (and queen of Alupa King Chitravahana) made several grants and had a Jain basadi called Anesajjebasadi constructed at Puligere, and the queens of VikramadityaII, Lokamahadevi and Trailokyamahadevi made grants and possibly consecrated the Lokesvara Temple (now called Virupaksha temple) but also and the Mallikarjuna temple respectively at Pattadakal.|$|E
5|$|The tactics {{were also}} {{unsuitable}} for fighter-versus-fighter combat. Packed in tight formation, the RAF pilots {{were more concerned}} with keeping their position and not colliding with each other than they were keeping watch for the enemy. It made them vulnerable to surprise attacks by Bf 109s and Bf 110s. Even if the British fighters reached the bombers without interception, the chaos of modern aerial combat {{made it impossible to}} concentrate attacks with large, rigid formations. Pilots were also forced into paying far too <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> to the bomber's defensive capabilities. Attacks were broken off far too early and caused little damage to bombers. These tactical failures were evident during the battles in Belgium and France. Moreover, rushed training with pilots who were barely able to use the old tactical methods meant that airmen could not cope with much needed radical changes.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy and {{his wife}} moved north of Auckland {{to what is now}} known as Warkworth in early 1854, {{following}} his appointment as district surveyor for the Mahurangi Peninsula, which was being opened for settlement. For two years, Heaphy surveyed the plots of land that were to be sold to people moving to the area. In 1856 he became Auckland's provincial surveyor following the retirement of his predecessor. He moved back to Auckland and took up residence in Parnell. Surveying kept him busy {{for the next few years}} but in early 1859, he accompanied Ferdinand von Hochstetter, who had been invited by the government to make a report on a coalfield discovered south of Auckland. The two became friendly and Hochstetter was impressed with Heaphy's bush skills, although privately did not accord him <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> for his scientific knowledge. When Hochstetter left for Europe later in the year, he took with him many examples of Heaphy's artwork. The two later fell out, when Heaphy had an article published in a geological journal. Hochstetter felt usurped by someone he considered an inferior scholar and publicly questioned Heaphy's credentials. He also made allegations that Heaphy had plagiarised portions of his work on the coalfields. Heaphy mounted a spirited defence and generally had the sympathy of the public. The dispute did not stop Hochstetter from using Heaphy's artwork in a book he published on New Zealand's geology.|$|E

5|$|Mandela {{obtained}} work as {{an attorney}} for the firm Terblanche and Briggish, before moving to the liberal-run Helman and Michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. In August 1953, Mandela and Tambo opened their own law firm, Mandela and Tambo, operating in downtown Johannesburg. The only African-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. Disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the Group Areas Act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. As a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, Mandela was part of Johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> from the black community. Although a second daughter, Makaziwe Phumia, was born in May 1954, Mandela's relationship with Evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. He may have had affairs with ANC member Lillian Ngoyi and secretary Ruth Mompati; various individuals close to Mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. Disgusted by her son's behaviour, Nosekeni returned to Transkei, while Evelyn embraced the Jehovah's Witnesses and rejected Mandela's preoccupation with politics.|$|E
5|$|Artist Takayoshi Sato {{corrected}} {{inconsistencies in}} the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic {{tasks such as}} font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as {{he did not have}} as <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work {{at the end of a}} day.|$|E

He was also a friend of Cao Cao and Yuan Shao.|$|E
25|$|According to his {{visitors}} at Rarău, Daniil was living an exemplary austere life, but was prioritizing the internal prayer over all exterior ritual, and would spend half a working day submerged in meditation. He did provide the occasional sermon, and earned <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> from the Bukovinan peasants he addressed, especially {{because he would}} freely express his emotions in front of them.|$|E
25|$|Ren Jun {{was known}} for being generous, {{understanding}} and magnanimous. Cao Cao highly regarded him and often heeded his advice and suggestions.

25|$|Outside of Scandinavia, the Isle of Man {{stands out}} with its 30 runestones from the 9th century and early 11th century. Scattered runestones {{have also been}} found in England, Ireland, Scotland and the Faroe Islands. With the {{exception}} of the runestone on Berezan', there are no runestones in Eastern Europe, which probably is {{due to a lack of}} available stones and the fact that the local population probably did not treat the foreigners' stones with <b>much</b> <b>respect.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Scranton {{was chosen}} by President Ford to become United States Ambassador to the United Nations. His {{measured}} approach to diplomacy and genuine interest in human rights earned him <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> in his short time in office. Some in the Republican Party pushed for Scranton to be named Ford’s running mate for the 1976 presidential election, but Ford chose Senator Robert Dole of Kansas instead. After his term as UN Ambassador, Scranton retired {{to his home in}} Dalton, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Bu Zhi {{was known}} for being magnanimous, generous and capable of putting up with indignities – these traits earned him <b>much</b> <b>respect</b> from many people, {{including}} his enemies.

However, the historian Pei Songzhi criticised Bu Zhi for supporting Sun Quan's fourth son Sun Ba in the succession struggle against Sun Quan's second heir apparent Sun He, and added that this incident left a huge stain on Bu Zhi's good reputation.|$|E

25|$|The Respect {{system is}} a scoring system where the player earns Respect points to unlock {{missions}} and progress through the storyline. The player can partake in storyline and stronghold missions only after filling up at least one bar of Respect, and Respect points are removed when the player starts a mission. The 'style rank' is a modifier of how <b>much</b> <b>Respect</b> the player can earn; this is increased by purchasing items for the player character. Respect points can be earned in two ways; by progressing through side-missions called Activities and by completing mini-games and stunts called Diversions.|$|E
