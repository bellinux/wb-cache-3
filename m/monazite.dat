5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the <b>monazite</b> sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive <b>monazite</b> surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining <b>monazite</b> sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} for <b>monazite,</b> (Ln,Th)PO4, which usually contains all the rare earths, {{as well as}} thorium, is more involved. <b>Monazite,</b> because of its magnetic properties, can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation.

Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that, the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid, but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO3 and hence precipitates out.

New geochronological data from the TAC reveal a tectonic evolution with two major events. <b>Monazites</b> ages from the Neoarchean granulitic crust illustrate a main tectono-metamorphic event around 2. 45 Ga.

5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals <b>monazite,</b> euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant. Once extracted and prepared, ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant. The metal is a fire and explosion hazard.|$|E
5|$|Samarium is {{not found}} free in nature, but, like other rare earth elements, is {{contained}} in many minerals, including <b>monazite,</b> bastnäsite, cerite, gadolinite and samarskite; <b>monazite</b> (in which samarium occurs at concentrations of up to 2.8%) and bastnäsite are mostly used as commercial sources. World resources of samarium are estimated at two million tonnes; they are mostly located in China, US, Brazil, India, Sri Lanka and Australia, and the annual production is about 700 tonnes. Country production reports are usually given for all rare-earth metals combined. By far, China has the largest production with 120,000 tonnes mined per year; it {{is followed by the}} US (about 5,000tonnes) and India (2,700tonnes). Samarium is usually sold as oxide, which at the price of about 30USD/kg is one of the cheapest lanthanide oxides. Whereas mischmetal – a mixture of rare earth metals containing about 1% of samarium – has long been used, relatively pure samarium has been isolated only recently, through ion exchange processes, solvent extraction techniques, and electrochemical deposition. The metal is often prepared by electrolysis of a molten mixture of samarium(III) chloride with sodium chloride or calcium chloride. Samarium can also be obtained by reducing its oxide with lanthanum. The product is then distilled to separate samarium (boiling point 1794°C) and lanthanum (b.p.3464°C).|$|E

Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain 228Ra, the daughter of 232Th, which is a strong gamma emitter. Lanthanum is relatively easy to extract as it has only one neighbouring lanthanide, cerium, which can be removed by making use of its ability to be oxidised to the +4 state; thereafter, lanthanum may be separated out by the historical method of fractional crystallization of La(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O, or by ion-exchange techniques when higher purity is desired.|$|E

Initial ε Nd values, mostly in the range of- 0. 5 to- 1. 0, imply a moderate input of older crustal material into most of the lateorogenic granites.

The study undertook varied geochemical analyses for determining element variations and the relationships, and elemental partitions in the regolith units. It was found that TI, Pb, Si, Fe are surface indicators of mineralisation for the Grevillea deposit. Two types of rock units dominated the regolith, which overlies the massive pyrite zone: the jarosite limonites and the hematite limonites, and both act as sponges for metals derived from the ore. The jarosite types in the area are likely plumbojarosite and argentojarosite. Textures were also studied in outcrop, on a handspecimen scale, and on microscopic scales to search for evidence of primary sulfides.

In this study, U-Pb dating of zircons and <b>Monazites</b> used in order to find the ages of deposition and metamorphism of metasediments in SMC.
