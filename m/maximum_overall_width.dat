50|$|The hillfort {{stands on}} the western fringe of Amesbury and borders the River Avon on its {{southern}} side, and the A303 on its northern edge. It is inside {{the boundaries of the}} Stonehenge World Heritage Site inscribed in 1986. Several other hill-forts are located nearby, including Danebury to the east, Sidbury Hill and Casterley Camp to the north, Yarnbury Castle to the west, and Figsbury Ring and Old Sarum to the south. Ogbury Camp 3 mi south may have been a satellite enclosure of Vespasian's Camp.From north to south the hill-fort is 730 m in overall length and 374 m wide at the southern end, narrowing to 100 m wide at the northern end. It encloses an area of some 15 hectares. The bank is up to 40 m wide and up to 6 m high above the ditch bottom. The ditch is up to 10 m wide with a low counterscarp bank up to 18 m wide {{on the outside of the}} ditch, creating a <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> <b>width</b> of the hill-fort's defences of 68 m.|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE The apparatus and procedure for obtaining coefficient of friction values of bituminous and portland cement concrete pavements and bridge decks using a portable skid tester are described in this test method. B. APPARATUS 1. Skid testing unit A 2 -ply tire (200 mm rim height, 95 mm rim width, 425 mm tire height and a <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> tire <b>width</b> from 100 to 120 mm) with 170 ± 15 kPa air pressure manufactured with a smooth tread, together with rim, axle, and driving pulley, is mounted to a rigid frame. The tire is brought to the required test speed by a motor. A carriage moves on two parallel guides. Friction is reduced to a low uniform value with three roller bearings fitted at 120 ˚ points to bear against the guide rod at each corner of the carriage. Two guide rods are rigidly connected to the end frame bars. The front end of the guide bar frame assembly is firmly fastened to a bumper hitch to restrain forward movement. The bumper hitch provides for swinging the skid tester to the right or left after positioning the vehicle. The rear end of the frame assembly is raised by an adjustable knob to hold the tire 6 mm above the surface to be tested. This device is constructed so that the tire may be dropped instantaneously to the test surface by tripping the release arm. A tachometer indicates the speed of the tire in kilometers per hour. The springs are calibrated by procedures outlined i...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the sub-classification of myopic glaucomatous eyes by optic disc and peripapillary features. Optic disc tilt and torsion were determined from retinal nerve fiber layer photographs. Based {{on the location}} of the Bruch's membrane (BM) opening within the β-zone of the peripapillary atrophy (PPA) area, the widths of β-zone PPA (PPA 1 W), PPA+BM (PPA 2 W), and PPA-BM (PPA 3 W) were measured with enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Cluster analysis that employed partitioning around medoids was performed with these parameters, the presence of inward rotation of BM ending axial length (AXL), and central corneal thickness. A total of 115 eyes (AXL≥ 24 mm) were included. Two clusters produced <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> silhouette <b>widths</b> (average = 0. 43). Visual field (VF) mean deviation was not different between cluster 1 (52 eyes; - 4. 02 ± 3. 01 dB) and cluster 2 (63 eyes; - 5. 21 ± 5. 62 dB; p = 0. 174). In cluster 1 compared to cluster 2, optic disc tilt was significantly greater, PPA 1 W and PPA 3 W were longer, and AXL was longer (all p< 0. 001). The presence of an inward rotation of BM ending was more frequent in cluster 2 (p = 0. 043). Forty-one eyes (78. 8 %) in cluster 1 had superior VF defects while 10 eyes (19. 2 %) had inferior defects, and only one eye (2 %) had defects in both hemifields. Eyes in cluster 2 were more evenly distributed: 55. 6 % had superior defects, 34. 9 % had inferior defects, and 9. 5 % had defects in both hemifields (p = 0. 023). Myopic glaucomatous eyes characterized by optic disc and peripapillary configurations can be classified as two distinct types, and the most distinct difference between the two was degree of optic disc tilt and width of PPA. The location of VF defects were also significantly different between two clusters...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> {{length is}} {{dictated}} {{by the need to}} fit into a box magazine of standard manufacture.

This dictates that the cartridge's <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> length be no greater than 2.260". However, for competition purposes during off-hand and slow fire prone match stages, the [...]223 Remington is loaded one cartridge at a time into the rifle's receiver. This allows for the cartridge to be longer than the standardized 2.260" [...] SAAMI <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> length. These cartridges can be safely loaded to a length that has the ogive portion of the bullet just touching the rifle's lands. Many competitive shooters will make these cartridges 0.005" [...] less than the truly <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>overall</b> length, for the sake of safety.|$|R
