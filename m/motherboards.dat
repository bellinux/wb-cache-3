5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} <b>motherboards,</b> the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack {{was moved to the}} bottom of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Judy {{convinced}} {{the managers of}} two bars in Seattle, Washington, to set up Donkey Kong machines. The managers initially showed reluctance, but when they saw sales of $30 a day—or 120 plays—for a week straight, they requested more units. In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong <b>motherboards</b> and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox One S hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a system-on-chip (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console will feature a vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and <b>motherboards</b> will be tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console will also support AMD's FreeSync technology on compatible displays.|$|E

50|$|Dedicated {{graphics}} {{cards are}} not {{bound to the}} <b>motherboard,</b> and therefore most are removable, replaceable, or upgradable.

25|$|DJ {{software}} requires specialized hardware {{in addition}} to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular sound card integrated into most computer <b>motherboards</b> can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs {{need to be able to}} output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer <b>motherboards.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Core 2 {{processor}} {{does not}} require the use of DDR2. While the Intel 975X and P965 chipsets require this memory, some <b>motherboards</b> and chipsets support both Core 2 processors and DDR memory.

25|$|Both FBDIMM (fully buffered) and LRDIMM (load reduced) memory {{types are}} {{designed}} primarily {{to control the}} amount of electric current flowing {{to and from the}} memory chips at any given time.

25|$|It {{was thought}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC <b>motherboards</b> {{replacing}} BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008.

25|$|DRAM density: Size of {{the chip}} is {{measured}} in megabits. Most <b>motherboards</b> recognize only 1GB modules if they contain 64M×8 chips (low density). If 128M×4 (high density) 1GB modules are used, they most likely will not work. The JEDEC standard allows 128M×4 only for slower buffered/registered modules designed specifically for some servers, but some generic manufacturers do not comply.|$|E
