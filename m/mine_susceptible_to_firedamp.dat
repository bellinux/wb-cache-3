Due to the decreasing plan of CdF workers, the inadequacy of some manufacturers and the missing of some others, the use of external workshops for the repairing is more and more frequent. So, it is necessary for safety reasons to ensure that such repairs are conducted in optimal conditions. The aim of Saqr-ATEX certification is to ensure that the quality and the traceability of repaired equipment used in gassy coa! mines give an equivalent safety level to the new equipment one. In order to be attractive for workshops, Saqr-ATEX is not only usable for ATEX coal mine equipment but also for ATEX equipment installed in every location where hazardous atmosphere could occur. The setting up of this certification requires: • the development of a technical referential based upon the IEC standard 60079 - 19, " the writing of specific procedures for some types of equipment, • the definition of an organisation scheme in order to ensure quality and traceability, • the development of a procedure for the assessment of the workshop and concerned persons, » the development of certification procedures, • the installation of committees with users, repairers and INERIS to ensure the certification transparency. The whole is contained in the certification document Saqr-ATEX which has been registered with the French Ministry of Industry in accordance with the law related to the voluntary certification of products and services. For the time being, about 15 repairer workshops are interested by this quality certification and 4 of them will be certified in October 2001...|$|R

Mine accidents were considered inevitable, and mine safety did not appreciably improve the situation because of lax enforcement.

One of the important operations in <b>mines</b> which were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> human error, is blasting operations. The aim of this study is identification and assessment of human errors in blasting operations in iron ore mine. Methods : Current Study is a qualitative research study in order to identify and assessment human error in a mine blasting operations. With direct observation of activities and documents, sub tasks were selected and analyzed by hierarchical analysis Job (HTA). The results were presented in the form of HTA charts. Types of possible human errors were detected and by using the SHERPA technique were surveyed. Appropriate prevention solutions were then proposed for reducing the risk of errors. Results : The results showed, from total of 42 identified errors, predicted the unacceptable risks are 0. 11, adverse risks are 0. 42, acceptable risks with revision are 0. 4 and accepted without revision are 0. 04. Moreover, percentage types of human errors were included practical errors (0. 55) and recovery errors (0. 14), checking error (0. 21), selection errors (0. 6) and communication errors (0. 016). Conclusion : The highest percentage of errors is practical and the lowest percentage of errors is of communication error. To reduce the occurrence of any identified error and limiting the consequences of their, appropriate control measures in the design of checklist, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, the use of systems Tag Out- Lock Out, efficient education laws and guidelines are effective...|$|R

The organisms included 217 Bacteroides fragilis group strains, 137 non-B. fragilis group Bacteroides spp., and 40 fusobacteria. All strains were <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem.

All agents showed excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (for trospectomycin, 95 % were susceptible; for all other drugs, 100 % were susceptible). Overall, both carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were most active. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and cefoperazone-sulbactam lacked activity against some cefoxitin-resistant B. fragilis group strains but had excellent activity against other organisms. Tosufloxacin, a new quinolone, had very good activity against B. fragilis group strains (94 % susceptible), good activity against other beta-lactamase-positive strains (less than or equal 85 % susceptible), and excellent activity against beta-lactamase-negative strains (100 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 0. 5 microgram/ml). Trospectomycin was active against > 90 % of all strains except for B. fragilis group strains (88 % susceptible; MIC for 90 % of strains, 32 microgram/ml).

Organisms were isolated from specimens obtained from outpatients in six geographic regions of the United States.

40|$|Spontaneous heating of coal is a {{major problem}} {{worldwide}} and has been a great concern due to its potential to destroy precious coal resources and cause fire accidents in coal mines. Majority of fires occurring in different coalfields are started by spontaneous combustion of coal. The auto oxidation of coal gives rise to spontaneous combustion which is the major root cause for the disastrous fire in coal mines. So, extensive research work is being done to characterize the nature and causes of spontaneous heating to prevent its occurrence. Since, coal is a sedimentary rock its properties vary widely from place to place. So, coal samples from individual seams need to be tested discretely to determine liability towards spontaneous heating. In this project, different properties of coal obtained from coal mines under Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) have been evaluated based on: proximate and ultimate analysis, calorific value, FT-IR spectroscopy and DTA. The data obtained was used to compare characteristics of different seams with respect to their tendency towards spontaneous heating susceptibility. From the experimental investigations, it was found that, in general the CCL coals have high ash content, low in moisture (below 2 %), and have higher calorific value. The CHNS analysis showed that the sulphur content of the coals is less than 1 % in all the cases. Among organic compounds alkane was found to be the most abundant functional group. The transition temperature was highest at 213. 28 C for seam 2 of Sarubera and was found to be 153. 09 C at its lowest value for seam 8 of Pindra open cast.
