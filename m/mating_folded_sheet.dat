40|$|Abstract. In this work, the {{mechanical}} properties of randomly <b>folded</b> thin <b>sheets</b> in the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic stress states were studied. It is {{pointed out that}} under the hydrostatic compression the sheet, rigidity is governed by the volume dependence of its enthalpy, whereas in a non-hydrostatic stress state, the rigidity of <b>folded</b> <b>sheets</b> {{is controlled by the}} shape dependence of the Edwards entropy of the network of crumpling creases. Furthermore, the stress relaxation in <b>folded</b> <b>sheets</b> after uni-axial compression was studied. It was found that stress relaxation in <b>folded</b> elasto-plastic <b>sheets</b> differs from this in the <b>folded</b> predominantly plastic <b>sheets</b> and obeys an unusual relaxation law with the universal characteristic exponent...|$|R
