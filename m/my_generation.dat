Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our dreams were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.|$|E

His funeral drew thousands, which {{turned into a}} mass demonstration of national unity. The Palestinian fedayeen who emerged in the 1960s saw al-Qassam as their originator. The founders of the Palestinian nationalist armed movement Fatah had initially considered naming their group the [...] "Qassamiyun".

500|$|During the {{production}} of THX 1138 (1971), producer Francis Ford Coppola challenged co-writer/director George Lucas to write a script that would appeal to mainstream audiences.

[...] "Cruising was gone, and I felt compelled to document the whole experience and what <b>my</b> <b>generation</b> used {{as a way of}} meeting girls," [...] Lucas explained. As he developed the story in his mind, Lucas included his fascination with Wolfman Jack. Lucas had considered doing a documentary about the Wolfman when he attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts, but dropped the idea.|$|E
500|$|At French {{television}} show Taratata Gaga appeared while {{hanging out of}} the window of her limousine. She later went on the show to perform [...] "Hair", but changed her outfit once more. The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future.

500|$|After <b>My</b> <b>Generation,</b> the Who {{fell out}} with Talmy, which meant {{an abrupt end}} to their {{recording}} contract. [...] The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding {{the rights to the}} master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002. The Who were signed to Robert Stigwood's label, Reaction, and released [...] "Substitute". Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of the Rolling Stones's [...] "19th Nervous Breakdown". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic twelve-string guitar. Talmy took legal action over the B-side, [...] "Instant Party", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, [...] "Waltz for a Pig", was recorded by the Graham Bond Organisation under the pseudonym [...] "the Who Orchestra".|$|E
500|$|... "Teen Spirit" [...] {{is widely}} {{interpreted}} to be a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation {{reinforced by the}} song's music video. In an interview conducted the day Nevermind was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, [...] "We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults [...] It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme." [...] As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the song's meaning. When discussing the song in Michael Azerrad's biography , Cobain revealed that he felt a duty [...] "to describe what I felt about my surroundings and <b>my</b> <b>generation</b> and people my age." ...|$|E
500|$|The next single, [...] "My Generation", {{followed}} in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it {{was turned into}} a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal stutter to simulate the speech of a mod on amphetamines, and two key changes. Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics [...] "Hope I die before I get old" [...] were not meant to be taken literally. Peaking at No.2, [...] "My Generation" [...] is the group's highest-charting single in the UK. The début album <b>My</b> <b>Generation</b> was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and [...] "The Kids Are Alright", the album has several James Brown covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.|$|E

Moon also co-composed [...] "The Ox" [...] (an instrumental from their debut album, <b>My</b> <b>Generation)</b> with Townshend, Entwistle and keyboardist Nicky Hopkins. The setting for [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp" [...] (from Tommy) was credited to Moon; {{the song was}} primarily written by Townshend and, {{although there is a}} misconception that Moon sings on it, the album version is Townshend's demo.|$|E

She stated that her biggest influence as a teenager was her teacher Bud Brown, whose lectures about the Civil Rights Movement, poverty, the free press, and anti-semitism in Europe [...] "absolutely inflamed" [...] her and changed her life. Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948. She stopped acting in college because her father refused to support her in that career. She chose Education, {{even though she was}} not interested in becoming a teacher, on the recommendation of her mother and because as she later stated, [...] "It was something that girls of <b>my</b> <b>generation</b> did because teaching was acceptable".|$|E
500|$|During {{a repeat}} of the {{previous}} year's final on 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties after a 0–0 deadlock, resulting in Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. After the match, Messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. Sources reported that other Argentine players – Sergio Agüero, Javier Mascherano, Gonzalo Higuaín, Lucas Biglia, Éver Banega, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Ángel Di María – could follow their captain in retiring from international football. Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, [...] "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for <b>my</b> <b>generation,</b> because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But I think the best player ever played today here in the United States." [...] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for people of <b>my</b> <b>generation,</b> and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{especially}} appreciated by filmmakers and film critics {{associated with the}} French New Wave movement. André Bazin said [...] "as a conventional love story, the film {{could have been a}} success if the scenario had respected the rules of the movie game. But Renoir wanted to make his own style of drame gai, and the mixture of genres proved disconcerting to the public." [...] Film critic Claude Beylie called it [...] "the cornerstone of the work of Jean Renoir, the point of arrival and the swan song of the French cinema of the thirties...The Rules of the Game is a rare combination of satire, vaudeville and tragedy." [...] It was a major source of inspiration for Alain Resnais, who said seeing the film was [...] "the single most overwhelming experience I have ever had at the cinema";and [...] Louis Malle, who said [...] "for all of us, <b>my</b> <b>generation</b> of French filmmakers, La Regle du jeu was the absolute masterpiece." [...] François Truffaut articulated the film's enormous influence and said [...] "it isn't an accident that The Rules of the Game inspired a large number of young people who had first thought of expressing themselves as novelists to take up careers as filmmakers." [...] He also said [...] "It is the credo of movie lovers, the film of films, the film most hated when it was made and most appreciated afterwards, {{to the extent that it}} ultimately became a true commercial success." ...|$|E
500|$|Mickiewicz's {{importance}} {{extends beyond}} literature {{to the broader}} spheres of culture and politics; Wyka writes {{that he was a}} [...] "singer and epic poet of the Polish people, and a pilgrim for the freedom of nations." [...] Scholars have used the expression [...] "cult of Mickiewicz" [...] to describe the reverence in which he is held as a [...] "national prophet." [...] On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: [...] "For men of <b>my</b> <b>generation,</b> he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world." [...] Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz's works as Promethean, as [...] "reaching more Polish hearts" [...] than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as [...] "healthier" [...] than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has [...] "informed the foundations of [...] parties and ideologies" [...] in Poland from the 19th century to this day, [...] "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'" [...] While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among [...] "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires." ...|$|E
