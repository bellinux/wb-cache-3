Some of the adjustments made was the adoption of AI and Embryo Transfer. Today the breed's original characteristics are now back in demand.

5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|As {{the home}} country of {{beetroot}} borscht, Ukraine boasts great {{diversity of the}} soup's regional variants, with virtually every province having its own recipe. Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used (meat, bone, or both), the kind of meat (beef, pork, poultry, etc.), the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them. For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry <b>meat,</b> <b>that</b> is, chicken, duck or goose. The use of zucchini, beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht; in this variant, beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples. The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages.|$|E

25|$|Bushmeat {{has also}} been implicated in {{spreading}} Ebola disease, either by handling the raw meat or through droppings from the animals. It is the raw blood and <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> {{is thought to be}} more dangerous, so it is those that hunt and butcher the raw <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> are more at risk as opposed to cooked meat sold at market. Health care workers in Sierra Leone have been warned not to go to markets.|$|E
25|$|Islamic Law and Judaism have dietary {{guidelines}} called Halal and Kashrut, respectively. In Judaism, <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> may {{be consumed}} according to halakha (Jewish law) is termed kosher; <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> is not compliant with Jewish law is called treif. Causing unnecessary pain to animals is prohibited by {{the principle of}} tza'ar ba'alei chayim. While it is neither required nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Judaism, such as Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama, regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal.|$|E
25|$|In 1668, Italian {{physician}} Francesco Redi disproved {{the theory}} of spontaneous generation. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that maggots developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, he used samples of rotting <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly maggots, whereas rotting <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the way people viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.|$|E

25|$|Holishkes, stuffed cabbage, {{also known}} as the cabbage roll, is also a European Jewish dish that emerged from more impoverished times for Jews.

This gave the effect of more <b>meat</b> <b>that</b> was stuffed into the cabbage leaves.|$|E

Several Canadian athletes received permission to do the same. The United States Olympic Committee's plan to bring its own food to China disappointed the leader of food services for the Beijing Olympics.|$|E
5000|$|Heterocyclic amines are a {{group of}} {{chemical}} compounds, many {{of which can be}} formed during cooking. They are found in <b>meats</b> <b>that</b> are cooked to the [...] "well done" [...] stage, in pan drippings and in <b>meat</b> surfaces <b>that</b> show a brown or black crust. Epidemiological studies show associations between intakes of heterocyclic amines and cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, prostate, pancreas, lung, stomach/esophagus and animal feeding experiments support a causal relationship. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service labeled several heterocyclic amines as likely carcinogens in its 13th Report on Carcinogens. Changes in cooking techniques reduce the level of heterocyclic amines.|$|R
