Although {{it was the first}} practical way to transmit signals over the horizon, its major drawback was soon realized. Because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the Earth's rotational period of 24 hours, continuous coverage was impossible. It was apparent that multiple MEOs needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.|$|E

The <b>medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> orbits at 8062 km and uses the Ka band. It has a latency of about 100 milliseconds because it is much closer to Earth than standard geostationary satellites, whose latencies can be over 600 milliseconds.

40|$|Ever {{since the}} U. S. Federal Communication Commission opened the {{discussion}} on spectrum usage for personal handheld communication, {{the community of}} satellite manufacturers has been searching for an economically viable and technically feasible satellite mobile communication system. Hughes Aircraft Company and others have joined in providing proposals for such systems, ranging from low to medium to geosynchronous orbits. These proposals {{make it clear that}} the trend in mobile satellite communication is toward more sophisticated satellites with a large number of spot beams and onboard processing, providing worldwide interconnectivity. Recent Hughes studies indicate that from a cost standpoint the geosynchronous satellite (GEOS) is most economical, followed by the <b>medium</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> (MEOS) and then by the low earth orbit satellite (LEOS). From a system performance standpoint, this evaluation may be in reverse order, depending on how the public will react to speech delay and collision.

An operational requirement has been established for the provision of video services that can swiftly distribute high-quality video from within the fleet to anywhere in the world with short notice. Such a capability requires rapidly deployable, high-throughput, low-latency satellite communications. Modern satellite constellations can enable this capability acting as a high-speed telecommunications portal. This research evaluated an integrated, satellite-enabled, high definition portable video processing solution constructed from commercially available components. This solution can be used to deliver ultra high definition (UHD) video from forward-deployed units in a wide variety of use cases and applications.

40|$|The ground {{monitoring}} {{stations of}} BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) are regional distribution {{and the number}} of these stations is small. The more global ground stations cannot be built in the short term. The ground regional monitoring stations are difficult to observe the global <b>Medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Satellite</b> (MEO) continuously, which leads to low precision of orbits in BDS real-time broadcast ephemeris. Based on the above problems, in view of real time satellite GNSS data of low earth orbit satellite can effectively make up the lack of regional monitoring stations in space overlay, a method is proposed that the GNSS receivers of LEO satellites used as high dynamic space-based monitoring stations combining with the data of the ground monitoring stations to calculate and forecast the MEO satellite orbits. The numeral results show that, using the data of seven regional monitoring stations add 1 to 3 LEO satellites, the precision of the MEO orbit determination can be increased by about 21 %, 34 % and 55 % respectively. It also shows that, the ground regional monitoring stations combined with the data of LEO satellites can effectively improve the orbit precision of MEO satellite.

40|$|Abstract: Since {{the launch}} of COMPASS-M 1 {{satellite}} (the first <b>medium</b> <b>earth</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>satellite</b> of the COMPASS constellation) in 2007, there has been increased attention paid to the emerging Chinese Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Based on the recent released design of the constellation and the signal structure, the satellite visibility and Position Dilution of Procession (PDOP) performance can be analysed. However, desspite {{the fact that the}} signal transmission delay can be estimated using GPS and GLONASS data, there are other unmodelled errors in the error budget, such as the satellite clock error and the orbit error. An analysis of the absolute positioning precision of COMPASS can not truly indicate the performance of the future system in a realistic manner. It is well known that the double-differenced observation model can be used to eliminate the satellite and receiver clock error and hardware-related delays. In addition, the satellite orbit error and the atmospheric delays can also be mitigated. Hence, the precision of relative positioning can be analysed {{in the case of a}} short baseline. In this paper, the COMPASS system is simulated assuming that the measurement noise of COMPASS is similar to that of GPS. As is well known in relative positioning, ambiguity resolution is the key to achieving high accuracy results. Using the Ambiguity Dilution of Precision (ADOP) factor, the ambiguity success rate is analysed and the expected precision of the ambiguity-fixed solution is calculated...|$|E

40|$|Two-way time {{transfer}} {{is one of}} the most accurate time synchronization methods applied to spacecrafts and ground stations to carry out time transfer. As this method doesn’t require the knowledge of locations of two satellites in advance and it offsets the negative influence of transmission path and other additional delays, this method has boosted the time synchronization accuracy. However, in the process of time synchronization, this method demands that the aircrafts, who conduct time synchronization, could be relatively static. So it is mainly used in GEO satellites for satellite-ground two-way time transfer. Based on the establishment of mobile satellite mutual visual model, the simulation of satellite mutual visual time on mobile satellite, including IGSO (Inclined Geo Synchronous Orbit) satellite and MEO (<b>Medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit)</b> <b>satellite,</b> has been conducted. The visual time and the variation range of IGSO-MEO link distance have been gained. The characteristics of the propagation delay of two-way time transfer signals between IGSO satellite and MEO satellite varying with inter satellite range were analyzed and the rule of inter satellite clock offset varying with inter satellite range obtained with this algorithm was deduced. This study presents a inter satellite dynamic two-way time transfer algorithm based on mobile satellite. The high-accuracy inter satellite clock offset is solved through the combination of inter satellite pseudo-range polynomial fitting and clock-offset polynomial fitting. Simulation results showed that with the algorithm the inter satellite time transfer error can be controlled within 1 ns. The algorithm can be used high-accuracy time transfer between mobile satellites...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{feasibility}} of per-forming Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), in earth-satellite up and downlinks and in intersatellite links, with two quantum cryptography protocols: BB 84 and SARG 04, and with two implementation options: with and without decoy states. As real measurements in these scenarios are not possible yet, {{the objective is to}} obtain results as realistic as possible to support the design of future satellite missions performing QKD. Therefore, we use realistic values for the optical hardware and take into account usual atmospheric conditions. In the same line, we assume specic types of attacks, namely the photon number splitting and the intercept-resend with unambiguous discrimination attacks, which could likely be the main threat to the rst satellite-based QKD applications. A lower bound on the key generation rate of SARG 04 with two decoy states is presented. The optimum signal- and decoy-states mean photon numbers for each protocol and each distance are also computed. The resulting values for the signal-state are larger than those often employed. We show that {{it may be possible to}} establish QKD with LEO (Low <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit)</b> and, under certain circumstances, with MEO (<b>Medium</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Orbit)</b> <b>satellites,</b> but not with GEO (Geostationary) ones.
