50|$|The hamon {{outlines}} the transition between {{the region of}} harder <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel</b> at the blade's edge and the softer pearlitic steel at the center and back of the sword. This difference in hardness is {{the objective of the}} process; the appearance is purely a side effect. However, the aesthetic qualities of the hamon are quite valuable—not only as proof of the differential-hardening treatment but also in its artistic value—and the patterns can be quite complex.|$|E
50|$|Untempered <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel,</b> while very hard, is too brittle to {{be useful}} for most applications. A method for {{alleviating}} this problem is called tempering. Most applications require that quenched parts be tempered. Tempering consists of heating steel below the lower critical temperature, (often from 400 to 1105 ˚F or 205 to 595 ˚C, depending on the desired results), to impart some toughness. Higher tempering temperatures (may be up to 1,300 ˚F or 700 ˚C, depending on the alloy and application) are sometimes used to impart further ductility, although some yield strength is lost.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermal {{cycles of}} {{conventional}} galvanizing and galvannealing processes {{were applied to}} low carbon <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> to examine the mechanical property of <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> after their processing in conventional Continuous Galvanizing Lines (CGL). During the thermal cycle simulation, tempering phenomena occurred resulting in changes of microstructure and mechanical properties. In this study, the tensile deformation behavior of <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> was studied in detail {{in order to understand}} the tempering phenomena occurring during their processing. It was found that, after tempering, the strain hardening ability decreased drastically and that the plastic flow became localized. An experimental analysis of this phenomenon will be presented based on TEM microstructural observation and Internal Friction measurements...|$|R
40|$|<b>Martensitic</b> {{stainless}} <b>steels</b> {{are commonly}} used for fabricating components. For many applications, an increase in surface hardness and wear resistance can be beneficial to improve performance and extend service life. However, the improvement in hardness of <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> is usually accompanied by a reduction in corrosion strength. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of nitriding on AISI 420 <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> in terms of microstructure and corrosion propagation behavior. The results indicate that the microstructure and phase composition as well as corrosion resistance were influenced by nitriding temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper was to analyze the surface roughness produced by turning process on hard <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> by Cubic Boron Nitride cutting tool. The work piece material was hard AISI 440 C <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were designed using various operating parameters like cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. These operating parameters are predominantly used in carrying out the experiments. Findings: Low surface roughness was produced at cutting speed of 225 m/min with feed rate of 0. 125 mm/rev and 0. 50 mm depth of cut (doc). However, moderate cutting speed of 175 m/min under above feed rate and doc is an ideal operating parameters taking flank wear in to account. Research limitations/implications: While searching for references in turning of <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> very limited journals are available, but very few literatures are available on turning of AISI 440 C hard <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> which was a constraint. Practical implications: The turning of hard <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> brings interesting information on surface roughness, tool wear etc. and further can be extended to turn with different cutting tools. Originality/value: The value of the research work lies in using the results by other researches. The result will upgrade the knowledge about the influence parameters on surface roughness especially on <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steel</b> especially on <b>martensitic</b> stainless <b>steels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Steel {{targets are}} targets for {{firearms}} {{made out of}} hardened (<b>martensitic)</b> <b>steel,</b> and are used in sports such as cowboy action shooting, practical/dynamic shooting and for long range shooting, as well as recreational plinking. They are popular in both training and competitions because the shooter gets instant feedback on a hit {{in the form of}} sound, and one can also often see the bullet getting pulverized and the target moving. Hanging or self-reseting targets also have the advantage that the shooter doesn't have to go forward to tape the targets, making it a good option for shooting ranges that otherwise have electronic targets. Steel targets also are weather proof, contrary to paper targets that may not hold up when wet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel</b> {{which forms}} {{from the edge}} of the blade to the hamon is in effect the {{transition}} line between these two different forms of steel, and is where most of the shapes, colours and beauty in the steel of the Japanese sword are to be found. The variations in the form and structure of the hamon are all indicative of the period, smith, school or place of manufacture of the sword. As well as the aesthetic qualities of the hamon, there are, perhaps not unsurprisingly, real practical functions. The hardened edge is where most of any potential damage to the blade will occur in battle. This hardened edge is capable of being reground and sharpened many times, although the process will alter the shape of the blade. Altering the shape will allow more resistance when fighting in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (graphitizing agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel</b> is more common for this application).|$|E
50|$|Bainite is an {{intermediate}} of pearlite and martensite {{in terms of}} hardness. For this reason, the bainitic microstructure becomes useful in that no additional heat treatments are required after initial cooling to achieve a hardness value between that of pearlitic and <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{deformation}} strains and annealing temperatures on microstructures and mechanical properties of <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> were examined. The amount of cold deformation was changed as 30 %, 50 % and 60 %, and annealing temperatures varied from 500 °C to 600 °C. In samples cold rolled 30 %, the dominant microstructure for an annealing at 500 °C was dislocation substructures with uniformly distributed rod-shaped carbide particles. For an annealing at 600 °C, the microstructure consisted of equiaxed ultrafine grains, spherical carbide particles and elongated dislocation substructures.

40|$|The steam {{oxidation}} {{behavior of}} inner tube surfaces in the as-manufactured condition for selected <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> and nickel-based alloys was {{compared with that}} of standard laboratory test coupons that were ground to a 600 grit surface finish prior to the steam exposure. Exposures up to 10, 000 h in the temperature range of 550 °C to 700 °C revealed that the as-delivered inner tube surfaces may exhibit substantial internal oxidation {{as a result of the}} (solution) heat treatment in the final stages of the manufacturing process. The internal oxides contained mainly chromia in the <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels</b> and alumina and/or titania in the nickel-based alloys. For the latter materials, the internal oxidation, especially of Ti, caused the steam-grown external chromia scales to be generally thinner than those observed on the specimens that were ground prior to oxidation testing. For the <b>martensitic</b> <b>steels,</b> the internal oxidation modified the incorporation of Cr (Mn, Si) into the surface scales, thus suppressing the formation of protective chromia-based surface scales. For all studied materials, the internal oxidation present in the as-received condition may affect the steam oxidation behavior at temperatures in the range of 550 °C to 700 °C up to 10, 000 h exposure time...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{corrosion}} {{performance of}} nanostructured bainitic steel was compared with <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel</b> in chloride-containing solution using electrochemical techniques.

Potentiodynamic polarization results showed an 85 % lower corrosion current density for nanostructured bainitic steel compared to <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel.</b> Galvanostatically polarized <b>martensitic</b> <b>steel</b> revealed high localized corrosion i. e., intergranular corrosion (IGC) as well as localized attack in the grains. However, the nanostructured bainitic steel when polarized galvanostatically exhibited only a marginal selective dissolution of retained austenite.
