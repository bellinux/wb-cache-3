5000|$|The {{circulation}} {{of money is}} first initiated by the transformation of a commodity into money. The commodity is taken from its natural state and transformed into its monetary state. When this happens the commodity [...] "falls out of circulation into consumption." [...] The previous commodity now in its monetary form replaces a new and different commodity continuing the {{circulation of}} money. In this process, money is the means for the movement and circulation of commodities. Money assumes the measure of value of a commodity, i.e. the socially necessary labor-time. The repetition of this process constantly removes commodities from their starting places, taking {{them out of the}} sphere of circulation. Money circulates in the sphere and fluctuates with the sum of all the commodities that co-exist within the sphere. The price of commodities varies by three factors: [...] "the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices,</b> the quantity of commodities in circulation, and the velocity of circulation of money." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to analyze certain intertemporal aspects of the <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> in the world market in a general {{equilibrium}} framework. A model of a competitive economy consisting of several "small" countries engaged in consumption, production and trade is developed here. The intertemporal allocation decisions are derived from solving dynamic optimization involving a constrained maximization of a discounted sum of one period utilities from consumption over an infinite horizon. Following Hicks, one way to look at the evolution of an economic system is to view it as a succession of temporary or short-run competitive equilibria. The main focus of the paper is in providing the existence of temporary equilibrium. A set of sufficient conditions are provided for the equilibrium to be unique and stationary. ...|$|E

The results suggest that market leadership volatility has a definite influence on domestic price change, providing empirical support for its effect of a downward <b>movement</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices.</b> But, it is necessary to note that its effect is not strong enough to offset the concentration’s effect, since concentration still is positively related to price change. Also, import intensity has a negative association with price change. Distribution involvement has a positive effect. Thus, market leadership volatility is important as a determinant of market behavior from the viewpoint of competition policy as well as business strategy.

The experimental results on nine shares from Shanghai Stock Exchange in China show that both SVM and RF are effective for the trend prediction, and SVM performs better than RF. In addition, SVM seems to be unaffected by the correlation and redundant features and it turns better for the most shares when more features are used for modeling.

40|$|The use {{of chain}} indices is {{recognized}} as representing a superior method for measuring the volume growth of National accounts aggregates, especially in periods of structural change and rapid <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>prices.</b> So, if {{the objective is to}} measure the actual <b>movements</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and volumes from period to period (e. g. from t- 1 and t), indices should be compiled between consecutive time periods. Changes in prices and volumes between periods that are separated in time are then obtained by cumulating the short-term variations or, in other words, by linking the indices between consecutive periods, to form “chain indices”. In the context of the revision of the GDP estimates, carried out for the 2000 National accounts benchmark, the chain indices have been adopted to deflate National accounts aggregates.
