Factors that should prompt consideration of preventive therapy include the occurrence {{of two or more}} migraines per month with disability lasting three or more days per month; failure of, contraindication for, or adverse events from acute treatments; use of abortive medication more than twice per week; and uncommon migraine conditions (e.g., hemiplegic migraine, <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> <b>prolonged</b> <b>aura,</b> migrainous infarction). Patient preference and cost also should be considered....Therapy should be initiated with medications that have the highest levels of effectiveness and the lowest potential for adverse reactions; these should be started at low dosages and titrated slowly. A full therapeutic trial may take two to six months. After successful therapy (e.g., reduction of migraine frequency by approximately 50 percent or more) has been maintained for six to 12 months, discontinuation of preventive therapy can be considered.|$|E

The EEG abnormalities were non-epileptiform and consisted of focal delta slow waves or theta slow waves. The EEG abnormalities showed good correlation with the patients' aura symptoms and resolved when the patients became symptom free. The posterior-to-anterior sequence of the aura symptoms is in accord with the findings during cerebral blood flow studies in patients having migraine with aura.

40|$|Background and Purpose—Previous 31 P–magnetic {{resonance}} spectroscopy (31 P-MRS) {{studies have}} shown that cerebral cortical energy metabolism is abnormal in migraine and that cortical energy reserves decrease with increasing severity and duration of aura. Migrainous infarction is a rare complication of <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura, and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We used 31 P-MRS to determine whether migrainous stroke shows similar interictal abnormalities in cortical energy metabolism as severe, <b>prolonged</b> <b>aura.</b> Methods—We used 31 P-MRS to study patients with a diagnosis of either migrainous infarction or <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> persistent aura without infarction (aura duration 7 days) according to International Headache Society criteria. We compared clinical presentation and metabolite ratios between patient groups. We also studied healthy controls with no history of <b>migraine.</b> Results—Patients <b>with</b> persistent aura without infarction had lower phosphocreatine-phosphate (PCr/Pi) ratios (meanSD, 1. 610. 10) compared with controls (1. 940. 35, P 0. 011) and with patients with migrainous stroke (1. 960. 16, P 0. 0001). These differences were present in cortical tissue only. In migrainous stroke patients, the metabolite ratios did not differ significantly from those of controls without migraine. Conclusions—The differences in cortical energy reserves between patients with migrainous stroke and in those <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> persistent aura suggest that the pathomechanisms of these conditions differ and that migrainous infarction does not simply represent a particularly severe form of migrainous aura.

40|$|Objective: To {{summarize}} {{and evaluate}} proton (H- 1) and phosphorus (P- 31) {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) findings in migraine. Methods: A thorough review of H- 1 and/or P- 31 -MRS studies in any form of migraine published up to September 2011. Results: Some findings were consistent in all studies, such {{as a lack of}} ictal/interictal brain pH change and a disturbed energy metabolism, the latter of which is reflected in a drop in phosphocreatine content, both in the resting brain and in muscle following exercise. In a recent interictal study ATP was found to be significantly decreased in the occipital lobe of migraine with aura patients, reinforcing the concept of a mitochondrial component to the migraine threshold, at least in a subgroup of patients. In several studies a correlation between the extent of the energy disturbance and the clinical phenotype severity was apparent. Less consistent but still congruent with a disturbed energy metabolism is an observed lactate increase in the occipital cortex of several migraine subtypes (MwA, <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> <b>prolonged</b> <b>aura).</b> No increases in brain glutamate levels were found. Conclusion: The combined abnormalities found in MRS studies imply a mitochondrial component in migraine neurobiology. This could be due to a primary mitochondrial dysfunction or be secondary to, for example, alterations in brain excitability. The extent of variation in the data can be attributed to both the variable clinical inclusion criteria used and the variation in applied methodology. Therefore it is necessary to continue to optimize MRS methodology to gain further insights, especially concerning lactate and glutamate...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{search for}} {{impairment}} of neuromuscular transmission by single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) {{in patients with}} common forms of migraine. BACKGROUND: P/Q Ca(2 +) channels are genetically abnormal in most cases of familial hemiplegic migraine (International Headache Society [IHS] code 1. 2. 3) and {{may be involved in}} other types of migraine. Besides in the brain, these channels are found in motor nerve endings, where they control stimulation-induced acetylcholine release. If they are functionally abnormal, the neuromuscular transmission might be impaired. METHODS: Sixty-two migraineurs (18 without aura, IHS code 1. 1; 19 with typical aura, IHS code 1. 2. 1; 10 with prolonged aura, IHS code 1. 2. 2; 15 with and without aura) and 16 healthy control subjects underwent stimulation SFEMG. Results were expressed as the mean value of consecutive differences (MCD) and percentage of single-fiber abnormalities (abnormal jitter or impulse blocking). RESULTS: Average MCD was comparable in control subjects and migraineurs (17. 1 +/- 2. 6 versus 17. 5 +/- 4. 7 microsec). By contrast, single-fiber abnormalities were found in 17 patients but in none of the control subjects (p = 0. 036). Most of these patients had unilateral sensorimotor symptoms and/or aphasia and/or loss of balance during the aura. SFEMG abnormalities were significantly correlated with the occurrence of these clinical features and with a diagnosis of <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> <b>prolonged</b> <b>aura.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation SFEMG shows mild abnormalities of neuromuscular transmission in a subgroup of migraineurs with aura, characterized by clinical features frequently found in human P/Q Ca(2 +) channelopathies. These abnormalities might thus be due to genetically modified P/Q Ca(2 +) channels. Peer reviewe...|$|E

All interviews of first degree relatives and spouses were done blindly by a neurological resident. The operational diagnostic criteria of the International Headache Society were used.

50|$|<b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> {{brainstem}} aura (abbreviated MBA) (previously used terms: basilar artery migraine; basilar migraine; basilar-type migraine) is a subtype of <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura {{in which}} symptoms clearly originate from the brainstem, but no motor weakness. When motor symptoms are present, the subtype is coded as 1.2.3 Hemiplegic migraine. Originally the terms basilar artery migraine or basilar migraine were used but, since {{involvement of the}} basilar artery is unlikely, the term <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> brainstem aura is preferred in ICHD-3 beta. There are typical aura symptoms {{in addition to the}} brainstem symptoms during most attacks. Many patients who have attacks with brainstem aura also report other attacks with typical aura and should be coded for both 1.2.1 <b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> typical aura and 1.2.2 <b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> brainstem aura. Many of the symptoms like dysarthria, vertigo, tinnitus, hypacusis, diplopia, ataxia and decreased level of consciousness may occur with anxiety and hyperventilation, and therefore are subject to misinterpretation.

Using triptans and other vasoconstrictors as abortive treatments for <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> brainstem aura is contraindicated.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To better {{define the}} {{involvement}} of human leukocyte antigen region (HLA) genes in migraine via an association study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) genes, located in the HLA class III region, <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> and without aura. BACKGROUND: Migraine without aura and <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura are disorders involving multiple factors-environmental and genetic. In a previous study, we hypothesized a protective role for the HLA-DR 2 antigen, providing additional basis for the proposed genetic heterogeneity between migraine without aura and <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura. The cytokines produced by TNF genes are polypeptide effectors of inflammatory reaction and endothelial function. METHODS: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - 308 (TNF- 308 A and TNF- 308 G alleles) and lymphotoxin alpha (TNFB* 1 and TNFB* 2 alleles) polymorphisms were analyzed by the NcoI-cleaved polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragments in 47 patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> without aura, 32 patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura, and 101 migraine-free controls. RESULTS: The frequency of TNFB* 2 allele was significantly increased in our patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> without aura {{as compared with the}} control group (78. 72 % versus 61. 4 %, Pc =. 004), but {{no significant differences were found}} between patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura and controls. Additionally, there was a significant decrease of TNFB* 1 homozygotes in patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> without aura compared with the control group (2. 13 % versus 16. 8 %, Pc =. 0201). Carriage of the TNFB* 2 allele confers a high risk for the development of migraine without aura. No significant association was found at TNF- 308 polymorphism. CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that lymphotoxin alpha could be a susceptibility gene in migraine without aura and confirm previous data indicating that <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> and without aura are distinct entities with different genetic backgrounds...|$|R

In animal models, similar cells are known to be selectively vulnerable to damage as a result of hypoxic conditions. Evidence consistent with our hypothesis is provided by recent studies of visual function in migraine. Some clinical and pathophysiological implications of this hypothesis are discussed. 0 <b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura, selective vulnerability, visual cortex, visual dysfunctio...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{fields were}} mapped with kinetic arc perimetry in 23 <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura {{subjects}} and, for comparison, in 20 {{migraine without aura}} subjects and in 21 non-headache controls. Central vision on the Amsler eye chart and visual perception threshold on a computer task were also investigated. Measures were obtained at least seven days after an episode of migraine. In addition, 10 of the <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura subjects and 10 migraine without aura subjects were studied the day after an attack. The day after <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura, visual sensitivity in {{the periphery of the}} visual fields was depressed, central vision was blurred, and visual perception threshold was elevated. These visual disturbances had resolved 7 to 10 days later. With the exception of a minor increase in visual perception threshold, vision was normal after attacks of migraine without aura. Residual effects of the migraine aura could mediate the subclinical visual disturbances which persist for at least one day after attacks of <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of patent foramen ovale (PFO) is higher among adult migraine patients. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the frequency of PFO in children and adolescent migraine patients. Methods and results: A total of 32 patients <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> (divided into two subgroups, the <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura subgroup and the migraine without aura subgroup) and 31 normal control subjects were enrolled in this study. All of the partici-pants underwent transthoracic echocardiography with an agitated saline test. We compared the {{prevalence of}} PFO and the severity of right-to-left shunt (RLS) in each group. No statistical difference in age and sex ratio was observed in either group. The prevalence of PFO was higher in the migraine group than in the control group, but without statistical significance (46. 9 % vs. 25. 8 %, p 0. 084). The prevalence of PFO was significantly higher in the <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura subgroup than in the migraine without aura subgroup (p 0. 031) and the normal control group (p 0. 0074). <b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura was the only significant factor showing an association with PFO (< 0. 01). RLS size did not have an influence on migraine. Conclusions: Considering the significantly high prevalence of PFO in pediatric <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura patients, <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura is a clear predictor of PFO among children and adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-six {{patients}} {{suffering from}} <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura and without aura were examined using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) during the intercritical phase. The mean amplitude of the prerolandic component was significantly reduced in <b>migraine</b> patients <b>with</b> and without aura {{on the right}} hemisphere; the ratio between the parietal N 20 /P 25 and the prerolandic P 22 /N 30 was significantly enhanced in migraine groups over {{the left and the}} right hemisphere. A significant interside asymmetry of the N 30 amplitude was observed in the <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura group in comparison with control subjects. The occurrence of SEP abnormalities was not correlated with the age of the patients, with illness duration or with the frequency of migraine attacks. SEP abnormalities observed in <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> and without aura may have an underlying primary neural disorder probably based on a chronic dopaminergic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura {{triggered}} by cardiac myxoma: Case report and literature review Laura de Ceuster, Ton van Diepen and Peter J Koehler We present a new case of cardiac myxoma triggering migraine auras. A 52 -year-old woman {{was suffering from}} <b>migraine</b> attacks <b>with</b> aura. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no abnormalities. Subsequently, she had a minor stroke with multiple ischaemic lesions bilaterally on repeat MRI. An echocardiogram showed a myxoma of the left atrial wall. After removal of the myxoma she was free of symptoms. In the past, seven cardiac myxoma associated migraine patients have been reported. Other cardiac abnormalities, patent foramen ovale in particular, {{are known to be}} associated <b>with</b> <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura. We attempted to compare the mechanisms by which cardiac myxoma and other cardiac abnormal-ities could trigger cortical spreading depression leading to <b>migraine</b> <b>with</b> aura...|$|R
