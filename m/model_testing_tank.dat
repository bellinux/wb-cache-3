40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the results of}} over 2000 experimental runs conduced at the MIT Ship <b>Model</b> <b>Testing</b> <b>Tank.</b> A rake of constant temperature anemometers is employed to study the spanwise velocity correlation and the vertical velocity profile downstream of a vibrating cylinder. Experiments involve either free vibration implemented through a force feedback system or forced sinusoidal motion. All experiments are conducted at a towing speed within the subcritical flow regime at Re ~ 3 x 104. This thesis explores the connection between these downstream velocity properties and the vortex-induced vibrations of the cylinder. In addition to downstream velocities, experimental data include lift and drag forces and cylinder displacement. Vortices {{are found to be}} correlated along {{the entire length of the}} test cylinder only within a specific band of motion amplitudes and frequencies. Overall, forced oscillations produce vortices that are more organized and well correlated than those shed from a freely vibrating cylinder. by Joshua Tolford Davis. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The mine {{tailings}} are generated as the wastes worldwide {{as a result}} of exploration, excavation, blasting, beneficiation and extraction of mineral ores. In Western Australia, due to the extensive mining activities and increasing low grade ores, there is generation of {{mine tailings}} in large quantities, which could lead to environmental and disposal problems. The common practice of handling the tailings are to store them in tailing dams or as stockpiles near mine sites. Limited quantities are sometimes used as backfills and other applications. The utilisation of tailings in building and construction projects, which may consume a large volume of wastes, have not been explored extensively so far. Additionally, the understanding of chemical composition-based utilisation of tailings has very limited investigation. In the present research, a critical review of the literature was made focusing on the utilisation of mine tailings in large quantities. Experiments have been conducted by developing a methodology to characterise the tailings based on the relationship that exists between electrical resistivity and the relative density of the tailings in dry and wet conditions. The results show that the electrical resistivity of iron ore mine tailings produced in Western Australia in dry condition ranges from 11 kΩm in a more dense state to 19 kΩm in a very loose state, while that in fully saturated condition ranges from 20 Ωm for a very dense state to 31 Ωm in a very loose state. The laboratory investigation has been conducted to utilise iron ore tailings to produce geopolymer bricks. The sized tailings were mixed with sodium silicate solution used as an activator to form a paste. The paste was moulded and cured for different durations. It was found that the geopolymer bricks produced from iron ore tailings could have a compressive strength as high as 50. 35 MPa. This is either superior or similar to international standard specifications for conventional bricks. Additionally, the new bricks will be more economical than conventional bricks with potential cost reduction of 36. 8 %. The research has also investigated the utilisation of iron ore mine tailings to replace conventional aggregates in concrete. 100 % of both fine and coarse conventional aggregates were replaced with tailings in the mixed design. The concrete mix was casted into moulds and cured. It was found that the compressive strength of the concrete with tailings aggregates at 28 days was 36. 95 MPa which shows an improvement of 11. 56 % over the concrete with conventional aggregates. Additionally, the new concrete met all other requirements for quality assessment of concrete. Finally, the research has conducted investigation into load-settlement behaviour of iron ore tailings to be considered as a structural fill material. The experiment was conducted in a <b>model</b> <b>test</b> <b>tank</b> in the laboratory varying the relative density of the tailings. It was found that the load-bearing capacity is 22 times higher, and the stiffness is 13. 5 times higher than their values for conventional fill materials...|$|R
40|$|NASA is {{currently}} investigating methods {{to reduce the}} boil-off rate on large cryogenic upper stages. Two such methods to reduce the total heat load on existing upper stages are vapor cooling of the cryogenic tank support structure and integration of thick multilayer insulation systems to the upper stage of a launch vehicle. Previous efforts have flown a 2 -layer MLI blanket and shown an improved thermal performance, and other efforts have ground-tested blankets up to 70 layers thick on tanks with diameters between 2 3 meters. However, thick multilayer insulation installation and testing in both thermal and structural modes has not been completed {{on a large scale}} tank. Similarly, multiple vapor cooled shields are common place on science payload helium dewars; however, minimal effort has gone into intercepting heat on large structural surfaces associated with rocket stages. A majority of the vapor cooling effort focuses on metallic cylinders called skirts, which are the most common structural components for launch vehicles.

40|$|The {{free surface}} bow flow around a fast and fine ship in calm water is studied with an {{emphasis}} on generation and evolution of the breaking and splashing bow wave using the 2 D ? t theory. A temporal domain-decomposition strategy is adopted which combines sequentially two Lagrangian methods: a potential-flow solution, given by a boundary element method (BEM), follows the jet evolution up to the breaking and then initiates a rotational solution, provided by a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. The latter describes the splashing and the evolution of rotational flow structures generated during the evolution. The compound method is very efficient and proved to be able to capture the breaking features. A validation has been performed through comparison with experimental data and other numerical solutions available in the literature. The DDG 51 vessel is used to carry on a parameter investigation in terms of the ship speed (Froude number) and surface tension.
