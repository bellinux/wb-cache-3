5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future <b>military</b> <b>policy</b> as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, warning that increasing passivity would affect {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Styer was deputy {{commander}} of the Construction Division in the Quartermaster Corps and later the Corps of Engineers. In March 1942, he became {{the chief of staff}} of the Services of Supply. He became deputy commanding general of the Army Service Forces in August 1943, as the Services of Supply was renamed. In this capacity he served on the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, which oversaw the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphee, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphee, Tolman, Cohen and Tolman estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945.|$|E
5|$|In September 1942, the {{director}} of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), Vannevar Bush, suggested Styer be appointed director of the Manhattan Project, but Somervell did not wish to lose his services, and engineered the appointment of Groves instead. On 23 September 1942, Styer {{became a member of the}} <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, a group chaired by Bush (with James B. Conant as his alternate) with Rear Admiral William R. Purnell as its third member. As director, Groves was answerable to the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, which was responsible for the higher direction of the Manhattan Project. When the Combined Policy Committee was formed in September 1943 by the Quebec Agreement, its chairman, Secretary of War Henry Stimson, had Styer appointed as his deputy. Styer also became chairman of its technical subcommittee, which included America's Richard Tolman, Britain's James Chadwick and Canada's C. J. Mackenzie. The technical subcommittee became very influential, as it furnished most of the data on which the Combined Policy Committee based its decisions.|$|E

5|$|Purnell became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He {{was also}} the Navy {{representative}} on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the Navy representative on the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project.

5|$|The Senate was the {{predominant}} political {{institution in the}} Roman Republic. The Senate's authority derived primarily from custom and tradition. It {{was also one of}} the few places in which free political discussion could take place.

5|$|With the {{addition}} of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta, and two representatives from Washington, D.C., the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee.|$|E

Its principal role is to provide direction and advice on <b>military</b> <b>policy</b> and strategy. It provides guidance on military matters to the NATO Strategic Commanders, whose representatives attend its meetings, and {{is responsible for the}} overall conduct of the military affairs of the Alliance under the authority of the Council. The Chairman of the NATO Military Committee is Petr Pavel of the Czech Republic, since 2015.|$|E
5|$|In March 1904 Neild {{attacked}} the government's <b>military</b> <b>policy</b> and {{the commander of}} the military forces, Major-General Sir Edward Hutton, who had long wished to dismiss Neild from the citizen army. Neild had incited a near mutiny by destroying a well-known sergeant's military career, and was suspended from duty; Neild responded by accusing Hutton of intimidation and infringing a Senator's right of freedom of expression. In April 1904 the Senate formed a committee to investigate alleged contempt of Parliament by Hutton, which found that Neild had not been intimidated. In 1905 Neild retired from the militia.|$|E
5|$|In early 1944, Smyth {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project. The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, supported the idea. He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant, the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project, who had similar thoughts. Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project's director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.. In April, Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report. Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project’s governing body, the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, in May 1944.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist <b>military</b> <b>policy,</b> thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became increasingly concerned with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great political question of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and <b>military</b> <b>policy.</b> This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E

5|$|While the Turks {{were settled}} in the Ordos region (former {{territory}} of the Xiongnu), the Tang government took on the <b>military</b> <b>policy</b> of dominating the central steppe. Like the earlier Han dynasty, the Tang dynasty (along with Turkic allies) conquered and subdued Central Asia during the 640s and 650s. During Emperor Taizong's reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the Göktürks, but also separate campaigns against the Tuyuhun, the oasis city-states, and the Xueyantuo. Under Emperor Gaozong, a campaign led by the general Su Dingfang was launched against the Western Turks ruled by Ashina Helu.|$|E
5|$|With the {{addition}} of the 1st Ordnance Squadron to its roster in March 1945, the 509th Composite Group had an authorized strength of 225 officers and 1,542 enlisted men, almost all of whom deployed to Tinian, an island in the northern Marianas within striking distance of Japan, in May and June 1945. The 320th Troop Carrier Squadron kept its base of operations at Wendover. In addition to its authorized strength, the 509th had attached to it on Tinian all 51 civilian and military personnel of Project Alberta. Furthermore, two representatives from Washington, D.C. were present on the island: the deputy director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell of the <b>Military</b> <b>Policy</b> Committee.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{prompted}} {{major changes}} in Southern Rhodesia's financial and <b>military</b> <b>policy,</b> and accelerated the process of industrialisation. The territory's participation in the EATS brought about major economic and infrastructural developments {{and led to the}} post-war immigration of many former airmen, contributing to the growth of the white population to over double its pre-war size by 1951. The war remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades afterwards. Since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government has removed many references to the World Wars, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the war today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
