50|$|By 1900 the {{position}} had clearly declined. Bryngurnos colliery and Bryn colliery {{are described as}} 'disused' and the Drysiog and Bryntroedygarn were described as 'old levels'. On the plus side a new coal <b>mine</b> above meadow <b>row</b> brought many jobs.|$|R

50|$|Vehement′s next minelaying {{operation}} on 24 July 1918 involved the entire flotilla laying 496 mines in the North Sea in 22 rows; during the operation, Vehement detected two periscopes. The flotilla sortied from the Humber again at 13:00 hours on 28 July 1918 {{and during the}} night of 28-29 July laid a North Sea field of 416 <b>mines</b> in 18 <b>rows.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was stayed {{like the}} gallery of a <b>mine,</b> with a <b>row</b> of {{stanchions}} in the middle, and cross-beams overhead, penetrating {{into the gloom}} ahead--indefinitely. And to port there loomed, like the caving in {{of one of the}} sides, a bulky mass with a slanting outline. The whole place, with the shadows and the shapes, moved all the time. The boatswain glared: the ship lurched to starboard, and a great howl came from that mass that had the slant of fallen earth.|$|R
50|$|Vehement′s next sortie from Immingham on 21 June 1918 ended {{almost as}} soon as it began when her {{propellers}} suffered damage after striking a cable while she was leaving the harbor, forcing her to remain in port for repairs. She was back in service in time to join her flotilla in laying a North Sea minefield on 27 June 1918. On the night of 5-6 July and again on the night of 8-9 July 1918, she joined her flotilla in laying a field of 384 <b>mines</b> in 18 <b>rows</b> in the North Sea.|$|R
50|$|The first {{anti-tank}} mines were improvised {{during the}} First World War as a counter measure against the first tanks {{introduced by the}} British {{towards the end of}} the war. Initially they were nothing more than a buried high explosive shell or mortar bomb with its fuze upright. Later, purpose built mines were developed, including the Flachmine 17, which was simply a wooden box packed with explosives and triggered either remotely or by a pressure fuze. By the end of the war, the Germans had developed <b>row</b> <b>mining</b> techniques, and mines accounted for 15% of U.S. tank casualties during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, Third Battle of the Aisne, Battle of Selle and Meuse-Argonne Offensive.|$|R
2500|$|Naval mines {{were also}} used to protect Krepost Sveaborg from an attack from the sea. An outer line of contact mines was laid {{approximately}} [...] outside the main line of defence. Shore detonated controlled mines were used to create an inner mine barrier to protect the entrances to the outer anchorage. These mines were laid typically in three rows with [...] separation between rows and [...] between <b>mines</b> in a <b>row.</b> Controlled <b>mines</b> required an extensive cabling system to the shore stations where the command to detonate the mines was given. Fortified electrical stations provided the necessary electricity for the mine control network. Electricity was also used for communication systems, searchlights, electrical ammunition lifts and in barracks and crew shelters.|$|R
5000|$|In 1846, {{the first}} copper mine opened in Bruce Mines. Miners from Cornwall, England {{emigrated to the}} area to work the mines. The mining {{companies}} quickly built wharves and docks in the bay to handle the influx of people and materials. Two of the mine managers built their homes {{at the entrance to}} the main dock property. They made sure that only approved boats used the docks. The mining companies did not allow any stores to open in their town. All of the miners and their families were forced to purchase from the Company Store. The Marks brothers from Hilton Beach would load a barge on St. Joseph Island and bring fresh produce, meat and lumber to the miners in Bruce Mines. They were not allowed to land on the dock, so would anchor their barge in the middle of the bay and the people of Bruce <b>Mines</b> would <b>row</b> and paddle out to buy merchandise from them. Eventually they opened one of the first mercantile stores in Bruce Mines. A Company tugboat, the [...] "E.P. Sawyer" [...] was a familiar site in Bruce Mines. This tug was used to move barges around the bay from the different mines located in Bruce Mines. Passenger vessels, such as the [...] "Caribou" [...] and the [...] "Premier" [...] also stopped on a regular basis in Bruce Mines. These vessels brought much needed cargo and passengers to the area. The [...] "Premier" [...] burned and sank at the dock in 1923. Divers later recovered the propeller and salvaged the metal from her boilers.|$|R
60|$|It is raining--dismally, dismally raining. And this is Messina coming. Oh horrible Messina, earthquake-shattered and {{renewing}} your youth like a vast <b>mining</b> settlement, with <b>rows</b> {{and streets}} {{and miles of}} concrete shanties, squalor and a big street with shops and gaps and broken houses still, just back of the tram-lines, and a dreary squalid earthquake-hopeless port in a lovely harbor. People don't forget and don't recover. The people of Messina seem to be today what they were nearly twenty years ago, after the earthquake: {{people who have had}} a terrible shock, and for whom all life's institutions are really nothing, neither civilization nor purpose. The meaning of everything all came down with a smash in that shuddering earthquake, and nothing remains but money and the throes of some sort of sensation. Messina between the volcanoes, Etna and Stromboli, having known the death-agony's terror. I always dread coming near the awful place, yet I have found the people kind, almost feverishly so, as if they knew the awful need for kindness.|$|R
5000|$|The area {{immediately}} {{south of}} the station was for many years a busy freight location, handling haematite ore traffic from Moor <b>Row</b> <b>mine</b> {{as well as the}} aforementioned chemical tankers up & down the incline at the nearby Preston Street goods depot (the one time W&FJR passenger terminus) and associated yard. Two signal boxes (Corkickle No. 1 & No. 2) supervised the sidings, as well as controlling access to and from the incline and the Moor Row branch (the surviving portion of the former Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railway line to Egremont & Sellafield). Although sufficiently busy to require its own resident shunting locomotive well into the 1970s, the gradual loss of traffic from the early 1980s onwards saw facilities run down and following the demise of Preston Street depot, the yard eventually closed (along with both signal boxes, which had been replaced by standard LMR-designed structures in 1958-59) on 15/16 February 1997. [...] Today no trace remains of the sidings or either signal box, only the one surviving running line southwards towards St Bees & Sellafield.|$|R
