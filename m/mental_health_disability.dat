Across free market countries, {{the rate of}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability</b> is growing and now constitutes about one third of all disability claimants. Living on disability benefits begets demoralization and passivity. This article reviews (a) {{the current status of}} <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability</b> and <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability</b> systems, (b) the encouraging findings related to research on evidence-based treatments and supported employment, and (c) policy changes that might ameliorate the problem of rising rates (and costs) of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability.</b> Mental health treatments, employment services, and disability policies powerfully shape the disability experience. Evidence-based mental health and employment services can ameliorate disability and could potentially prevent disability if applied as early interventions. Yet evidence-based mental health treatments and supported employment services are rarely available. Furthermore, current disability policies tend to trap people in a “disability benefits culture. ” Policy changes should recognize that people with mental health disabilities usually want to work, that they are often able to work when provided with appropriate mental health and vocational services, and that employment is highly therapeutic. Disability policies need to strengthen work incentives for beneficiaries, providers, and employers...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop a Cultural Analysis Tool (CAT). The CAT {{consists}} of specific thematic questions that can serve as a cultural and equity analysis instrument for practitioners to use in the implementation of Ontario’s civil <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> laws. The rationale behind creating the CAT is based on research suggesting that ethno-racial people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disabilities</b> experience inequities and differential outcomes while interacting with Ontario’s civil <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> laws. Given the increasing multi-racial population in Ontario, there is a need to develop mechanisms to address these intersecting issues. Other countries that have created evaluative tools for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation include the United Kingdom and Australia. Such a tool does not exist in Canada, let alone in Ontario specifically. This study contributes to a better understanding of how equitable outcomes for ethno-racial people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disabilities</b> interacting with Ontario’s civil <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> laws can be achieved. I developed the CAT through an iterative process involving a comprehensive review of the literature and qualitative data drawn from thirty-five semi-structured interviews with seven members of each of the following groups: (1) ethno-racial people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disabilities</b> including in-patients and ex-patients, (2) lawyers who practice in the area of <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> law, (3) health care professionals including psychiatrists, nurses and social workers, (4) service providers such as front-line case workers at <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> agencies and (5) adjudicators, government advisors and academics. I analyzed the data using the grounded theory approach, symbolic interactionism, tenets of the theoretical framework and an analysis of the jurisprudence, legislation, international laws and literature on the existing tools used for <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> legislation. After developing a draft version of the CAT, I refined the CAT’s questions through an expert review (involving the qualitative technique of member-checking) using three focus groups of 1) ethno-racial people with <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disabilities,</b> 2) <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> lawyers and service providers and 3) health care professionals. Lastly, in order to develop the final version of the CAT, I analyzed and contextualized the results that emerged from the interviews through primary and secondary sources and the focus group data...|$|R

The sample also included key informants. Data was collected through focus group discussions with the participants and individual interviews with the key informants. Overall, a total of 41 people provided information for this study. Thematic data analysis was used to assess the data.

The challenges go beyond commonly-reported problems in the literature such as stigma and discrimination and include basic challenges such as a lack of transportation to healthcare services and a lack of acceptance of the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders by the parents.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to stimulate {{discussion}} on how to meet the demand for flexible instructional strategies that include information and communications technologies (ICT) in higher education as effective interventions for people with mental health issues. ICT strategies are widely believed to offer new options for Web-mediated courseware design. We examine the impact of mental illness on post secondary education. Despite the advances made with multi-media and online courseware development, we suggest there has been little examination of whether ICT tools meet the specific needs of people recovering from mental illness. Correctly designed electronic courseware may provide the customised learning environment that affords the much needed flexibility people are asking for. Adoption of effective human-computer interaction (HCI) provides enhanced solutions for people with a <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability</b> wishing to continue with their studies.

40|$|One {{conclusion}} of the decade-long epidemiological Global Burden of Disease Project is that five of the top 10 disease “burdens ” the world will face by 2020 will be related to mental disabilities. Therefore, developing social policy and community responses to the ways that people with mental disabilities are treated is becoming an important focus for community practitioners, political activists and legislators. The author explores some {{of the dynamics of}} our culture’s approach to dealing with difference, especially when manifested in disenfranchized individuals. He discusses a commu-nity development project created by a New York City advocacy and social policy organization following the 1999 mur-der of a woman by an individual whose <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> <b>disability</b> was never treated. Parallels are drawn between the civil rights and community mental health movements, which created a precedent for the 1990 Americans with Disabili-ties Act. Also examined are the ways in which community mental health systems manifest social policy that alternately resists, repeats and colludes with power operations. The unexamined assumptions that drive this dynamic are examined as ableism or disability oppression...|$|E
