40|$|This paper {{presents}} an adaptive fuzzy-neural controller for <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> which incorporates {{the advantage of}} fuzzy logic and neural network. Inverted pendulum is well known as a multivariable and nonlinear system. And {{it is very difficult}} to design and realize a single stage fuzzy controller for the problem of <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> as inverted pendulum. After the description of the research background of quadruple inverted pendulum system, a fuzzy-neural controller is proposed which is based on three dimension fuzzy composed variable and the parameters are optimized by back propagation algorithm in neural network. And the parameters could be adjusted online further. The proposed method gives a solution to design and realize high dimension fuzzy controller in <b>multivariable</b> <b>system.</b> Simulation shows its validity. © 2005 IEEE.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel linear {{recurrent}} neural network for <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> identification, namely a linerec neural network (LNN). Based on this network, {{the transfer function}} matrix model of a <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> can be identified directly according to its input and output data. In this way, LNNs differ from existing neural networks. An LNN is constructed based on the identification of prior knowledge in a system, and its weights have definite physical meaning. An LNN is equivalent to a linear equation set, and its training algorithm is based on Widrow-Hoff learning rules. In this paper, the theoretical foundation, structural algorithm and learning rules of LNNs are proposed and studied. To guarantee learning convergence, network training stability is analysed using discrete Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results show the feasibility of LNNs for <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> identification...|$|E

40|$|Decentralized {{control is}} a well {{established}} approach to control the multivariable processes. In this approach, control structure design and in particular input-output pairing is a vital stage in the design procedure. There are several powerful methods to select the appropriate input-output pair in linear <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems.</b> However, {{despite the fact that}} most practical processes are nonlinear, there is no general method to select the appropriate input-output pair for nonlinear <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems.</b> In this study, a new general approach to input-output pairing for linear and nonlinear <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed.

40|$|In <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems,</b> {{controlled}} variables interact {{each other}} in general.

However the method becomes fairly complicated when we design a precompensator and PID controller. Therefore we propose compensator design method for <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems,</b> then we can realize PID control relatively easily in view of utility. We design a compensator which meets the diagonal dominance using Real Code Genetic Algorithms. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed with the simulation results...|$|R

One application of the algorithm is to find the transfer matrix of a linear <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> given on state space form. The algorithm is advantageous when one needs repeated computations of a transfer matrix in a <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> for successive changes in one or a few parameters in the system.

40|$|In {{technical}} practice {{often occur}} multivariable processes with time delay. Time-delays are {{mainly caused by}} {{the time required to}} transport mass, energy or information, but they can also be caused by processing time or accumulation. In a <b>multivariable</b> <b>system</b> each input may influence all system outputs. The design of a controller for such a system must be quite sophisticated if the system is to be controlled adequately. One of the possible approaches to control of multivariable time-delay processes is application of predictive control methods. The paper deals with design of an algorithm for predictive control of multivariable processes with time-delay. The predictive controller is based on the recursive computation of predictions which was extended for the time-delay system.

40|$|A second-order {{terminal}} sliding mode controller for uncertain <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems</b> {{is proposed}} in this paper. The controller adopts the hierarchical control structure.

40|$|A {{variance}} {{analysis of the}} parameters of a plant, belonging to a class of <b>multivariable</b> <b>systems,</b> estimated in closed-loop operation is performed. More specifically, having in mind the control applications where it is not desirable to excite all external reference inputs, {{the effect of the}} absence of one or more reference signals on the variance of the estimated parameters is investigated. The derived expressions are valid {{for a wide range of}} model structures including all conventional prediction error models. It is shown that, regardless of the parametrization, the absence of a reference signal never improves and, in most cases, impairs the accuracy of the parameter estimates. In other words, there is a price to pay when restrictions are imposed on the experimental conditions. The analytical results are illustrated by two simulation examples.
