40|$|The {{environmental}} costing model (Milieu-Kosten-Model or MKM in Dutch) is a {{tool for}} assessing cost-efficiency of environmental policy. The present paper describes the modelling methodology and illustrates it by presenting numerical simulations for selected multi-sector and <b>multi-pollutant</b> emission control problems for Flanders. First, the paper situates the concept of cost-efficiency {{in the context of}} Flemish environmental policy and motivates the chosen approach. Secondly, the structure of the numerical simulation model is laid out. The basic model input is an extensive database of potential emission reduction measures for several pollutants and several sectors. Each measure is characterized by its specific emission reduction potential and average abatement cost. The MKM determines, by means of linear programming techniques, least-cost combinations of abatement measures as to satisfy, possibly <b>multi-pollutant,</b> emission standards. Emission reduction targets can be imposed for Flanders as a whole, per sector or even per installation. The measures can be constrained to satisfy “equal treatment” of sectors and several other political feasibility constraints. Thirdly, the features of the model are illustrated by means of a multi-sector (non-ferrous, chemical and ceramics industry) and <b>multi-pollutant</b> (SO 2, NOx) example. Results show clearly that important cost savings are possible by allowing for more flexibility (emission standards for Flanders as a whole instead of per sector).

The <b>multi-pollutant</b> control system includes a hybrid selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) /in-duct selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system to reduce NOx emissions by {ge} 60 %, followed by a Turbosorp{reg_sign} circulating fluidized bed dry scrubber system to reduce emissions of SO{sub 2 }, SO{sub 3 }, HCl, and HF by {ge} 95 %. Mercury removal of {ge} 90 % is also targeted via the co-benefits afforded by the in-duct SCR, dry scrubber, and baghouse and by injection of activated carbon upstream of the scrubber, as required. The technology is particularly well suited, because of its relatively low capital and maintenance costs and small space requirements, {{to meet the needs of}} coal-fired units with capacities of 50 - 300 MWe. There are about 440 such units in the United States that currently are not equipped with SCR, flue gas desulfurization (FGD), or mercury control systems. These smaller units are a valuable part of the nation's energy infrastructure, constituting about 60 GW of installed capacity. However, with the onset of the Clean Air Interstate Rule, Clean Air Mercury Rule, and various state environmental actions requiring deep reductions in emissions of SO{sub 2 }, NO{sub x}, and mercury, the continued operation of these units increasingly depends upon the ability to identify viable air pollution control retrofit options for them. The large capital costs and sizable space requirements associated with conventional technologies such as SCR and wet FGD make these technologies unattractive for many smaller units. The Greenidge Project aims to confirm the commercial readiness of an emissions control system that is specifically designed to meet the environmental compliance requirements of these smaller coal-fired EGUs. The <b>multi-pollutant</b> control system is being installed and tested on the AES Greenidge Unit 4 (Boiler 6) by a team including CONSOL Energy Inc. as prime contractor, AES Greenidge LLC as host site owner, and Babcock Power Environmental Inc. as engineering, procurement, and construction contractor. All funding for the project is being provided by the U. S. Department of Energy, through its National Energy Technology Laboratory, and by AES Greenidge. AES Greenidge Unit 4 is a 107 MW{sub e} (net), 1950 s vintage, tangentially-fired, reheat unit that is representative of many of the 440 smaller coal-fired units identified above. Following design and construction, the <b>multi-pollutant</b> control system will be demonstrated over an approximately 20 -month period while the unit fires 2 - 4 % sulfur eastern U.

40|$|International audiencePeople {{spend most}} of their time indoors. Dust settled in the home may be {{contaminated}} by semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Exposure to these compounds is of great concern, in particular for infants. Their number is large so arose the question of which ones should be selected for dust ingestion exposure assessment. This work proposes a health ranking of SVOCs ingested through settled dust. This ranking is based on the toxicity and contamination of SVOCs in dust. Data on compounds and contamination was retrieved from a bibliographic review. Where possible, toxicity data was retrieved from databases, otherwise it was calculated from raw data. One hundred and fifty-six SVOCs were selected, 66 of which were prioritized. Forty-two could not be prioritized because contamination data was below the limit of detection, and 48 could not be prioritized because there was no contamination or toxicity data. The top-ranked compounds were phthalates, pesticides, short-chain chlorinated paraffins, PBDEs, PFCs, organotins, PCBs, and PAHs. As most of these have reprotoxic and neurotoxic properties, an integrated <b>multi-pollutants</b> approach to exposure is required and simultaneous measurement methods should be developed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The large number of compounds identified in settled dust in recent years should be considered for the assessment of exposure to dust ingestion.

40|$|In recent decades, the Pearl River Delta (PRO) region {{located in}} south China has been {{experiencing}} severe air pollution, {{arising from the}} rapid increase in industry and motor vehicles.

By taking 2015 as a target year, this paper assessed the impacts of five possible motor vehicle emission control measures and a combined policy scenario on ambient air quality in the PRD region, {{with the use of the}} Model- 3 /CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) model. The results show: (1) an overall decreasing pattern in SO(2), NO(2) and PM(10) concentrations was found in central-south metropolitan areas of the PRO region for all measures, but increased O(3) concentrations may occur in these areas as well. The exception to this is that a slight decrease was observed for the cases of motorcycle restriction and introduction of HEV: (2) upgrading to National IV emission standards is the most effective individual measure and can reduce daily averaged NO(2) and PM(10) concentrations by 11. 7 ppbV and 21. 3 mu g m(- 3), respectively; but involves an increase (at maximum) of 10. 3 ppbV in O(3) concentration. Evaluation of the combined scenario indicates that solely controlling motor vehicle emissions is not sufficient to improve PRO regional air quality significantly. O(3) and PM(10) concentrations under the same VOC/NO(x) reduction ratios exhibit differently at different locations, suggesting that integrated and location-specific pollution control strategies, considering co-control of <b>multi-pollutants,</b> are needed in this region in order to decrease primary and secondary pollutant concentrations simultaneously.

Despite of many studies dedicated to the environmental damage of cultural heritage, in case of cement mortars, commonly used in the 20 th century architecture, the deterioration due to air multipollutants impact, especially the formation of black crusts, is still not well explored making this issue a challenging area of research. This work centers on cement mortars – environment interactions, focusing on the diagnosis of the damage on the modern built heritage due to air <b>multi-pollutants.</b> For this purpose three sites, exposed to different urban areas in Europe, were selected for sampling and subsequent laboratory analyses: Centennial Hall, Wroclaw (Poland), Chiesa dell'Autostrada del Sole, Florence (Italy), Casa Galleria Vichi, Florence (Italy). The sampling sessions were performed taking into account the height from the ground level and protection from rain run off (sheltered, partly sheltered and exposed areas). The complete characterization of collected damage layer and underlying materials was performed using a range of analytical techniques: optical and scanning electron microscopy, X ray diffractometry, differential and gravimetric thermal analysis, ion chromatography, flash combustion/gas chromatographic analysis, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer. The data were elaborated using statistical methods (i. e. principal components analyses) and enrichment factor for cement mortars was calculated for the first time. The results obtained from the experimental activity performed on the damage layers indicate that gypsum, due to the deposition of atmospheric sulphur compounds, is the main damage product at surfaces sheltered from rain run-off at Centennial Hall and Casa Galleria Vichi. By contrast, gypsum has not been identified in the samples collected at Chiesa dell'Autostrada del Sole. This is connected to the restoration works, particularly surface cleaning, regularly performed for the maintenance of the building.

With respect to the five scenarios of burning activities, the average emissions and overall propagation of uncertainties at the 95  % confidence interval (CI) of SPM from agricultural open burning in China in 2012 were estimated to be 1005. 7 (− 24. 6, 33. 7  %), 901. 4 (− 24. 4, 33. 5  %), 432. 4 (− 24. 2, 33. 5  %), 134. 2 (− 24., 34. 0  %), 249. 8 (− 25. 4, 34. 9  %), 25. 1 (− 33. 3, 41. 4  %), 5. 8 (− 30. 1, 38. 5  %), 8. 7 (− 26. 6, 35. 6  %), 0. 5 (− 26. 0, 34. 9  %), and 2. 7 (− 26. 1, 35. 1  %)  Gg for PM 2.

The emissions were further spatio-temporally characterized using a geographic information system (GIS) in different regions in the summer and autumn post-harvest periods. It was found that less than 25  % of the total emissions were released during the summer harvest, which was mainly contributed by the North Plain and the centre of China, especially Henan, Shandong, and Anhui, which are the top three provinces regarding smoke particle emissions. Flux concentrations of primarily emitted smoke PM 2. [*] 5 that were calculated using the box-model method based on five versions of emission inventories all exceed the carcinogenic-risk permissible exposure limits (PEL). The health impacts and health-related economic losses from the smoke PM 2. [*] 5 short-term exposure were assessed. The results show that China suffered from  7836 cases (95,% CI: 3232, 12362) of premature mortality and  7   267   237 cases (95  % CI: 2   961   487, 1   130   784) of chronic bronchitis in  2012, which led to losses of USD  8822. 4 million (95  % CI: 3574. 4, 13   034. 2) or 0. 1  % of the total GDP. We suggest that the percentage of open-burnt crop straw in the post-harvest period should be cut down by over 97  % to ensure a reduction in carcinogenicity risk, especially in the North Plain and the northeast, where the emissions should decrease at least by 94  % to meet the PEL. With such emission control, over 92  % of the mortality and morbidity attributed to agricultural fire smoke PM 2. [*] 5 can be avoided in China...|$|R

40|$|The {{promulgation}} of Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014 {{on emissions}} from {{coal-fired power plants}} in Malaysia has prompted power plant operators to adopt emission control strategy that complies with the new emission limits. Currently, various emission control strategies are available to achieve the desired emission level. Each strategy offers unique advantages and disadvantages, depending on the objective of emissions control, process nature, and constraints on the resources incurred. To address this challenge, a proper decision-making analysis needs to be performed. In this paper, a systematic decision analysis methodology is proposed to select the most effective <b>multi-pollutant</b> control strategy that is compatible for coal-fired power plants in Malaysia. The methodology includes: (1) identification of pollutant emission from the plant under study and comparison with the stipulated emission limits, (2) establishment of emission factors, (3) selection of <b>multi-pollutant</b> control strategy, (4) identification of emission reduction factor for the pollutants and control technologies of interest, (5) determination of emission level from the selected <b>multi-pollutant</b> control strategy, and (6) prediction of ground-level concentration of pollutants. The decision analysis methodology is applied to a real case study of coal-fired power plant in Malaysia, which also currently faces a dilemma {{to comply with the}} additional and more stringent emission limits stipulated in the Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014. The proposed method is applicable for both the process concept under the design phase as well as the existing process plant...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of {{persistent}} air quality problems, as well as emerging concerns such as greenhouse gases and state budgetary constraints, states are looking to new ways to maximize air quality while minimizing costs. The non-profit Regulatory Assistance Project (RAP) assists states in air quality management, and has recently proposed a new methodology for states to use {{in order to take}} a proactive, forward-thinking approach to optimize air quality. RAP’s proposed Integrated, <b>Multi-Pollutant</b> Planning for Energy and Air Quality (IMPEAQ) fosters long-range planning, <b>multi-pollutant</b> analysis and cost optimization modeling to enable state air quality districts to achieve efficient gains in air quality. At RAP’s request, the Center for Climate Change Law has undertaken an analysis of potential legal issues that might arise during the use of IMPEAQ. This white paper assesses the general statutory and regulatory framework applicable to IMPEAQ as a voluntary program for states to adopt for their air quality planning. It first addresses threshold issues: state authority under the Clean Air Act to voluntarily implement integrated planning using IMPEAQ and the permissibility of using a <b>multi-pollutant</b> approach to air quality planning. It then examines two key issues concerning emerging control measures: how states can use energy efficiency and renewable energy (EERE) programs in their State Implementation Plans (SIPs) and to what extent states may allow novel measures to satisfy the Act’s source-specific control technology requirements. Our analysis finds that the IMPEAQ approach would be generally permissible under the Clean Air Act and EPA policy, given the wide discretion states have to develop their air quality plans and to choose the control measures they wish to use in their SIPs. Further, emerging control measures identified through the IMPEAQ process, such as energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, may qualify for SIP credit where the state meets the specific statutory and regulatory requirements for doing so. An open issue [...] though arguably allowable under the Act [...] {{is the degree to which}} states could opt to allow offsite programs to substitute for site-specific technology controls. Based on this analysis, we conclude that IMPEAQ represents a viable planning approach for states to voluntarily adopt for integrated, <b>multi-pollutant</b> air quality planning. The proposed general framework is allowable under the Clean Air Act and is consistent with EPA’s policy that favors a <b>multi-pollutant</b> analysis and encourages the use of cost-effective measures to improve air quality. However, we must caution that because the specifics of planning under the IMPEAQ approach are still under development, this paper is not intended to assess all potential aspects of IMPEAQ planning...|$|E
40|$|Semi-dense phase {{pneumatic}} {{delivery and}} injection of calcium and sodium sorbents, and microfine powdered coal, at various sidewall elevations of an online operating coal-fired power plant, was investigated {{for the express}} purpose of developing an in-furnace, economic <b>multi-pollutant</b> reduction methodology for NO{sub x}, SO{sub 2 } & Hg. The 154 MWe tangentially-fired furnace that was selected for a full-scale demonstration, was recently retrofitted for NO{sub x} reduction with a high velocity rotating-opposed over-fire air system. The ROFA system, a Mobotec USA technology, has a proven track record of breaking up laminar flow along furnace walls, thereby enhancing the mix of all constituents of combustion. The knowledge gained from injecting sorbents and micronized coal into well mixed combustion gases with significant improvement in particulate retention time, should serve well the goals of an in-furnace <b>multi-pollutant</b> reduction technology; that of reducing back-end cleanup costs on a wide variety of pollutants, on a cost per ton basis, by first accomplishing significant in-furnace reductions of all pollutants...|$|E
40|$|The methodological {{challenges}} {{associated with}} {{conducting research on}} air pollution mixtures are well-known: correlated co-pollutants result in unstable effect estimates and large standard errors, hindering the assignment of causality to any one exposure. There is still relatively little research in the growing <b>multi-pollutant</b> literature that {{is focused on the}} mixture itself as the unit of analysis. In this dissertation, I implement a statistical method from the causal inference literature to estimate the effects of ambient air pollution, as single pollutants and in a two-pollutant mixture. I analyze the effects of single-pollutant and <b>multi-pollutant</b> summertime ambient air pollution exposures on pulmonary function in a cohort of children with asthma living in Fresno, California. I employ a technique from the causal inference literature, the Population Intervention Model (PIM), to describe the health effects that would result from several hypothetical interventions that involve lowering concentrations of ambient air pollution. By describing the health effects of the ambient air pollutants in these terms, this approach estimates results that are relevant to real-world policy questions. Furthermore, this analytical approach permits the calculation of air pollution health effects that correspond to multiple pollutants dynamically changing within a mixture, as ambient air pollution is actually experienced by people. I interpret each of these health effects according to whether it reflects a realistic, or even a possible, exposure scenario during the study period and in the region where data were collected. I achieve this through an examination of the individual and joint distributions of the pollutants under study. This dissertation contains several analyses, corresponding to single- and <b>multi-pollutant</b> exposure regimens. In the first analysis, I analyze the effects of ambient summertime NO 2 on FEF 25 - 75 in a single-pollutant approach that demonstrates the methodological approach. All analyses use central-site exposure data, assigning all subjects on a given study day the same air pollution exposure values. Ambient PM 10 - 2. 5 is analyzed throughout as a summertime pollutant of secondary interest, both in a single-pollutant PM 10 - 2. 5 analysis, and in a mixture analysis. For the <b>multi-pollutant</b> mixture analysis, I extend the Population Intervention Model framework demonstrated in the single-pollutant analyses to a two-pollutant summer analysis of ambient NO 2 and PM 10 - 2. 5, estimating health effects associated with an intervention that dynamically alters levels of one or both pollutants. In this two-pollutant analysis, I estimate the effects of lowering levels of one co-pollutant while "controlling for" the other (i. e., holding it at observed levels), as well as the effects of a joint intervention that decreases levels of both pollutants. 	The Background chapter presents a brief history of air pollution epidemiology and policy, and reviews the epidemiologic and statistical research upon which this dissertation builds. The Methods chapter describes the data collection protocol of the Fresno Asthmatic Children's Environment Study (FACES), the theoretical basis for the chosen methodological approach, and the details of the statistical methods employed in these analyses. In the Results section, I describe the characteristics of the FACES study sample, provide tabular and graphical descriptions of the distribution of ambient air pollution in the study, and present the results of the single- and <b>multi-pollutant</b> PIM analyses. In the Discussion section, I provide interpretation of the effects estimated in these various analyses, and refer back to the single- and <b>multi-pollutant</b> exposure distributions to situate the various health effects in appropriate context, and to speculate on potential sources of bias. All health effects calculated in these analyses were estimated relatively imprecisely; however, comparison of the magnitude and direction of the risk differences across analyses demonstrates patterns and provides information about the respiratory effects of the pollutants analyzed in this study. Furthermore, consideration of the individual and joint distributions of the two exposures yields key insight that guides the interpretation of these findings, especially as relates to parameter identifiability. In this analysis, there is ample evidence that the types of air pollution profiles described by two interventions are not realistic given the observed data, and furthermore that there is not support in the data to estimate health effects for these interventions. These parameters were defined to be comparable to standard practice in the <b>multi-pollutant</b> literature. The finding that they were not identifiable in the FACES data argues against giving weight to these specific findings, and also raises broader questions about parameters of this type: large, isolated single-pollutant concentration changes in a <b>multi-pollutant</b> exposure regimen. The work presented here emphasizes that such parameters should be scrutinized for positivity and data support before commencing analysis, regardless of the analytical approach chosen...|$|E
