40|$|BACKGROUND: Fresh sprouted seeds {{have been}} {{associated}} with a number of large outbreaks caused by Salmonella and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. However, the high number of commensal bacteria found on sprouted seeds hampers the detection of these pathogens. Knowledge about the composition of the sprout microbiome is limited. In this study, the microbiome of <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprouts and the impact of buffered peptone water (BPW) and Enterobacteriaceae enrichment broth (EE-broth) -based enrichment protocols on this microbiome were investigated. RESULTS: Assessments based on aerobic mesophilic colony counts showed similar increases in <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprout background flora levels independent of the enrichment protocol used. 16 S rRNA sequencing revealed a <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprout microbiome dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. EE-broth enrichment of such samples preserved and increased Proteobacteria dominance while reducing Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes relative abundances. BPW enrichment, however, increased Firmicutes relative abundance while decreasing Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes levels. Both enrichments also lead to various genus level changes within the Protobacteria and Firmicutes phyla. CONCLUSIONS: New insights into the microbiome associated with <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprout and how it is influenced through BPW and EE-broth-based enrichment strategies used for detecting Gram-negative pathogens were generated. BPW enrichment leads to Firmicutes and Proteobacteria dominance, whereas EE-broth enrichment preserves Proteobacteria dominance in the <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprout samples. By increasing the relative abundance of Firmicutes, BPW also increases the abundance of Gram-positive organisms including some that might inhibit recovery of Gram-negative pathogens. The use of EE-broth, although preserving and increasing the dominance of Proteobacteria, can also hamper the detection of lowly abundant Gram-negative target pathogens due to outgrowth of such organisms by the highly abundant non-target Proteobacteria genera comprising the <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprout associated background flora...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} 35 {{years of research}} into the potential value of Australian native legumes of the Vigna genus in breeding improved crop varieties for cultivation. [Extract] Over the past {{three and a half}} decades, a collection of crop wild relatives in the legume genus Vigna has been assembled from tropical and subtropical Australia and nearby regions. Vigna is an important genus, especially in traditional village agriculture, and includes a range of pulses, for example, cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), mungbean (Vigna radiata), black gram (Vigna <b>mungo),</b> adzuki <b>bean</b> (Vigna angularis), and rice bean (Vigna umbellata); vegetables, for example, long bean (V. unguiculata); tubers (Vigna vexillata); and forages, for example, Vigna luteola, Vigna marina, and Vigna hosei. The project started in the late 1970 s at Brisbane in subtropical Australia, and then in the mid- 1990 s transferred to Townsville in the northeastern tropics. The aim was to develop a clearer understanding of the natural diversity within the wild Vigna species across northern Australia and to assess their likely utility for plant genetic improvement (Lawn et al., 1988) ...|$|R
40|$|Foodborne {{diseases}} {{are a major}} source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In most cases, these {{diseases are}} caused by contaminated food products, but transmission can also subsequently occur via person to person contact. The ability to detect the pathogens is an important aspect in the verification of food safety. A major proportion of foodborne disease is caused by Gram-negative bacteria. In this thesis, the detection of Gram-negative foodborne pathogens is addressed by looking at the successive steps from enrichment to detection with Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli and Cronobacter spp. as example pathogens. The detection of foodborne pathogens using microbiological culture media aiming at the resuscitation and growth of bacteria is still regarded as the gold standard and included in many reference methods. However, cultural methods are time and labour-intensive. Since an immediate response is required in case of contamination and during outbreaks there is a strong interest in methods that deliver information on the microbiological status of the product as quickly and reliable as possible. Rapid cultural methods and commercially available real-time PCR systems for the detection of Salmonella and STEC were compared with regards to their sensitivity and specificity. It was shown that most of the marketed systems are as reliable as the standard methods. However, false-positive results were obtained with real-time PCR systems for the detection of Salmonella. Rapid cultural methods that were based on procedures without the pre-enrichment step, reduced the time to detection but did show some ambiguous results with difficult matrices such as tea. Of the seven rapid tests for the detection of STEC, one did not detect relevant Stx subtypes. In order to be detected, pathogens need to multiply to reach a minimum threshold level. However, because they are often sublethally injured due to hostile processing and storage conditions, they first need to be resuscitated. For most pathogens, (Salmonella, STEC and Cronobacter spp.) {{the first step in the}} detection is an enrichment including resuscitation in a non-selective medium such as BPW. Modifications to BPW were compared with respect to their ability to promote growth of unstressed and stressed Gram-negative pathogens. The aim was to develop a medium that could be used for the enrichment of pathogens in horizontal methods using only one enrichment step. The resuscitation of stressed Cronobacter cells was improved in BPW supplemented with an additional iron source and sodium pyruvate along with low levels of compounds for the inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria. However, it was observed that BPW containing these supplements allowed for less resuscitation of STEC when compared to regular BPW. Based on these results it was concluded that the application of a one-broth enrichment in food products with a high number of competing bacteria is not recommended due to the overgrowth of the target bacteria. Limitations of the current method for the detection of STEC from sprouted seeds were noticed. Therefore, the growth of stressed STEC cells from different serotypes was assessed in media used for the enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, the growth of STEC was examined in the enrichment of sprouts using different media and incubation temperatures. It was shown that the high level of competitors was inhibiting the detection of the target pathogen and that the similarity of target and competing bacteria prevents the design of a selective enrichment procedure.  In order to get a better insight in the enrichment ecology, the microbiome of <b>mungo</b> <b>bean</b> sprouts was analysed using Illumina HiSeq sequencing prior to and during the enrichment in BPW and EE-broth at different temperatures. The majority of the sprout flora was composed of bacteria belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria. Enrichment in BPW increased the proportion of Firmicutes whereas the incubation in EE-broth enriched Proteobacteria. The results point out that with the application of a selective medium like EE-broth, growth of the competitive microflora that complicates the detection of STEC is promoted. It was shown that EE-broth also resulted in good growth of STEC however, the problematic situation of low maximum population densities of the target strain in the matrix is still present. The probability of detection is not only influenced by the natural flora of a food product, but also by the physiological state of the pathogen. The influence of stress on the lag time of single cells and the resulting probability of detection were determined for Cronobacter spp. in powdered infant formula. Lag time was calculated from optical density measurement data and different scenarios were modelled. Lag time was longest after acid stress and lag time increase coincided with increased lag time variability. The probability of detection, however, depended both on the sampling plan and on the duration of the lag phase. This thesis provides a critical evaluation of rapid methods and valuable new insights on enrichment procedures, the role of competitors in bacterial enrichment procedures and the limitations of selective agents. This information will be of great help to further improve microbiological methods and thereby contribute to more effective management of food safety.    ...|$|E
40|$|In Taiwanese {{alternative}} medicine Lu-doh-huang (also called Pracparatum <b>mungo),</b> mung <b>beans</b> {{are mixed with}} various herbal medicines and undergo a 4 -stage process of anaerobic fermentation. Here we used high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to profile the bacterial community structure of Lu-doh-huang samples. Pyrosequencing of samples obtained at 7 points during fermentation revealed 9 phyla, 264 genera, and 586 species of bacteria. While mung beans were inside bamboo sections (stages 1 and 2 of the fermentation process), family Lactobacillaceae and genus Lactobacillus emerged in highest abundance; Lactobacillus plantarum was broadly distributed among these samples. During stage 3, the bacterial distribution shifted to family Porphyromonadaceae, and Butyricimonas virosa became the predominant microbial component. Thereafter, bacterial counts decreased dramatically, and organisms were too few to be detected during stage 4. In addition, the microbial compositions of the liquids used for soaking bamboo sections were dramatically different: Exiguobacterium mexicanum predominated in the fermented soybean solution whereas B. virosa was predominant in running spring water. Furthermore, our results from pyrosequencing paralleled those we obtained by using the traditional culture method, which targets lactic acid bacteria. In conclusion, the microbial communities during Lu-doh-huan...|$|R
40|$|Background Archaeobotany, {{the study}} of plant remains from sites of ancient human activity, {{provides}} data for studying the initial evolution of domesticated plants. An important background to this is defining the domestication syndrome, those traits by which domesticated plants differ from wild relatives. These traits include features that have been selected under the conditions of cultivation. From archaeological remains the easiest traits to study are seed size and in cereal crops the loss of natural seed dispersal. Scope The rate at which these features evolved and the ordering in which they evolved can now be documented for a few crops of Asia and Africa. This paper explores this in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) from the Near East, rice (Oryza sativa) from China, mung (Vigna radiata) and urd (Vigna <b>mungo)</b> <b>beans</b> from India, and pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from west Africa. Brief reference is made to similar data on lentils (Lens culinaris), peas (Pisum sativum), soybean (Glycine max) and adzuki bean (Vigna angularis). Available quantitative data from archaeological finds are compiled to explore changes with domestication. The disjunction in cereals between seed size increase and dispersal is explored, and rates at which these features evolved are estimated from archaeobotanical data. Contrasts between crops, especially between cereals and pulses, are examined. Conclusions These data suggest that in domesticated grasses, changes in grain size and shape evolved prior to non-shattering ears or panicles. Initial grain size increases may have evolved during the first centuries of cultivation, within perhaps 500 – 1000 years. Non-shattering infructescences were much slower, becoming fixed about 1000 – 2000 years later. This suggests a need to reconsider the role of sickle harvesting in domestication. Pulses, by contrast, do not show evidence for seed size increase {{in relation to the}} earliest cultivation, and seed size increase may be delayed by 2000 – 4000 years. This implies that conditions that were sufficient to select for larger seed size in Poaceae were not sufficient in Fabaceae. It is proposed that animal-drawn ploughs (or ards) provided the selection pressure for larger seeds in legumes. This implies different thresholds of selective pressure, for example in relation to differing seed ontogenetics and underlying genetic architecture in these families. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) may show some similarities to the pulses in terms of a lag-time before truly larger-grained forms evolved. © 2007 The Author(s).

The endopeptidase is unable to remove the presequences of prethiolases from rape (Brassica napus) glyoxysomes and rat peroxisomes at the expected cleavage site.

In dark-grown mung bean, black bean and squash hypocotyls and pea epicotyls, growth rates after 24 h stress {{were found to be}} proportional to the Ψ of the medium. In mung bean hypocotyls, growth stopped before any change in Ψ or Ψ(π) occurred in the growing region. In this tissue and also in dark-grown squash hypocotyls, pea epicotyls, and in lightgrown cowpea hypocotyls, equivalent reductions in Ψ and Ψ(π) were evident in the growing region after 3 h, so turgor remained constant. In other species, osmotic adjustment with turgor maintenance was evident after 24 h in both the growing and expanded regions. The results with mung bean hypocotyls provided the first demonstration that stress causes an almost instantaneous stress-caused cessation of elongation in dicots. Since data from all plants showed that stress causes growth rate inhibition or cessation without a concomittant decrease in Ψ(p), it is concluded that turgor is not the factor regulating growth.

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1976. Bibliography: leaves [90]- 96. Microfiche. xii, 96 leaves illCrosses {{with three}} lines of mung bean (V. radiata) and two lines each of adzuki bean (V. angularis), black gram (V. <b>mungo)</b> and rice <b>bean</b> (V. umbellata) {{were made in}} order to {{determine}} the barriers to hybridization between species, and to assess the possibility of overcoming these barriers. This would provide useful information for exploiting wide germp 1 asm resources in breeding these valuable pulse crops. Reciprocal differences were common in all the species combinations. These differences were observed in pod set, embryo abortion, embryo culture, and seedling lethality. No crosses were successful in both directions. The results of six interspecific combinations are summarized as follows: (1) Adzuki bean and black gram was the least successful combination. Although pod set was normal when adzuki bean was used as the female, embryo abortion was complete and no seedlings obtained from embryo culture survived beyond the seedling stage. (2) Black gram and rice bean was also a very difficult combination to produce. Some seedlings obtained by embryo culture from crosses using black gram as the pistillate parent reached adult stage, but died before flowering. (3) Adzuki bean and mung bean was a somewhat more successful combination. Hybrids from mung bean produced by embryo culture flowered profusely but were completely sterile. Lack of chromosome pairing, shown by an average of 2. 39 II + 17. 22 I seems likely to be a principal cause of sterility. (4) The mung bean and rice bean combination was somewhat easier to make than the last. Embryo abortion is not complete so that some crinck 1 ed but viable seeds are produced on mung bean used as the pistillate parent. However, the hybrids, with average chromosome pairing of 0. 09 IV + 4. 69 II + 12. 26 I, are still completely sterile. Colchicine- induced amphidiploids showed regular meiosis with 22 bivalents and greatly improved fertility, indicating that at least in this combination much of the sterility of the diploid hybrid is caused by chromosomal factors. However, low pod set and defective seeds in the amphidiploid indicate that some adverse genic interactions are still found. (5) The mung bean and black gram combination (the former used as the pistillate parent) produced hybrid seeds with good germination. However, the FI hybrids were only partially fertile. One quadrivalent in 37 % of the cells examined indicates that one reciprocal translocation has occurred during chromosome differentiation of these two species. Segregation for morphological characters and the appearance of highly fertile individuals in the F 2 and BC 1 demonstrate the possibility of gene exchange between these two species. (6) The adzuki bean and rice bean combination obtained by culture of embryos from rice bean used as the pistillate parent was highly fertile with completely normal bivalent formation. Segregation for morphological characters and high fertility in the F 2 and BC 1 indicate the possibility of gene exchange between these species also. On the basis of crossability relationships, and on the assumption that cytoplasm which prevents the development of a hybrid embryo is the evolved cytoplasm, while cytoplasm which permits development of a hybrid embryo is the original type, evolutionary relationships of these four species are proposed. Mung bean and rice bean are assumed to have been derived independently from a common ancestor, possibly radiata var. soblobata which is a wild species. Black gram and adzuki bean are considered to be later derivatives from mung bean and rice bean, respectively. Thus, these four species can be divided into two subgroups, mung bean with black gram and rice bean with adzuki bean, in which the two species of each group retain enough chromosomal homology to allow germplasm exchange within the group...|$|R
