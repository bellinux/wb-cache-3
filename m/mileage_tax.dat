40|$|This paper {{develops}} and implements {{an analytical}} framework for estimating optimal {{taxes on the}} fuel use and mileage of heavy-duty trucks in the United States, accounting for external costs from congestion, accidents, pavement damage, noise, energy security, and local and global pollution. The analysis allows for endogenous fuel economy, increased auto travel in response to reduced truck congestion, and distinguishes driving by truck type and region. We estimate the optimal (second-best) diesel fuel tax at $ 1. 12 per gallon and implementing it increases welfare by $ 1. 34 billion per annum. Optimizing over both fuel and <b>mileage</b> <b>taxes,</b> and differentiating <b>mileage</b> <b>taxes</b> by vehicle type and region, yields progressively higher welfare gains. The most efficient tax structure involves a diesel fuel tax of 69 cents per gallon and charges on trucks that vary between 7 and 33 cents per mile; implementing this tax structure yields estimated welfare gains of $ 2. 06 billion.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} replacing current fuel taxes by a system of taxes that account better for all the different external costs of the different transport modes. One of the important implications of this reform is that current fuel taxes are decreased {{to a level of}} 80 euro/ton of CO 2 but that the <b>mileage</b> related <b>taxes</b> on car and truck use increase. Using the TREMOVE model for the transport sector of 31 European countries, one finds that the volume of transport will decrease because current taxes on transport are too low compared to overall external costs. Overall CO 2 emissions will decrease slightly. Using the MARKAL–TIMES model for the Belgian energy sector, putting all sectors and technologies on equal footing shows that a fuel tax reform makes that it is not cost efficient to require large CO 2 emission reductions in the transport sector and that traditional car technologies will continue to dominate the car market in 2020 – 2030. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a national random-digit-dial public opinion poll that asked 1, 516 respondents if they would support various tax options for raising federal transportation revenues. The 11 specific tax options tested were variations on raising the federal gas tax rate, creating a new <b>mileage</b> <b>tax,</b> and creating a new federal sales tax. In addition, the survey collected standard socio-demographic data, some minimal travel behavior data, and attitudinal data about how respondents view the quality of their local transportation system and their priorities for government spending on transportation in their state. All of this information is used to assess support levels for the tax options among different population subgroups. The survey results show that a majority of Americans would support higher taxes for transportation—under certain conditions. For example, a gas tax increase of 10 ¢ per gallon to improve road maintenance was supported by 62 % of respondents, whereas support levels dropped to just 24 % if the revenues were to be used more generally to maintain and improve the transportation system. Other variants on a gas tax that received at least 50 % support were increases of 10 ¢ per gallon with the revenues dedicated either to projects reducing accidents and improving safety or projects to “add more modern, technologically advanced systems. ” For tax options where the revenues were to be spent for undefined transportation purposes, support levels varied considerably by what kind of tax would be imposed, with a sales tax much more popular than either a gas tax increase or a new <b>mileage</b> <b>tax.</b> A central goal of the survey was to compare public support for two alternative versions of a new <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> and eight versions of a gas tax increase. All variations on the two taxes increased support over that for the base case of each (a flat-rate <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> of 1 ¢ per mile and a 10 ¢ gas tax increase proposed without any additional detail). For example, varying the <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> by the vehicle’s pollution level increased support by 14 percentage points. For the gas tax, most notably, dedicating the tax proceeds to maintaining streets, roads, and highways increased support by 38 percentage points...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives and {{implements}} formulas for {{the welfare}} effects of differentiated and uniform mileage taxes, gasoline taxes, and per mile insurance premiums, for reducing the external costs of passenger vehicle accidents. The model distinguishes three driver groups and five vehicle groups, and we obtain estimates of external accident costs per mile for each group from crash data. The (average) external accident cost is estimated at 2. 2 - 6. 6 cents per mile. Accidents costs differ substantially across drivers of different ages, but only moderately across different vehicles groups. Annual welfare gains from a <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> differentiated across drivers and vehicles according to marginal external costs are $ 9. 4 billion in the benchmark case. The uniform <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> and per-mile insurance reform can achieve 76 % and 65 % of this welfare gain, respectively, while the gasoline tax can achieve only 28 % of the welfare gain. Unlike other policies, the gasoline tax induces costly improvements in average fleet fuel economy that have little effect on reducing external costs. traffic accidents; external costs; pricing policies; insurance reform...|$|E

The model incorporates travel by auto, microbus, public bus, and rail, plus externalities from local and global air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents. In our benchmark case, the optimal gasoline tax is $ 2. 72 (29. 6 pesos) per gallon, or 16 times the current tax. However, a per-mile toll would reduce traffic congestion, the largest externality, more directly, and we put the optimized auto toll at 20. 3 cents per mile. Tolls should also be imposed on microbuses even though the welfare gains are relatively modest, as are those from reforming public transit fares. gasoline <b>taxes,</b> <b>mileage</b> tolls, transit subsidy, pollution, congestion, Mexico City, welfare effects...|$|R
40|$|This article compares four {{potential}} transportation {{energy conservation}} strategies using a comprehensive evaluation framework {{that takes into}} account how each strategy affects annual vehicle mileage, and therefore mileage-related impacts such as traffic congestion, road and parking facility costs and crash risk. Mileage-related impacts tend to be large in magnitude compared with energy conservation benefits, so even small mileage changes can have a large impact on net benefits. Fuel efficiency standards and some alternative fuels cause <b>mileage</b> increases. Fuel <b>tax</b> increases cause a combination of increased vehicle fuel economy and reduced mileage. Mobility management strategies cause relatively large mileage reductions and so provide the greatest mileage-related benefits.

40|$|States {{around the}} nation are {{scrambling}} to find new sources of revenue to maintain and expand their transportation systems. The traditional major source of funds, state and federal fuel taxes, has rarely kept pace with inflation. In most cases state legislatures have been unwilling to raise fuel taxes high enough to cover desired levels of expenditure, thus pushing {{state and local governments}} to look for new sources such as sales taxes and tolls. Another outcome of legislative reluctance to raise fees and taxes that generate transportation revenues has been to put any potential revenue measure before the voters, as a ballot proposition. As a result of these new trends in how legislatures respond to proposals for raising transportation revenues, transportation agencies are more and more asked to choose revenue options that have strong public support. This paper investigates public opinion in California on support for a range of revenue options to fund transportation, including taxes and fees, bonds, and tolling. The analysis is based on results from two telephone surveys of California residents conducted in 2006. The survey revealed fairly strong public support for some tolling options. The most popular tax or fee option was to increase vehicle registration fees by a variable amount depending on the vehicle?s air pollutant emissions and gas <b>mileage.</b> Three <b>tax</b> options ? gas taxes, sales taxes, and the vehicle license fee ? had virtually the same levels of overall support, about 40 %. The analysis of demographic and other factors provides further insights. People living in regions that have toll roads and HOT lanes were far more supportive of these concepts. Support for pricing options was not clearly related to income or ethnicity. Lower income respondents were about equally likely to support tolls roads, express toll lanes, and HOT lanes. Younger adults were more supportive of most tolling options, the mileage fee, and the registration fee that varied by emissions and gas mileage. The survey also revealed what many researchers have found ? that methodology, particularly question wording, is very important. Overall, the survey provides some optimism for implementing new options, such as tolling, and more traditional options of user fees. The positive reaction to linking fees with environmental objectives should be explored further by researchers and policy makers...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a national random-digit-dial public opinion poll that asked 1, 545 respondents if they would support various tax options for raising federal transportation revenues. The eight specific tax options tested were variations on raising the federal gas tax rate, creating a new <b>mileage</b> <b>tax,</b> and creating a new national sales tax. In addition, the survey collected standard socio-demographic data and some travel behavior data and asked a few attitudinal questions related {{to the quality of the}} transportation system and respondents´ priorities for government spending on transportation. These questions were used to assess support levels for the tax options among different population subgroups. None of the tax options achieved majority support, but three did fairly well, with support levels around 40 %. These were a 0. 5 ¢ sales tax (43 % support), a 10 ¢ gas tax increase with revenue to be dedicated to projects that would reduce the transportation system´s impact on global warming (42 % support), and a 10 ¢ gas tax increase spread over five years (39 % support). The report also compares public support for alternative versions of the mileage and gas taxes. The base cases tested against alternatives were a flat-rate <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> of 1 ¢ per mile and a 10 ¢ gas tax with no additional information given about the tax. All variants of these base cases increased support levels, in most cases significantly. Varying the <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> by the vehicle´s pollution level increased support by 12 percentage points. For the gas tax, all four alternatives to the base case received higher support. Most notably, spreading the gas tax increase over five years increased support by 16 percentage points, and linking the increase to global warming reduction increased support by a full 19 percentage points...|$|E

But the forecasts are not very optimistic because of cultural traditions, economic constraints, the flexibility of road transport and geographic inequalities between regions.

30|$|Another tax, the <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> on {{commercial}} vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes (which {{has recently been}} renamed the “green tax”), was proposed in 2009 for implementation in 2011. Its level varies between 2.5 and 20 centimes per kilometre, depending on the vehicle’s EURO class. It would apply to a network of 10, 000  km of non conceded roads, and a few routes on the French road network. Like the CCE and the TIPP, this tax aims to encourage modal transfers. 9 It was trialled in Alsace in 2010 and met with strong opposition from road hauliers who perceived {{it as a way}} for the government to recover revenue it had lost {{as a result of the}} privatization of motorways. In particular, the tax was criticized as unfair to some regions (such as Brittany where the network is almost free) which would be highly taxed, as well as to French hauliers as foreign trucks use motorways more. In this case too, the French government retreated and on 19 April 2010, the Minister for Transport delayed the implementation of this <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> for HGVs until the second half of 2012 on the grounds of its technical complexity. This was in spite of the fact that the tax was expected to bring about a reduction in CO 2 emissions of between 350 and 500 thousand tonnes.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} outlines three topics {{on urban}} transportation energy, emphasizing {{the role of}} transportation energy policy, and aims to provide a single comprehensive framework to evaluate and compare different pricing and regulatory policy options for reducing transportation fuel consumption in the United States. In the first chapter, I {{examine the effect of}} population density on motor fuel (i. e., highway gasoline) consumption, controlling for other variables such as gas price, income, vehicle stock and so on, using state level aggregate cross-sectional time series data from 1966 to 2004. By estimating the impact of density on fuel consumption, I improve the understanding of the conventional logic that there is a negative correlation between population density and transportation energy use due to reduced average travel distance and availability of alternative modes in denser area. In the second part, I examine various transportation energy policy instruments such as a fuel <b>tax,</b> a <b>mileage</b> based VMT <b>tax,</b> Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, a Pay-at-the-pump (PATP), and a Pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance premium to measure policy impacts through computerized policy simulations. By fully integrating three interrelated economic demand decisions - size of vehicle stock, use of the vehicle stock, and energy efficiency - it can predict short-run, long-run, and dynamic effects of a policy change. The impacts are measured in terms of vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and cost savings. I also examine the impact of transportation energy policies on traffic safety {{in terms of the number}} of traffic accidents, traffic fatalities, and total accident costs. The outcome of this research provides a set of specific results comparing policy scenarios in a consistent manner. The results will provide guidance concerning whether the policy option would reduce energy dependency as well as undesirable side effects such as environmental problems and safety problems of motor-vehicle travel.

40|$|Funding for {{the federal}} Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is not {{keeping up with the}} deteriorating {{condition}} of America?s roads and bridges. HTF outlays have exceeded revenues in almost every year since 2001, and the fund faces an estimated shortfall of $ 167 billion over the next ten years.

They recommend a congestion-adjusted vehicle <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> (VMT) as an economically efficient means of tackling infrastructure funding issues in a way that reflects the costs of road use.

In this paper we estimate the increased probability of fatalities from {{being hit by a}} heavier vehicle in a collision.

Estimation results further suggest that the fatality risk is even higher if the striking vehicle is a light truck (SUV, pickup truck, or minivan). We calculate that the value of the external risk generated by the gain in fleet weight since 1989 is approximately 27 cents per gallon of gasoline. We further calculate that the total fatality externality is roughly equivalent to a gas tax of $ 1. 08 per gallon.

Better, however, would be a mileage-based tax because that comes closer to reflecting these externalities; better still would be one that varies with congestion, emissions of local pollutants, or potential for a vehicle to inflict damage on others in a collision. The case for fuel efficiency standards relies primarily on the strength of and reasons for consumer undervaluation of fuel efficiency when making vehicle purchase decisions.

40|$|AbstractFor {{more than}} a decade, {{transportation}} officials in the US have been concerned that, at current levels, the fuel tax, which is the primary surface transportation funding source in the US, would not provide enough revenue to satisfy the ever rising transportation needs. Political and public support for raising the fuel tax is lacking, and fuel tax revenue has not kept pace with construction costs {{because it is not}} indexed to inflation. Increase in fuel efficiency is expected to reduce the fuel tax revenue. While there are many funding alternatives such as increasing the fuel tax, replacing it with a mileage based tax, increasing sales tax and tolling, officials from transportation agencies and policy makers need to reach a consensus on the best or preferable alternative to be implemented. Due to the differences in their backgrounds as well as their objectives, they may have different priorities. In this research, the authors organize a structured communication among many Texas-based transportation officials and the Texas Legislative Committee members’ staff using the Delphi method to obtain their opinions about the criteria and their weights to be used for evaluating transportation funding alternatives. Through this process, the authors try to build a consensus among the members of this expert panel by feeding back the group response for their review. The result of this survey is a set of criteria and their weights, which can be used to evaluate transportation funding alternatives for the state of Texas. The criteria weights seem to indicate that the panelists recognize the importance of public opinion and its impact on reaching a legislative solution. The panelists appear to be less concerned about criteria that may be addressed through modifications to the funding alternatives and research. This research shows that the funding policy is not seen as a tool for improving user efficiency, which opposes the common view in the literature that encourages replacement of fuel tax with a vehicle <b>mileage</b> <b>tax</b> involving high implementation and operating cost...|$|E
