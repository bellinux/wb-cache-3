25|$|During development, it {{was found}} that the rifle was not only solidly {{designed}} and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867's 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a <b>magazine</b> <b>loader,</b> {{it was found}} that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of 4 meters (12ft) towards a rocky surface in order to see if any of the rounds in the magazine would go off. Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.|$|E

Ted Ismert made the spun-closed stub-outs and Ed Ismert sold them to plumbers through Double I Supply. Later, Ted automated production by building a <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> for his spinning machine.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} production {{feature of}} the Austen was that some parts were manufactured by the diecasting process. These parts were the magazine housing, part of the mechanism for the stock and the forward half of the magazine. The <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> was also diecast. The two firms manufacturing the Austen were specialist diecasting companies.|$|E

5000|$|Loading a STANAG magazine, {{particularly}} {{one with}} a large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds {{to the top of}} the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler. These are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as <b>magazine</b> <b>loaders,</b> stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. There are a wide range of both commercial and military type loading tools available for STANAG magazines. For example; draft STANAG 4181 is a type of stripper clip and guide tool proposed for standardization based on the USGI M16 rifle stripper clips and guide tools.|$|R
5000|$|Loading {{a firearm}} magazine, {{particularly}} {{one with a}} large capacity and a corresponding high spring pressure pushing the rounds {{to the top of}} the magazine, can be quite difficult. A number of devices are available to make this task simpler, which are sometimes called speedloaders but are more commonly known as <b>magazine</b> <b>loaders,</b> stripper clips, spoons, or stripper clip guides. The simplest are inexpensive devices that depress the top round in the magazine, allowing the next round to be partially inserted with no pressure on it. These are also called [...] "thumb savers", and address ease of loading more than speed of loading. There are also devices available for certain popular firearms, such as the Ruger 10/22, that accept loose ammunition and will load a round into the magazine with a simple push of a button or turn of a crank. These are more complex and expensive (US$25 to US$50), but are more truly a speedloader since they do greatly reduce the time required to load a magazine.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the solid slugs produced in Plant 6, hollow fuel element production was started about January 1, 1956. Hollow slug blanks were produced oversize on a 2⅝" [...] RB-6 Acme-Gridley machine and were centerless ground before the drilling operation. The oversize slug blank was then loaded into a <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> on a 1⅝" [...] Acme and thence through a four-step drilling operation making a hole halfway through the blank. The blank was then reversed and again placed in the <b>magazine</b> <b>loader.</b> After a four-step drilling sequence produces a hole {{all the way through}} the blank, a reamer was passed through this hole in the final position. The oversize Outer Diameter was turned concentric with the finished Inner Diameter on an automatic Sundstrand lathe. Subsequent operations were the same as those for the solid slug.|$|E

5000|$|A semi-automatic, self-loading, or [...] "auto loader" [...] firearm is {{one that}} {{performs}} all steps necessary to prepare it for firing again after a single discharge, until cartridges are no longer available in the weapon's feed device or <b>magazine.</b> Auto <b>loaders</b> fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. Some people confuse the term with [...] "fully automatic" [...] firearms. (See next.) While some semi-automatic rifles may resemble military-style firearms, they are not properly classified [...] "Assault Weapons" [...] which refers to those that continue to fire until the finger no longer depressed the trigger.|$|R

50|$|He {{began his}} career after leaving school {{at the age of}} fifteen in 1930, and {{initially}} worked in the film industry at the Stoll Film Studios in Cricklewood. Here he worked first as a clapper boy, then {{during the course of the}} decade worked his way up to become <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> and then an assistant cameraman. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, he joined the Royal Fusiliers, but was quickly seconded to the army's film unit, making documentary and propaganda films.|$|E
50|$|However, arms {{designer}} Kijiro Nambu {{did nothing}} to address the dimensional tolerance issue between the bolt and gun barrel, which led to frequent failures when fired cases became stuck in the chamber. In order to ensure reliable feeding (theoretically), Nambu resorted to oiling the cartridges via an oil pump in the <b>magazine</b> <b>loader.</b> In practice, this tended to worsen the problem instead, as the oiled cartridges tended to become coated with dust and sand. This feature and its inherent faults was dropped {{with the introduction of}} the Type 99 light machine gun.|$|E
5000|$|Stripper clips were {{originally}} employed in infantry bolt-action rifles, {{such as the}} Russian Mosin-Nagant, the British Lee-Enfield, and the German Gewehr 98 and its variant the Mauser K98k, the related US Springfield M1903 and many others. [...] Stripper clips were also employed in newer, semi-automatic rifles with internal box magazines, such as the Soviet SKS and Egyptian Hakim Rifle. Many early semi-automatic pistols also used stripper clips to reload, including the Mannlicher M1894, the Roth-Steyr M1907, the Mauser C96. Currently {{they are used to}} top-off detachable box magazines for semi-automatic and automatic rifles. A <b>magazine</b> <b>loader</b> is placed on the lip of the box magazine, the clip is placed inside the loader, and then the rounds are pushed into the magazine.|$|E

40|$|Development of {{the ability}} to {{automatically}} assemble surface mount devices on circuits is described, including the characterization of the assembly process and improvements made to the system to increase the accuracy and repeatability of this process. The accuracy and repeatability of the system were characterized by measurements of the individual system components as well as the actual placement of components on a specially designed gauge. The forces and stresses experienced by the components when handled by the system were analyzed. The ability to deliver surface mount components to the system was developed by the design and development of stick magazines, vibratory feeders, a feeder control system, and an automatic stick <b>magazine</b> <b>loader...</b>|$|E
