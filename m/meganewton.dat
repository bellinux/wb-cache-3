2500|$|In {{the initial}} phase of liftoff, the Saturn V launch vehicle was {{powered by the}} {{reaction}} of liquid oxygen with RP-1. [...] For the five 6.4 <b>meganewton</b> sea-level thrust F-1 rocket engines of the Saturn V, burning together, the reaction generated roughly 1.62×1011 watts (J/s) (162 gigawatt) or 217 million horsepower.|$|E
50|$|Sänger {{agreed to}} lead a rocket {{development}} team in the Lüneburger Heide region in 1936. He gradually conceived a rocket-powered sled that would launch a bomber with its own rocket engines that would climb to the fringe of space and then skip along the upper atmosphere - not actually entering orbit, but able to cover vast distances {{in a series of}} sub-orbital hops. This remarkable design was called the Silbervogel ("Silverbird") and would have relied on its fuselage creating lift (as a lifting body) to carry it along its sub-orbital path. Sänger was assisted in this design by mathematician Irene Bredt, whom he married in 1951. Sänger also designed the rocket motors that the space-plane would use, which would need to generate 1 <b>meganewton</b> (225,000 lbf) of thrust. In this design, {{he was one of the}} first to suggest using the rocket's fuel as a way of cooling the engine, by circulating it around the rocket nozzle before burning it in the engine.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the EMRP Joint Research Project SIB 63 “Force” with the title “Force traceability within the <b>meganewton</b> range”, WP 2, aiming to extend the traceability of the force measurements to the higher part of the scale, a new and innovative type of Build-Up System (BUS) force transducer, with a capacity of 5 MN, has been designed and realized by INRIM. It is composed by six Uniaxial Force Transducers (UFTs) and it has a hexapod-shape. It can be used to extend the scale from 1 MN to 5 MN with internal traceability for the vertical (axial) force and, thanks to his scheme, additionally provides measurements of transversal forces, bending and torsion moments. In the paper, the description of the design, of the calibration procedure and of the data analysis is provided...|$|E
40|$|Tensile and stress-rupture {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on wires of W-Hf-C, W-Re-Hf-C, ASTAR 811 C (a tantalum alloy), and B- 88 (a columbium alloy) at room temperature, 1093 C (2000 F), and 1204 C (2200 F). Metallographic examinations were also made of the wire microstructure after testing. Ultimate tensile strength values up to 2170 <b>meganewtons</b> per square meter (314000 psi) at 1093 C (2000 F) and 1940 <b>meganewtons</b> per square meter (281 000 psi) at 1204 C (2200 F) were obtained for W-Re-Hf-C wire. The best strength values obtained for a 100 -hour rupture life were, 1410 <b>meganewtons</b> per square meter (205 000 psi) at 1093 C (2000 F) and 910 <b>meganewtons</b> per square meter (132 000 psi) at 1240 C (2200 F) for W-Re-Hf-C wire. The properties obtained suggested that the wires studied showed promise as potential fiber reinforcement in the 1093 to 1204 C (2000 to 2200 F) temperature range...|$|R
50|$|The Atlas V first stage, the Common Core Booster (CCB), is 12.5 ft (3.8 m) in {{diameter}} and 106.6 ft (32.5 m) in length. It {{is powered by a}} single Russian RD-180 main engine burning 627,105 lb (284,450 kg) of liquid oxygen and RP-1. The booster operates for about four minutes, providing about 4 <b>meganewtons</b> (860,000 lbf) of thrust. Thrust can be augmented with up to five Aerojet strap-on solid rocket boosters, each providing an additional 1.27 <b>meganewtons</b> (285,500 lbf) of thrust for 94 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Rocket {{technology}} can combine very high thrust (<b>meganewtons),</b> very high exhaust speeds (around 10 times {{the speed of}} sound in air at sea level) and very high thrust/weight ratios (>100) simultaneously as well as being able to operate outside the atmosphere, and while permitting the use of low pressure and hence lightweight tanks and structure.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{multicomponent}} dynamometers {{are required}} with capacities in the <b>meganewton</b> range, {{for a number}} of purposes ranging from improvement of existing force standards to routine checks on material testing machines. Owing to size constraints, elastic element configuration is almost invariably limited to single-billet style; advantage is taken of current strain gage technique for first order compensation right at bridge level of the influence of the main error originating sources. Transducer construction is therefore well within the reach of most laboratories having the required proficiency in strain gage work; commercially available instrumentation is more than adequate for excitation, signal conditioning and recording as required. Data processing is no problem either thanks to the ubiquitous microprocessor. The catch however is that for measurement exploitation purposes the relationship between applied load components and output signals must be known within a level of uncertainty consistent with the requirements of the problem at hand. As these may not infrequently entail evaluation of minute components in view of their compensation or elimination as for as possible, accurate assessment of some second order terms may then be necessary. At medium to low force/moment capacities, that is within the range of large wind tunnel testing work, say up to the order of 105 N and 104 Nm, the problem is only one of time, and cost. Facilities and procedures are available capable of yielding routinely all reasonable requirements at state of the art level. The picture however is a completely different one when the limits of these facilities are exceeded, and the outlay of the huge sums of money required to make a large capacity installation is out of question. In these conditions one finds that but a subset of the component combinations required for regular second order model fitting and validation may be applied, and educated guesses only instead of hard facts are available as basis for estimation of some effects. Theoretical analysis and accumulated experience are drawn upon to offset at least to some extent the lack of specific experimental evidence...|$|E
50|$|The company {{purchased}} the McGregor, Texas, testing facilities of defunct Beal Aerospace, where it refitted the largest test {{stand at the}} facilities for Falcon 9 testing. On 22 November 2008, the stand tested the nine Merlin 1C engines of the Falcon 9, which deliver 350 metric-tons-force (3.4-meganewtons) of thrust, well under the stand's capacity of 1,500 metric-tons-force (15 <b>meganewtons).</b>|$|R
50|$|Teradyne {{was founded}} by Alex d’Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and {{set up shop in}} rented space above Joe and Nemo’s hotdog stand in {{downtown}} Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 <b>meganewtons</b> (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force).|$|R
50|$|The Orion nuclear pulse drive {{combines}} {{a very high}} exhaust velocity, from 19 to 31 km/s (12 to 19 mi/s) in typical interplanetary designs, with <b>meganewtons</b> of thrust. Many spacecraft propulsion drives can achieve one of these or the other, but nuclear pulse rockets are the only proposed technology that could potentially meet the extreme power requirements to deliver both at once (see spacecraft propulsion for more speculative systems).|$|R

Lifetimes ranged from 5 to 2065 hours. The creep-rupture {{strength of the}} tubes was 50 percent {{lower than that of}} unwelded, thick sheet specimens, and 20 percent lower than that of unwelded, thin sheet specimens.

50|$|Due {{to their}} ability to harness the power of what is {{essentially}} a continuous nuclear fission explosion, NSWRs would have both very high thrust and very high exhaust velocity, meaning that the rocket would be able to accelerate quickly as well as be extremely efficient in terms of propellant usage. Such an engine being able to produce both high thrust and high ISP is a very rare trait in the rocket world, owing to the possibility to use a low density propellant such as hydrogen. One design would generate 13 <b>meganewtons</b> of thrust at 66 km/s exhaust velocity (compared to ~4.5 km/s exhaust velocity for the best chemical rockets of today).|$|R

40|$|Most suspension-feeding trichopterans spin a fine-silk capture net {{that is used}} {{to remove}} {{suspended}} matter from the water. The efficiency of these nets has previously been studied by considering the geometry of the web structure but the material from which the nets is constructed has received little attention. We report measurements of the tensile strength and extensibility of net silk from Hydropsyche siltalai. These measurements place caddisfly silk as one of the weakest natural silks so far reported, with a mean tensile strength of 221 +/- 22 <b>megaNewtons</b> (MN) /m(2). We also show that H. siltalai silk can more than double in length before catastrophic breakage, and that the silk is at least 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the maximum force estimated to act upon it in situ. Possible reasons for this disparity include constraints of evolutionary history and safety margins to prevent net failure or performance reduction...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the structural integrity and effective thermal conductivity of three metallic-ceramic composite coatings was conducted. These coatings were plasma sprayed onto the combustion side of water-cooled, 12. 7 -centimeter throat diameter, hydrogen-oxygen rocket thrust chambers operating at 2. 07 to 4. 14 <b>meganewtons</b> per square meter chamber pressure. The metallic-ceramic composites functioned for six to 17 cycles and {{for as long as}} 213 seconds of rocket operations and could have probably provided their insulating properties for many additional cycles. The effective thermal conductivity of all the coatings was in the range of 0. 7472 to 4. 483 w/(m) (K), which makes the coatings a very effective thermal barrier. Photomicrographic studies of cross-sectioned coolant tubes seem to indicate that the effective thermal conductivity of the coatings is controlled by contact resistance between the particles, {{as a result of the}} spraying process, and not the thermal conductivity of the bulk materials...|$|R
