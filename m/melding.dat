50|$|During {{the first}} trick, players {{announce}} <b>melds,</b> scoring combinations of cards that they hold. The {{team with the}} highest ranking <b>meld</b> scores all their <b>melds,</b> while the other team scores nothing for <b>melds.</b> The rank and point values for <b>melds</b> are listed above. No card {{may be used in}} more than one <b>meld.</b> Among sequences of equal length, the one with higher cards wins; if the rank of the cards is also equal, a trump sequence beats a non-trump sequence. If both teams have a sequence of equal rank and length in non-trump suits as their highest <b>meld,</b> neither team scores for <b>meld</b> on that deal. In order to score any <b>meld,</b> the player must announce it just before playing a card to the first trick. If both teams have announced the same kind of <b>meld</b> as their highest, then {{at the end of the}} first trick each must declare the rank, and if those are equal, whether or not the <b>meld</b> is in trump. The members of the team with the highest <b>meld</b> must show all the <b>melds</b> that they declared just before playing to the second trick. If the player does not announce the <b>meld</b> before playing the first trick or show the <b>meld</b> before playing the second, the <b>meld</b> is not scored.|$|R

We retrospectively calculated the pretransplant <b>MELD</b> scores of 226 consecutive adult grafts. We did not correct for hepatocellular carcinoma comorbidity or for the etiology of liver disease. Cases were categorized according to the <b>MELD</b> score: class I, <b>MELD</b> scores between 6 and 14 (low <b>MELD,</b> n = 116); class II, <b>MELD</b> score between 15 and 24 (intermediate <b>MELD,</b> n = 78); class III, <b>MELD</b> score between 25 and 42 (high <b>MELD,</b> n = 32). All patients were transplanted using deceased donors. Grafts were categorized also according to donor quality (standard donor vs nonstandard donor). Sorting into categories was performed before transplant by officers of the Central-South Italian Transplant Organization overregional organ procurement agencies, namely OCST. Differences in Kaplan-Meier graft survivals (GS) between low <b>MELD</b> class and high <b>MELD</b> class were statistically significant (P <. 01). Among standard donors, the 6 -month GS were 83 %, 94 %, and 63 % for the low, intermediate, and high <b>MELD</b> subset, respectively, differences that did not reach statistical significance. Among nonstandard donors, the 6 -month GS were 77 %, 71 %, and 38 % for the low, intermediate, and high <b>MELD</b> classes, respectively. Differences between low <b>MELD</b> class and intermediate <b>MELD</b> class and between low <b>MELD</b> class and high <b>MELD</b> class were statistically significant (P <. 01). We strongly suggest that the utilization of nonstandard organs should be avoided for patients with high <b>MELD</b> scoresfor patients with high <b>MELD</b> scores...|$|R

5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when <b>melding</b> with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a key difference between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E

40|$|Background: Liver {{allocation}} in Eurotransplant (ET) {{is based}} on the <b>MELD</b> score. Interlaboratory <b>MELD</b> score differences in INR and creatinine determination have been reported. The clinical implication of this observation has not been demonstrated. Methods: <b>MELD</b> scores were calculated in 66 patients with liver cirrhosis using bilirubin, creatinine, and INR analyzed in six liver transplant centers. Based on allocation results of ET, patients transplanted from December 2006 to June 2007 were divided according to <b>MELD</b> score in four groups. For each group, the influence of the match <b>MELD</b> on the probability of receiving a transplant was studied (Cox proportional hazards model).

40|$|Background. Several {{studies have}} shown that obese {{patients}} undergoing liver transplantation (LT) have an increased risk of mortality regardless of Model of End Stage Liver Disease (<b>MELD)</b> scores. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the range of body mass index (BMI) at LT associated with the lowest risks of posttransplant mortality by <b>MELD</b> category. Methods. A retrospective cohort of patients aged 18 years or older from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network database undergoing LT between February 27, 2002, and December 31, 2013, was identified and followed up through March 14, 2014. Patients' <b>MELD</b> score at the time of transplantation was categorized into 10 or lower (<b>MELD</b> 1), 11 to 18 (<b>MELD</b> 2), 19 to 24 (<b>MELD</b> 3), and 25 or higher (<b>MELD</b> 4). Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted. Results. Among 48 226 patients in the analytic cohort (14. 8 % were in <b>MELD</b> 1, 33. 7 % were in <b>MELD</b> 2, 19. 6 % were in <b>MELD</b> 3, and 32. 0 % were in <b>MELD</b> 4), 25 % died with mean follow-up of 1371 days. For <b>MELD</b> 1, patient BMI ranging from 30 to 33 was associated with a better survival outcome than BMI less than 30 or 33 or greater; for <b>MELD</b> 2, BMI ranging from 28 to 37 had a better survival outcome than BMI less than 28 or 37 or greater; for <b>MELD</b> 3, the survival outcome improved with an increasing BMI; for <b>MELD</b> 4, the survival outcome was not associated with patient BMI. Conclusions. This study provides evidence that obesity in LT patients is not necessarily associated with higher posttransplantation mortality and highlights the importance of the interaction between BMI and <b>MELD</b> category to determine their survival likelihood...|$|R
