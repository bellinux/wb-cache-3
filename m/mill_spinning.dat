50|$|The {{mid-19th century}} {{proved to be}} {{the first step in the}} {{industrialization}} of this municipality. A water system was devised to not only supply pure water for domestic use, but also to provide water power to such industries as a sawmill, planing mill, grist <b>mill,</b> <b>spinning</b> mill, pottery and a tannery. Many of these new establishments were either owned, started, or financed by George Tillson.|$|E
50|$|The site {{on which}} Lagan Valley Island was built once played a {{significant}} role in Lisburn's industrial past. Previously the site for the Island <b>Mill</b> <b>Spinning</b> Company, famous for the production on linen through it, production at the mill came to an end in 1983. When this happened, Lisburn City Council (then Lisburn Borough Council) purchased the site, and with funding assistance from the National Lottery to the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, regeneration of this site began.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the {{district}} {{was described by}} one observer as having [...] "extensive collieries, cotton mills and potteries", and famed for the manufacture of [...] "hinges, locks, files and nails". Mills such as the Record <b>Mill</b> (<b>Spinning),</b> situated in York Road, and the Makerfield Mill (the 'Weaving Shed'), in Windsor Road, took over from home-working. Similarly, Thomas Crompton & Sons in Gerard Street, which would eventually employ around 1,200 workers, superseded the subcontracting system that sustained substantial numbers of locally based blacksmiths and other craftsmen.|$|E
50|$|Pemberton's {{history was}} built on coal and cotton. The first May Mill was built in 1889 {{on the site of}} Wilde's Mill, a woollen mill built in 1850 and {{destroyed}} by fire on 13 June 1859. A second mill, known as Roper's Mill was built and also burnt down after a fire started in the engine house. In January 1889 the May <b>Mill</b> <b>Spinning</b> Company limited was formed to build a new fireproof mill to replace the one destroyed. The cornerstone was laid on 25 March 1889 and the engines, named Louisa and Helen, were dedicated in May 1890.|$|E
50|$|The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was {{registered}} in 1891 to build theMinerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later {{referred to as}} the Ashton syndicate. In April 1891, the syndicate registered the Rock <b>Mill</b> <b>Spinning</b> Company Ltd to build the Rock Mill.It was built with a capital of 60,000 GBP. The syndicate went on to build Atlas Mill, Curzon Mill, Tudor Mill, Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill.Construction was slow, it was not completed until August 1893. Even then only a third of its 66,000 spindles were working.|$|E

As of 2010 over 20 modern <b>spinning</b> <b>mills</b> this region {{has become one of the}} major centre [...] for <b>spinning</b> <b>mills</b> in India.

50|$|However, in 1860, the Oldham Limiteds {{concept was}} born. Initially, {{workers in the}} {{industry}} gathered together {{to build their own}} mill, but when the concept had been proven all started to speculate. This provided A.H.Stott many new mills to build, but also he indulged in the speculation. The Abbey <b>Mill</b> <b>Spinning</b> Company was registered in 1875, of the first 490 ₤5 shares taken up, 200 went to Abraham H. Stott and 200 to George Preston, a civil engineer. As a rule of thumb, a 58,000 spindle mill would cost about ₤64,000 to build or about ₤1.10 a spindle, and the architect would claim a 2½% fee. Abraham was not as active building mills as his brother Joseph in the 1870s. Example mills may be Butler Green Cotton Spinning Ltd, Chadderton (1862), Reddish Spinning Company Mills (1874), a finishing works for J. Chadwick & Co Ltd (1875), and John Broadbent & Sons, Oakfield Mill, Droylsden.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of breakage of PET (polyethylene terephthalate/cotton staple yarns {{has been investigated}} by study-ing the fibers removed from actual yarn breaks. Techniques have been devised that show the strain history of the PET fibers at a break and live the f: action of broken PET and cotton fibers. It is postulated that yarn breakage takes place in two stages: an initial rupture, followed by breakage of PET fibers spanning the "gap " formed. Such a mechanism may be common to all staple yarns, whether homo-yarns or blends, since 100 % PET staple yarns appear to behave similarly. These techniques were used to examine yarns broken during <b>mill</b> <b>spinning,</b> It appears that the mill breaks occurred by fiber slippage hefore the yarn was fully developed, probably at the drafting stage. This view is supported by comparison of the break frequency/load spectrum of the spun yarn with the spinning conditions. I’here have been many attempts to predict the strength of staple yarns based on theoretical grounds, but few attempts to study what actuallv happens at a break. The most comprehensive study is by Kem...|$|E
40|$|A {{bioassay}} technique using isolated guinea-pig ileum {{was employed}} to compare the smooth muscle contractor activity of various dusts from mills in which the prevalence of byssinosis was known. The activity of dust from a <b>mill</b> <b>spinning</b> a coarse grade of cotton was several times greater than that in dust from a mill processing a fine grade of cotton. There was a similar order in the difference of the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. However, the activities of fine cotton, flax, and jute dusts were very similar to each other, in spite of marked differences in the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. For cotton dust, smooth muscle contractor activity was associated with all particle sizes, although {{the lowest level of}} activity was found in the largest sized fraction (less than 2 mm). Activity in the cotton dust extracts was not correlated with nitrogen, carbohydrate, or potassium content. However, about one-fifth of the activity of a cotton dust extract was associated with an insoluble particulate fraction. The possible chemical nature of the water-soluble contractor agent is discussed. It is concluded that, until the role of this agent in the pathogenesis of byssinosis has been established, the bioassay technique cannot be employed as a means of assessing the byssinogenic potential of cotton dust...|$|E
