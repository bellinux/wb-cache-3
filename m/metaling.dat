50|$|FSP has {{benefits}} for when two materials’ {{would be needed}} to be mixed. “FSP is a short route, solid state processing technique with one-step processing that achieves microstructural refinement densification and homogeneity”(MA) FSW helps modify materials so that <b>metaling</b> down or changing the material drastically does not have to take place. FSP, for example, can easily change the form of a piece of material as sheets of metal, where before it may have had to be melted down before and put into a mold for it to cool and form. (Smith,Mishra) “The microstructure and mechanical properties of the processed zone can be accurately controlled by optimizing the tool design, FSP parameters an active cooling/heating.”(MA) The same sheet of metal can be modified to fit various situations with the proper modification of the tool. FSP has shown to make metallic alloys bendable as for example an alloy modified with FSP would be able to bend to 30 degrees as before it could only bend to seven.|$|E
