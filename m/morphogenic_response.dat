40|$|The Gab {{family of}} docking {{proteins}} (Gab 1 and Gab 2) are phosphorylated {{in response to}} various cytokines and growth factors. Gab 1 acts to diversify the signal downstream from the Met receptor tyrosine kinase through the recruitment of multiple signaling proteins, and is essential for epithelial morphogenesis. To determine whether Gab 1 and Gab 2 are functionally redundant, we have examined the role of Gab 2 in epithelial cells. Both Gab 1 and Gab 2 are expressed in epithelial cells and localize to cell-cell junctions. However, whereas overexpression of Gab 1 promotes a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response,</b> the overexpression of Gab 2 fails to induce this response. We show that Gab 2 recruitment to the Met receptor {{is dependent on the}} Grb 2 adapter protein. In contrast, Gab 1 recruitment to Met is both Grb 2 dependent and Grb 2 independent. The latter requires a novel amino acid sequence present in the Met-binding domain of Gab 1 but not Gab 2. Mutation of these residues in Gab 1 impairs both association with the Met receptor and the ability of Gab 1 to promote a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response,</b> whereas their insertion into Gab 2 increases Gab 2 association with Met, but does not confer on Gab 2 the ability to promote epithelial morphogenesis. We propose that the Grb 2 -independent recruitment of Gab proteins to Met is necessary but not sufficient to promote epithelial morphogenesis...|$|E

To gain further {{insight into the}} plant transcriptional response to apoplastic ROS, the phytotoxic atmospheric pollutant ozone {{was used as a}} model ROS inducer in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and gene expression was analyzed with microarrays. In contrast to the increase in signaling via the stress hormones salicylic acid, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene, ROS treatment caused auxin signaling to be transiently suppressed, which was confirmed with a DR 5 -uidA auxin reporter construct. Transcriptomic data revealed that various aspects of auxin homeostasis and signaling were modified by apoplastic ROS. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of auxin signaling showed that transcripts of several auxin receptors and Auxin/Indole- 3 -Acetic Acid (Aux/IAA) transcriptional repressors were reduced in response to apoplastic ROS. The ROS-derived changes in the expression of auxin signaling genes partially overlapped with abiotic stress, pathogen responses, and salicylic acid signaling. Several mechanisms known to suppress auxin signaling during biotic stress were excluded, indicating that ROS regulated auxin responses via a novel mechanism. Using mutants defective in various auxin (axr 1, nit 1, aux 1, tir 1 afb 2, iaa 28 - 1, iaa 28 - 2) and JA (axr 1, coi 1 - 16) responses, ROS-induced cell death was found to be regulated by JA but not by auxin.

40|$|Ethylene is a {{plant hormone}} {{that is of}} {{fundamental}} importance to in vitro morphogenesis, but in many species, {{it has not been}} thoroughly studied. Its relationship with polyamines has been studied mainly because the two classes of hormones share a common biosynthetic precursor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). In order to clarify whether competition between polyamines and ethylene influences in vitro morphogenetic responses of Passiflora cincinnata Mast., a climacteric species, different compounds were used that act on ethylene biosynthesis and action, or as ethylene scavengers. Treatment with the ethylene inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) caused a greater regeneration frequency in P. cincinnata, whereas treatment with the ethylene precursor, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic-acid (ACC) lessened regeneration frequencies. The data suggested that levels of polyamines and ethylene are not correlated with <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses</b> in P. cincinnata. It was ascertained that neither the absolute ethylene and polyamine levels, nor competition between the compounds, correlated to the obtained <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses.</b> However, sensitivity to, and signaling by, ethylene appears {{to play an important role}} in differentiation. This study reinforces previous reports regarding the requirement of critical concentrations and temporal regulation of ethylene levels for <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses.</b> Temporal regulation also appeared to be a key factor in competition between the two biosynthetic pathways, without having any effects on morphogenesis.

40|$|The dissociation, migration, and {{remodeling}} of epithelial monolayers {{induced by}} hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) entail modifications in cell adhesion {{and in the}} actin cytoskeleton through unknown mechanisms. Here we report that ezrin, a membrane–cytoskeleton linker, is crucial to HGF-mediated morphogenesis in a polarized kidney-derived epithelial cell line, LLC-PK 1. Ezrin is a substrate for the tyrosine kinase HGF receptor both in vitro and in vivo. HGF stimulation causes enrichment of ezrin recovered in the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton fraction. Overproduction of wild-type ezrin, by stable transfection in LLC-PK 1 cells, enhances cell migration and tubulogenesis induced by HGF stimulation. Overproduction of a truncated variant of ezrin causes mislocalization of endogenous ezrin from microvilli into lateral surfaces. This is concomitant with altered cell shape, characterized by loss of microvilli and cell flattening. Moreover, the truncated variant of ezrin impairs the <b>morphogenic</b> and motogenic <b>response</b> to HGF, thus suggesting a dominant-negative mechanism of action.

Because ethylene mediates several abiotic stresses in plants, here, we have examined the ethylene influence in both shoot and root systems of the epiphytic orchid Catasetum fimbriatum. Under controlled conditions, ethylene production was quantified during an entire growth cycle of C. fimbriatum development in vitro, while treatments modulating either ethylene concentration or perception were carried out over the early growth phase of these plants. After treatments, growth measurements and histological features were studied in both shoot and root tissues. Ethylene production showed a decreasing trend over the period of organ elongation; however, it increased considerably when leaves were shed, and a new axillary bud was initiating. The early exposure of young plants to higher concentrations of ethylene triggered <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses</b> that included root hair formation instead of velamen, and a combination of inhibitory effects (decreases in both stem enlargement and cellular/organ elongation) and inductive effects (increases in leaf and root formation, bud initiation and cellular thickening) on plant growth, which favored biomass allocation to roots.

However, this receptor has been implicated in the genesis of human breast and renal carcinomas, where ErbB 2 is amplified in 20 [...] 30 % of human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis. Using the non-transformed MDCK epithelial cell model, I have established that a deregulated activated ErbB 2 /Neu receptor (NeuNT) but not overexpression of the wild type (WT) receptor induces cell dispersal and motility, accompanied by the breakdown of cell-cell junctions and E-cadherin internalization, in addition to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. This phenotype can be reversed following treatment of the cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK, indicating that MEK dependent pathways {{are involved in the}} NeuNT-induced remodeling of cell-cell junctions. In three-dimensional cultures of MDCK cells, NeuNT but not WT ErbB 2 triggers a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response</b> that correlates with recruitment and increased phosphorylation levels of the Shc adapter protein. This demonstrates that the deregulated ErbB 2 /NT receptor induces a distinct biological response when compared to the wild type receptor and induces the loss of epithelial architecture observed in carcinomas. Invasive morphogenesis downstream from the Met/HGF receptor is modulated through a sustained phosphorylation of the Gab 1 docking protein and of downstream kinase (Erk). In contrast, a transient phosphorylation of Gab 1 and Erk induced by EGF is not sufficient to promote a <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response.</b> In Chapter III, I demonstrate that NeuNT but not the WT ErbB 2 receptor display elevated and sustained levels of Gab 1 and Erk phosphorylation which correlates with their ability to promote invasive morphogenesis. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation analyses provide evidence for the recruitment of Gab 1 to ErbB 2 /Neu in a Grb 2 -dependent and Grb 2 -independent manner. To identify physiologically relevant factors that synergize with ErbB 2, I established that HGF, the Met receptor ligand, promotes the disruption and invasion of NeuNT-induced epithelial structures in three dimensional matrix cultures. Moreover HGF synergizes with NeuNT, enhancing the invasive potential of NeuNT expressing cells ten fold through Matrigel. HGF treatment of NeuNT expressing cells promotes a decrease in E-cadherin protein, and can be blocked or reversed by treatment with the MEK inhibitor, UO 126, establishing the involvement of MEK-dependent pathways in this process. These results demonstrate that physiological signals downstream from HGF/Met cooperate with deregulated ErbB 2 /Neu to enhance the malignant phenotype promoting a more stable epithelial-mesenchymal transition and enhanced cell invasion...|$|E

In this study, it is shown that BABA induces the stress-induced <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response</b> (SIMR). SIMR is observed in plants exposed to sub-lethal stress conditions. Anthocyanin, a known modulator of stress signalling, {{was also found}} to accumulate in BABA-treated Arabidopsis. These data and a previous microarray study indicate that BABA induces a stress response in Arabidopsis. High concentrations of amino acids, except for L-glutamine, cause a general amino acid stress inhibition. General amino acid inhibition is prevented {{by the addition of}} L-glutamine. L-Glutamine was found to inhibit the BABA-mediated SIMR and anthocyanin accumulation, suggesting that the non-protein amino acid BABA causes a general amino acid stress inhibition in Arabidopsis. L-Glutamine also blocked BABA-induced resistance to heat stress and to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC 3000. During bacterial infection, priming of the salicylic acid-dependent defence marker PR 1 was abolished by L-glutamine treatment.

Adult inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells were found to express primarily Gpc 4 and to proliferate, migrate, and form tubules with HGF, correlating with sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Embryonic IMCD cells expressing predominantly Gpc 3 proliferated and migrated in response to HGF but activated ERK only transiently and failed to form tubules. Overexpressing Gpc- 4 but not Gpc- 3 or Gpc- 1 led to sustained HGF-stimulated ERK activation and rescued the tubulogenic response in these cells.

We report that neuregulin can also induce profound <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses</b> in cultured epithelial cells of different origins. These effects include scattering of small epithelial islands and rearrangement of larger cell islands into ordered ring-shaped arrays with internal lumens. The ring-forming cells are interconnected by cadherin- and �-catenincontaining adherens junctions. In confluent cultures, neuregulin treatment induces formation of circular lumenlike gaps in the monolayer. Both cell scattering and ring formation are accompanied by a marked increase in cell motility that is independent of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and its receptor (c-Met). Affinity-labeling experiments implied that a combination of ErbB- 2 with ErbB- 3 mediates the morphogenic signal of neuregulin in gastric cells. Indeed, a similar morphogenic effect could be reconstituted in nonresponsive cells by coexpression of ErbB- 2 and- 3.

A constitutively activated ErbB 2 /Neu receptor, NeuNT, promotes a similar invasive morphogenic program in MDCK cells. Because both receptors are expressed in breast epithelia, are associated with poor prognosis, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is expressed in stroma, we examined the consequence of cooperation between these signals. We show that HGF disrupts NeuNT-induced epithelial morphogenesis, stimulating the breakdown of cell-cell junctions, dispersal, and invasion of single cells. This correlates with a decrease in junctional proteins claudin- 1 and E-cadherin, {{in addition to the}} internalization of the tight junction protein ZO- 1. HGF-induced invasion of NT-expressing cells is abrogated by pretreatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) pathway, which restores E-cadherin and ZO- 1 at cell-cell junctions, establishing the involvement of MEK-dependent pathways in this process. These results demonstrate that physiological signals downstream from the HGF/Met receptor synergize with ErbB 2 /Neu to enhance the malignant phenotype, promoting the breakdown of cell-cell junctions and enhanced cell invasion. This is particularly important for cancers where ErbB 2 /Neu is overexpressed and HGF is a physiological growth factor found in the stroma...|$|E

We demonstrate that VEGF- 165 but not VEGF- 121 induces single-cell branching morphogenesis and multicellular tubulogenesis in mouse renal tubular epithelial cells and that these morphogenic effects require activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) and, to a lesser degree, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and protein kinase C signaling pathways. Further, VEGF- 165 -stimulated sheet migration is dependent only on PI 3 -K signaling. These morphogenic effects of VEGF- 165 require activation of both VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR- 2) and neuropilin- 1 (Nrp- 1), since neutralizing antibodies to either of these receptors or the addition of semaphorin 3 A (which blocks VEGF- 165 binding to Nrp- 1) prevents the <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response</b> and the phosphorylation of VEGFR- 2 along with the downstream signaling. We thus conclude that in addition to endothelial vasculogenesis, VEGF can induce renal epithelial cell morphogenesis in a Nrp- 1 -dependent fashion...|$|E
40|$|On the {{assumption}} that arsenic induces stress morphogenetic responses involved in As tolerance and hyperaccumulation in the Pteris vittata fern, we analyzed the root system of young sporophytes grown in 250, 334, and 500 M As for five days and for 14 days. Anatomical and histological analyses were performed in plants grown for five days to evaluate the number, position, length and differentiation pattern of root hairs. AgNOR staining, employed to study nucleolus behavior in root apices, showed that arsenic influences nucleolar activity (evaluated by nucleolus size, number and absorbance) in the root meristem. In plants treated with 250 and 334 M As an acropetal shift of root hair development {{and an increase in}} hair length and density were observed, linked to an ectopic pattern of differentiation. The opposite trend was recorded in plants treated with 500 M As. It is worth noting the presence of living border-like cells, not yet observed in ferns, and their increase following As treatments. Analysis and vitality of border-like cells were surveyed after 14 days of treatments. In conclusion As treatments elicited a stress-induced <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response</b> which, by modifying the differentiation pattern, number and length of root hairs, modulating nucleolar activity and interacting with the rhizosphere by inducing border-like cell production, may adjust the rate of root uptake and its metabolic activity...|$|E
40|$|Plant roots exhibit {{remarkable}} developmental plasticity {{in response}} to local soil conditions. It is shown here that mild salt stress stimulates a stress-induced <b>morphogenic</b> <b>response</b> (SIMR) in Arabidopsis thaliana roots characteristic of several other abiotic stresses: the proliferation of lateral roots (LRs) with a concomitant reduction in LR and primary root length. The LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR is dramatically enhanced by the transfer of seedlings from a low to a high NO 3 − medium, thereby compensating for the decreased LR length and maintaining overall LR surface area. Increased LR proliferation is specific to salt stress (osmotic stress alone has no stimulatory effect) and {{is due to the}} progression of more LR primordia from the pre-emergence to the emergence stage, in salt-stressed plants. In salt-stressed seedlings, greater numbers of LR primordia exhibit expression of a reporter gene driven by the auxin-sensitive DR 5 promoter than in unstressed seedlings. Moreover, in the auxin transporter mutant aux 1 - 7, the LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR is completely abrogated. The results suggest that salt stress promotes auxin accumulation in developing primordia thereby preventing their developmental arrest at the pre-emergence stage. Examination of ABA and ethylene mutants revealed that ABA synthesis and a factor involved in the ethylene signalling network also regulate the LR proliferation component of the salt SIMR...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} RON and the avian sea genes encode {{tyrosine kinase}} receptors of poorly characterized biological functions. We recently identified macrophage-stimulating protein as the ligand for Ron; no ligand {{has yet been}} found for Sea. In this work we investigated the biological response to macrophage-stimulating protein in mouse liver progenitor cells expressing Ron. These cells were also transfected with a chimeric cDNA encoding the cytoplasmic domain of Sea, fused to the extracellular domain of Trk (nerve growth factor receptor). In the presence of nanomolar concentrations of the respective ligands, both receptors induced cell "scattering", extracellular matrix invasion, and DNA synthesis. When liver progenitor cells were grown in a tri-dimensional type-I collagen matrix, ligand-induced stimulation of either Ron or Sea induced sprouting of branched cell cords, evolving into ductular-like tubules. The motogenic, mitogenic, and <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses</b> were also elicited by triggering the structurally related hepatocyte growth factor receptor (Met) but not epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor receptors. These data show that Ron, Sea, and Met belong to a receptor subfamily that elicits a distinctive biological response in epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|RON is {{a member}} of the {{receptor}} tyrosine kinase gene family that includes the MET oncogene, whose germline mutations have been causally related to human tumorigenesis. In vitro, RON and MET receptors cross-talk, synergize in intracellular signaling, and cooperate in inducing <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses.</b> Here we show that the RON and MET oncogenes were expressed in 55 % and 56 % of human ovarian carcinomas, respectively, and were significantly coexpressed in 42 % (P< 0. 001). In ovarian carcinoma samples and cell lines we did not find mutations in RON and MET gene kinase domain, nor coexpression of RON and MET receptor ligands (MSP and HGF, respectively). We show that motility and invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells coexpressing MET and RON receptors were elicited by HGF and, to a lesser extent, by MSP. More interestingly, invasion of both reconstituted basement membrane and collagen get was greatly enhanced by the simultaneous addition of the two ligands. These data suggest that coexpression of the MET and RON receptors confer a selective advantage to ovarian cancer cells and might promote ovarian cancer progression...|$|R
40|$|Attempts to use artificially lit {{cabinets}} to grow plants {{identical to}} those growing in sunlight have provided compelling evidence {{of the importance of}} light quality for plant growth. Changing the balance of red (R) to far-red (FR) radiation, but with a fixed photosynthetic input can shift the phytochrome photoequilibrium in a plant and generate large differences in plant growth. With FR enrichment the plants elongate, and may produce more leaf area and dry matter. Similar <b>morphogenic</b> <b>responses</b> are also obtained when light quality is altered only briefly (15 - 30 min) at the end-of-the-day. Conversely, for plants grown in natural conditions the response of plant form to selective spectral filtering has again shown that red and far-red wavebands are important as found by Kasperbauer and coworkers. Also, where photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) of sunlight have been held constant, the removal of far-red alone alters plant growth. With FR depletion plants grown in sunlight are small, more branched and darker green. Here we examine the implications for plant growth and flowering when the far-red composition of incident radiation in plant growth chambers is manipulated...|$|R
