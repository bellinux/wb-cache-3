The increase in road accidents every year is mostly linked to drivers’ fatigue. Therefore, posture comfort is an important aspect in <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design. The {{aim of this study}} is to design a <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> which is suitable for Malaysians. There are three main objectives in this study; firstly, to investigates the comfort level and safety system of the existing <b>driver's</b> <b>seat,</b> secondly, to identify and determine parameters which may affect comfort and the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> safety system, and lastly, to develop and design an ergonomic <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> Anthropometric data of drivers should be used during the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design stage. Critical dimensions of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> and anthropometric data must be taken into consideration in order to optimize the comfort level and safety of the seat. Previous studies showed that the evaluation of <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort should include both objective and subjective evaluations. The seat discomfort will negatively affect the driver's performance. All information pertaining to the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> design was obtained through research on the related subjects. In the data collection phase, the objective evaluation method was used in determining the seat's dimension while subjective evaluation was used to gather information on the drivers’ experience. Anthropometric data from 1405 male and female subjects were collected and stored in a database. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation on <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> discomfort was conducted on 100 male and female respondents. The SPSS software was used to analyse the data. Every parameter that affects the safety and comfort of the <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were then used to design a new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat.</b> The parameters that were taken into account are backrest height, cushion width, cushion length and adjustability. These parameters were then matched with the Malaysian drivers’ anthropometric data. Finally, the dimensions of the new <b>driver's</b> <b>seat</b> were determined: 520 mm cushion width; 380 mm cushion length, 480 mm backrest width, 407. 5 mm backrest height and 180 mm adjustability...|$|R

Real-time controllers for MRAs with on-o and continu-ously variable control schemes were developed in the integrated design and control environment of MATLAB/Simulink. The sensors used in experiments were tested to see how reconstructed velocity signals should aect output signals of the controllers to the MRA.
