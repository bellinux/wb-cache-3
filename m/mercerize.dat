40|$|Abstract: Polymeric {{materials}} {{reinforced with}} synthetic fibres such as glass provide advantage of high stiffness and high {{strength to weight}} ratio. Despite these advantages, {{the widespread use of}} synthetic fibre-reinforced polymer composite has a tendency to decline because of their high-initial cost and most importantly their adverse environmental impact. In this work, four different composites are prepared with untreated coconut fibres, NaOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibres, KOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibres and CSM glass fibres. A lot of studies are done earlier on NaOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibre composites. But, no studies are done specifically for KOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibre composites. So, KOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibre composites are prepared in this study. General purpose polyester resin is used for preparing all the compsites. The mechanical properties of composites are studied using the flexural test, impact test and tensile test. The mechanical properties of KOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibre composites are studied and compared with the mechanical properties of NaOH <b>mercerized</b> coconut fibre composites, untreated coconut fibre composites and CSM glass fibre composites...|$|R

40|$|Anisotropic {{nanostructures}} such as nano-wires, nano-tubes, nano-rods, nanoribbons, nano-layers, etc. {{are extremely}} attracted {{due to their}} larger surface area as compared to nano-particles. This research has targeted at fabrication of the metallic nano-wires through a simple one-step pad-dry method. The effects of <b>mercerizing</b> {{as one of the}} most common and important finishing treatments on cotton fabrics have been investigated. <b>Mercerized</b> and un-mercerized fabrics with the same structures have been treated and compared. SEM micrographs confirmed fabrication of the nano-wires with a high aspect ratio on the fiber surfaces oriented parallel with fiber axes. An enhanced potentiality for growing nano-wires with higher level of orientation has been observed for <b>mercerized</b> fabrics compared to un-mercerized ones. As it is well known, <b>mercerizing</b> can cause some structural changes in cotton fibers. Reduction of crystallinity as a result of this process (<b>mercerizing)</b> leads to increasing the amorphous regions which have a good potentiality for growing nano-structured materials. The higher moisture regains, absorbency, smoother morphology, etc. caused by <b>mercerizing</b> can direct the better growth of nano-structures on <b>mercerized</b> fabrics.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{concerned}} with sourcing for suitable and reliable, safe and cheap alternative <b>mercerizing</b> agents that may improve the mechanical properties of cotton / polyester blend fabric. The pH of the used liquor was evaluated. Cost analyses for the agents were investigated. Six alternative 19 - 23 % <b>mercerizing</b> agents were used (namely liquid NH 3, NH 4 OH, (NH 4) 2 C 2 O 4, CH 3 CH 2 OH, CH 3 COOH, (COOH) 2 and NaOH as the control) after bleaching the fabric respectively. The optimum experimental results for the <b>mercerizing</b> agents showed that 19 % NH 4 OH optimally improved the breaking load (16. 19 kgf) more than the control. The optimum value for breaking extension (24. 98 %) of the <b>mercerized</b> fabric was by 19 % (NH 4) 2 C 2 O 4 ranking the highest. 19 % CH 3 CH 2 OH <b>mercerized</b> fabric recorded the highest linear density (4. 6904 tex). 21 % NH 4 OH <b>mercerized</b> fabric ranked the highest for dry crease recovery (132 °). The alkalinity and acidity (pH) of the alternative agents after the <b>mercerizing</b> process were environmentally friendly {{in comparison with the}} highly alkaline NaOH (pH range of 12. 20 - 12. 30), hence unfriendly. The cost analysis revealed some of the alternative agents far cheaper than the NaOH. These imply that the alternative agents are suitable and reliable as <b>mercerizing</b> agents than NaOH. Therefore the alternative agents could be employed in the Textile Industry and commercially as <b>mercerizing</b> agents so that the world could be a better and safe place for fabric users...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{desizing}} and scouring stages {{were eliminated}} by <b>mercerizing</b> greige cotton fabrics for 5 min at different temperatures ranging from 15 to 90 °C in both slack and under tension states. Mercerization {{is one of}} the most common wet processing of cotton materials to improve their dyeing and physical properties following changes in fine structure, morphology and conformation of the cellulose chains occur during mercerization. The barium activity number was used to express the degree of mercerization of the <b>mercerized</b> fabrics. The ratio of IR peak heights (α 1372 cm - 1 /α 2900 cm - 1) obtained from treated fabrics was used to measure crystallinity index of <b>mercerized</b> cotton fabrics at various temperatures. It was observed that mercerization treatments decrease the cellulose crystallinity index where decrement in crystallinity index was varied in different mercerization conditions. Mercerization at low temperatures could increase dye uptake. Maximum dye uptake increase was observed at 35 °C for slack <b>mercerized</b> fabrics and at 65 °C for tension <b>mercerized</b> fabrics which were about 34 and 28. 2 % compared to un-mercerized fabric respectively.

30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the textile finishing processes for making a finished fabrics. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, <b>mercerizing</b> and dyeing process. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, <b>mercerizing</b> and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process <b>mercerizing</b> process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the yarn number, mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). Mercerised cotton fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the mercerisation process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. <b>Mercerizing</b> process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various chemical finishes. <b>Mercerized</b> cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|R

30|$|Thus, {{probably}} the denim fabric {{employed in the}} present study was subjected during its production to a chemical treatment to confer it a softer touch, which at the same time increased its hydrophilicity and, possibly, its affinity to the indigo dye. As a hypothesis, the denim fabric may have been subjected to mercerization in the secondary stage of textile processing. The process of <b>mercerizing</b> consists in applying cold concentrated caustic soda (sodium hydroxide - NaOH) on the tensioned fabric. The caustic soda reacts with the cellulose fibers of the cotton causing a swelling, leaving them with a more rounded profile and decreasing the amorphous regions of the cellulose.
