5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> the Land of Grapico. <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> the Land of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E

He made his stage debut at age 13, in a school production of George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan, and appearances in West Windsor-Plainsboro High School productions of <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis and You Can't Take It with You followed. At the Hun School he took acting classes at the McCarter Theatre on the Princeton campus, and after high school graduation he studied acting at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, eventually dropping out after he was cast in Dead Poets Society (1989). He twice enrolled in New York University's English program, but dropped out both times to pursue acting roles.|$|E

On casting Hunnam, del Toro stated: [...] "I saw him and I thought he had an earnest, really honest nature. And {{he was the kind}} of guy that I can relate to, as a male audience member I go, 'I like that guy. I would like to have a few beers with that guy' … he has an earthy quality." [...] Describing the character, Hunnam stated: [...] "When you <b>meet</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of the story, I've suffered a giant loss. Not only has it killed my sense of self-worth, but also my will to fight and keep on going. And then, Rinko and Idris, and a couple other people, bring me {{out of retirement}} to try to help with this grand push. I think that journey is a very relatable one. Everybody, at some point in their life, has fallen down and not felt like getting back up, but you have to, no matter how difficult it is." [...] Hunnam was also considered for the role of Prince Nuada in del Toro's previous film, [...] Paul Michael Wyers plays Raleigh as a child.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Johansson practiced acting by {{staring in}} the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in <b>Meet</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her {{brothers}} instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: [...] "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." [...] She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, {{in which she had}} only two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She remembers being on the set of the film, knowing instinctively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).|$|E
500|$|The term 'heavy metal', as it {{was used}} by Lester Bangs and Dave Marsh at Creem, {{referred}} to a sound best exemplified by albums such as Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II, Deep Purple's Deep Purple in Rock, and Black Sabbath's Paranoid. An examination {{of some of the}} lyrics from bands such as these show a lack of any explicitly negative themes. Led Zeppelin's [...] "Whole Lotta Love" [...] could just as well be a conversation between husband and wife, as not. Black Sabbath's [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] exactly parallels the blood red moon of the Book of Revelation by John of Patmos, while their [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] describes the ravages of drug abuse. Ozzy Osbourne could be heard preaching to his audience in the earlier song, [...] "Children of the Grave": [...] "Tell the world that love is still alive you must be brave; or the children of today are children of the grave." [...] Later, in the song [...] "In My Time of Dying", Robert Plant even pleaded to Jesus: [...] "Meet me Jesus, meet me; <b>Meet</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the middle of the air; if my wings should fail me Lord, please meet me with another pair." [...] Perhaps not overtly Christian, but songs such as these exhibited similar themes. Early heavy metal fans were viewed by the populace as a counterculture, just as the fans of rock and roll, in general, were. Early heavy metal lyrics and themes were often accused of challenging Christian values, and as the genre grew, some bands actually did.|$|E

500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds. The song, written solely by Swift, is in the key of D minor with Swift's vocals {{spanning}} two octaves, from F3 to C5. Johnathan Keefe claimed that [...] "the a capella [...] "Drop everything now" [...] exclamation simply commands attention, with the desperation in Swift’s call-to-action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste." [...] Bobby Peacock stated that [...] "I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is [...] hardly make-or-break. Perhaps my biggest {{problem is that the}} song's chorus undermines itself in the second half – it starts out emphatic [...] and anthemic as usual, but there's just no [...] "oomph" [...] on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated [...] ""Sparks Fly" [...] centers around a simple but effective hook—"I see sparks fly whenever you smile"—that further cements Swift’s reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, [...] "Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a [...] "bad idea," [...] she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: [...] "Drop everything now, <b>meet</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / ‘Cause I see sparks fly / Whenever you smile," [...] she sings insistently." ...|$|E
