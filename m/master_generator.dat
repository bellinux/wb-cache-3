40|$|Distribution {{of timing}} signals is an {{essential}} factor {{for the development of}} digital systems for telecommunication networks, integrated circuits and manufacturing automation. Originally, this distribution was implemented by using the master-slave architecture with a precise <b>master</b> clock <b>generator</b> sending signals to phase-locked loops (PLL) working as slave oscillators. Nowadays, wireless networks with dynamical connectivity and the increase in size and operation frequency of the integrated circuits suggest that the distribution of clock signals could be more efficient if mutually connected architectures were used. Here, mutually connected PLL networks are studied and conditions for synchronous states existence are analytically derived, depending on individual node parameters and network connectivity, considering that the nodes are nonlinear oscillators with nonlinear coupling conditions. An expression for the network synchronisation frequency is obtained. The lock-in range and the transmission error bounds are analysed providing hints to the design of this kind of clock distribution system. FAPESPCNP...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of a cueing system, the <b>Master</b> Cue <b>Generator</b> (MCG) used to trigger performers (humans or computers) over an IP-based network. The performers are scattered in several locations and receive cues to help them interact musically over the net- work. The paper proposes a classification of cues that dynamically evolve and reshape as the performance takes place. This begets the explo- ration of various issues such as how to represent and port a hierarchy of control over a net- worked music performance (NMP) and also takes into account parameters inherent to a net- work such as latency and distance. This ap- proach is based on several years of practice-led research in the field of NMP, a discipline that is gaining grounds within the music technology community both as a practice and through the development of tools and strategies for interact- ing over disparate locations...|$|R
40|$|Synchronization is an {{essential}} feature {{for the use of}} digital systems in telecommunication networks, integrated circuits, and manufacturing automation. Formerly, master-slave (MS) architectures, with precise <b>master</b> clock <b>generators</b> sending signals to phase-locked loops (PLLs) working as slave oscillators, were considered the best solution. Nowadays, the development of wireless networks with dynamical connectivity and the increase of the size and the operation frequency of integrated circuits suggest that the distribution of clock signals could be more efficient if distributed solutions with fully connected oscillators are used. Here, fully connected networks with second-order PLLs as nodes are considered. In previous work, how the synchronous state frequency for this type of network depends on the node parameters and delays was studied and an expression for the long-term frequency was derived (Piqueira, 2006). Here, by taking the first term of the Taylor series expansion for the dynamical system description, it is shown that for a generic network with N nodes, the synchronous state is locally asymptotically stable...|$|R

40|$|In the CERN 26 Gev Proton Synchrotron (PS) {{accelerator}} network, super-cycles {{are defined}} as sequences {{of different kinds of}} beams produced repetitively [Fig. 1]. Each of these beams is characterised by attributes such as particle type, beam energy, its route through the accelerator network, and the final end user. The super-cycle is programmed by means of an editor through which the operational requirements of the physics programme can be described. Each beam in the normal sequence may later be replaced by a set of spare beams automatically depending on software and hardware interlocks and requests presented to the <b>Master</b> Timing <b>Generator</b> (MTG [Glos. 1]). The MTG calculates at run time how each beam is to be manufactured, and sends a telegram [Glos. 3] message to each accelerator, just before each cycle, describing what it should be doing now and during the next cycle. These messages, together with key machine timing events and clocks are encoded onto a timing distribution drop net where they are distributed around the PS complex to VME-standard timing reception TG 8 [Glos. 8] modules which generate output pulses and VME bus interrupts for task synchronisation. The TG 8 modules are able to use accelerator-related clocks such as the incremental/ decremental magnetic field trains, or the beam revolution and radio frequencies to produce high precision beam synchronous timing. Timing Surveillance Modules (TSM) monitor these timings, which give high precision interval measurements used for the machine tuning, beam diagnostics, and fault detection systems...|$|R
40|$|The master {{equation}} {{describing the}} non-equilibrium dynamics of a quantum dot coupled to metallic leads is considered. Employing a superoperator approach, we derive an exact time-convolutionless master equation for the probabilities of dot states, i. e., a time-convolutionless Pauli <b>master</b> equation. The <b>generator</b> of this <b>master</b> equation is derived order by {{order in the}} hybridization between dot and leads. Although the generator {{turns out to be}} closely related to the T-matrix expressions for the transition rates, which are plagued by divergences, in the time-convolutionless generator all divergences cancel order by order. The time-convolutionless and T-matrix master equations are contrasted to the Nakajima-Zwanzig version. The absence of divergences in the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation due to the nonexistence of secular reducible contributions becomes rather transparent in our approach, which explicitly projects out these contributions. We also show that the time-convolutionless generator contains the generator of the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equation in the Markov approximation plus corrections, which we make explicit. Furthermore, it is shown that the stationary solutions of the time-convolutionless and the Nakajima-Zwanzig master equations are identical. However, this identity neither extends to perturbative expansions truncated at finite order nor to dynamical solutions. We discuss the conditions under which the Nakajima-Zwanzig-Markov master equation nevertheless yields good results. Comment: 13 pages + appendice...|$|R
30|$|Three Caterpillar D 3512 {{diesel engines}} (Peoria, IL, USA) {{are the main}} power source of the {{isolated}} wind-diesel power plant [1]. Diesel generators are with the following specifications: 4.16 [*]kV, 1, 200 [*]rpm, and 925 [*]kW with a power factor of about 0.85. Each of the diesel units (CAT 3512, 1, 400 -hp engine with a 925 -kW generator) is equipped with an automatic voltage regulator and a governor system. Two frequency control modes are used including (1) a speed-droop characteristic for fast load following capability and (2) an isochronous mode for load sharing and frequency regulation. One {{or two of the}} three diesel generators are normally required to supply the local community load. Parallel operation and cycling periods of the diesel generators are coordinated by the diesel <b>generator's</b> <b>master</b> controller. The wind energy system consists of six Windmatic wind turbines (OR, USA), a 200 -kW controllable dump load, and six capacitor banks. The Windmatic WM 15 S is a horizontal axis, two-speed, upwind turbine which uses two induction generators, a 65 -kW and a 13 -kW unit for the energy conversion and direct connection to the distribution system. A 30 -kvar fixed capacitor bank is connected in parallel with the output of each wind turbine to partially compensate for the reactive power needs of the induction generators. The start-up of the 65 -kW wind turbines is currently assisted by the diesel plants; each wind turbine operates as a motor until it is accelerated beyond synchronous speed, at which point it begins to generate power. The diesel plant also provides the balance of the reactive power, while the capacitor banks are switched on/off to correct the wind plant's power factor to above 0.9.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. Ozone (03) {{is used as}} a {{steriliser}} of air and water, but {{the nitrogen}} oxides (NOx) are harmful to man and the environment. Ozone generators excite electrons to higher energy levels so that O 3 and NOx can be manufactured from oxygen and nitrogen in the air feed. The factors that influence the NOx production in domestic ozone generators, in particular Sterizone ozone generators were investigated, so that their design, operation and marketability could be improved. Sterizone ozone generators are designed with an exceptionally fast change in electrical field of 3 x 10 xy 8 V mm- 1 s- 1 with the aim of optimalising ozone production and decreasing NOx production. In this study it was found that Sterizone does produce NOx. After optimalising the analytical methods, the influence of the following reaction conditions on the production of O 3 and NOx by Sterizone was investigated: 1) Feed of synthetic air 2) Water vapour pressure of the feed gas 3) N 2 / 02 ratio of the feed gas 4) Contaminants in the air feed 5) C 02 in the air feed 6) Change in the frequency of the pulses 7) Temperature of the feed gas It was found that the Sterizone unit showed comparable properties with other ozone generators. High temperatures lower the ozone production so that the air feed must remain sufficiently high to prevent overheating which leads to high N 0,/ 03 ratios. The ozone production of Sterizone is dependent {{on the quality of the}} environmental air. Air humidity and contaminants like diesel fuel, ethanol, paraffin and xylene vapours lead to a drastic decrease in O 3 production. Carbon dioxide on the other hand causes a much smaller decrease in ozone production. No reaction conditions were found that led to a significant lowering of NO, production. The determination of nitrogen oxides was problematic and better analytical methods should be developed. It is recommended that an investigation is done into the possibility of removing the nitrogen oxides by means of an external filter or decreasing the product by means of ultraviolet radiation. The development of a more comprehensive theoretical model for the ozone formation processes will be beneficial to the optimalisation of ozone <b>generators.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|R
