5|$|During {{the first}} two seasons of the 1970s, Nea Salamina {{finished}} {{in the middle of}} the table; the next two seasons threatened relegation, which was avoided.

Its offices were housed temporarily at the offices of Alki Larnaca F.C. and in January 1975 acquired a rented building. Expenses were paid with contributions from <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends</b> of the club. Two youth academies were founded, in Larnaca and Limassol.|$|E

This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family <b>members</b> <b>and</b> <b>friends.</b> He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E
