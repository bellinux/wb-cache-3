40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{experimental}} and theoretical study of irregular, tetrahedral <b>microwave</b> <b>networks</b> consisting of coaxial cables (annular waveguides) connected by T-joints. The spectra of the networks were measured in the frequency range 0. 0001 - 16 GHz {{in order to obtain}} their statistical properties such as the integrated nearest neighbor spacing distribution and the spectral rigidity. The comparison of our experimental and theoretical results shows that <b>microwave</b> <b>networks</b> can simulate quantum graphs with time reversal symmetry. In particular, we use the spectra of the <b>microwave</b> <b>networks</b> to study the periodic orbits of the simulated quantum graphs. We also present experimental study of directional <b>microwave</b> <b>networks</b> consisting of coaxial cables and Faraday isolators for which the time reversal symmetry is broken. In this case our experimental results indicate that spectral statistics of directional <b>microwave</b> <b>networks</b> deviate from predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) in random matrix theory approaching, especially for small eigenfrequency spacing s, results for Gaussian unitary ensembles (GUE). Experimental results are supported by the theoretical analysis of directional graphs. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures, to be published in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

2500|$|Delivering {{competitive}} {{telecommunications services}} to regional {{and rural areas}} is a major issue, with Telstra often providing the only telecommunications backhaul transmission infrastructure. The large distance and small population means that providers interested in serving these areas often must invest large amounts of capital with low returns.

2500|$|In the 1950s, as a war-torn Europe rebuilt itself, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)—based in Switzerland—set up {{an ad hoc}} {{committee}} to search for ways of bringing together {{the countries of the}} EBU around a [...] "light entertainment programme". At a committee meeting held in Monaco in January 1955 with Marcel Bezençon of the Swiss television as chairman, the committee conceived the idea (initially proposed by Sergio Pugliese of the Italian television RAI) of an international song contest where countries would participate in one television programme to be transmitted simultaneously to all countries of the union. The competition was based upon the existing Sanremo Music Festival held in Italy and was seen as a technological experiment in live television, as in those days it was a very ambitious project to join many countries together in a wide-area international network. Satellite television did not exist, and the Eurovision Network comprised a terrestrial <b>microwave</b> <b>network.</b> The concept, then known as [...] "Eurovision Grand Prix", was approved by the EBU General Assembly in a meeting held in Rome on 19 October 1955, and it was decided that the first contest would take place in spring 1956 in Lugano, Switzerland. The name [...] "Eurovision" [...] was first used in relation to the EBU's network by British journalist George Campey in the London Evening Standard in 1951.|$|E
2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines <b>microwave</b> <b>network.</b> [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E

Compared with the existing results, the prototype has a wider bandwidth, lower insertion loss, better return loss, isolation, and imbalances. Secondly, two typical linear waveguide slotted arrays are designed. Both the radiation patterns and scattering parameters at the input ports agree well with the desired goals. Finally, the feeding network of a two-element microstrip antenna array is optimized to decrease the mismatch at the input port, and a good impedance matching is successfully achieved...|$|R
