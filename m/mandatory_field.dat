The objective {{of the current study}} was to explore factors that help pharmacists identify and thus prevent harm from incorrect drug prescribing errors in an ambulatory care setting. MethodsAt the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, a tertiary care referral hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, medication error reports from the pharmacy are initiated by the pharmacist and reviewed by the quality control department and medication safety officer. This was a retrospective study in the hospital ambulatory care pharmacies including incorrect drug error reports from January 2011 until September 2012. Reports were reviewed by two pharmacists to ensure the accuracy of data classification. Factors contributing to the identification of incorrect drug prescribing errors were identified. ResultsDuring the study period, a total of 2073 prescribing errors were included in the hospital Safety Reporting System. Incorrect drug prescribing errors identified by pharmacists comprised 203 reports (10 %). Factors contributing to the identification of incorrect drug prescribing errors were: matching the drug with the indication for prescribing included in the prescription (34 %), reviewing the patient’s medication history (27 %), patient counseling and review of medication history (9 %), patient counseling during dispensing (8 %), others (15 %), and not specified by the reporter (7 %). ConclusionsPharmacists reviewing and matching the indication for prescribing the prescribed drug and reviewing patient medication history before dispensing were the major factors (60 %) found that allowed pharmacists to detect and thus prevent incorrect drug prescribing errors. Therefore, including the indication in the prescription as a <b>mandatory</b> <b>field</b> is important for patient safety...|$|E
40|$|To {{update the}} European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) risk model. A {{dedicated}} website collected prospective risk and outcome data on 22 381 consecutive patients undergoing major cardiac surgery in 154 hospitals in 43 countries over a 12 -week period (May-July 2010). Completeness and accuracy were validated during data collection using <b>mandatory</b> <b>field</b> entry, error and range checks and after data collection using summary feedback confirmation by responsible officers and multiple logic checks. Information was obtained on existing EuroSCORE {{risk factors and}} additional factors proven to influence risk from research conducted since the original model. The primary outcome was mortality at the base hospital. Secondary outcomes were mortality at 30 and 90 days. The data set was divided into a developmental subset for logistic regression modelling and a validation subset for model testing. A logistic risk model (EuroSCORE II) was then constructed and tested. Compared with the original 1995 EuroSCORE database (in brackets), the mean age was up at 64. 7 (62. 5) with 31 % females (28 %). More patients had New York Heart Association class IV, extracardiac arteriopathy, renal and pulmonary dysfunction. Overall mortality was 3. 9 % (4. 6 %). When applied to the current data, the old risk models overpredicted mortality (actual: 3. 9 %; additive predicted: 5. 8 %; logistic predicted: 7. 57 %). EuroSCORE II was well calibrated on testing in the validation data subset of 5553 patients (actual mortality: 4. 18 %; predicted: 3. 95 %). Very good discrimination was maintained with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 8095. Cardiac surgical mortality has significantly reduced in the last 15 years despite older and sicker patients. EuroSCORE II is better calibrated than the original model yet preserves powerful discrimination. It is proposed for the future assessment of cardiac surgical risk...|$|E

Few published studies have considered physical therapists 2 ̆ 7, especially novice therapists 2 ̆ 7, value and use of family-centered practices. The purpose of this exploratory study was to: (1) describe novice physical therapists who practice in early intervention and schools; (2) investigate novice physical therapists 2 ̆ 7 value and use of family-centered practices; (3) compare therapists 2 ̆ 7 and families 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of family-centered practice; and (4) identify factors that may contribute to therapists 2 ̆ 7 use of family-centered practices. ^ Twenty five novice early intervention and school physical therapists from across the country and 27 parents of children receiving physical therapy services completed the Family-Centered Program Rating Scale and responded to a researcher-designed survey designed to quantify factors that potentially influence delivery of care. Analysis of participants 2 ̆ 7 responses indicated that most therapists chose to practice in early intervention and schools because they wanted to work with children. Their preservice classroom and field training relating to young children varied in number of hours, with {{less than half of the}} sample 2 ̆ 7 s training programs having <b>mandatory</b> <b>field</b> experiences with young children.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Individualised Learner Record (ILR) is a dataset that collects information on learners and their learning in the Further Education system in England. The Further Education system includes further education colleges, sixth form colleges, independent learning providers, former external institutions, local authorities and voluntary and community organisations. Since 2013, the ILR has been directly collected and administrated by the Skills Funding Agency. Previously the ILR was owned and governed by the Information Authority (IA), while The Data Service {{was responsible for the}} collection of the dataset on behalf of the IA. Further education institutions in receipt of certain types of funding, the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People’s Learning Agency, were contractually obliged to made data returns in line with the specification set by the IA. The individual level data held in the ILR dataset is comprehensive and includes information about learner characteristics (including NI number), funding, employment, route onto the course and outcomes and their final destination. &# 160; The Individualised Learner Record covers further education learners and institutions in England. The Individualised Learner Record dataset is available from 2003 / 04. Between 2003 / 04 and 2009 / 10, ILR data were collected at different times of the year depending on the funding stream of the learners. The learner responsive stream (those typically studying at FE colleges) was traditionally collected at quarterly intervals with a subsequent annual collection. For the 2011 / 2012 data collection there has been a move towards an open year-long data collection with one final deadline for all funding streams {{towards the end of the}} academic year. Each year variables are reviewed and undergo various amendments in line with policy changes and the needs of the Skills Funding Agency and other key stakeholders. Many of the changes are of a technical nature regarding the re-classification of variable codes. Full details of all of the changes made to the ILR since 2005 / 06 are available in the data specifications which can be accessed through the documentation section. The ILR return is compulsory for state funded Further Education in England. Learners are told their data will be collected and used for administration and funding of their education. Their participation and achievement data are then shared with the Learning Records Service, and learners can share this with other UK education providers they then progress to. Learners are assumed to opt in, but have the option to opt out if they request. Those learners who are ‘subcontracted’ in from a school or higher education institution (i. e. learners attending a school or higher education institution who undertake a particular course at an FE institution) are not included in the individual level returns. The sharing of ILR data is regulated under section 122 of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009. ILR data are collected from providers that are in receipt of any of the following types of funding from the Skills Funding Agency, the Young People’s Learning Agency, 16 - 18 Learner Responsive, Adult Learner Responsive, Employer Responsive, Adult Safeguarded Learning and from providers funded by co-financed European Social Funds (ESF). The Individualised Learner Records returns are made via an electronic system which incorporates validation checks on the data. Further validation checks are then carried out by the Skills Funding Agency. Data are generally expected to be of high quality. The number of missing answers will vary between variables according in part to whether the variable is mandatory or voluntary for a particular learner. The data specification for each year gives exact details of the completion status for all variables. Although the ILR is available from 2003 / 04 onwards, the data prior to 2005 / 06 are generally considered to be of lower quality due to institutions becoming accustomed to providing the data. Research Usage and Linkage The ILR data are used by the Skills Funding Agency (and previously by The Data Service) in their series of statistical first releases covering information on post- 16 education and skills including learner participation and outcomes. The data are also used by the government to monitor the distribution of funding in the FE system, inform decisions about provisions, monitor the effectiveness of providers and national targets and to demonstrate outcomes. In recent times the ILR data have been used to analyse the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) qualifications in England. The ILR dataset can also be used to address a range of FE education research questions, for example on learner participation rates and outcomes for different groups. The ILR contains several fields that could in theory enable the linkage to other datasets, for example Name, Address, National Insurance Number and the Unique Learner Number. In 2010 / 11, the use of a Unique Learner Number (ULN) became a <b>mandatory</b> <b>field</b> in the ILR. The ULN is also collected as part of the Department for Education’s Pupil Census, the Universities & Colleges Admission Service dataset and the Higher Education Statistics Agency Student Record dataset. More specifically, researchers can now also make a single application for linked data extracts from the National Pupil Database, HESA Student Records and Individualised Learner Records. These datasets cover compulsory, further and higher education in England. </div...|$|E
