25|$|The need {{to protect}} freedom of {{expression}} is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals.

25|$|Wind {{gradient}} {{can have}} a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> the design of noise barriers.|$|E

25|$|Important {{structural}} changes in post-Mao China after Reform and Opening, beginning under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> {{relation to the}} digital divide. The current urban-rural dual structure—or market-driven versus government-centered—is the underlying cause of the urban-rural divide. The digital divide between the two sectors could potentially intensify the current economic differences, causing more inequalities between the rural and urban sectors. It {{is also important to}} consider technology domestication or domestication theory.|$|E
25|$|If {{the optical}} cavity is not empty (e.g., a laser cavity which {{contains}} the gain medium), {{the value of}} L used is not the physical mirror separation, but the optical path length between the mirrors. Optical elements such as lenses placed in the cavity alter the stability and mode size. In addition, for most gain media, thermal and other inhomogeneities create a variable lensing effect in the medium, which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> {{the design of the}} laser resonator.|$|E
25|$|Both larvae {{and adults}} of the predatory Creophilus maxillosus {{feed on the}} organic remains of carrion as well as nutrient-packed diptera larvae. Their {{appearance}} in the 'common' faunal succession usually follows the first Diptera larvae colonization and continues throughout the later stages of decomposition. The presence of C. maxillosus on carrion is sometimes associated with a marked reduction or in some instances an unexplained absence of fly larvae. This predation causes an overall misrepresentation of the overall entomofaunical succession, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> some instances.|$|E

25|$|Any real {{amplifier}} is {{an imperfect}} realization {{of an ideal}} amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.|$|E
25|$|Facilitation of {{non-native}} species, {{either by}} native species or other non-native species, {{may increase the}} invasibility of a community, or {{the ease with which}} non-native species become established in a community. In an examination of 254 published studies of introduced species, 22 of 190 interactions studied between introduced species in the studies were facilitative. It is worth noting that 128 of the 190 examined interactions were predator–prey relationships of a single plant-eating insect reported in a single study, which may have overemphasized the importance of negative interactions. Introduced plants are also facilitated by native pollinators, dispersers, and mycorrhizae. Thus, positive interactions <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> any attempt to understand the invasibility of a community.|$|E
25|$|By-products {{of thermal}} power plant {{operation}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> their design and operation. Waste heat energy, which remains due to the finite efficiency of the Carnot, Rankine, or Diesel power cycle, is released directly to the atmosphere or river/lake water, or indirectly to the atmosphere using a cooling tower with river or lake water used as a cooling medium. The flue gas from combustion of the fossil fuels is discharged to the air. This gas contains carbon dioxide and water vapor, {{as well as other}} substances such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), mercury, traces of other metals, and, for coal-fired plants, fly ash. Solid waste ash from coal-fired boilers must also be removed. Some coal ash can be recycled for building materials.|$|E

25|$|When {{it is not}} {{possible}} for a law to be authentically interpreted, recourse must be had to what is called magisterial, or doctrinal, interpretation, for which rules of law have been formulated. The words of a law must be understood according to their usual signification, unless it is certain that the legislator intended them to be taken in another sense, or the rules of law dictate another interpretation. In all interpretations, however, the meaning of the words is to be preferred which favours equity rather than strict justice. The provisions of a previous statute are not presumed to be changed beyond the express meaning of the words of a new law. No words of a law are ever presumed to be superfluous. In interpreting a law the words <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> their context. When the words of a law are doubtful the presumption is in favour of the subjects, not of the lawgiver.|$|E
500|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{argue that}} {{gender and race}} <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> economic analysis. Amartya Sen argues that [...] "the systematically inferior position of women {{inside and outside the}} household in many societies points to the necessity of treating gender as a force of its own in development analysis." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} experiences of men and women, even within the same household, are often so different that examining economics without gender can be misleading.|$|E
500|$|Wind shear {{can have}} a {{pronounced}} effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere, where waves can be [...] "bent" [...] by refraction phenomenon. The audibility of sounds from distant sources, such as thunder or gunshots, is very dependent {{on the amount of}} shear. The result of these differing sound levels is key in noise pollution considerations, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> the design of noise barriers. This phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s, contributing to the design of urban highways as well as noise barriers.|$|E

500|$|In Rosen v. United States (1896), the Supreme Court {{adopted the}} same {{obscenity}} standard {{as had been}} articulated in a famous British case, Regina v. Hicklin (1868). The Hicklin test defined material as obscene if it tended [...] "to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall". In the early twentieth century, literary works including An American Tragedy (Theodore Dreiser, 1925) and Lady Chatterley's Lover (D.H. Lawrence, 1928) were banned for obscenity. In the federal district court case United States v. One Book Called Ulysses (1933), Judge John M. Woolsey established a new standard to evaluate James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922), stating that works <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>in</b> their entirety, rather than declared obscene {{on the basis of}} an individual part of the work.|$|E
2500|$|A {{modification}} of the Ritz–Tolman theory was introduced by J. G. Fox (1965).

40|$|Problem statement: The {{objective}} {{of this study were}} to determine the effect of job satisfaction on turnover intentions among the employees in XYZ Sdn. Bhd, Malaysia. Approach: A total of 32 set of complete questionnaires gathered from executives and non-executives of a local printing company were involved in the study and 32 completed the questionnaires. Using structured questionnaires in a controlled environment, the results manage to extract both intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction that influences the turnover intention. Results: The statistical results obtained in this study showed that both forms of job satisfaction (intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction) have inverse relationship on employeesâ turnover intentions. Conclusion: Eventhough Instrinsic Job Satisfaction have stronger influence on Turnover Intention.
