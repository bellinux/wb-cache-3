50|$|In statistics, the {{principle}} of marginality refers {{to the fact that}} the average (or <b>main)</b> <b>effects,</b> of variables in an analysis are marginal to their interaction effect. The principle of marginality argues that, in general, it is wrong to test, estimate, or interpret <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> of explanatory variables where the variables interact or, similarly, to model interaction <b>effects</b> but delete <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> that are marginal tothem. While such models are interpretable, they lack applicability, as they ignore the effects of their marginal <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the Old China Trade was an increased import of opium and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: estrogen receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and estrogen receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the {{aid package}} was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E

50|$|More {{information}} on experimental designs {{may be found}} here. It is worth reiterating, however, that small designs that estimate <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> typically do so by deliberately confounding higher order interactions with the <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b> This means that unless those interactions are zero in practice, the analyst will obtain biased estimates of the <b>main</b> <b>effects.</b> Furthermore (s)he has (1) no way of testing this, and (2) no way of correcting it in analysis. This emphasises the crucial role of design in DCEs.|$|R

The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of this break is that the fourth element of the line usually coincides with the word-accent.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of {{suspension}} bondage is {{to create}} a heightened sense of vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of {{the battle}} was unforeseen: the large loss of German {{transport}} aircraft. According to military historian Lt. Col. E.H. Brongers (ret.), {{the loss of the}} transport aircraft had a direct effect on the planning for the proposed German cross channel invasion of Britain. Also, Brongers mentions the impact of the loss of transport aircraft during the invasion of Crete. Since the Germans did not have sufficient aircraft to land troops in force, they had to drop them instead in groups, which resulted in heavy casualties. Brongers' conclusions are supported by military historian Col. Adriaan Hakkert (ret.).|$|E

40|$|When {{interaction}} terms {{exist in}} a two-factor, factorial experiment, the consideration and analysis of <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> are often restricted to those situations where the interaction between factors is not significant.

A test for the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> in that situation may be pragmatic to the practitioner and appealing to researchers in other disciplines. Intersection [...] union and union [...] intersection methods are examined for assessing the directional nature of significant interactions so that the <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> in a two-factor factorial may be evaluated.

25|$|Much of {{the first}} two years of Timesitheus's {{prefecture}} seems to have been spent producing a stable environment in which government of any sort could be carried on.

The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of his manoeuvring seems to have been to ensure that the kind of men who had carried on the government under Alexander Severus were restored to effective office.|$|E
25|$|James Ferguson {{has argued}} that the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of many {{development}} projects carried out by the World Bank and similar organizations is not the alleviation of poverty. Instead the projects often serve to expand the exercise of bureaucratic state power. Through his case-studies of development projects in Thaba-Tseka he shows that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions in Lesotho was flawed, and the Bank ignored the political and cultural character of the state in crafting their projects. As a result, the projects failed to help the poor, but succeeded in expanding the government bureaucracy.|$|E

25|$|In 1750 he {{abandoned}} Mingotti's group for another company established {{by a former}} member of the Mingotti troupe, Giovanni Battista Locatelli. The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of this was that Gluck returned to Prague on a more consistent basis. For the Prague Carnival of 1750 Gluck composed a new opera, Ezio (again set to one of Metastasio's works, with the manuscript located at the Lobkowicz Palace). His Ipermestra was also performed in the same year. The other major event of Gluck's stay in Prague was, on 15 September 1750, his marriage to Maria Anna Bergin, aged 18 years old, the daughter of a rich but long-dead Viennese merchant. Gluck seems to have spent most of 1751 commuting between Prague and Vienna.|$|E
25|$|The Longquan celadons {{were among}} the finest {{of a range of}} celadon wares {{produced}} in China, and led stylistic and technical developments. The celadons were produced in a range of shades of colour, centred on olive-green, but extending to greenish blues (regarded as desirable, but less common) and browns. All these colours come from the glaze; the body beneath is sometimes left partly unglazed as part of the decoration, when it fires to a terracotta brown. The wares are hardly ever painted; decoration comes from the vessel shape and carved or incised designs in the body. Shapes were originally mostly simple, allowing the glaze colour to create the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of a piece, but in later periods raised decoration was common.|$|E

25|$|The spill had {{a severe}} {{impact on the}} coastal area {{surrounding}} Madinat 'al-Jubayl as Sinaiyah, the major industrial and population center newly planned and built by the Saudi government. The spill threatened industrial facilities in 'Al Jubayl because of the seawater cooling system for primary industries and threatened the supply of potable water produced by seawater-fed desalination plants. The 'Al Jubayl community harbor and Abu Ali Island, which juts into the gulf immediately north of 'Al Jubayl, experienced the greatest pollution, with the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the spill concentrated in mangrove areas and shrimp grounds.

25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of hantavirus infections {{is unclear}} {{as there is}} a lack of animal models to describe it (rats and mice do not seem to acquire severe disease). While the primary site of viral replication in the body is not known, in HFRS the <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> is in the blood vessels while in HPS most symptoms are associated with the lungs. In HFRS, there are increased vascular permeability and decreased blood pressure due to endothelial dysfunction and the most dramatic damage is seen in the kidneys, whereas in HPS, the lungs, spleen, and gall bladder are most affected. Early symptoms of HPS tend to present similarly to the flu (muscle aches, fever and fatigue) and usually show up around 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. Later stages of the disease (about 4 to 10 days after symptoms start) include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath and coughing.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{the orbital}} {{eccentricity}} of Earth occur on {{a cycle of}} about 100,000 years. The inclination, or tilt, of Earth's axis varies periodically between 22° and 24.5°. (The tilt of Earth's axis {{is responsible for the}} seasons; the greater the tilt, the greater the contrast between summer and winter temperatures.) Changes in the tilt occur in a cycle 41,000 years long. Precession of the equinoxes, or wobbles on Earth's spin axis, complete every 26,000 years. According to the Milankovitch theory, these factors cause a periodic cooling of Earth, with the coldest part in the cycle occurring about every 40,000 years. The <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> of the Milankovitch cycles is to change the contrast between the seasons, not the amount of solar heat Earth receives. These cycles within cycles predict that during maximum glacial advances, winter and summer temperatures are lower. The result is less ice melting than accumulating, and glaciers build up.|$|E
