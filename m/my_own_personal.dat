By 1955, the film had brought in $6.8 million, making it the third most {{successful}} of Warners' wartime movies (behind Shine On, Harvest Moon and This Is the Army). On April 21, 1957, the Brattle Theater of Cambridge, Massachusetts, showed the film {{as part of a}} season of old movies. It was so popular that it began a tradition of screening Casablanca during the week of final exams at Harvard University, which continues to the present day. Other colleges have adopted the tradition. Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology who had attended one of these screenings, has said that the experience was [...] "the acting out of <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> rite of passage". The tradition helped the movie remain popular while other films famous in the 1940s have faded from popular memory. By 1977, Casablanca was the most frequently broadcast film on American television.|$|E

500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told me {{that this}} story about a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> experience with them. I had the same feeling about Patlabor and I {{thought it would be}} interesting to make a film that took place in the near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E
500|$|Long's {{theories}} about animal surgery garnered negative {{attention from the}} scientific {{community as well as}} the literary; biologist William Morton Wheeler wrote to Science in February 1904 that Long's story was [...] "a series of anecdotes which for rank and impossible humanization of the animal can hardly be surpassed." [...] Other scientists agreed about the dubiousness of Long's claims, and publicly rebuked him for not providing evidence as to his observations in a scientifically-accepted format. Long responded in turn, insisting that [...] "If scientists and comparative-psychologists are honestly looking for new facts in the animal world, I have enough to fill several regular editions of Science, every one of which is supported not only by <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>personal</b> observation, but by the testimony of other honest men whose word can be taken without hesitation." [...] As to the woodcock story, Long provided several accounts from other men who had witnessed as much; an Ohio man, for example, reportedly found upon shooting a similar bird that it [...] "had evidently broken its leg above the knee joint. There was a bandage around it, composed of a hard clay-like substance, interwoven with grass or a woody fiber of some kind. The bone seemed to have been set properly and had knit perfectly." [...] None of Long's witnesses were able to provide specimens for study, however, and Science followed Long's essay with the note, [...] "We Hope that this discussion will not be carried further." ...|$|E

The frame was required to support the machine and provide a strain relief for the cords attached to the machine as it moved in the x and y directions. Calculations also had to be done to be sure the design would be able to withstand any loads or outside sources of stress. After the calculations proved the design to be ready to withstand the requirements, the parts were ordered or fabricated, as required.
