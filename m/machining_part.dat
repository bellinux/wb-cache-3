The number of <b>machine</b> <b>parts</b> errors were collected from a thermo plastic injection molding machine in a car bumper auto parts manufacturer in Liberec city, Czech Republic from January 2012 to November 2012. A Bayesian method is used for parameter estimation. The results of this study indicate that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and {{the amount of time spent}} on the error correction do not improve the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> status of the individual part, but there is a very strong month-to-month dependence of the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> states. Using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion, the performance of the proposed model (MAE = 1. 62) and the HMM including <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction only (MAE = 1. 68), from our previous study, is not significantly different. However, the proposed model has more advantage in the fact that the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> state can be explained by both the <b>machine</b> <b>part</b> error correction and the amount of time spent on the error correction...|$|R

The proposed washing system consists of two processes: the dipping process and the modified automatic ultrasonic washing process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a unique micro/nano sculpturing technology for difficult-to-cut materials by controlling vibration amplitude in elliptical vibration cutting. In the present research, machining performance of the amplitude control sculpturing method is investigated, and limitation in nano-scale machining is explored. In the proposed machining method, the machinable part geometry is essentially restricted by cutting tool geometry and vibration conditions. In order to clarify the machining performance of the proposed technology, a series of analytical and experimental investigations were conducted. From the experimental results, {{it was confirmed that}} nano structures with a step height of more than 2 nm and a pitch of more than 250 nm can be machined with surprisingly high accuracy of about 1 nm. On the other hand, a considerable error between the amplitude command and the envelope of tool trajectory is generated when the slope of the <b>machining</b> <b>part</b> geometry becomes large. In order to overcome this error, a compensation method of the amplitude command is proposed. By applying the proposed compensation, nano structures with large ratio of the step height to the pitch were machined accurately. The proposed machining method was subsequently applied to a three-dimensional grid surface machining, and successful experimental results verified feasibility of practical machining application by applying proposed technology...|$|E
40|$|How to meet {{a variety}} of {{customized}} products and {{how to cope with}} the quick response for confirmed needs will gradually become the great challenge to the manager of present industry. Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS), with possession of medium-to-mass production and high flexibility, could be implemented in and regarded as strategic weapons for the operations management. For an FMS, the investment in versatile machines and the cutting tool cost are usually expensive. How efficiently utilizing the machines and allocating cutting tools are the big headache problems. Due to the applications of computerized automation, a <b>machining</b> <b>part</b> is almost without any part move during the manufacturing route because of versatile machines and adequate tool management. Consequently, a genetic algorithm(GA) based scheduling of FMS is developed in this paper. For given confirmed orders, a machine loading problem should be solved to achieve load balance and adequately allocating needed tools for a part with precedence route is discussed with the consideration of part scheduling, number of tools, and routing flexibility of a part. The objective is to minimize makespan and balance deviation. Finally, a numerical example is designed to demonstrate the proposed algorithm and we expect that the planned frame will affirmatively supply the useful solution methodology for the FMS scheduling problems...|$|E

40|$|This {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} measured environmental impacts of selective laser melting, to determine where most impacts arise: machine and supporting hardware; aluminum powder material used; or electricity used to print. Machine impacts and aluminum powder impacts were calculated by generating life cycle inventories of materials and processing; electricity use was measured by in-line power meter; transport and disposal were also assessed. Impacts were calculated as energy use (megajoules; MJ), ReCiPe Europe Midpoint H, and ReCiPe Europe Endpoint H/A. Previous {{research has shown that}} the efficiency of additive manufacturing depends on machine operation patterns; thus, scenarios were demarcated through notation listing different configurations of machine utilization, system idling, and postbuild part removal. Results showed that electricity use during printing was the dominant impact per part for nearly all scenarios, both in MJ and ReCiPe Endpoint H/A. However, some low-utilization scenarios caused printer embodied impacts to dominate these metrics, and some ReCiPe Midpoint H categories were always dominated by other sources. For printer operators, results indicate that maximizing capacity utilization can reduce impacts per part by a factor of 14 to 18, whereas avoiding electron discharge <b>machining</b> <b>part</b> removal can reduce impacts per part by 25 % to 28 %. For system designers, results indicate that reductions in energy consumption, both in the printer and auxiliary equipment, could significantly reduce the environmental burden of the process...|$|E

The aim {{of this research was}} to understand and solve problems associated with the integration of a Machine Planner within a product model environment. This work was carried out in conjunction with other researchers, pursuing parallel integration issues related to pre-production proving and product data representation. Product data representations of component level planned, processes and feature level process data have been explored as sub-sets of -a product data model to aid integration. Geometric queries on a cell decomposition solid, model. have been explored as a means of providing feature geometric interaction data, while the dimensional interactions between features have also been addressed. Product data representations have been modelled using a prototype software tool, providing an environment for the exploration of the integration of a Machine Planner using a feature based design approach. Necessary Machine Planning functions have been implemented, using the ADA programming language, to explore the integrating capability of the product model environment, concentrating on the use of a prismatic benchmark component. Using the experimental implementation, setup and operation plans have been produced and <b>machining</b> <b>part</b> programs generated from product model representations of variants on the benchmark component.
