5|$|All these controversies {{have led}} {{ethnic groups in}} Macedonia to use terms in {{conflicting}} ways. Despite {{the fact that these}} terms may not always be used in a pejorative way, they <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied. Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group, and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side, or the region in general.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Any true {{physical}} color can {{be represented}} {{by a combination of}} pure spectral colors. As physical colors can be composed of any number of physical colors, the space of physical colors may aptly be represented by a Hilbert space over spectral colors. Humans have three types of cone cells for color perception, so the perceivable colors {{can be represented}} by 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The non-unique linear mapping from the Hilbert space of physical colors to the Euclidean space of human perceivable colors explains why many distinct physical colors <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by humans to be identical (e.g., pure yellow light versus a mix of red and green light).|$|E

5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by tonal and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Gotland shifted {{allegiance}} between the Swedes and the Danes several times. Although the island <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> to have closer links to Svealand, it is counted {{as part of}} Götaland.|$|E
25|$|Under certain conditions, {{involving}} primarily complete {{absence of}} threat to the self structure, experiences which are inconsistent with it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> and examined, {{and the structure of}} self revised to assimilate and include such experiences.|$|E

500|$|In {{a parody}} ruling the court must {{determine}} whether a work is transformative {{in a way that}} gives a new expression, meaning or message to the original work. In this case, the court ruled that the [...] "ad <b>may</b> reasonably <b>be</b> <b>perceived,</b> as commenting on the seriousness and even pretentiousness of the original." [...] It also ruled that the ad differed from the original [...] "in a way that <b>may,</b> reasonably, <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as commenting, through ridicule on what a viewer might reasonably think is the undue self-importance conveyed by the subject of the Leibovitz photograph." ...|$|R

25|$|Any {{experience}} {{which is}} inconsistent with {{the organization of the}} structure of the self <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a threat, and the more of these perceptions there are, the more rigidly the self structure is organized to maintain itself.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{features}} {{may include}} hypertension, {{and heart rate}} that may be rapid or irregular in character; these <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as palpitations. Less common findings include left ventricular hypertrophy, premature atrial and ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, systemic embolization, death from cardiovascular collapse and resistance to some drug effects (digoxin, coumadin).|$|E
25|$|Known {{members of}} the {{community}} may be accused as witches, or the witches <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as supernatural, non-human entities. In early modern Europe and Britain such accusations led to the executions {{of tens of thousands of}} people, who were seen to be in league with Satan. Those accused of being satanic witches were often practitioners of (usually benign) folk magic.|$|E
50|$|Culturally, {{however, the}} {{division}} is more ambiguous. In the eastern provinces like Jiangsu and Anhui, the Yangtze River <b>may</b> instead <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as the north-south boundary {{instead of the}} Huai River, {{but this is a}} recent development.|$|R

25|$|In the {{contemporary}} United States, essentially anyone of European descent is considered White. However, {{many of the}} non-European ethnic groups classified as White by the U.S. Census, such as Jewish-Americans, Arab-Americans, and Hispanics or Latinos may not identify as, and <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be,</b> White.|$|R
25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|Within Christian traditions, many {{instances}} reported involve images of Jesus or other Christian figures seen in food; in the Muslim world, structures {{in food and}} other natural objects <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as religious text in Arabic script, particularly the word Allah or verses from the Qur'an. Many religious believers view them as real manifestations of miraculous origin; a sceptical view is that such perceptions are examples of pareidolia.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{that are}} {{approaching}} an intersection {{from beyond the}} subtended angular velocity detection threshold (SAVT) limit <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> with subjective constancy by the stopped driver; which means the oncoming vehicle cannot be reliably distinguished between moving or parked or give insight to time-to-collision, {{though they may be}} traveling at such an imprudent speed as to pose an immediate hazard. An entering driver must have fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct is forbidden by such hazard for it to be illegal.|$|E
50|$|Luna is {{the first}} young adult novel to feature a {{transgender}} character, aside from Carol Plum-Ucci's What Happened to Lani Garver in which the main character <b>may</b> possibly <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as transgender. Peters introduced {{the idea that a}} transgender person <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> an extreme form of homosexuality as one may have previously thought.|$|R
50|$|Other {{variants}} of database publishing are the rendering of content for direct PDF output. This approach prevents manual intervention {{on the final}} output, since PDF is not (comfortably) editable. This <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as a limitation in situations like report generation where manual editability is not needed or not desired.|$|R
25|$|The above {{result may}} or <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as surprising. A {{classical}} system would display the same property, and a hidden variable theory (see below) {{would certainly be}} required to do so, based on conservation of angular momentum in classical and quantum mechanics alike. The difference is that a classical system has definite values for all the observables all along, while the quantum system does not. In a sense to be discussed below, the quantum system considered here seems to acquire a probability distribution for {{the outcome of a}} measurement of the spin along any axis of the other particle upon measurement of the first particle. This probability distribution is in general different from what it would be without measurement of the first particle. This <b>may</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as surprising in the case of spatially separated entangled particles.|$|R
25|$|Other {{problems}} involve states being {{reluctant to}} relinquish involvement in other regional groups, e.g., Tanzania's withdrawal from COMESA but staying within the SADC bloc for the Economic Partnership Agreement {{negotiations with the}} European Union. Many Tanzanians are also concerned because creating a common market means removing obstacles to the free movement of labour and capital. Free movement of labour <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as highly desirable in Uganda and Kenya, and have important developmental benefits in Tanzania; however, in Tanzania there is widespread resistance {{to the idea of}} ceding land rights to foreigners, including citizens of Kenya and Uganda.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, Clooney was {{featured}} with Martin Sheen and Brad Pitt {{in a performance}} of Dustin Lance Black's play, '8'—a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned California's Prop 8 ban on same-sex marriage—as attorney David Boies. The production {{was held at the}} Wilshire Ebell Theatre and broadcast on YouTube {{to raise money for the}} American Foundation for Equal Rights. In September 2012, Clooney offered to take an auction winner out to lunch to benefit the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN). GLSEN works to create a safe space in schools for children who are or <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> to be gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{distress}} to tissue causes capillaries {{to break}} under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps {{into the surrounding}} tissues, causing the bruise to darken and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the peer}} tutor {{is seen by}} the tutee as being more at their own level, advice given by the tutor <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{accepted}} more readily than advice from a teacher. Another key {{reason for this is}} that a peer tutor does not give any grade on the paper, whereas a teacher serving in a tutor role <b>may</b> still <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as someone who grades papers.|$|R
50|$|Interpersonal Valence can be best {{described}} as a nonverbal communication typology. A touch from someone you like is received differently than an unwanted touch. Interpersonal valence has a positive affect for socially and physically attractive people and a negative valence for those not so attractive. This degree of attraction <b>may</b> <b>be</b> within the initiator’s point of view or <b>may</b> also <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> from the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|A {{graduate}} tax <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> to <b>be</b> a debt in {{the same}} way as a student loan is. [...] Vince Cable states that [...] "current system reinforces the idea that students carry an additional fixed burden of debt into their working lives. Yet, most of us don’t think of our future tax obligations as 'debt'." ...|$|R
25|$|Psychology of the sacred, {{taking stock}} of the human condition, conveys that people {{construct}} meaning from that which is without meaning; stated differently, culture gives context to lived experience. Therefore, both meaning and absence of meaning <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as being co-existents. Cultural context as constructed meaning and memetic transmission engenders social, existential, and spiritual comfort in a tenuous and arbitrary lived experience and millieu: perception as a participatory event parsing experience into meaningful units. The crossroads or intersections of evolutionary psychology of religion, pattern recognition, neuroaesthetics and symbolic communication lend {{to the construction of}} meanings as group cohesion and bond-forming in human society.|$|E
25|$|Good Samaritan {{provisions}} are not universal in application. The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply. In {{the absence of}} imminent peril, {{the actions of a}} rescuer <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{is home to}} {{a number}} of {{perceptions}} about Canadian culture, due to the countries' partially shared heritage and the relatively large number of cultural features common to both the US and Canada. For example, the average Canadian <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> as more reserved than his or her American counterpart. Canada and the United States are often inevitably compared as sibling countries, and the perceptions that arise from this oft-held contrast have gone to shape the advertised worldwide identities of both nations: the United States is seen as the rebellious child of the British Crown, forged in the fires of violent revolution; Canada is the calmer offspring of the United Kingdom, known for a more relaxed national demeanour.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} factor <b>may</b> <b>be</b> differences or changes {{in parts of}} the brain known to be involved in representing body shape (e.g., see proprioception and body image).
