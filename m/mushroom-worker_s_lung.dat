50|$|A {{number of}} legends {{regarding}} <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> exploits exist. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{first arrived in}} China at O-Mei Shan in Szechuan province. During his time there he became quite famous for his skill. Upon arrival on the Pearl River, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> was challenged by a pirate known as Cheung Po-Jai. Cheung was famous for robbing corrupt Qing Dynasty officials. After having defeated Cheung, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> accepted him as a student.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage/tradition, <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{described}} as the 36th, 18th or 14th generation inheritor of the Lion's Roar system. There is a 350-year gap between Ah Dat-Ta and <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> and a troubling lack of information regarding this long period. However, we have very definite and established lineages once <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> began teaching in Guangdong province, Southern China. This is a brief summary {{of some of the}} prominent and still active lineages.|$|R
50|$|When the {{misunderstanding}} was corrected <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{offered to}} heal the leg using special Tibetan medical techniques and the two became friends. Wong Ping was so impressed by <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> that he asked the old monk to teach his son. Wong Yan-Lam studied {{for many years and}} achieved considerable skill under the direction of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> In addition to Lama Pai, Wong Yan Lam also learned the Lo Han Myuhn (Boddhisattva division) and Gam Gong Myuhn (Diamond division) internal methods and the Tibetan medical techniques.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> (聖龍, also <b>Sing</b> Luhng, meaning [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] or [...] "Venerable Monk") was a Chinese martial artist.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{genealogy}} of Tibetan White Crane, [...] "Ng Mui" [...] is the Chinese {{name of the}} Tibetan monk Jikboloktoto, who was {{the last}} generation of transmission before <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> who brought the art to Guangdong. This account is most different from the others, with a male Ng Mui, {{the absence of a}} Manchu menace to flee from and, given the dating of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> relocation to Guangdong to 1865, a 19th-century setting.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> taught many {{individuals}} his art of Lama Pai. It appears that {{only two of}} his students are primarily responsible for taking the style and spreading it throughout China: Wong Lam-Hoi (黃林开) and Wong Yan-Lam (王隐林). There were five other students who absorbed much of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung’s</b> teaching as well. They are responsible for spreading the style {{to other parts of}} China, but for one reason or another, kept fairly secret about their teachings.|$|R
5000|$|Wong Yan Lam 王隱林 {{was the son}} of a Shaolin Kung-Fu master {{known as}} Wong Ping. Wong Ping was {{something}} of a local legend, known as [...] "the bronze foot", and was fond of demonstrating his kung-fu in public. Because of this he came to the attention of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung.</b> One day <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> came down from the mountain and had an opportunity to observe Wong Ping's kung-fu. He was impressed by Wong Ping's skill and tried to tell him so but because <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> Chinese was not very good there was a misunderstanding. Wong Ping attacked Sing Luhng with a powerful leg sweep but the Tibetan monk utilized a technique known as [...] "GAM GONG HONG LUHNG". He leapt up into the air and landed on the leg, breaking Wong Ping's knee.|$|R

5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} lineage, the figure known as <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> is {{rendered}} in Chinese characters as either [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) or [...] "Star Dragon" [...] (星龍). From a Buddhist point of view, the [...] "Sage Dragon" [...] (聖龍) makes more logical sense {{and the use}} of the character for [...] "star" [...] (星) can easily be explained by the long established tradition of [...] "white characters" [...] in Chinese society, i.e. the use of a simpler character with the same phonetic sound. <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> also has an alias as Gam Ngau [...] "Golden Hook" [...] Leih Wu-Ji (Li Hu Ji) (金钩李胡子).|$|R

40|$|Background: Lung {{cancer and}} {{colorectal}} cancer are {{leading causes of}} U. S. cancer mortality.

50|$|It {{seemed that}} <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> {{was much more}} {{interested}} in the propagation of his unique martial arts style, rather than any hidden political agenda. He decided to stay at the monastery for approximately 10 years before his death in 1893. He taught both monks and lay disciples his Lion’s Roar style. It was during that time that the style received its new name, Lama Pai (喇嘛派), or style of the Tibetan monk.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Tibetan White Crane" [...] is {{associated}} with the lineage passed down from Wong Lam-Hoi through Ng Siu-Chung, whose training with Wong Lam-Hoi was later supplemented by training with Chu Chi-Yiu, another of <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung's</b> students. Nhg Siu-Chung sought to make the system more accessible to the general public. The White Crane style attempted to standardize the practice of basics and both modified and created hand sets to make them logical and systematic.|$|R
5000|$|While {{today the}} martial arts known as Lama Pai, Tibetan White Crane, and Hop Gar exist as {{relatively}} distinct lineages and/or organizations, all originated with a single figure known as <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> who arrived in Guangdong Province during the Qing Dynasty and taught a martial art then known as [...] "Lion's Roar" [...] (獅子吼).

50|$|Fortunately, {{this debate}} {{can be put}} to rest quite quickly if one {{examines}} more closely the history of Lion's Roar. Ah Dat-Ta, the founder of Lion's Roar, is described as both ethnically Chinese (i.e. Han) and as living {{in what is now}} the province of Qinghai, situated in north western China, next to modern day Tibet. There is also reason to believe <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung,</b> the Buddhist monk who brought Lion's Roar to Guangdong, was raised and trained in Qinghai. To understand the significance of this one has to know a little {{about the history of the}} region.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this period of time that <b>Sing</b> <b>Lung</b> taught Chan Yam (陳蔭), Chou Heung-Yuen (周香遠), and Chu Chi-Yu (朱子堯). Chan Yam and Chou Heung-Yuen both died {{relatively}} young and apparently had few, if any, students worth noting. Chu Chi-Yu accepted only a few disciples and generally kept what he had learned concealed from the general public. Among his students were Chu Cheung, Lei Seung-Dong, and Chiu Dihk. These students continued to guard what they had learned very closely and only accept a few disciples. Chu Chi-Yu apparently also taught Nhg Siu-Chung for a period of time.|$|R
40|$|Administration of alpha-naphthylthiourea (ANTU) to rats causes {{damage to}} {{pulmonary}} endothelial cells and possibly mesothelial lining cells that together {{may account for}} the massive pleural effusion characteristic of thiourea toxicity. Using 35 S-thiourea as a model compound, the extent of binding of 35 <b>S</b> to <b>lung</b> proteins correlated well with the extent of edema, suggesting that the extent of binding of thiourea metabolites is a measure of lung toxicity. ANTU and phenylthiourea (PTU) compete for 35 <b>S</b> binding to <b>lung</b> slices, suggesting that these toxins may act in a similar way. Binding of 35 <b>S</b> in <b>lung</b> slices from resistant rats is much less than in controls, and resistance cannot be explained by differences in either whole body metabolism or redistribution of thiourea in vivo. Lung glutathione levels (in vitro and in vivo) in normal and resistant rats following thiourea administration were essentially the same. However, at doses of thiourea that cause pleural effusion, there was an increase in total lung glutathione...|$|R

The reseach design was quasi experiment with control group pretest-postest design. Total 34 patients (17 subjects for each group, intervention and control group) were included by a simple random sampling method. A breathing retraining was given to the intervention group for 6 days. The finding showed that the average of the COPD patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lung</b> ventilation was significantly different before and after breathing retraining (p value = 0. 000). The average score of the COPD patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lung</b> ventilation after breathing retraining between intervention group and control group was also significantly different (p value = 0. 012). There was significant relationship between age and increased lung ventilation function (p value = 0. 001). However, no relationship found between body height and increased lung fuction (p value = 0. 091) and between gender and lung ventilation function (p value = 0. 346). The research suggested to implement the breathing retraining to increase the lung ventilation function of the CPOD patients.

40|$|Recent {{treatment}} planning {{studies have}} demonstrated the use of physiologic images in radiation therapy treatment planning to identify regions for functional avoidance. This image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) strategy may reduce the injury and/or functional loss following thoracic radiotherapy. 4 D computed tomography (CT), developed for radiotherapy treatment planning, {{is a relatively new}} imaging technique that allows the acquisition of a time-varying sequence of 3 D CT images of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lungs</b> through the respiratory cycle. Guerrero et al. developed a method to calculate ventilation imaging from 4 D CT, which is potentially better suited and more broadly available for IGRT than the current standard imaging methods. The key to extracting function information from 4 D CT is the construction of a volumetric deformation field that accurately tracks the motion of the patient 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>lungs</b> during the respiratory cycle. The spatial accuracy of the displacement field directly impacts the ventilation images; higher spatial registration accuracy will result in less ventilation image artifacts and physiologic inaccuracies. Presently, a consistent methodology for spatial accuracy evaluation of the DIR transformation is lacking. Evaluation of the 4 D CT-derived ventilation images will be performed to assess correlation with global measurements of lung ventilation, as well as regional correlation of the distribution of ventilation with the current clinical standard SPECT. This requires a novel framework for both the detailed assessment of an image registration algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s performance characteristics as well as quality assurance for spatial accuracy assessment in routine application. Finally, we hypothesize that hypo-ventilated regions, identified on 4 D CT ventilation images, will correlate with hypo-perfused regions in lung cancer patients who have obstructive lesions. A prospective imaging trial of patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer will allow this hypothesis to be tested. These advances are intended to contribute to the validation and clinical implementation of CT-based ventilation imaging in prospective clinical trials, in which the impact of this imaging method on patient outcomes may be tested...|$|R
