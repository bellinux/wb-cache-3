50|$|Park et al. {{created an}} {{orthogonal}} receptor-ligand interface between PYR1 and <b>mandipropamid.</b> PYR1 normally binds to abscisic acid which together then bind and inactivate to PP2C as a drought stress response, which stops PP2C from deactivating SnRK2. This causes a cascade {{that leads to}} the activation of the slow anion channel 1 and closing of the leaf guard cells and stomata. The result is less water loss by the plant. The natural response by the plant using abscisic acid to bind PYR1 in drought conditions is not strong enough and is activated too late to significantly hinder crop yield loss. Abscisic acid is also currently too expensive to synthesize {{to be used as a}} spray to control drought response artificially on a mass scale. The ability to control this externally by spraying the PYR1MANDI (orthogonal receptor) with <b>mandipropamid</b> (orthogonal ligand and fungicide) has the potential to reduce crop yield loss during droughts in plants with these engineered receptors, and has been confirmed to work in canola.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides for {{the control}} of potato blight are {{normally}} only used in a preventative manner, optionally in [...] with disease forecasting. In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend {{on the nature of}} local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of P. infestans became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include <b>mandipropamid,</b> chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenytin, mancozeb and others. In the past, copper sulfate solution (called 'bluestone') was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that {{have been shown to be}} effective include horticultural oils, phosphorous acids, and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing [...] "beneficial" [...] microbes such as Bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by American Phytopathological Society and can be found at: [URL] infestans causes potato late blight, an important and costly disease of potato and tomato crops. Seven clonal lineages of P. infestans identified recently in the United States were tested for baseline sensitivity to six oomycete-targeted fungicides. A subset of the dominant lineages (n = 45) collected between 2004 and 2012 was tested in vitro on media amended with a range of concentrations of either azoxystrobin, cyazofamid, cymoxanil, fluopicolide, <b>mandipropamid,</b> or mefenoxam. Dose-response curves and values for the effective concentration at which 50 % of growth was suppressed were calculated for each isolate. The US- 8 and US- 11 clonal lineages were insensitive to mefenoxam while the US- 20, US- 21, US- 22, US- 23, and US- 24 clonal lineages were sensitive to mefenoxam. Insensitivity to azoxystrobin, cyazofamid, cymoxanil, fluopicolide, or <b>mandipropamid</b> was not detected within any lineage. Thus, current U.

Their effectiveness was previously assessed only partially and without evaluations of plant behaviour {{in the following}} vegetative season. Three IBS systemic triazoles (tebuconazole, cyproconazole and epoxyconazole), the translaminar cytotropic <b>mandipropamid</b> and a mixture of cyproconazole and azoxystrobin (methoxyacrilate similar to strobilurines) were tested on one-year plantlets of the susceptible clone ’ÂÂNeva’ (Populus ×canadensis). The products were sprayed twice in August 2010, the second treatment twenty days after the first one. The leaf area covered by uredinia was assessed in several dates {{from the beginning of}} August until the end of September, as well as the percentage of still living leaves on the plant (last ten days of October). In May 2011, the average leaf surface of side shoots close {{to the top of the}} crown and the Chlorophyll Content Index (CCI) were measured. The tested fungicides dramatically reduced the infections, except <b>mandipropamid</b> which showed no effectiveness. Tebuconazole and cyproconazole, either alone or in mixture with azoxystrobin, have offered the best performance (at the end of September, less than 10 % of leaf surface covered by uredinia vs. over 50 % of the control and <b>mandipropamid</b> treatment), followed by epoxyconazole that is anyway satisfying (about 15 % of surface covered by uredinia). The systemic properties of these fungicides allowed a preventive action on leaves sprouted after both of the treatments as well, thus uredinium eruption was limited to 20 % of leaf surface instead 40 % on the test thesis. The same effectiveness ranking was reiterated for the percentage of still living leaves on the plant at the end of October (about 45 % vs. 4 % of the control test) and, during the following season, for the average leaf surface of side shoots (over 800 cm 2 vs. less than 400 cm 2 of the test) and for the CCI parameter (over 21 vs. 16). Thus, the phylloptosis induced by rusts involves a seriously impaired leaf sprouting during the season following the attacks, both as regards tissue amount and its photosynthetic efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Many oomycetes {{species are}} {{pathogens}} of plants, animals and humans; {{some of them}} are well studied because they cause significant economic losses in agriculture and acquaculture. The cell wall of oomycetes consists mainly of cellulose, β- (1, 3) and β- (1, 6) - glucan and in some species a small amount of chitin is also present. The biosynthesis of cellulose in oomycetes is still poorly studied and therefore misunderstood, although it’s the target of some fungicides that inhibit this process, such as carboxylic acid amides. Since 2010, single amino acid exchanges in CesA 3 protein conferring CAA resistance in Plasmopara viticola have been identified. In this work, we initially provide the first evidence of the presence of <b>mandipropamid</b> resistant populations of Plasmopara viticola in commercial vineyards in Italy (paper I). We continue by studying the different activity of four CAAs fungicides (benthiavalicarb, dimethomorph, iprovalicarb, <b>mandipropamid)</b> toward P. viticola resistant strains (paper II). The results show that the G 1105 S mutation affects all four CAAs, but its impact is varied. These results confirm that they are cross resistant, although many gaps in the mode of action are still present. In order to confirm our previous findings, we performed a microscopical base method to assess the sensitivity of four CAAs, and preliminary microscopical data confirmed the different activity toward the CAA-resistant and CAA-sensitive populations (chapter ten). Furthermore, we present a study (chapter eleven) in which we randomly selected samples from paper I, in order to test them using a different approach, simulating a scenario more close to the field.

40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) is a {{phytohormone}} {{that regulates}} developmental processes {{and response to}} abiotic and biotic stresses. It mediates seed dormancy, inhibits seed germination and lateral root formation and controls seedling development. It also limits water loss in times of low water availability through stomatal closure. Core ABA signaling components consist of recently identified PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors that directly regulate clade A PP 2 C phosphatases. Inhibition of PP 2 C activity releases SnRK 2 kinase inhibition, which enables phosphorylation of downstream targets. In Chapter 1, I identified four ABA transporters, which were identified by their ability to promote ABA uptake into S. cerevisiae cells, as indicated by measuring PYR 1 -PP 2 C interactions. For each protein identified, I cloned selected homologues and measured their ability to promote ABA transport in to S. cerevisiae by measuring 3 H labeled ABA uptake. I also determined Kms for the two strongest ABA transporters identified (NRT 1. 2 and SUC 7) and examined whether other substrates altered their ABA transport. Seed germination and root assay data showed that knockout mutants for {{a subset of the}} identified genes possessed altered sensitivity to ABA compared with wild type, which suggests that the genes AT 1 G 69850, AT 1 G 66570, AT 1 G 09380 and AT 4 G 22790 may function as ABA transporters in Arabidopsis. Collectively, the data suggest that there are likely many ABA transporters in Arabidopsis that function redundantly or in different tissues. In Chapter 2, I provided evidence for the existence and characteristics of ABA desensitization, measured at the transcriptional level. RNA-Seq analysis demonstrates that a large (~ 10 %) subset of ABA responsive genes are less responsive to ABA for a period of hours after initial ABA exposure. I also present data describing the desensitization response based on transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles, which demonstrates the desensitization is not only restricted to several specific genes, but is genome wide and can be measured both in metabolic and transcriptional responses. In Chapter 3 I characterize engineered variants of the ABA receptor PYR 1 that possess nanomolar sensitivity to the agrichemical <b>mandipropamid.</b> These were developed by others in my thesis lab to create a system for orthogonal control of ABA responses.

Analytes in the samples were determined by HPLC with variable wavelength detection. Key parameters that influence the UAE procedure were optimized, such as the nature and volume of extraction solvent, number of sonication steps, and sonication time. The highest extraction efficiencies in the range of 61. 1 - 87. 8 % were obtained by using only 7. 5 mL of ethyl acetate hexane (1 + 1, v/v) and sonicating for 10 min. At 0. 5 and 2. 0 pg/g fortification levels, satisfactory recoveries (> 60 %) with RSD 52 %). The method was linear over the range of 0. 005 to 10 pg/g and the correlation coefficients (r(2)) obtained ranged from 0. 9955 to 0. 9992. The LODs (S/N = 3) varied from 0. 0015 to 0. 006 mu g/g. The proposed UAE procedure was compared to classical extractions (shake-flask and Soxhlet extraction) and showed satisfactory extraction efficiencies using shorter time and smaller amounts of organic solvents, thereby minimizing the costs of the analysis and the disposal of waste solvent...|$|E
40|$|The grapevine downy mildew, Plasmopara viticola, {{is one of}} {{the most}} devastating {{pathogens}} in viticulture. Effective control is mainly based on fungicide treatments, although resistance development in this pathogen is reported for a number of fungicides. In this study we describe for the first time the molecular mechanism of resistance to a carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicide. We identified a family of four cellulose synthase (CesA) genes containing conserved domains that are found in all processive glycosyltransferases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed their close relationship to the cellulose synthases of Phytophthora sp. Sequencing of the CesA genes in a CAA- resistant and -sensitive field isolate revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the amino acid structure of the proteins. SNP inheritance in F- 1 -, F- 2 - and F- 3 -progeny confirmed resistance to be correlated with one single SNP located in PvCesA 3. Only if present in both alleles, this SNP led to the substitution of a glycine for a serine residue at position 1105 (G 1105 S) in the deduced amino acid sequence, thus conferring CAA- resistance. Our data demonstrate that the identified genes are putative cellulose synthases and that one recessive mutation in PvCesA 3 causes inheritable resistance to the CAA fungicide <b>mandipropamid.</b> (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The mating type distribution changed from mainly A 1 in 1997 to a majority of A 2 in 2007. No resistant isolates were detected for fluazinam and <b>mandipropamid,</b> whereas the proportion of isolates resistant to mefenoxam (MFX) was high and increased over the years. There was no genetic link between mating type and MFX resistance. Aggressiveness (product between lesion expansion and sporulation capacity) was slightly higher for MFX-resistant compared to sensitive isolates and for isolates collected later compared to earlier in the same season. It was about equally high for A 1 and A 2 types, and for French isolates in 1997 and British isolates in 2007, but lower for French isolates in 2007. Six different SSR genotype families were distinguished. In 1997, populations were dominated by genotype families I and III/IV, which significantly declined in 2007 being largely displaced by genotype families II ('blue 13 ' type) and V, which are by coincidence mainly A 2 MFX resistant and A 1 MFX sensitive, respectively.

The trace residue {{levels in the}} soil were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with variable wavelength detection (VWD). Parameters affecting the MAE process such as the type and volume of the extraction solvent, irradiation power, temperature, irradiation time, moisture and salt addition were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, extraction efficiencies {{in the range of}} 72. 4 - 99. 4 % were obtained for all the fungicides studied. The method was linear over the range of 0. 01 - 10 mu g g(- 1) with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between 0. 9989 and 0. 9999. LODs (S/N = 3) and LOQs (S/N = 10) obtained varied from 0. 0006 to 0. 0015 mu g g(- 1) and from 0. 002 to 0. 005 mu g g(- 1), respectively. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of real soil samples and acceptable recoveries from 57. 5 to 122 % with RSDs <= 14 % were obtained.

40|$|Proper {{disease control}} is very {{important}} to minimize yield losses caused by oomycetes in many crops. Today, oomycete control is partially achieved by breeding for resistance, but mainly by application of single-site mode of action fungicides including the carboxylic acid amides (CAAs). Despite having mostly specific targets, fungicidal activity can differ even in species belonging to the same phylum but the underlying mechanisms are often poorly understood. In an attempt to elucidate the phylogenetic basis and underlying molecular mechanism of sensitivity and tolerance to CAAs, the cellulose synthase 3 (CesA 3) gene was isolated and characterized, encoding the target site of this fungicide class. The CesA 3 gene was present in all 25 species included in this study representing the orders Albuginales, Leptomitales, Peronosporales, Pythiales, Rhipidiales and Saprolegniales, and based on phylogenetic analyses, enabled good resolution of all the different taxonomic orders. Sensitivity assays using the CAA fungicide <b>mandipropamid</b> (MPD) demonstrated that only species belonging to the Peronosporales were inhibited by the fungicide. Molecular data provided evidence, that the observed difference in sensitivity to CAAs between Peronosporales and CAA tolerant species is most likely caused by an inherent amino acid configuration at position 1109 in CesA 3 possibly affecting fungicide binding. The present study not only succeeded in linking CAA sensitivity of various oomycetes to the inherent CesA 3 target site configuration, but could also relate it to the broader phylogenetic context.

Water collected was sampled and analysed for fungicide residues, and organic biofilter was analysed to assess fungicide dissipation. Fungicides were removed from water in a range of 92. 4 – 100 % of the initial concentration. Metalaxyl M was the least retained and probably desorbed during recirculation of water. However, metalaxyl M residues dissipated in 70 days in collected stagnant water. Abiotic and biotic factors contributing to the disappearance of metalaxyl M in water was hypothesised. Fungicide dissipation in the organic biofilter occurred in a 90 -day period with the exception of penconazole that remained at 63. 6 % and 42. 0 % in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

Here, {{we report on the}} comparison of several novel treatments with a more generally accepted antifungal treatment in experimental scientific trials to treat Bd-infected frogs including Alytes obstetricanstadpoles and metamorphs, Bufo bufo and Limnodynastes peroniimetamorphs, and Lithobates pipiensand Rana muscosaadults. The experimental treatments included commercial antifungal products (itraconazole, <b>mandipropamid,</b> steriplantN, and PIP Pond Plus), antimicrobial skin peptides from the Bd-resistant Pelophylax esculentus, microbial treatments (Pedobacter cryoconitis), and heat therapy (35 °C for 24 h). None of the new experimental treatments were considered successful in terms of improving survival; however, these results may advance future research by indicating the limits and potential of the various protocols. Caution in the use of itraconazole is warranted because of observed toxicity in metamorphic and adult frogs, even at low concentrations. Results suggest that rather than focusing on a single cure-all, diverse lines of research may provide multiple options for treating Bdinfection in amphibians.

The baseline sensitivities of 226 P. capsici isolates, tested by mycelial growth inhibition, showed a unimodal distribution with a mean EC 50 value of 1. 4261 (60. 4002) mg/ml. Twelve pyrimorph-resistant mutants were obtained by repeated exposure to pyrimorph in vitro with a frequency of approximately 161024. The resistance factors of the mutants ranged from 10. 67 to 56. 02. Pyrimorph resistance of the mutants was stable after 10 transfers on pyrimorph-free medium. Fitness in sporulation, cystospore germination, and pathogenicity in the pyrimorph-resistant mutants was similar to or less than that in the parental wild-type isolates. On detached pepper leaves and pepper plants treated with the recommended maximum dose of pyrimorph, however, virulence was greater for mutants {{with a high level}} of pyrimorph resistance than for the wild type. The results suggest that the risk of P. capsici developing resistance to pyrimorph is low to moderate. Among mutants {{with a high level of}} pyrimorph resistance, EC 50 values for pyrimorph and CAA fungicides flumorph, dimethomorph, and <b>mandipropamid</b> were positively correlated. This indicated that point mutations in cellulose synthase 3 (CesA 3) may confer resistance to pyrimorph. Comparison of CesA 3 in isolates with a high level of pyrimorph resistance and parental isolates showed that an amino acid change from glutamine to lysine at position 1077 resulted in stable, high resistance in the mutants.

40|$|The climatic {{conditions}} in Northern and Western (NW) Europe, {{which are very}} suitable for the cultivation of potatoes, are also very favourable {{for a range of}} diseases of which late blight, caused by Phytophthora infestans, {{is by far the most}} important with the potential to cause total crop loss. It is controlled by foliar fungicides, with up to 15 – 20 sprays being used per season. A wide range of fungicides is approved for the control of late blight including nonsystemics (e. g. mancozeb, fluazinam), numerous translaminar compounds (e. g. cymoxanil, dimethomorph, <b>mandipropamid)</b> but few fully systemic fungicides (viz. the phenylamides including metalaxyl-M, and propamocarb hydrochloride). Resistance to metalaxyl appeared in 1980, within a few years of its introduction, and led to control failures in Ireland and the Netherlands. Subsequently, anti-resistance management strategies were developed which allowed continuing use of phenylamides only in mixtures with nonsystemic multisite-inhibiting fungicides and with a limited number of applications. Resistance to other fungicides used to control late blight or early blight (caused by Alternaria spp.) has not developed or has not led to major reductions in control, perhaps in part as a consequence of effective resistance management. The potato is also susceptible to many tuber pathogens, which can cause rots and blemishes and are frequently transmitted via the seed tuber. Relatively few fungicides are approved for tuber or soil application to control tuber diseases. Resistance to thiabendazole, first used on potatoes in the 1970 s, developed in several pathogens and resulted in loss of control where it was used alone. Resistance management has focused on avoiding repeated use of thiabendazole during multiple generations of the potato crop and use in mixtures with imazalil.

40|$|Phytophthora blight of peppers (Capsicum annuum) {{is caused}} by the oomycete {{pathogen}} Phytophthora capsici. In Arizona, the root and crown rot phase of the disease initially can appear on plants early in the growing season in areas of the field where soil remains saturated with water after an irrigation or rainfall event. Disease severity can increase dramatically due to summer rains during July and August in the southeastern Arizona production area. Fungicides are an important component of a Phytophthora disease management system, when used in combination with other management practices such as crop rotation, raised beds, and water management. The efficacy of the systemic fungicide mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) for control of Phytophthora blight on pepper has been documented; however, in many pepper production regions, populations of the pathogen insensitive to this fungicide have developed. Other chemistries, including dimethomorph (Acrobat) as well as some new fungicides in development, have activity on some species of Phytophthora and associated diseases on crops other than pepper. The objective of the following study was to evaluate these additional chemistries for efficacy in suppressing development of root and crown rot on pepper plants grown in soil naturally infested with Phytophthora capsici in a greenhouse environment. The mean duration of survival for Aristotle bell pepper plants in untreated soil infested with P. capsici was 29 days. On the other hand, a significant increase in pepper plant survival was achieved when soil was treated with Reason (fenamidone) + Previcur Flex (propamocarb), SA- 110201, Ranman (cyazofamid), Omega (fluazinam), Ridomil Gold (mefenoxam), V- 10161 (fluopicolide), Forum (dimethomorph), NOA- 446510 (<b>mandipropamid),</b> IR- 6141 (kiralaxyl), and Maestro (captan).

40|$|Abstract The {{significance}} of amides {{as a component}} of biomolecules and synthetic products has triggered the development of catalytic direct amidation methods which involve reaction of a carboxylic acid and amine to form an amide with water as the only by-product. These methods evade the need for stoichiometric activation or coupling reagents and hence, are important green chemical processes. Investigations into direct amide formation began with the development a mild reaction conditions for the direct amidation reaction with known arylboronic acid catalysts in two different model reactions and compared with both reported and potential organometallic catalysts (Zr and Fe based). After a systematic evaluation of solvent, temperature and catalyst, ambient reaction conditions were applied in the direct amidation of amino-acid derivatives in order to exploit these more economical reagents for peptide synthesis which is both little used and little explored. Protected amino acid derivatives showed slow reactivity compared to simple amine-carboxylic acid combinations and hence high catalyst loadings were required, though did proceed at 65 68 °C generally avoiding racemisation. However, an interesting synergistic catalytic effect was observed during dipeptide formation using mixture of two arylboronic acid catalysts (1 : 1) in the direct amidation reaction at lower temperatures, although the process was particularly slow. This impressive result led to explore more about the effect of ‘Cooperative Catalysts’, particularly, on the less reactive acid-amine combination. As a consequence, some commercially important synthesis has been reviewed through this novel cooperative catalysis to ensure their real applicability in industries. Acceptance of the practicability and general applicability of this new approach depends upon the understanding of the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis. In order to reveal the mechanism of the cooperative catalysis the direct amide formation reactions were followed by the real time monitoring technology (React-IR) and HPLC. However, further investigations are required to understand the mechanistic intricacies of this cooperative catalysis. Further, the role of H-bonding in the amide bond formation with significantly inert acid (pivalic acid) towards the amine to form amide has been attempted. In order to accelerate the catalytic activity the use of a potential catalyst promoter, ‘ANB 209 ’ in the direct amidation reactions was also examined. Improvements in catalysts activity or alterations in catalyst would need further study so that the direct amide formation becomes a common tool {{for a wide range of}} carboxylic acid and amine partners. The effect of different substituents on the α-position of carboxylic acid with various amine substrates was investigated to understand the exceptional direct amide formation of the synthesis of <b>mandipropamid,</b> a well known fungicide. Both uncatalysed and catalysed direct amidations of mandelic acid was done with different amine substrates at different temperatures, resulting different rate of amide formation. Finally, the application of two novel borinic acid (R 1 RBOH) compounds in the direct amide formation reactions has been assessed for the first time, which displayed in some cases the potential to act as catalysts for direct amide formation. Further research will likely to accelerate the developments of this type of catalysts in direct amidations. ...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew, {{caused by}} the biotrophic oomycetes, Peronospora sparsa, is a major disease of boysenberries, with crop loss from disease for {{conventional}} growers being up to 45 % and for organic growers up to 100 % in some years. Most boysenberry plant material (including tissue culture propagated plants) are systemically infected with the pathogen. Disease expression by sporulation of naturally infected leaves, stems/canes and calyxes at 15 ºC under high humidity in the field was identified {{as the source of}} inoculum in the wider Nelson area in 2010 and 2011 with peak spore dispersal in mid-November. A strong relationship between rainfall pattern, humidity and temperature and P. sparsa spore dispersal was observed. Spore dispersal was triggered by the frequency (%) of rainy days, RH and warm temperatures (16 - 23 ºC) in early spring where early wet periods with high moisture levels promoting sporulation and a subsequent dry period allowed spore release. In vitro, the optimum temperature for spore germination, infection, sporulation and lesion expansion were 20 ºC (24 h darkness), 15 or 20 ºC (12 h/ 12 h light/ dark), 15 or 20 ºC (12 h/ 12 h light/ dark) under high humidity, respectively. The optimum spore numbers for infection was 200. Similarly in vivo evaluations showed that disease expression on young foliage, stems/canes, calyxes/sepals, petals and stamen by symptoms and sporulation was favoured at temperatures ranging from 5 - 15 ºC, under high relative humidity (90 - 100 %) in potted systemically infected boysenberry plants. An existing nested PCR for detection of P. sparsa was optimised and limits of detection determined in different plant tissues. The optimised Plant & Food Research (P&FR) protocol (using modified Aegerter buffer) extracted more P. sparsa DNA with a higher purity than the commercial PowerPlant® DNA isolation kit. The optimised nested PCR could detect as little as 0. 4 pg of P. sparsa genomic spore DNA from a range of asymptomatic boysenberry tissues including primocane tips, leaves, leaf buds, canes/ stems, roots, flower buds, flowers and berries. This was approximately equivalent to 40 spores. The method was improved to a more rapid and robust one step nested PCR method with an equivalent sensitivity for detecting latent infection of P. sparsa. The results showed that the most robust tissues for reliable detection of latent infection were root or crown. In vitro and in vivo evaluations indicated that dryberry is caused by spore infection of flowers or berries by the spores produced on systemically infected canes/ stems, calyx, and petals under favourable environmental conditions. Accordingly two infection pathways resulting in dryberry were identified: 1) spores produced on petals and calyx may infect pollen followed by fertilisation of infected pollen then systemic infection of the drupelets of the developing berry initials, 2) spore infection of drupelets at the red partially ripe stage. Movement of the pathogen from the systemically infected cane to berries across the pedicel and calyx was not observed. Of the ten fungicides investigated in vitro, chlorothalonil, <b>mandipropamid,</b> fluazinam, azoxystrobin and dimethomorph were the most effective to inhibit P. sparsa spore germination and infection. In vivo evaluations on young disease-free boysenberry plants showed that dimethomorph, azoxystrobin and metalaxyl-M+mancozeb were the most effective at protecting leaves from infection. Three applications of phosphorous acid (PA) reduced both incidence and severity of dryberry whereas, acibenzolar-s-methyl reduced only incidence in systemically infected plants. A tissue culture protocol was developed for the production of P. sparsa pathogen free clean boysenberry propagation material by heat alone. As this method does not rely on treatment of infected plants with fungicides, there is no subsequent risk of fungicide resistant strains developing. Distribution of clean boysenberry planting material in new gardens or replanting areas in existing gardens in New Zealand is an important initial step to avoid disease epidemics in the field...|$|E
40|$|Many oomycetes are {{important}} pathogens of plants (e. g. arable crops, fruit and forest trees), animals or microbes and, upon attacking their hosts, cause considerable economic damage mainly in agriculture and aquaculture. To minimize yield losses efficient disease control, primarily {{relying on the}} application of anti-oomycete compounds with a single-site mode of action, is very important. Some anti-oomycete compounds specifically inhibit mitochondrial respiration, RNA synthesis, microtubule organization or cell wall synthesis. The oomycete cell wall is mainly composed of β- 1, 3 -, β- 1, 6 glucans and cellulose that provide rigidity to the cell. The synthesis of cellulose was recently shown in Phytophthora infestans to be the target for <b>mandipropamid</b> (MPD), which belongs to the oomycete specific carboxylic acid amide (CAA) fungicides controlling members of the Peronosporales. However, there are several oomycetes that the CAAs cannot control (e. g. the entire genus Pythium), even though cellulose is an important cell wall component of all oomycetes. Furthermore, the mode of action of CAA fungicides is highly specific, thus the resistance risk {{is assumed to be}} moderate to high. Consequently, resistant individuals were recovered in Plasmopara viticola and Pseudoperonospora cubensis populations, but the underlying mechanism of resistance remained unknown. This thesis aims to identify and characterize the cellulose synthase (CesA) genes of various oomycete species and thereby to investigate the mechanism(s) of resistance in sensitive species, i. e. species normally affected by CAAs, and tolerance in insensitive species, i. e. species unaffected by CAA fungicides. A family of four cellulose synthase genes was identified and fully sequenced in the downy mildew pathogens P. viticola and P. cubensis. Phylogenetic analyses of the four genes revealed their close relatedness to cellulose synthase genes of Phytophthora spp. and the red algae Porphyra yezoensis. Sequencing of the CesA genes in CAA- resistant and -sensitive field isolates of P. viticola and P. cubensis uncovered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the amino acid structure of CesA proteins. Inheritance of resistance in P. viticola was confirmed to be correlated with one recessive SNP located in the CesA 3 gene. This SNP led to an exchange from a highly conserved glycine (encoded by GGC) to serine (AGC) at position 1105 (G 1105 S), whereas in P. cubensis, mutations causing amino acid substitutions from glycine (GGG) to valine (GTG) or tryptophane (TGG) (G 1105 V, G 1105 W) occurred in the same codon. The results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} SNPs in codon 1105, when present in both alleles, lead to amino acid exchanges in the CesA 3 enzyme causing inheritable and stable resistance to all CAA fungicides. New insights into the molecular basis of CAA tolerance in Pythiales were provided by characterizing five genes putatively involved in carbohydrate synthesis of the root rot and damping off causative agent Pythium aphanidermatum. Using the CODEHOP PCR strategy, one chitin synthase gene, PaChs, and four cellulose synthase genes, PaCesA 1 to PaCesA 4, out of which PaCesA 3 encodes the MPD target enzyme, were amplified and fully sequenced. These genes were individually upregulated during encystment, germination of cystospores and mycelial growth indicating their relevance for cell wall formation. However, almost no change in PaCesA or PaChs expression was observed when mycelium was treated with MPD concentrations slightly affecting mycelial growth. Detailed analyses of the putative target site in PaCesA 3 revealed a specific amino acid configuration (L 1109) also present in CAA resistant P. infestans mutants. The affected amino acid residue is located only four amino acids downstream of the G 1105 residue, where amino acid exchanges cause inheritable resistance to CAAs in P. viticola and P. cubensis field isolates. This implies that MPD tolerance in P. aphanidermatum, and most likely in other Pythium species, is based on the leucine configuration at position 1109 which may affect the binding of CAAs to the enzyme. To further examine the results obtained with P. aphanidermatum, the CesA 3 gene structure as well as the sensitivity to CAAs of 25 species representing the Albuginales, Leptomitales, Peronosporales, Pythiales, Rhipidiales and Saprolegniales was investigated. Molecular characterization of the putative target site in CesA 3 revealed a conserved glycine at position 1105 (G 1105) in all oomycete species. However, at position 1109 the Peronosporales displayed the amino acid valine, whereas all species from the other orders showed either leucine or methionine at this position. The observed amino acid configurations (L 1109 and M 1109) correlated with MPD tolerance, suggesting that amino acid changes at position 1109 may also affect CAA efficacy in sensitive species. In addition, the full-length nucleotide sequence of the CesA 3 gene was used to study phylogenetic relatedness among oomycetes originating from the six distinct orders. The phylogenetic tree constructed with the CesA 3 gene sequence was largely in agreement with trees based on other markers (e. g. cox 2, SSU, LSU rDNA), implying that this gene represents a promising tool to reconstruct an overall picture of the oomycete phylogeny. The presented insights into the molecular mechanism(s) of CAA resistance and tolerance significantly contribute to a sound assessment of resistance risk when CAAs are used to control oomycetes. In addition, the results open up novel tools for basic investigations on cellulose biosynthesis in oomycetes. ...|$|E
