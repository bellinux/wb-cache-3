A study, in which correlations between <b>methyleugenol</b> 1 ′-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes from 15 individuals and the conversion of enzyme specific substrates by the same microsomes were investigated, showed that P 450 1 A 2 and P 450 2 C 9 are important enzymes in the bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol.</b> This was confirmed in an inhibition study in which pooled human liver microsomes were incubated with <b>methyleugenol</b> in the presence and absence of enzyme specific inhibitors.

40|$|<b>Methyleugenol</b> is a {{component}} of essential oils and is found in many foods and consumer products. Structurally similar to safrole, a known rodent carcinogen, <b>methyleugenol</b> {{has been shown to}} be a potent rodent hepatocarcinogen in a National Toxicology Program two-year bioassay. The mechanism by which <b>methyleugenol</b> causes tumors is suspected to mimic that of safrole. However, it is unknown if <b>methyleugenol</b> produces metabolites analogous to the proximate carcinogens of safrole. The hypothesis of this study is that <b>methyleugenol</b> is a genotoxicant after metabolic activation. The data presented show that <b>methyleugenol</b> is rapidly excreted from the body of rodents after oral and IV dose, primarily in the urine. Metabolites found in the urine include hydroxylated derivatives that are subsequently conjugated. The same basic pattern of metabolites is produced in isolated hepatocytes and microsomes from both rodents and humans. Mice produce more of these metabolites and at a faster rate than do rat or human derived systems. Among the metabolites identified in microsomes is 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol, the analogous metabolite to the proximate carcinogen of safrole. Results of the Unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in hepatocytes show that <b>methyleugenol</b> is positive (genotoxic) in both rats and mice but possibly much less so in human derived hepatocytes, and that genotoxicity can be blocked by preventing sulfation in rodent hepatoctyes. Thus <b>methyleugenol</b> is capable of forming the proximate carcinogenic molecule (1 ' - hydroxymethyleugenol) and the subsequent sulfation of that molecule may lead to the moiety responsible for DNA damage and potentially eventual tumorigenesis...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Methyleugenol,</b> the {{methyl ether}} of eugenol, {{both of which}} are flavorant {{constituents}} of spices, has been listed by the National Toxicology Program’s Report on Carcinogens as reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. This finding is based on the observation of increased incidence of malignant tumors at multiple tissue sites in experimental animals of different species. By contrast, eugenol is not listed. In this study, we show that both <b>methyleugenol</b> and eugenol readily undergo peroxidative metabolism in vitro to form free radicals with large hyperfine interactions of the methylene allylic hydrogen atoms. These large hyperfine splittings indicate large electron densities adjacent to those hydrogen atoms. <b>Methyleugenol</b> undergoes autoxidation such that the commercial product contains 10 − 30 mg/L hydroperoxide and is capable of activating peroxidases without the presence of added hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, the hydroperoxide is not a good substrate for catalase, which demonstrates that these antioxidant defenses will not be effective in protecting against <b>methyleugenol</b> exposure...|$|E

40|$|<b>Methyleugenol,</b> {{which occurs}} {{naturally}} in various herbs such as tarragon, basil, nutmeg and allspice, {{is added to}} food either directly as a flavoring substance or as a constituent of added essential oils (Smith et al., 2002). The interest {{in the risk of}} <b>methyleugenol</b> as a food constituent came from its widespread use in a variety of foods and beverages as well as its structural resemblance to the known carcinogen safrole (Johnson et al., 2000). In addition, <b>methyleugenol</b> has been reported to be DNA reactive and carcinogenic, inducing malignant tumors in multiple tissues of rats and mice as well as inducing unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver (Ding et al., 2011; NTP, 2000; Smith et al., 2002). The safety of human exposure to <b>methyleugenol</b> at low dietary intake levels has been assessed several times (Hall and Oser, 1965; NTP, 2000; SCF, 2001; Smith et al., 2002) without reaching a scientific agreement on how to translate the carcinogenicity data of rodent animal experiments obtained at high levels of exposure to the relevant human situation. A recent evaluation, performed by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 2008, has indicated that although evidence of carcinogenicity to rodents given high doses of <b>methyleugenol</b> exists, {{further research is needed to}} assess the potential risk to human health at relevant dietary exposure resulting from the presence of <b>methyleugenol</b> in foods and essential oils and its use as flavoring agent (JECFA, 2008). Predicting the cancer risk in humans at relevant dietary intake levels requires extrapolation of the animal carcinogenicity data taking in consideration dose, species, and interindividual variation. Furthermore, it implies extrapolation from rat or mouse studies with high dose levels of the pure compound to the human situation in which exposure at low dose levels occurs within the context of a complex food matrix. The aim of the present PhD project was to obtain quantitative insight into the consequences of dose- and species-dependent effects and of interindividual differences and matrix effects for the bioactivation and detoxification of <b>methyleugenol</b> by using physiologically based kinetic (PBK) modeling. The first chapter of this thesis presents background information to the topic. In chapter 2, a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for the alkenylbenzene <b>methyleugenol</b> in rat was defined based on in vitro metabolic parameters determined using relevant tissue fractions, in silico derived partition coefficients (Payne and Kenny, 2002 and reference therin), and physiological parameters (Brown et al., 1997) derived from the literature. The model was based on the model previously developed for the related alkenylbenzene estragole and consists of eight compartments including liver, lung, and kidney as metabolizing compartments, and separate compartments for fat, arterial blood, venous blood, richly perfused and slowly perfused tissues (Punt et al., 2008). Evaluation of the model was performed by comparing the PBK predicted concentration of <b>methyleugenol</b> in the venous compartment to <b>methyleugenol</b> plasma levels reported in the literature, by comparing the PBK predicted dose-dependent % of formation of 2 -hydroxy- 4, 5 -dimethoxyallylbenzene, 3 -hydroxy- 4 -methoxyallylbenzene, and 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide to the corresponding % of metabolites excreted in urine reported in the literature, which were demonstrated to be in the same order of magnitude (Solheim and Scheline, 1976). With the model obtained the relative extent of bioactivation and detoxification of <b>methyleugenol</b> at different oral doses was examined. At low doses, formation of 3 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenyl) - 2 -propen- 1 -olandmethyleugenol- 2 ′, 3 ′-oxideleadingto detoxification appear to be the major metabolic pathways, occurring in the liver. At high doses, the model reveals a relative increase in the formation of the proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol, occurring in the liver. This relative increase in formation of 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol leads to a relative increase in formation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide, 1 ′-oxomethyleugenol, and 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol the latter being the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of <b>methyleugenol.</b> These results indicate that the relative importance of different metabolic pathways of <b>methyleugenol</b> may vary in a dose-dependent way, leading to a relative increase in bioactiviation of <b>methyleugenol</b> at higher doses. In subsequent studies described in chapter 3 a physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for <b>methyleugenol</b> in human based on in vitro and in silico derived parameters was identified based on the model previously developed for the related alkenylbenzene estragole. The model consists of six compartments including liver as metabolizing compartment, and separate compartments for fat, arterial blood, venous blood, richly perfused and slowly perfused tissues (Punt et al., 2009). With the model obtained, bioactivation and detoxification of <b>methyleugenol</b> at different dose levels could be investigated. The outcomes of this human model were compared with those of the PBK model for <b>methyleugenol</b> in male rat. The results obtained reveal that formation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide, a major metabolic pathway in male rat liver, appears to represent a minor metabolic pathway in human liver whereas in human liver a significantly higher formation of 1 ′-oxomethyleugenol compared with male rat liver is observed. Furthermore, formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol, which readily undergoes desulfonation to a reactive carbo-cation that can form DNA or protein adducts, is predicted to be the same in the liver of both human and male rat at oral doses of 0. 0034 up to 300 mg/(kg bw). Altogether it was concluded that despite a significant difference in especially the metabolic pathways of the proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol between human and male rat, the influence of species differences on the ultimate overall bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> to 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol appears to be negligible. Moreover, the PBK model predicted the formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol in the liver of human and rat to be linear from doses as high as the benchmark dose (BMD 10) down to as low as the virtual safe dose (VSD). This shows that kinetic data do not provide a reason to argue against linear extrapolation from the rat tumor data to the human situation. Another aim of the present PhD study was to study the effect of the basil constituent nevadensin on the bioactivation and genotoxicity of herb based <b>methyleugenol.</b> The results presented in chapter 4 show that nevadensin is able to inhibit DNA adduct formation in HepG 2 cells exposed to the proximate carcinogen 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol in the presence of this flavonoid. This inhibition occurs at the level of sulfotransferase (SULT) -mediated bioactivation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol. In order to investigate possible in vivo implications the SULT inhibition by nevadensin was integrated into the male rat and human PBK models for bioactivation and detoxification of <b>methyleugenol.</b> The results thus obtained reveal that coadministration of <b>methyleugenol</b> with nevadensin may reduce the levels of bioactivation of 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol to the DNA reactive metabolite, without reducing its detoxification via glucuronidation or oxidation. This effect may be significant even at realistic low dose human exposure levels. The results obtained point at a potential reduction of the cancer risk when <b>methyleugenol</b> exposure occurs by oral intake within a relevant food matrix containing SULT inhibitors compared to what is observed in rodent bioassays upon exposure to pure <b>methyleugenol</b> dosed by gavage. Besides dose-dependent effects, species differences effects, and matrix effects on the bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> the effect of interindividual variation on <b>methyleugenol</b> detoxification and bioactivation was investigated in chapter 5. To this end we predicted the level of formation of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol in the human population by taking the variability in key bioactivation and detoxification reactions into account using Monte Carlo simulations. Insight in the variation in relevant metabolic routes was obtained by determining kinetic constants for the metabolic reactions by specific isoenzymes or by measuring the kinetic constants in incubations with a range of individual human liver fractions. The results of the study indicate that formation of 1 ′-sulfooxymethyleugenol is predominantly affected by i) P 450 1 A 2 catalyzed bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> to 1 ′- hydroxymethyleugenol ii) P 450 2 B 6 catalyzed epoxidation of <b>methyleugenol</b> and iii) the apparent kinetic constants for detoxification of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol via oxidation and iv) the apparent kinetic constants for bioactivation of 1 ′-hydroxymethyleugenol to 1 ′- sulfooxymethyleugenol. Based on the Monte Carlo simulation a chemical-specific adjustment factor (CSAF) for intraspecies variation could be derived which is defined as the 95 th or 99 th percentile divided by the 50 th percentile of the predicted distribution of the formation of 1 ′- sulfooxymethyleugenol in the liver. The obtained CSAF value at the 95 th percentile was 3. 7 indicating that the default uncertainty factor of 3. 16 for human variability in kinetics (WHO, 1999) may adequately protect 95 % of the population. While protecting 99 % of the population requires a larger uncertainty factor of 5. 8. Altogether, the results shown in this thesis reveal that integrating in vitro metabolic parameters within a framework of a PBK model provides a good method to evaluate the occurrence of dose-dependent effects, species differences, and human variability in detoxification and bioactivation of a genotoxic carcinogen. Moreover, the results presented in this thesis show the possible protective effect of the basil constituent nevadensin on SULT catalysed bioactivation and DNA adduct formation of <b>methyleugenol</b> in vitro. Upon validation of these effects in vivo, it may turn out that rodent carcinogenicity data on <b>methyleugenol</b> substantially overestimate the risks posed when humans are exposed to <b>methyleugenol</b> within a nevadensin containing food matrix...|$|E

40|$|This study {{defines a}} physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model for <b>methyleugenol</b> (ME) in human based on in vitro and in silico derived parameters. With the model obtained, {{bioactivation}} and detoxification of <b>methyleugenol</b> (ME) at different doses levels could be investigated. The {{outcomes of the}} current model were {{compared with those of}} a previously developed PBK model for <b>methyleugenol</b> (ME) in male rat. The results obtained reveal that formation of 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol glucuronide (1 'HMEG), a major metabolic pathway in male rat liver, appears to represent a minor metabolic pathway in human liver whereas in human liver a significantly higher formation of 1 '-oxomethyleugenol (1 'OME) compared with male rat liver is observed. Furthermore, formation of 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol (1 'HMES), which readily undergoes desulfonation to a reactive carbonium ion (CA) that can form DNA or protein adducts (DA), is predicted to be the same in the liver of both human and male rat at oral doses of 0. 0034 and 300 mg/kg bw. Altogether despite a significant difference in especially the metabolic pathways of the proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol (1 'HME) between human and male rat, the influence of species differences on the ultimate overall bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> (ME) to 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol (1 'HMES) appears to be negligible. Moreover, the PBK model predicted the formation of 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol (1 'HMES) in the liver of human and rat to be linear from doses as high as the benchmark dose (BMD 10) down to as low as the virtual safe dose (VSD). This study shows that kinetic data do not provide a reason to argue against linear extrapolation from the rat tumor data to the human situation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{predicting}} {{the level of}} formation of the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of <b>methyleugenol,</b> 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol, in the human population by taking variability in key bioactivation and detoxification reactions into account using Monte Carlo simulations. Depending on the metabolic route, variation was simulated based on kinetic constants obtained from incubations {{with a range of}} individual human liver fractions or by combining kinetic constants obtained for specific isoenzymes with literature reported human variation in the activity of these enzymes. The results of the study indicate that formation of 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol is predominantly affected by variation in i) P 450 1 A 2 -catalyzed bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> to 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol, ii) P 450 2 B 6 -catalyzed epoxidation of <b>methyleugenol,</b> iii) the apparent kinetic constants for oxidation of 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol, and iv) the apparent kinetic constants for sulfation of 1 '-hydroxymethyleugenol. Based on the Monte Carlo simulations a so-called chemical-specific adjustment factor (CSAF) for intraspecies variation could be derived by dividing different percentiles by the 50 th percentile of the predicted population distribution for 1 '-sulfooxymethyleugenol formation. The obtained CSAF value at the 90 th percentile was 3. 2, indicating that the default uncertainty factor of 3. 16 for human variability in kinetics may adequately cover the variation within 90 % of the population. Covering 99 % of the population requires a larger uncertainty factor of 6. 4. In conclusion, the results showed that adequate predictions on interindividual human variation can be made with Monte Carlo-based PBK modeling. For <b>methyleugenol</b> this variation was observed to be in line with the default variation generally assumed in risk assessment...|$|E

The essential oil of A. rugosa aerial parts was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of 37 components of the essential oil were identified, with the principal compounds being <b>methyleugenol</b> (50. 51 %), estragole (8. 55 %), and eugenol (7. 54 %), followed by thymol (3. 62 %), pulegone (2. 56 %), limonene (2. 49 %) and caryophyllene (2. 38 %). Based on bioactivity-guided fractionation, the three active constituents were isolated from the essential oil and identified as <b>methyleugenol,</b> estragole and eugenol. The essential oil of A. rugosa exhibited strong nematicidal activity against M. incognita, with a LC 50 value of 47. 3 μg/mL.

40|$|The herbal {{constituents}} safrole, estragole, and <b>methyleugenol,</b> {{belonging to}} the chemical class of the alkenylbenzenes, are genotoxic and carcinogenic compounds. The genotoxicity of these alkenylbenzenes proceeds via electrophilic metabolites generated by cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450) and sulfotransferases (SULT). Carcinogenicity of these compounds was demonstrated in animal experiments using relatively high doses of single compounds. Human exposure to these compounds is {{much lower than the}} doses used in the animal experiments and humans are exposed to alkenylbenzenes in a complex food matrix. The first aim of this thesis was to identify the human P 450 enzymes that are responsible for the bioactivation of the alkenylbenzenes into their proximate carcinogenic 1 ¢ - hydroxymetabolites. Several in vitro studies using recombinant P 450 enzymes and human liver microsomes were undertaken to identify the main enzymes involved in the 1 ¢ -hydroxylation of the alkenylbenzenes and to determine their kinetics. These studies showed that at low substrate concentrations, P 450 1 A 2 is the major enzyme in the bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol,</b> P 450 1 A 2 and P 450 2 A 6 are the main enzymes in the bioactivation of estragole, and P 450 2 A 6 is the main enzyme in the bioactivation of safrole. The second objective of this thesis was to study the influence of other herbal constituents on the bioactivation and the genotoxicity of herb-based alkenylbenzenes. An on-line high-performance liquid chromatography detection system was developed for the detection of P 450 1 A 2 inhibitors in herbal extracts. The presence of P 450 1 A 2 inhibitors in basil, a herb that contains <b>methyleugenol</b> and estragole, was demonstrated using this on-line system. In addition to these P 450 1 A 2 inhibitors, also the alkenylbenzenes themselves may act as inhibitors competing for the active site of P 450 1 A 2 (estragole and <b>methyleugenol)</b> or P 450 2 A 6 (estragole and safrole). Furthermore it was demonstrated that basil extract is able to strongly inhibit sulfation and subsequent DNA adduct formation of 1 ¢ - hydroxyestragole in incubations with rat and human S 9 homogenates and in the human hepatoma HepG 2 cell line. These in vitro results suggest that P 450 - and SULT-catalyzed bioactivation of <b>methyleugenol</b> and/or estragole and subsequent adverse effects may be lower in a matrix of other herbal components than what would be expected on the basis of experiments using single compounds. In vivo experiments have to point out whether the protective effects that are found in these in vitro studies can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation. It may turn out that rodent carcinogenicity data on estragole and <b>methyleugenol</b> considerably overestimate the risks posed when humans are exposed to these compounds in a herbal matrix...|$|E

40|$|A risk {{assessment}} of basil-based pesto sauces containing <b>methyleugenol</b> and related alkenylbenzenes was performed {{based on their}} levels detected {{in a series of}} pesto sauces available on the Dutch market. The estimated daily intake (EDI) values of alkenylbenzenes as a result of consumption of the different pesto sauces amounted to 1. 2 – 44. 3 μg/kg bw for individual alkenylbenzenes, 14. 3 – 43. 5 μg/kg bw when adding up the alkenylbenzene levels assuming equal potency, and 17. 3 – 62. 9 μg/kg bw when expressed in <b>methyleugenol</b> equivalents using alkenylbenzenes defined toxic equivalency factors (TEF). The margin of exposure approach (MOE), used to evaluate the potential risks, resulted in MOE values that were generally lower than 10000 indicating a priority for risk management when assuming daily consumption. The levels of <b>methyleugenol</b> detected in the pesto sauces would allow consumption of 1. 1 – 29. 8, 7. 5 – 208, 15. 1 – 416. 5, and 32. 4 – 892. 5 g of pesto sauce on a daily basis, once a week, once every two weeks, and once a month, respectively, to achieve MOE values above the 10000 limit indicating low priority for risk management.

40|$|Human {{cytochrome}} P 450 enzymes {{involved in}} the bioactivation of estragole to its proximate carcinogen 1 ′-hydroxyestragole were identified and compared to the enzymes of importance for 1 ′-hydroxylation of the related alkenylbenzenes <b>methyleugenol</b> and safrole. Incubations with Supersomes revealed that all enzymes tested, except P 450 2 C 8, are intrinsically able to 1 ′-hydroxylate estragole. Experiments with Gentest microsomes, expressing P 450 enzymes to roughly average liver levels, indicated that P 450 1 A 2, 2 A 6, 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 might contribute to estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation in the human liver. Especially P 450 1 A 2 is an important enzyme based on the correlation between P 450 1 A 2 activity and estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation in human liver microsomal samples and inhibition of estragole 1 ′-hydroxylation by the P 450 1 A 2 inhibitor α-naphthoflavone. Kinetic studies revealed that, at physiologically relevant concentrations of estragole, P 450 1 A 2 and 2 A 6 {{are the most important}} enzymes for bioactivation in the human liver showing enzyme efficiencies (kcat/Km) of, respectively, 59 and 341 min- 1 mM- 1. Only at relatively high estragole concentrations, P 450 2 C 19, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 might contribute to some extent. Comparison to results from similar studies for safrole and <b>methyleugenol</b> revealed that competitive interactions between estragole and <b>methyleugenol</b> 1 ′-hydroxylation and between estragole and safrole 1 ′-hydroxylation are to be expected because of the involvement of, respectively, P 450 1 A 2 and P 450 2 A 6 in the bioactivation of these compounds. Furthermore, poor metabolizer phenotypes in P 450 2 A 6 might diminish the chances on bioactivation of estragole and safrole, whereas lifestyle factors increasing P 450 1 A 2 activities such as cigarette smoking and consumption of charbroiled food might increase those chances for estragole and <b>methyleugenol.</b> © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E
