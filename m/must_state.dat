5|$|As a formality, {{a person}} <b>must</b> <b>state</b> a justifiable reason for {{purchasing}} a B category firearm, which include collecting, sporting, hunting or cultural activity, conducting business with firearms and ammunition, providing security, exercise of profession and self-defense. The police will issue the permit {{in up to}} 30 days (usually immediately) and the permit is shall-issue if the applicant has a valid gun license (and fulfills all of its requirements, e.g. clean criminal record); the purchase permit is valid for 12 months.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys <b>must</b> <b>state</b> the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E

There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions <b>must</b> <b>state</b> the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E

There must also be a concise statement of facts, and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred. During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents. However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to pay any costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E

40|$|International {{human rights}} law {{requires}} states {{to protect people}} from abuses committed by third parties. Decision-makers widely agree that states have such obligations, but no framework exists for identifying when states have them or what they require. The practice is to varying degrees splintered, inconsistent, and conceptually confused. This article presents a generalized framework to fill that void. The article argues that whether a <b>state</b> <b>must</b> protect someone from third-party harm depends on the state 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with the third party and {{on the kind of}} harm caused. A duty-holding <b>state</b> <b>must</b> take reasonable measures to restrain the abuser. That framework is grounded in international law and intended to guide decisions in concrete cases. So after presenting and justifying the framework, the article applies it to two current debates in human rights law: when <b>must</b> a <b>state</b> protect against third-party harms committed outside its territory? And what <b>must</b> <b>states</b> do to protect women from private acts of violence? The article ends by suggesting how the same framework may inform analogous obligations outside human rights law...|$|R

25|$|The {{conditions}} of probation {{must be provided}} to the defendant {{in a written statement}} that is sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the defendant's conduct and for such supervision as is required. The District Court <b>must</b> <b>state</b> its reasons for imposing a term of supervised release where none is required by statute; appellate courts deem it inappropriate to assume that the sentencing court's reason for imposing a prison term likewise extends to its decision regarding supervised release. The conditions for probation must be reasonably related to the purposes of the Federal Probation Act, and the purposes sought to be served by probation (including rehabilitation of the probationer), the extent to which constitutional rights enjoyed by law-abiding citizens should be accorded to probationers, and the legitimate needs of law enforcement are factors considered in determining whether a reasonable relationship exists. The trial court is given wide discretion in establishing {{conditions of}} probation, and the order of the district judge providing for probation will be overturned only if it is abuse of discretion.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We <b>must</b> <b>state</b> that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless the patients are cared for in a sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E

25|$|Further entries of the subject, {{or middle}} entries, occur {{throughout}} the fugue. They <b>must</b> <b>state</b> the subject or answer {{at least once}} in its entirety, and may also be heard in combination with the countersubject(s) from the exposition, new countersubjects, free counterpoint, or any of these in combination. It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle-entries as in the exposition; rather, it is usually heard with {{at least one of the}} countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments. Middle-entries tend to occur at pitches other than the initial. As shown in the typical structure above, these are often closely related keys such as the relative dominant and subdominant, although the key structure of fugues varies greatly. In the fugues of J. S. Bach, the first middle-entry occurs most often in the relative major or minor of the work's overall key, and is followed by an entry in the dominant of the relative major or minor when the fugue's subject requires a tonal answer. In the fugues of earlier composers (notably Buxtehude and Pachelbel), middle entries in keys other than the tonic and dominant tend to be the exception, and non-modulation the norm. One of the famous examples of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehude's Praeludium (Fugue and Chaconne) in C, BuxWV 137.|$|E
