He received a large number of letters and emails on the subject in subsequent years, and wrote a follow-up article in 2001 entitled [...] "Should a Christian Play Dungeons & Dragons?". These essays portray Dungeons & Dragons as a tool for New Age Satanic groups to introduce concepts and behaviors that are seen as contrary to Christian teaching and morality in general. Schnoebelen wrote: [...] "In the late 1970s, a couple of the game writers actually came to <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> as prominent 'sorcerers' in the community.

On 17 July 1995, Chris Shellabear sold the now-encumbered property to Sharon Creasy, wife of prospector Mark Creasy, for $2.7 million. On 10 October 1995, the Heritage Council of Western Australia added the property to the State Register of Heritage Places on an [...] "interim" [...] basis.
