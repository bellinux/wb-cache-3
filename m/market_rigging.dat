40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the lay-up {{decision in the}} North Sea offshore <b>rig</b> <b>market</b> from 2010 through march 2017. Using empirical analysis, we have specified a logistic regression model to investigate how rig characteristics, firm size and market variables affect the decision to both cold- and ready-stack a jackup or a semi-submersible rig. We find that that younger jackups with deep water depth owned by companies with multiple rigs in the North Sea, {{are less likely to}} be laid up. In a period with varying market conditions, a higher value of the rig characteristics variable deck load, quarters capacity and blow out preventer (BOP), as well as the specification severe environment, increase the probability of laying up a jackup. For semi-submersibles, we find that younger rigs with a higher value of max water depth and quarters capacity, equipped with self-propulsion, DP- 3 system and classified for severe environment, were less likely to be laid up. While a higher value of variable deck load increased the likelihood of cold-stacking a semi-submersible. The regression results show that a higher day rate and expectations for a higher future oil price strongly decrease the likelihood for both jackups and semi-submersibles being laid up. The thesis supplements the existing literature of the offshore <b>rig</b> <b>market.</b> To our knowledge, no economical investigation regarding the lay-up decision have been carried out on the North Sea offshore <b>rig</b> <b>market.</b> This thesis therefore provides a basis for further research of this market.

Optimal management of this steel is very critical in this line of business. However, in recent years, demand for these rigs has been increasing at a tremendous rate and previous steel management policies are fast becoming unable to cope with this surge of demand. The thesis first looks at characterizing the nature of the demand of steel plates in the company. This led to the identification of key factors of demand, resulting in a classification system of the steel plates according to their demand behavior. This system further led to the crafting of various policies to manage the risks involved in the procurement of the steel plates. We propose to use the newsboy model to minimize the inventory costs, subject to uncertain demand.

40|$|The thesis {{provides}} for a comprehensive legal overview of bid rigging and its manifestation in public procurement. Bid rigging is defined as coordination of competitors in tenders which is not necessary and which is executed when these competitors submit bids according to the conditions agreed among them. The thesis briefly sums up available information on occurrence of bid rigging with emphasis on the only two cases of bid rigging that have been identified, proved and sanctioned in the Czech Republic. This information suggests that {{despite the fact that}} the risk of bid rigging is higher at certain markets, notably markets with limited number of competitors present thereon, it may take place in any <b>market.</b> Bid <b>rigging</b> is further analysed as a prohibited agreement distorting competition which always distorts or prevents competitions and as such is considered one of the most serious anti- competitive practices capable of causing immense economic damage. A separate chapter tackles bid rigging in public procurement. This chapter analyses legal basis of prohibition of bid rigging in public procurement, its impact on principles of efficiency, effectiveness and expediency, and points out factors that may support occurrence of bid rigging.

40|$|The boom in {{the real}} estate and {{construction}} industry in India saw a sudden and sharp increase in the price of cement, to the extent of a price increment as high as 17 per cent in a single month. This paper is an attempt to use the theories of collusive behaviour to explain this sudden increase. Collusive behaviour of cartel formation refers to the illegal behavior of firms within an industry to explicitly or tacitly collude to regulate their market behavior so as to restrict competition. There is a very thin blurred line of distinction between legitimate cooperation and illegitimate collusion. Cartel members agree on fixing prices, total industry output, <b>market</b> shares, <b>rigging</b> bids, setting common sale agencies, allocating territories, or a combination of these measures to gain supernormal profits. In the process of assessing the cement industry behaviour, the paper analyses characteristics of an ideal cartel detection policy and structural and behavioral cartel detection methods. Parameters studied include the firm concentration index, region-wise production & consumption, capacity utilization, cost to sales ratio, etc. Our analysis clearly demonstrates that the sudden surge in the price of the cement is neither due to the demand-supply mismatch of the cement nor a sudden increment in the cost of producing cement. The contention that the cement industry engaged in illegitimate collusion is further strengthened by observing the recent decline in cement price after the Government announcement to import cement...|$|R
40|$|In recent months, Wall Street {{has been}} whipped {{into a frenzy}} {{following}} the March 31 st release of Michael Lewis’ book “Flash Boys. ” In the book, Lewis characterizes the stock <b>market</b> as being <b>rigged,</b> which has institutional investors and outside observers alike demanding some sort of SEC action. The vast majority of this criticism is aimed at high-frequency traders, who use complex computer algorithms to execute trades several {{times faster than the}} blink of an eye. One of the many complaints against high-frequency traders is over parasitic trading practices, such as front-running. Front-running, in the era of high-frequency trading, is best defined as using the knowledge of a large impending trade to take a favorable position in the market before that trade is executed. Put simply, these traders are able to jump in front of a trade before it can be completed.

40|$|In the {{construction}} industry both the design and management processes differ significantly from the stylised models usually promoted in the academic and business press. To the complexity that is normal business in construction industry projects add the uncertainty associated with the changing legal and ethical imperatives of sustainable development {{and the result is}} a mess. Innovative products, together with the companies that make them, are being built {{on the back of a}} <b>rigged</b> <b>market</b> in recycled raw materials and policy changes are spawning unintended consequences. Making sense of those processes that use knowledge about sustainability, at the level of the firm, is particularly daunting because companies behave differently in different international contexts. The problem is further complicated by the collaborative nature of projects; specialization and the need to communicate with and between experts increases both costs and uncertainties. We discuss a fundamental tension between understanding knowledge creation and use, and the drive to capture processes in formal documents and systems. We propose similarities between developments in the field of sustainability and developments in the field of risk, with risk having the advantage of being further down the evolutionary line. Both fields have strong dimensions of formal rules and socio-economic behaviours. Such complexity, we argue, requires a number of perspectives to make sense of how knowledge is used in construction and allied industries...|$|R
40|$|Horizontal {{agreements}} between competitors with t h e object/effect of reducing competition between them through <b>market</b> partitioning, bid <b>rigging,</b> production/distribution quantities limitation and price fixing {{are considered to be}} the infringements of competition law. Cartel is an agreement under which competitors agree not to compete with each other and presents the most serious form of anticompetitive behaviour. Such arrangements allow companies to exert market power they would not otherwise have by artificially restricting competition with deleterious effect on welfare. Competition authorities around the world continue to declare cartel detection and conviction in competition enforcement as their highest priority. Taking part in cartel can have severe consequences for managers as well for the undertaking. In some jurisdictions employees involved in the infringement of competition law are criminally prosecuted facing financial fines and possible imprisonment. The reason behind it is an acknowledgment by competition authorities that the mere threat of sanctions against managers and personal liability could be a more effective deterrent than the possibility of only undertaking-focused sanctions. The amount of fines imposed for antitrust infringements, and for hard core cartel violations in particular, has notably augmented over the last years. This paper will argue why managers are employed in harmful activities risking imposition of severe fines and adverse reputational impact for themselves and the owners of the undertakings they work for and what are the tools within undertaking that can reduce the risk of being involved in unlawful antitrust practices and minimize the negative impact if anticompetitive behaviour has occurred...|$|R
40|$|The London Interbank Offered Rate, {{better known}} as LIBOR, has ridden {{turbulent}} times over the last decade. Major banks, either through the collusion of individual traders operating on a discrete basis or on the instructions from more senior personnel, but always trading across national borders and on a global level, fixed the rate {{for at least four}} years. This resultant <b>rigged</b> <b>market</b> worked to limit competition and led to massive profits for the banks and individual traders. Furthermore it enabled banks to be insulated from the shocks of the market during the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 and the consequences of that crisis. The USA and UK are currently the largest and most important financial markets in the world, markets where most of the LIBOR manipulation took place, with the EU setting competition law standards for the European region. Therefore, this chapter will investigate this market manipulation through the lens of competition law, and specifically price fixing, {{from the perspective of the}} three jurisdictions of the USA, the EU, and the UK.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} and high-profile aspects of European Community competition law and policy has been the regulation {{of what may be}} described as serious antitrust violations, typically involving large and powerful corporate producers and traders operating across Europe, if not also in a wider international context. Such 'hard core' cartels characteristically engage in practices such as price fixing, bid <b>rigging,</b> <b>market</b> sharing and limiting production in order to ensure 'market stability' and maintain and increase profits. There is little doubt now in terms of competition theory and policy at both international and national levels about the damaging effect of such trading practices on public and consumer interests, and such cartels have been increasingly strongly condemned in the legal process of regulating and protecting competition. Indeed, a number of legal systems are now following the American lead in criminalizing such activity. This may therefore be seen as the 'hard end' of the enforcement of competition policy, requiring more confrontational and aggressive methods of regulation, yet also presenting considerable challenges to effective enforcement on account of the economic power, sophistication and determination of the typical participants in such cartels. The focus of this study is a critical evaluation {{of the way in which}} European-level regulation has evolved to deal with the problem of anti-competitive cartels. It traces the historical development of cartel regulation in Europe, comparing the pragmatic and empirical approach traditional in Europe with the more dogmatic and uncompromising American policy on cartels and asks whether a fully-fledged criminal proceeding (with its attendant level of legal safeguards) is the most appropriate approach to legal regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} form of rig {{contracts}} are day rate contracts, in which the oil company rents the rig for a stated rate for each day of the contract term. However, with the shift in negotiation power from rig companies to oil companies and the increased focus on cost among oil companies, well based contracts with incentive schemes rewarding time efficient performance have gained popularity. Designing such contracts presents new challenges for the oil companies. These are important to consider {{in order to get the}} desired effect – increased efficiency and lower cost. This thesis investigates challenges associated with determining the properties of a time based incentive model, how the model can be adjusted depending on various factors, and determining the target time. The thesis focuses on drilling contracts for semisubmersible <b>rigs</b> in a <b>market</b> similar to that seen in 2017, i. e. a <b>market</b> with low <b>rig</b> utilization. Based on studies of three rig contracts, interviews and discussions with Wintershall Norge AS, the challenges were first mapped. Analytical approaches were used to conclude on the most suitable shape of an incentive model for drilling rig compensation. Several factors that could influence the way compensation rates are adjusted were considered: the rig efficiency, the rig company’s OPEX and crew size, rate in subsequent contract, <b>rig</b> company’s <b>market</b> share, and size of the oil company. The results suggest to use a convex incentive model. Regarding the slope of the curve, the oil company could implement less generous incentives in cases when there is a higher rate in the subsequent contract and there is a newly started rig company. A large oil company with big market shares could have less generous incentives than smaller oil companies, and comparing rigs with different efficiencies, it is suggested to have a steeper slope for the less efficient. Due to the large time gap between the contract signing and the actual commencement date for the drilling operation, estimation of a fixed target time is very uncertain. This could prevent the desired drop in the rig company’s base rate. If a fixed target time is given and the oil company makes adjustments in the project reducing the expected project duration, there is a risk the rig company achieves a higher rate for the same level of performance. In cases when the oil company makes adjustments increasing the expected project duration, it is likely to result in costly renegotiations of the target time and/or rates. Otherwise, measures might be taken by the rig company to reduce its cost, which could negatively affect the progress in the drilling operation...|$|R
