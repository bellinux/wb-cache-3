25|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century {{changing}} musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities {{than the}} hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German Bauernleier 'peasant's lyre' and Bettlerleier 'beggar's lyre.' During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back {{to the attention of the}} upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is Nicolas Chédeville's Il pastor Fido, attributed to Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string vielle à roue. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in <b>multiple</b> <b>keys</b> (e.g., C and G, or G and D).|$|E

2500|$|Some low-quality {{keyboards}} also suffer {{problems with}} rollover (that is, when <b>multiple</b> <b>keys</b> pressed {{at the same}} time, or when keys are pressed so fast that <b>multiple</b> <b>keys</b> are down within the same milliseconds). Early [...] "solid-state" [...] keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early [...] "direct-contact" [...] keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had [...] "n-key" [...] rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) {{at the same time}} in a [...] "direct contact" [...] keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth [...] "phantom" [...] key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. [...] "Three-key" [...] rollover, also called [...] "phantom key blocking" [...] or [...] "phantom key lockout", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and games (designed for multiple key presses).|$|E
