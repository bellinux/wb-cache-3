5|$|The HTC Dream was {{the first}} ever {{smartphone}} to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) {{on the left side}} of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android <b>Market</b> <b>can</b> be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi.|$|E

25|$|The mere {{expectation}} or rumor of {{a central}} bank foreign exchange intervention might be enough to stabilize a currency. However, aggressive intervention might be used several times each year in countries with a dirty float currency regime. Central banks do not always achieve their objectives. The combined resources of the <b>market</b> <b>can</b> easily overwhelm any central bank. Several scenarios of this nature were seen in the 1992–93 European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapse, and in more recent times in Asia.|$|E
25|$|During the 13th {{century the}} {{settlement}} at the fortified river crossing {{took on the}} characteristics of a small town. Coins were minted from 1232, while a toll post was established in 1273. The town had a mayor, or Schultheiss, by 1278 and the first mention of a <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be traced to 1283. The importance of Brugg to the Habsburg can be seen in their decision to relocate to the town between 1220 and 1230. The confines of the Habsburg Castle had become too small for the family members that lived there. In 1242 the town {{is said to have been}} plundered by supporters of the Habsburg's Laufenburg Line.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{regulatory}} {{barriers to}} entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights {{in the face of}} rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.|$|E

25|$|Markets {{of varying}} types can spontaneously arise {{whenever}} a party has {{interest in a}} good or service that some other party can provide. Hence {{there can be a}} market for cigarettes in correctional facilities, another for chewing gum in a playground, and yet another for contracts for the future delivery of a commodity. There can be black markets, where a good is exchanged illegally, for example markets for goods under a command economy despite pressure to repress them, and virtual markets, such as eBay, in which buyers and sellers do not physically interact during negotiation. A <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be organized as an auction, as a private electronic market, as a commodity wholesale market, as a shopping center, as a complex institution such as a stock market, and as an informal discussion between two individuals.|$|E

The West Service Road also parallels the expressway starting on this segment. It then passes through industrial areas and businesses within Valenzuela. The transmission line mentioned before will turn left and an East Service Road starts paralleling the expressway before Paseo de Blas exit. On Valenzuela Exit, a Puregold building and Malinta <b>Market</b> <b>can</b> be seen between it. The road continues on a straight route, with a Caltex service area located near the Dulalia overpass, until it enters Bulacan.|$|E

500|$|While {{international}} trade in greenhouse gas reductions holds substantial promise {{as a source of}} new funding for sustainable development, this <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be largely inaccessible to many smaller-scale projects, remote communities, and least developed localities. [...] To facilitate participation and broaden the benefits, several barriers must be overcome, including: a lack of market awareness among stakeholders and prospective participants; specialized, somewhat complicated participation rules; and the need for simplified participation mechanisms for small projects, without which transaction costs can overwhelm the financial benefits of participation. If the barriers are adequately addressed, greenhouse gas trading can play an important role supporting activities that benefit people’s lives and the environment.|$|E
500|$|The {{sign of an}} El Niño in the {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific. [...] El Niño's warm rush of nutrient-poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the Humboldt Current. When El Niño conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be serious.|$|E

500|$|From its {{inception}} in 2003 through to nearly 2009, Steam had a mostly uncontested hold over the PC digital distribution market before major competitors emerged with the largest competitors in the past being services like Games for Windows – Live and Impulse, {{both of which were}} shut down in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Sales via the Steam catalog are estimated to be between 50 and 75 percent of the total PC gaming market. Steam’s critics often refer to the service as a monopoly, and claim that placing such a percentage of the overall <b>market</b> <b>can</b> be detrimental to the industry as a whole and that sector competition can only yield positive results for the consumer. Several developers also noted that Steam's influence on the PC gaming market is powerful and one that smaller developers cannot afford to ignore or work with, but believe that Valve's corporate practices for the service make it a type of [...] "benevolent dictator", as Valve attempts to make the service as amenable to developers.|$|E
