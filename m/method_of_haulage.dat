By {{analyzing}} {{various factors}} which influence and constraint roadway construction speed in huaheng coal mine, some improved technical measures about fast construction are introduced, such as improve blasting technology, choose appropriate rock breaking equipment {{and improve the}} fast construction supporting facilities, select the right support patterns and scientific construction organization management. Take east roadway in huaheng coal mine as example, there are three key aspects: the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> mucking and <b>haulage,</b> drilling and blasting techniques and supporting technology. In solving the problem of loading and transport, some mechanized equipments such as LW 150 C bucket loader, SSD(B) 20 shuttle mining car and CMJ 17 A full-hydraulic excavating jumbo are used, and the mechanized organization such as loading, transfer, transport and unloading is innovated. By improving bolt installation construction technology and optimizing construction management to achieve simultaneously operating of multiple procedure, increase drilling speed and shorten mucking time, which improved the roadway excavation speed and security significantly...|$|R

Road haulage becomes in last few years a significant market's part, which is necessary to the right function in all branches in the Czech Republic. The aim of this thesis is to analyse level of principle operation's research's support in TASW solution for the society, which is directed at road transport. Simultaneously I project a study, which supports a solution for small shippers, who aren't able or willing to acquire an expensive software for haulage entrepreneurship. I characterize issues of transportation's company to achieve my aim and I think about the principle's uses and <b>method</b> <b>of</b> operation's research in process <b>of</b> <b>haulage</b> entrepreneurship. I analyse a situation of operation's research's support with TASW, which is oriented on haulage entrepreneurship. After that I describe a study, where I project a solution for small shippers, which takes in the consideration the components of operation's research in their processes and TASW and this contributes {{to make the decision}} of small shippers easier to buy the suitable software for haulage. This thesis is divided into few parts [...] at the begging I theoretically follow up haulage entrepreneurship, its division and kind of current freight. I describe the price creation to make really obvious, which knowledge the shipper have to know. I explain particular disciplines of research's operation, which are connected to make more effective the workings <b>of</b> <b>haulage</b> entrepreneurship.

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies for}} {{analyzing}} optimal <b>haulage</b> routes <b>of</b> dump trucks in open pit mines mostly used raster data. However, the raster data has several problems in performing optimal route analyses: (1) the jagged appearance <b>of</b> <b>haulage</b> roads according the cell resolution often causes overestimation {{of the travel}} cost; (2) it difficult to trace the topological relationships among haulage roads. These problems can be eliminated by using vector network data, however a new method is required to reflect the performance characteristics of a dump truck according to terrain gradient changes. This study presents a new method to create vector network data with the consideration of terrain gradient for analyzing optimal <b>haulage</b> routes <b>of</b> dump trucks in open pit mines. It consists of four procedures: (a) creating digital elevation models, (b) digitizing haulage road networks, (c) calculating the terrain gradient <b>of</b> <b>haulage</b> roads, and (d) calculating the average speed and travel time of a dump truck along haulage roads. A simple case study at the Roto South pit in the Pasir open pit coal mine, Indonesia is also presented to provide proof that the proposed method is easily compatible to ArcGIS Network Analyst software and is effective in finding optima...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{implementation}} of the carbon tax and reductions in diesel rebates, as well as rising fuel prices, have seen the Australian mining industry shift its focus towards improving the management of energy efficiency. Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd (“Leighton”) has identified an opportunity to improve the identification of energy saving initiatives in haulage operations during mine design.
