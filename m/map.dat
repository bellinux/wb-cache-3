5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological <b>Map,</b> together with the nation's first geological <b>map,</b> which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological <b>map</b> of England by six years, although Smith's <b>map</b> was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological <b>map</b> to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic <b>map</b> of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a geological structure <b>map</b> of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar <b>map</b> of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic <b>map</b> of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic <b>map</b> of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this <b>map</b> in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological <b>map</b> of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale <b>map</b> of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, the entire <b>map</b> is obscured until explored by the player.

The player can sometimes encounter message bottles that clear away fog of war on the <b>map</b> to reveal hidden ports.Sea creatures and enemy ships appear randomly and challenge the player for gold or commodities in a card minigame. Ports are trading and safe zones where the player can sell commodities, buy upgrades for the ship, and take on sidequests. Whirlpools teleport the player's ship to a random location on the <b>map.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial <b>map</b> that resembled the current version, but with thin lines.

He was also instrumental in publishing the first weather <b>map</b> in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the <b>map</b> onto printing blocks.

5|$|In {{the realm}} of cartography, there were further {{advances}} beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547–627) {{was working for the}} Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded <b>map</b> with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224–271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592–672) was also known for his <b>map</b> of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730–805) complete a <b>map</b> of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the <b>map</b> was 9.1m (30ft) in length and 10m (33ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese <b>map</b> of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of <b>map</b> that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.|$|E
