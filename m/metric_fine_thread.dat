50|$|Beginning in 2000, the VDE {{standard}} for cable glands (VDE 0619) was formally replaced by EN 50262. After a transitional {{period of several}} years during which it could still be used, it was replaced in 2003 by a final <b>metric</b> <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> with 1.5 mm pitch. Similarly, conduit threads were replaced by EN 60423.|$|E
50|$|Stage {{lighting}} suspension bolts {{are most}} commonly 3/8 in and 1/2 in BSW. Companies that initially converted to metric threads have converted back, after complaints that the <b>finer</b> <b>metric</b> <b>threads</b> increased {{the time and}} difficulty of setup, which often {{takes place at the}} top of a ladder or scaffold. Fixings for garden gates traditionally used Whitworth carriage bolts, and these are still the standard supplied in UK.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>threads,</b> {{there is another}} division of extra <b>fine,</b> or “superfine” <b>threads,</b> with a very <b>fine</b> pitch <b>thread.</b> Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R
40|$|In general, most bolt {{sizes are}} {{available}} in coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> optiones. For example, ISO <b>metric</b> coarse and <b>fine</b> pitch series standard – ISO 724 : 1993 “General purpose metric screw threads – Basic dimensiones ” specify the dimensiones for metric threads. Which type of thread is best for a particular application is a common question. In order to give some answers to that questione this paper deals with finite element analysis of generic bolted joint in different load conditions...|$|R
50|$|The M3 is a thinner screw with a <b>finer</b> <b>thread</b> {{than the}} #6-32 UNC. This {{makes it more}} {{suitable}} for fastening into smaller parts and thinner materials requiring good strength in a limited space. Its size and <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> make it appropriate for applications where a #6-32 UNC would be excessively bulky without providing any other benefits versus the smaller M3.|$|R

50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger pitch (fewer threads per axial distance), and <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> are those with smaller pitch (more threads per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R

50|$|Egg {{cases of}} this genus contain yellow(ish) eggs {{and have more}} than one hundred {{individual}} eggs in them. They are coated in a thin layer of coagulated vulval secretion and some <b>fine</b> silken <b>threads.</b> This structure rests on a mesh of <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> above the bottom of the inner chamber of the egg case.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to present {{regression}} models for predicting resistance of joints made with screw and plywood members. Joint members were out of hardwood plywood that were 19 mm in thickness. Two types of screws including coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screw with 3. 5, 4 and 5 mm in diameter and sheet metal screw with 4 and 5 mm were used. Results have shown that withdrawal resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws, diameter and penetrating depth. Joints fabricated with coarse thread drywall screws were higher than those of <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws. Finally, average joint withdrawal resistance of screwed could be predicted by means of the expressions Wc= 2. 127 ×D 1. 072 ×P 0. 520 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf= 1. 377 ×D 1. 156 ×P 0. 581 for <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws by taking account the diameter and penetrating depth. The difference of the observed and predicted data showed that developed models have a good correlation with actual experimental measurements...|$|R

50|$|The {{plant is}} a shrub native to {{tropical}} and subtropical regions around the world, including the Americas, Africa, and India. The greatest diversity of wild cotton species {{is found in}} Mexico, followed by Australia and Africa. Cotton was independently domesticated in the Old and New Worlds. The most favoured cottons are {{the ones with the}} longest staple as they can be spun into the <b>finest</b> <b>thread.</b> Sea Island and Egyptian are two of these. Surat an Indian species has a short staple. Hand operated methods of processing remained the preferred way of spinning and weaving the very <b>finest</b> <b>threads</b> and fabrics into the third quarter of the nineteenth century.|$|R
50|$|The British Standard Cycle (BSC) {{standard}} which {{replaced the}} Cycle Engineers' Institute (CEI) standard was used on British bicycles and motorcycles. It uses a thread angle of 60° {{compared to the}} Whitworth 55° and very <b>fine</b> <b>thread</b> pitches.|$|R

50|$|Bobbin lace may be {{made with}} coarse or <b>fine</b> <b>threads.</b> Traditionally it was made with linen, silk, wool, or, later, cotton threads, or with {{precious}} metals. Today it is made {{with a variety of}} natural and synthetic fibers and with wire and other filaments.|$|R
5000|$|The British Standard Fine (BSF) {{standard}} has {{the same}} thread angle as the BSW, but has a <b>finer</b> <b>thread</b> pitch and smaller thread depth. This is more like the modern [...] "mechanical" [...] screw and was used for fine machinery and for steel bolts.|$|R
5000|$|Crochet lace is an {{application}} {{of the art of}} crochet. Generally it uses <b>finer</b> <b>threads</b> and more decorative styles of stitching, often with flowing lines or scalloped edges to give interest.

5000|$|The name [...] "sycee" [...] is an {{irregular}} romanization of the Cantonese pronunciation {{of the characters}} for [...] "fine silk". This is variously explained as deriving from the ability to draw pure gold or silver out into <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> or from the silky sheen of quality silver.|$|R
50|$|Coarse threads {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and cross threading because they have greater flank engagement. Coarse threads install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length. Finer threads are stronger as they have a larger stress area for the same diameter <b>thread.</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>threads</b> {{are less likely to}} vibrate loose as they have a smaller helix angle and allow <b>finer</b> adjustment. Finer <b>threads</b> develop greater preload with less tightening torque.|$|R

50|$|In Japan, {{there are}} a few things like tamagoyaki, such as usuyaki-tamago, kinshi-tamago, and iri-tamago. Their {{differences}} are made by their thicknesses, and the ways in which they are cooked. Usuyaki-tamago is thinner, kinshi-tamago is a kind of usuyaki-tamago that cuts like <b>fine</b> <b>threads,</b> and iri-tamago is similar to scrambled eggs.|$|R

This silk or byssus are <b>fine</b> <b>threads</b> which historically was used to make special royal fabrics. This was called Pinna silk or sea silk, although the species more frequently used was Pinna nobilis of the Mediterranean.|$|R

50|$|A whole leaf {{of green}} shiso {{is often used}} as a {{receptacle}} to hold wasabi, or various tsuma (garnishes) and ken (daikon radishes, etc., sliced into <b>fine</b> <b>threads).</b> It seems to have superseded baran, the serrated green plastic film, named after the Aspidistra plant, that graced takeout sushi boxes in bygone days.|$|R
