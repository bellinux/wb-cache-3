500|$|The third single {{from the}} album, [...] "One Thing", is an upbeat pop rock song. The song has a [...] "plucky" [...] guitar riff and a [...] "forceful" [...] chorus with Lewis Corner of Digital Spy dubbing it [...] "arena-ready".

2500|$|I {{am trying}} to ferret out some very {{specific}} information about monitoring software defect trends. Again, it was years ago but I was a software development Program Manager and my team used a tool that tracked the progress of a defect find/fix rate over time. This trend was called a [...] "glide slope". It was not a crystal ball but was reasonably illustrative in forecasting code stability and release date. I can't locate <b>my</b> <b>copy</b> of the algorithm and have been doing an Internet search with no luck. Thanks for any help that you can provide.|$|E

60|$|Of this be assured, that I {{will never}} give any {{thing to the}} world in 'propria persona' in my own name which I have not tormented with the file. I {{sometimes}} suspect that <b>my</b> foul <b>copy</b> would often appear to general readers more polished than <b>my</b> fair <b>copy.</b> Many of the feeble and colloquial expressions have been industriously substituted for others which struck me as artificial, and not standing the test; as being neither the language of passion, nor distinct conceptions. Dear sir, indulge me with looking still further on in my literary life.|$|R

60|$|Of late years, {{putting aside}} the Latin classics, I have found my {{greatest}} pleasure in our old English dramatists,--not from any excessive love of their work, which often irritates me by its want {{of truth to}} nature, even while it shames me by its language,--but from curiosity in searching their plots and examining their character. If I live a few years longer, I shall, I think, leave in <b>my</b> <b>copies</b> of these dramatists, down to the close of James I., written criticisms on every play. No one who has not looked closely into it knows how many there are.|$|R

60|$|MADAM,--I am truly sorry I {{was not at}} home yesterday, when I was so much honoured {{with your}} order for <b>my</b> <b>copies,</b> and incomparably more by the {{handsome}} compliments you are pleased to pay my poetic abilities. I am fully persuaded {{that there is not}} any class of mankind so feelingly alive to the titillations of applause as the sons of Parnassus; nor is it easy to conceive how the heart of the poor bard dances with rapture, when those, whose character in life gives them a right to be polite judges, honour him with their approbation. Had you been thoroughly acquainted with me, Madam, you could not have touched my darling heart-chord more sweetly, than by noticing my attempts to celebrate your illustrious ancestor, the saviour of his country.|$|R
