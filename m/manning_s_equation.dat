40|$|In 1958, Preucil {{suggested}} an equation to calculate ink trap based on measurements of a printed sheet with a densitometer. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> {{was based on}} the additivity rule and the proportional rule. However, these rules do not hold in all cases. Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness. The percent ink trapping on printed strips were then calculated by both the densitometric methods and the gravimetric method. The factors causing poor trapping and back-trap in the experiment are discussed. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> was found to correspond better with gravimetric trap values than Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> However, both under estimated ink trap in the majority of the tested conditions. As the ink trap measured gravimetrically increased, the discrepancy of ink trap calculated by Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> increased. This applied to Brunner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> as well, but not obviously to Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> proved to reduce the differences between gravimetric ink trap and densitometric ink trap significantly. A Dm value of 1. 59 for newsprint A, 1. 99 for newsprint B, and 2. 5 for coated paper resulted in the greatest accuracy over the conditions tested. When the Dm value approaches infinity, Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> becomes the equivalent of Preucil 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation.</b> The experiment suggests that a range of Dm values between 1. 5 and 2. 5 was suitable for the tested conditions. For future research, a larger selection of various types of papers and inks are needed to specify a Dm value for general conditions. It might also be useful to specify a theoretical maximum printable density for general conditions, with which the maximum printable density of a given paper can be compared. Thus, the reproduction quality of the paper can be predicted before the printing is conducted. Since the effects of back-trap and ink contamination influence the accuracy of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation</b> in this experiment, studies for compensating this inaccuracy are suggested...|$|R

40|$|The study {{investigated}} South African <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement {{and the possible}} influences of {{various factors such as}} demographic characteristics, expenditure on clothing, the frequency of clothing purchases, store patronage and <b>men</b> <b>s</b> work dress code. A survey was conducted across Gauteng which is the largest retail hub in South Africa with mainly urban areas. Most consumers in Gauteng have access to different clothing retailers. Consulta Research, a professional research company assisted with data collection. Data was collected by means of convenient sampling. Online questionnaires were distributed to their data base and a total of 479 usable questionnaires were completed. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, ANOVA s, Chi square tests and other post hoc tests. The study confirmed that men clothing involvement is not equally strong for all four dimensions of clothing involvement that are distinguished in literature. Previous studies suggested that involvement should be studied from an age ordering perspective, and therefore respondents demographic characteristics were vital in terms of the analysis of the data. Certain demographic characteristics seemed to be good indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement, namely age and marital status while factors such as work dress code surprisingly {{do not seem to be}} useful to predict <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. The majority of the sample spent less than 5 % of their monthly household income on clothing for themselves and indicated that they purchase clothing sporadically when necessary. Findings nevertheless indicated that expenditure on their clothing and frequency of clothing purchases are useful indicators of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing involvement. Although younger men (generation Y) were more inclined to patronise specialised <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing retailers, irrespective of their work dress code, the majority of men patronised general retailers and department stores when purchasing their clothing. Findings confirm that consumption- and purchase involvement are the prevalent forms of clothing involvement that are relevant in terms of <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing behaviour. Indications are that <b>men</b> <b>s</b> advertising involvement is not particularly strong, which implies that they gain their product information and fashion information from alternative sources that rather relates to purchase involvement which tested high in most cases. This has implications for retail because <b>men</b> <b>s</b> stronger purchase involvement probably means that the physical retail environment is more important in terms of fashion information and to inspire <b>men</b> <b>s</b> clothing purchases. Therefore retailers should focus more on factors that make in-store decisions easier for males such as displays and placement of clothing. Male apparel is a potentially lucrative and growing market that can be even more profitable. Younger men spend more on their clothing therefore this group should therefore take preference but the older men should not be forgotten. Based on the findings of this study various recommendations are made with a large focus to either expand this study or build onto this existing research. Topics related to male clothing and involvement of clothing can definitely be built on and studied more in the apparel industry to fill a gap on knowledge that is lacking and should be explored further.

Stability and superconvergence error results are proved for the method, which are then confirmed through numerical results. Additionally, a numerical simulation of backwards wave propagation through a negative-index metamaterial is given using the presented method.

40|$|A full-wave {{approach}} has been developed to study the problem of electromagnetic wave propagation in stratified media with nonuniform boundaries and varying electromagnetic parameters (Bahar, 1972 a, b). By expanding the electromagnetic field vectors E and H using the generalized Fourier Transforms and imposing the exact boundary conditions at the irregular boundary, Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are converted into the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the forward and backward traveling wave amplitudes. The generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> have been solved for the radiation fields scattered from rough surfaces using iterative approaches for the single scatter and the double-scatter. ^ A numerical method is developed in this dissertation to solve the generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> for the diffuse scattered radiation fields from one-dimensional rough surfaces. The full-wave numerical solution includes both single scatter and all the higher-order multiple scatters. Using this approach, the coupled generalized telegraphist 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equations</b> are first combined into a single integro-differential equation for the forward and backward wave amplitudes on applying the analytical properties of the basis functions and the scattering coefficients. Then, the primary (unperturbed) field components are subtracted from the total fields. The rapidly varying phase components of the wave amplitudes are factored out. The singularities in the scattering coefficients are removed through integration by parts. Thus, the integro-differential equation is converted into an integral equation for the diffuse scattered wave magnitudes which depend on the wave vector variable only. Finally, the continuous wave vector variables are discretized and the integral equation is converted into a matrix equation (moment method). The wave magnitudes are determined by solving the matrix equation. The far field vectors at a remote observation point are obtained from the field transformation using the steepest descent approach. ^ The full-wave numerical solution for the diffuse scattered radiation fields is applied to both deterministic rough surfaces with known profile and random rough surfaces with known statistics. The Monte-Carlo technique is used to simulate random rough surfaces. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} diffuse scattered radiation fields can be approximated using the single scatter iterative solutions when the maximum rough surface slope is less than 35 degrees. ...|$|R

40|$|Organisms {{in highly}} {{suitable}} sites generally produce more offspring, and offspring can inherit this suitability by not dispersing far. This combination of spatial selection and spatial inheritance acts to bias {{the distribution of}} organisms toward suitable sites and thereby increase mean fitness (i. e., per capita population increase). Thus, population growth rates in heterogeneous space change over time by a process conceptually analogous to evolution by natural selection, opening avenues for theoretical cross-pollination between evolutionary biology and ecology. We operationally define spatial inheritance and spatial selective differential and then combine these two factors in a modification of the breeder 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>equation,</b> derived from simple models of population growth in heterogeneous space.

Both the public and academic discourses on violence in public spaces in India are centered on the notion of the female victim. In this thesis I argue that we need to open up a strict binary understanding of only women as vulnerable and affected by the fear of crime in public spaces. I discuss the gendered implications of different types of violence, and how different identity categories that cut across gender, have an impact on middle class <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear. In addition to this I assess how the fear for others safety and the masculine ideal of being a protector has an impact on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> personal fear of violence. Because there is no research on <b>men</b> <b>s</b> fear of crime in an Indian context I have supported my analyses with three theoretical frameworks, all relevant in different ways.

To understand how fear of violence in public spaces is affecting lives in India, it is necessary to not restrict ourselves to only women s narratives.
