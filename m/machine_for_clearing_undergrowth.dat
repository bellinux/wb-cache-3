50|$|An {{agricultural}} version, {{commonly known}} as either a brush-axe or bush-axe, is readily available in rural hardware and farm-supply stores in the United States today. It has a 4 ft handle, and a 16 in head. It is extremely useful <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>undergrowth</b> and unwanted hedgerows. Both the concave and convex edges may be sharpened edges, but spear-points and back-hooks are not available. Expertly used, the brush-axe can fell a 3 in tree with a single blow. Inexpertly used, it can pose a grave danger of accidental maiming to those standing nearby.|$|R
50|$|The {{product range}} {{includes}} lines for home users (garden maintenance, firewood cutting, general DIY jobs), and for professional users (maintenance of large open spaces in {{urban and rural}} locations, <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> <b>clearing,</b> pruning, cutting firewood, forestry work and tidying of overgrown areas and undergrowth).|$|R
50|$|In 1959 a {{standard}} for machine-readable characters (MICR) was agreed and patented in the US for use with cheques. This {{opened the way for}} the first automated reader/sorting <b>machines</b> <b>for</b> <b>clearing</b> cheques. As automation increased, the following years saw a dramatic change {{in the way in which}} cheques were handled and processed. Cheque volumes continued to grow; in the late 20th century, cheques were the most popular non-cash method for making payments, with billions of them processed each year. Most countries saw cheque volumes peak in the late 1980s or early 1990s, after which electronic payment methods became more popular and the use of cheques declined.|$|R

50|$|Oeceoclades longebracteata is a {{terrestrial}} species found {{growing on}} gritty sand in <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth</b> in deciduous forests. It {{is similar to}} O. decaryana in floral morphology but is easily distinguished from that species by the very narrow leaves and the long, linear floral bracts.|$|R
50|$|The {{natural fire}} regime in Australia was altered {{by the arrival}} of humans. Fires became more frequent, and fire-loving species—notably eucalypts—greatly {{expanded}} their range. It is assumed that a good deal of this change came about as the result of deliberate action by early humans, setting fires to <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth</b> or drive game.|$|R
50|$|In July 2012, {{the woods}} made {{national}} headlines after the Forestry Commission <b>cleared</b> <b>undergrowth</b> within the woods, which {{were said to}} be attracting large numbers of doggers, scaring families and ramblers. Police patrols by both Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Police have been increased, and carparks closed by North Kesteven at night with warning signs applied.|$|R
50|$|El Tesoro welcomed {{assistance}} from three AmeriCorps crews in 2012 and 2013.The first AmeriCorps crew completed extensive trail maintenance along the nature trail, {{along with other}} projects. In 2013, the second crew <b>cleared</b> <b>undergrowth</b> and dead trees between Horizon Lodge and the Brazos River. A third crew taught outdoor education classes {{during the spring of}} 2013.|$|R
50|$|Keiller's {{first major}} {{excavation}} at Avebury was in 1937, {{the first of}} three seasons over the ensuing years. Each concentrated on a quadrant of the circle, <b>clearing</b> <b>undergrowth,</b> restoring and conserving the site. Buried stones, some up to a metre below ground, were uncovered and replaced in their original stone-holes. As with the avenue, he placed concrete pylons to denote missing stones. That same year, he founded the Morven Institute of Archaeological Research.|$|R

5000|$|The village {{may have}} been a Roman settlement, perhaps based on lead mining, but there is {{currently}} no archaeological evidence to prove this. A nineteenth-century bath house over a hot spring is known locally as The Roman Baths but this was built in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a spa resort. (After the Stoney Middleton Youth Club <b>cleared</b> <b>undergrowth</b> in the early 1980s the building was consolidated and made secure by local craftsmen {{with the aid of a}} grant by the Peak Park.) ...|$|R

50|$|On {{a single}} day 54 species of {{butterflies}} were recorded in 2001. Vegetation, mainly supporting butterfly population like Cadaba spp, Critalaria spp, Cassis spp, and variety of grasses was abundant at that time. Distortion and distraction caused while laying huge sewage lines and <b>clearing</b> <b>undergrowth</b> to facilitate public utility has led to diminishing of species. Being part of Mysore area, Lingambudhi also experiences, pre & post monsoon danaids butterfly migration (located in the plains between eastern and western ghat, where migration is documented). Thicket that provides incessant shade throughout the day provides shelter to these migratory butterflies roosting.|$|R
5000|$|The Albera {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to cold, though susceptible to heat, and is well {{adapted to the}} steep terrain of the Albera Massif. The cattle are kept year-round in semi-feral conditions, at an altitude between , foraging for food including the shoots and mast of the beech trees of the massif. They have little contact with man, and little productive capacity: cows calve every two years, and produce barely enough milk for the calf; meat yield is very low, {{of the order of}} [...] The cattle are used in vegetation management: by <b>clearing</b> <b>undergrowth</b> they help to prevent forest fires.|$|R

50|$|The {{album is}} mostly John Darnielle and his {{acoustic}} guitar, {{but it has}} sparse auxiliary instrumentation as well. Most of the songs were recorded on John's Panasonic RX-FT500 boom box, but due to either mechanical failure or desire <b>for</b> <b>clearer</b> sound quality, he used a 4-track recording <b>machine</b> <b>for</b> some tracks.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his legal practice, Cunningham had {{a great interest in}} history and the outdoors. He purchased land in the Kisatchie National Forest, <b>cleared</b> the <b>undergrowth</b> and constructed a road to a sandy creek on the property. The family met at Kisatchie for Sunday picnics and holidays.|$|R
5|$|The {{preservation}} of the existing diversity {{was the most important}} goal. It required conservation of the heritage plant communities: tall-herb fen with common butterbur, the chasmophytic vegetation with hart's-tongue fern and the woody fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli. The survival of populations of round-leaved wintergreen and of man orchid, the two most interesting plants, was also a priority, as a strikeout against brush invasion in the open areas where bee orchid and pyramidal orchid grow. The natural forest dynamics are to be contained within areas of <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth</b> or fringes with these species: common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid. Pioneer areas with mushrooms should be preserved and the invasive species contained. Artificial infrastructures (ruin, concrete pylons, walls and rock piles) should be utilized for the creation of new habitats.|$|R
50|$|Whilst the Royal Air Force {{carried on}} using the runway for {{aircraft}} landing {{and take off}} training until 1992, the buildings and hangars had long been abandoned. In 1983, a group started <b>clearing</b> the <b>undergrowth</b> and the site {{was ready to be}} unveiled as the Yorkshire Air Museum in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{people are}} farmers, {{planting}} corn (maize), beans, squash, and cucumbers in steep hillside plots. Burning {{is used to}} <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth,</b> plows and planting sticks being the chief cultivating implements. Most families keep a cow for milk and cheese, and sheep are sometimes kept for wool; however, very little meat is eaten. Other barnyard animals are also kept, and hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild foods augments farming. Neither the Huichol nor the Cora commonly live in villages but, rather, have households in the countryside clustered in loose groups of 1 to 12; these are called rancherias. Community centres consist of a church or Huicholtemple, public buildings, sometimes schools or jails, and houses that are kept by some families to live in when {{they are at the}} centre. The rancherias may be quite isolated from such community centres.|$|R
5000|$|On March 22, 1987 {{members of}} the Odinic Rite {{conducted}} [...] "Operation Guardian" [...] during which they <b>cleared</b> away <b>undergrowth</b> and built steps (which remain today) to allow access to the stone. The group called themselves Guardians of the White Horse Stone and looked after {{the area around the}} stone but activities were sporadic and unorganised.|$|R
5000|$|The station {{building}} - {{a simple}} concrete shelter - still stands and was {{fitted with a}} new tiled roof by EA Volunteers in February 2011, replacing the rusted corrugated iron roof {{that had been in}} place for many years. At {{the same time as the}} roof was replaced, the platform and trackbed were <b>cleared</b> of <b>undergrowth</b> to improve access for maintenance and management.|$|R
50|$|Haemanthus {{have from}} one to six leaves, ranging from broad, {{leathery}} and prostrate to narrow, crisped or succulent and erect, {{with a variety of}} surface textures from smooth to extremely hairy or even sticky. A few species such as H. unifoliatus and H. nortieri, usually produce only a single erect, broad leaf. H. coccineus and H. sanguineus were two of the first species in this genus to be described and because of their reddish flowers, gave rise to the generic name, being Greek for 'blood flower'. Haemanthus is found from Namibia through Namaqualand to the Western Cape and then through the Southern Cape to the Eastern Cape as far north as KwaZulu-Natal and the Transvaal.Haemanthus species are extremely variable in their habitat requirements - from coastal dunes to mountain tops, rocky ledges to seasonally-inundated gravel plains and bogs. Some species, such as H. canaliculatus, are to some extent fire-dependent in that they need occasional burning of their fynbos habitat to <b>clear</b> <b>undergrowth</b> in order to flower.|$|R

500|$|... 1988 {{was a big}} {{year for}} {{wildfires}} in the western United States, with more than 72,000 fires reported during the year, including 300 rated as major. Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit, and consequently, over 6,000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide, with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone. At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for one or two more tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, <b>clearing</b> <b>undergrowth</b> near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|R
