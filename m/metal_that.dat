5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one valence electron.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, {{tungsten}} {{is a hard}} steel-grey <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> {{is often}} brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, tungsten retains its hardness (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. Tungsten objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{chemical}} element that is assigned the symbol Pb (from the Latin plumbum) and the atomic number 82. It {{is a heavy}} <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point. When freshly cut, lead is bluish-white; it tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air. Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and concludes three major decay chains of heavier elements.|$|E

Reports {{indicated}} that a metal cable frayed during launch, shearing off shards of <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> struck the riders. The injuries were mainly arm abrasions, with one passenger experiencing cuts to the face. They were treated at the park's first aid station, and two later sought further medical attention.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> resembles {{platinum}}. It is {{the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> {{has a high}} reflectance. Rhodium metal {{does not}} {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E

5|$|Samarium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolSm and atomic number62. It is a moderately hard silvery <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> readily oxidizes in air. Being a typical {{member of the}} lanthanide series, samarium usually assumes the oxidation state +3. Compounds of samarium(II) are also known, most notably the monoxide SmO, monochalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe, as well as samarium(II) iodide. The last compound is a common reducing agent in chemical synthesis. Samarium has no significant biological role but is only slightly toxic.|$|E
5|$|Zirconium is a lustrous, greyish-white, soft, ductile and {{malleable}} <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> {{is solid}} at room temperature, {{though it is}} hard and brittle at lesser purities. In powder form, zirconium is highly flammable, but the solid form is much less prone to ignition. Zirconium is highly resistant to corrosion by alkalis, acids, salt water and other agents. However, it will dissolve in hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, especially when fluorine is present. Alloys with zinc are magnetic at less than 35K.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium is a steel {{gray and}} hard <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> is brittle at room {{temperature}} and has a close-packed hexagonal crystal structure. It has exceptional stiffness (Young's modulus 287 GPa) and a reasonably high melting point. The modulus of elasticity of beryllium is approximately 50% {{greater than that of}} steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast sound conduction speed in beryllium – about 12.9km/s at ambient conditions. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 J·kg−1·K−1) and thermal conductivity (216 W·m−1·K−1), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear thermal expansion (11.4×10−6 K−1), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An alkaline earth metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not very toxic.|$|E
50|$|Phytoextraction is a subprocess of {{phytoremediation}} {{in which}} plants remove dangerous elements or compounds from soil or water, most usually heavy <b>metals,</b> <b>metals</b> <b>that</b> {{have a high}} density and may be toxic to organisms even at relatively low concentrations. The heavy <b>metals</b> <b>that</b> plants extract are toxic to the plants as well, and the plants used for phytoextraction are known hyperaccumulators that sequester extremely large amounts of heavy metals in their tissues.|$|R

Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, ductile <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically {{similar to}} zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among the most difficult to separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Germany, a red mineral {{was found}} in the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains) that resembled copper ore. However, when miners were unable to extract any copper from it, they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick), for besetting the copper. They called this ore Kupfernickel from the German Kupfer for copper. This ore is now known to be nickeline (aka niccolite), a nickel arsenide. In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from {{kupfernickel}} at a cobalt mine in the Swedish village of Los, and instead produced a white <b>metal</b> <b>that</b> he named after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel or Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel.|$|E
