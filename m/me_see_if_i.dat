6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can't handle him, sir," [...] said Theriere to Skipper Simms. [...] "We don't want to {{lose any}} men if we can help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{can make}} a {{selection}} out of it--for business uses, I mean; we will keep the rest for Sundays. Give it to me in installments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait a little," [...] I said. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> have {{anything}} to forgive." [...] I turned to the gardener. [...] "What is your complaint of this man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then look at <b>me,</b> and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am {{not your}} daughter,' said Dschemila, {{throwing}} {{off her clothes}} and showing her two scars.|$|R
60|$|My friend {{threw out}} the {{information}} in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had followed his reasoning.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I said,' {{replied the}} old man, 'let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> were {{disposed}} to regard {{him in any}} other than a friendly spirit, I should have said keep us apart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{make that}} man square up with <b>me,</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> don't," [...] {{he said to}} Dave, as {{they arrived at the}} school. [...] "I'm not going to lose all that money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] she said. [...] "I {{approve of}} {{everything}} you did. But sit down, now, and don't keep walking that way, and let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> understand it perfectly. Of course, I {{had to have}} my say out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; lots," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can {{remember}} some of them." [...] And then he knit his brows and tapped his head, and repeated some very commonplace expressions of encouragement and sympathy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, by George! But you've beat me now. When you're {{hard pressed}} for hands down yonder, you send for <b>me,</b> and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> won't turn the mill for you, or hoe canes either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so, Molly. I hope you'll {{tell your}} little recruit {{that the first}} and {{foremost}} duty of a good policeman is to obey orders. Let <b>me</b> <b>see,</b> then, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can enlighten you a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, but Claude,' said Ada, 'papa told <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could find}} you. Dear Claude, I wish,' she proceeded, taking his hand, and looking engaging, 'I {{wish you would}} put your arm round me as you do round Phyl.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "it's no good {{thinking}} about that, is it? I've {{wanted to give}} you this for ages, darling; it IS so uncomfortable on my finger. Now, just let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can pop it on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Miss Starbrow, please don't think that. Wait {{a minute}} and let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can {{remember}} how that was," [...] said the poor curate. [...] "I think I said that all present at the table except myself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{off your}} coat and sit down, Will, and don't look so angry at me. I know that you're not greedy, well enough. Tell {{me what you}} are going to do, and let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heart's dearest, you trusted me {{in spite}} of my disguise; trust me still, and I will prove that I am neither false nor forsworn. Catechise <b>me,</b> and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> was not true {{in spite of}} all my seeming deception." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Lyddell, turning {{round on}} Elliot, [...] "you <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am the tyrant {{you would make}} <b>me.</b> You <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am going to force my daughter into a marriage against her wish--sacrifice my whole family because I have an ill-conditioned scamp of a good-for-nothing son. You see." ...|$|R
6000|$|At this, {{with his}} deliberation, {{he came back}} to his charming idea. [...] "Only try <b>me,</b> and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can't be MADE to. Work me in." [...] On her sharply {{presenting}} her back he stared a little at the clock. [...] "If I come at seven may I stay to dinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} be able to say the same, surely," [...] {{answered}} the Major, composing his face again, and rising carefully. [...] "I have to thank you, exceedingly, my dear sir, for your prompt generosity: but it is better discipline for a man, in many ways, to find things for himself than to have them put into his hands. So, with a thousand thanks, you shall let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can dredge a Turbinolia for myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit ye down, Mr. David," [...] said he, [...] "and {{now that}} you are looking a little more like yourself, let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can find you any news. You will be wondering, no doubt, about your father and your uncle? To be sure it is a {{singular}} tale; and the explanation is one that I blush to have to offer you. For," [...] says he, really with embarrassment, [...] "the matter hinges on a love affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly {{expected}} that you would. Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{can make it}} clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, {{will tell you what}} the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let <b>me</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can hunt up this Carlos Martine. I can {{at least}} have a talk with him, and learn how matters stand." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lisbeth {{had been}} rocking herself {{in this way}} {{for more than five}} minutes, giving a low moan with every forward {{movement}} of her body, when she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers, and a sweet treble voice said to her, [...] "Dear sister, the Lord has sent <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can be a comfort to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind them," [...] he whispered; [...] "you really cannot {{expect to}} duena your elder sister. Tell me, would you {{actually}} like <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> could assist the virtuous tramp? You {{have only to}} speak." [...] But Amita's interest appeared to be so completely appeased with Raymond's simple offer that she only smiled, blushed, and said [...] "No." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{you were}} gone he came {{straight}} to the inner room in search of something, saw me, and knew I must have heard all he had concealed from me so carefully. If you have ever seen him when that fierce temper of his grows ungovernable, you can guess what I endured. He said such cruel things I could not bear it, and cried out that I would come to you, for I was quite wild with terror, grief, and shame, that seemed like oil to fire. He swore I should not, and oh, Pauline, he struck <b>me!</b> <b>See,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> do not tell the living truth!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} Wheel. [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can {{tabulate}} it properly. Nothing like system in accounts of all kinds. Book! Book! Book! On {{the side of}} the Wheel towards the hundred of Burgelstaltone, where till now was a stye of three hogs, Mangles, a freeman, with four villeins, and two carts of two thousand bricks, has a new small house of five yards and a half, and one roof of iron and a floor of cement. Then, now, and afterwards beer in large tankards. And Felden, a stranger, with three villeins and one very great cart, deposits on it one engine of iron and brass and a small iron mill of four feet, and a broad strap of leather. And Mangles, the builder, with two villeins, constructs the floor for the same, and a floor of new brick with wires for the small mill. There are there also chalices filled with iron and water, in number fifty-seven. The whole is valued at one hundred and seventy-four pounds.... I'm sorry I can't make myself clearer, but you can see for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brown is gone to bed--and I {{am tired}} of rhyming--there is a north wind blowing playing young {{gooseberry}} with the trees--I don't care so it helps even with a side wind a Letter to me--for I cannot put faith in any reports I hear of the Settlement; some are good and some bad. Last Sunday I took a Walk towards Highgate and in the lane that winds {{by the side of}} Lord Mansfield's park I met Mr. Green our Demonstrator at Guy's in conversation with Coleridge--I joined them, after enquiring by a look whether it would be agreeable--I walked with him at his alderman-after-dinner pace for near two miles I suppose. In those two Miles he broached a thousand things--let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can give you a list--Nightingales--Poetry--on Poetical Sensation--Metaphysics--Different genera and species of Dreams--Nightmare--a dream accompanied by a sense of touch--single and double touch--a dream related--First and second consciousness--the difference explained between will and Volition--so say metaphysicians from a want of smoking the second consciousness--Monsters-- the Kraken--Mermaids--Southey believes in them--Southey's belief too much diluted--a Ghost story--Good morning--I heard his voice as he came towards me--I heard it as he moved away--I had heard it all the interval--if it may be called so. He was civil enough to ask me to call on him at Highgate. Good-night! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid there's {{going to}} be some trouble," [...] I said to Eve. [...] "Let <b>me</b> go and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can help. It looks as though the whole thing were a trap." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Albinia; 'I own I {{thought it}} was your {{kindness}} in leaving me a little breathing time. And would Mrs. Dusautoy be able to <b>see</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> were to call?' ...|$|R
5000|$|She later {{admitted}} {{that being the}} first female bishop in the Anglican church bore a great weight of responsibility {{and it was her}} responsibility to prove that women were suited to the role, adding [...] "I know that the whole world is looking up to <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> will deliver." [...] She visited Ireland in 2015, preaching at the St Macartin's Cathedral, Enniskillen on 25 January.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lobster-salad and chicken-croquettes I've had, {{and neither}} were very good. Now I want to {{distinguish}} myself by something very nice. I'd try a meat-porcupine or a mutton-duck {{if there was}} time; but they are fussy, {{and ought to be}} rehearsed before given to the class. Bavarian cream needs berries and whipped cream, and I won't tire my arms beating eggs. Apricots à la Neige is an easy thing and wholesome, but the girls won't like it, I know, as well as some rich thing that will make them ill, as Carrie's plum-pudding did. A little meat dish is best for lunch. I'd try sweetbreads and bacon, if I didn't hate to burn my face and scent my clothes, frying. Birds are elegant; let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can do larded grouse. No, I don't like to touch that cold, fat stuff. How mortified Ella was, when she had birds on toast and forgot to draw them. I shouldn't make such a blunder as that, I do hope. Potted pigeons--the very thing! Had that in our last lesson, but the girls are all crazy about puff-paste, so they won't try pigeons. Why didn't I think of it at once?--for we've got them in the house, and don't want them to-day, mamma being called away. All ready too; so nice! I do detest to pick and clean birds. 'Simmer from one to three hours.' Plenty of time. I'll do it! I'll do it! La, la, la!" ...|$|E
6000|$|When she {{had quite}} gone through her long {{relation}}, [...] "Well, madam," [...] says he, [...] "now let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> cannot tell how far she {{has told the}} truth in relation to you. When I first became acquainted with you, {{it was on the}} sale of those jewels, in which I stood so much your friend, at a time that you were in the greatest distress, your substance being {{in the hands of the}} Jew; you then passed for a jeweller's widow; this agrees with her saying you ran away with a jeweller. In the next place, you would not consent to marry me about twelve years ago; I suppose then your real husband was living, for nothing else could tally with your condescension to me in everything except marriage. Since that time, your refusing to come to Holland in the vessel I had provided for you, under a distant prospect of your being with child, though in reality it was your having a child too much, as the captain told me of, when I, being ignorant of the case, did not understand him. Now," [...] continued he, [...] "she says that you are the identical Lady Roxana which made so much noise in the world, and has even described the robe and head-dress you wore on that occasion, and in that I know she is right; for, to my own knowledge, you have that very dress by you now; I having seen you dressed in it at our lodging at the Quaker's. From all these circumstances," [...] says he, [...] "I may be assured that you have imposed grossly upon me, and instead of being a woman of honour as I took you for, I find that you have been an abandoned wretch, and had nothing to recommend you but a sum of money and a fair countenance, joined to a false unrelenting heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can be {{very cool}} and very supercilious with Henry," [...] he said. [...] "I can seem {{to make light of}} his apprehensions, and look down du haut de ma {{grandeur}} on his youthful ardour. To him I can speak as if, in my eyes, they were both children. Let <b>me</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> can keep up the same rôle with her. I have known the moment when I seemed about to forget it, when Confusion and Submission seemed about to crush me with their soft tyranny, when my tongue faltered, and I have almost let the mantle drop, and stood in her presence, not master--no--but something else. I trust I shall never so play the fool. It is well for a Sir Philip Nunnely to redden when he meets her eye. He may permit himself the indulgence of submission. He may even, without disgrace, suffer his hand to tremble when it touches hers; but if one of her farmers were to show himself susceptible and sentimental, he would merely prove his need of a strait waistcoat. So far I have always done very well. She has sat near me, and I have not shaken--more than my desk. I have encountered her looks and smiles like--why, like a tutor, as I am. Her hand I never yet touched--never underwent that test. Her farmer or her footman I am not--no serf nor servant of hers have I ever been; but I am poor, and it behoves me to look to my self-respect--not to compromise an inch of it. What did she mean by that allusion to the cold people who petrify flesh to marble? It pleased me--I hardly know why; I would not permit myself to inquire. I never do indulge in scrutiny either of her language or countenance; for if I did, I should sometimes forget common sense and believe in romance. A strange, secret ecstasy steals through my veins at moments. I'll not encourage--I'll not remember it. I am resolved, as long as may be, to retain the right to say with Paul, 'I am not mad, but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did a {{good deal}} of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with <b>me.</b> You <b>see,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am to be squire down there I must dress the part, {{and it may be that}} I have got a little {{careless}} in my ways out West. Among other things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can use them. When {{thou art}} empty come to <b>me</b> and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> speak the truth. I have some skill in these [he {{held out his}} hands], and if ever thou art in a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was as a}} {{man without}} a tongue, my hunger gone from sheer happiness--and fright. And yet eating the breakfast with a relish because she had made it. She busied herself about the room, dusting here and tidying there, and anon {{throwing}} a glance at <b>me</b> to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> needed anything. My eyes followed her hither and thither. When I had finished, she undid the napkin, and brushed the crumbs from the coverlet.|$|R
