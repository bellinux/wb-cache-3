As motion requirements increase, the strain transfer must be maximized from the ceramic actuator to the substrate. The {{objective of this}} work is to develop guidelines for designing metal-ceramic actuator systems using piezoceramic motor elements. Taguchi methods were used to select optimum adhesive and base metal combinations based on <b>metal</b> <b>shim</b> experiments. Confirmation experiments proved {{the validity of the}} analysis. Following these optimum parameters, single-layer piezoceramic elements were bonded to cantilevered beams to investigate the strain transfer from an actuator to the substrate...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} programme aims {{to develop a}} novel 2. 5 dimensional fabrication process for multilayer piezoelectric microactuators. Ultra-precision grinding was {{used in conjunction with}} standard micro-fabrication techniques and adhesive bonding technology to create a powerful bimorph structure. The multilayer structure forms the heart of a microvalve device and it comprises piezoelectric ceramic layers joined to a <b>metal</b> <b>shim</b> at relatively low temperature (200 Â° Celsius). I contrast with existing thick deposition techniques this new fabrication technique does not adversely affect the electro-active properties of the ceramic material and it has the further advantage that it is not substrate sensitive making it compatible with the wide range of materials available for micro-scale device construction. The objectives of this project were twofold: > To investigate the mechanism of the material removal process for piezoelectric ceramics using a ultra-precision grinding machine tool on four different piezoelectric materials. The research work investigated both planarization and surface integrity. > To develop different models using the definite element analysis technique to analyse and assess the thermally induced stress due to the bonding process. Direct and initial stress loading conditions were analysed and applied to a multilayer structure. This work ends with a fully characterized symmetric structure for bimorph cantilevers. Grinding is shown to be a suitable machining technique to prepare the surface of piezoelectric ceramic discs. The required surface quality is fully achieved for the target microsystems application. Surface flatness and roughness have been scientifically investigated through a experimental plan. The infinite element analysis reveals some valuable results relating to stress intensity and explores the effect of changes due to thermal expansion coefficient mismatch and the influence of adhesive bond thickness in a multilayer structure. Use of initial stress loading allows simulation of complex processes of fabrication leading to optimization of the structure. h this way a improved fabrication process has been established which avoids any profile deformation. Finally the performance of the bimorph cantilevers is predicted through analytical and numerical modelling and a correlation is established...|$|E

For this reason, a safety sling should always be used together with the lewis until the stone is reasonably close to its final position. Lifting the stone a small distance from the ground before hoisting {{is the best way to}} test a lewis. Any sign of looseness or damage should be corrected by adjusting the lewis hole or packing the lewis with <b>metal</b> <b>shims.</b>|$|R

When applied to correct {{errors in the}} on-axis field a large increase in the errors in the off-axis field was found. When instead errors in the off-axis field are corrected, the errors in the on-axis field are reduced as well. Only small corrections were locally required to make the errors in the on-axis field acceptable. The focussing strength of the wiggler has been measured in both transverse planes and was found to lead to a slightly elliptical shape for a matched electron beam.

40|$|The {{cross flow}} from channel to channel through gas {{diffusion}} layer (GDL) under the land could {{play an important}} role for water removal in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. In this study, characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL have been investigated experimentally, through measuring unsteady pressure drop in a cell which has the GDL initially wet with liquid water. The thickness of GDL is carefully controlled by inserting various thicknesses of <b>metal</b> <b>shims</b> between the plates. It has been found that severe compression of GDL could result in excessive pressure drop from channel inlet to channel outlet. Removing liquid water from GDL by cross flow is difficult for GDL with high compression levels and for low inlet air flow rates. However, effective water removal can still be achieved at high compression levels of GDL if the inlet air flow rate is high. Based on different compressed GDL thicknesses, different GDL porosities and permeabilities were calculated and their effects on the characteristics of liquid water removal from GDL were evaluated. Visualization of liquid water transport has been conducted by using transparent flow channel, and liquid water removal from GDL under the land was observed for all the tested inlet air flow rates, which confirms that cross flow is practically effective to remove the liquid water accumulated in GDL under the land area.

Later, around the 1940s, it became widely used to machine thin samples of very hard metal; photo-etching from both sides was used to cut sheet <b>metal,</b> foil, and <b>shim</b> stock to create shims, recording heat frets, and other components.|$|R

The sensor transducer gain is demonstrated as being location-dependent on the sensing surface and proportional to the local polarization magnetic field strength |B|^ 2 generated by the sensing inductor. To improve the gain uniformity, a bowl-shape stacked coil together with floating <b>shimming</b> <b>metal</b> is proposed for the inductor design. As an implementation example, a 16 -cell sensor array is designed in a 45 nm CMOS process. The spatially uniform sensor gain of the array is verified by testing micron-size magnetic particles randomly placed on the sensing surface. The Correlated-Double-Counting (CDC) noise cancellation scheme is also implemented in the presented design, which achieves a noise suppression of 10. 6 dB with no power overhead. Overall, the presented sensor demonstrates a dynamic range of at least 85. 4 dB...|$|R
