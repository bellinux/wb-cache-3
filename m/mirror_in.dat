He realises that Sirius would not want him to be depressed on the matter, and resolves to continue fighting Voldemort.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York City, Willis reorganized, {{along with}} George Pope Morris, the weekly New York Mirror as the daily Evening <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> 1844 with a weekly {{supplement}} called the Weekly <b>Mirror,</b> <b>in</b> {{part due to}} the rising cost of postage. By this time, Willis was a popular writer (a joke was that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was Germany's version of N. P. Willis) {{and one of the first}} commercially successful magazine writers in America. In the fall of that year, he also became the first editor of the annual gift book The Opal founded by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. During this time, he became the highest-paid magazine writer in America, earning about $100 per article and $5,000 per year, a number which would soon double. Even the popular poet Longfellow admitted his jealousy of Willis's salary.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Gutawa voiced a {{character}} in Meraih Mimpi (Chasing Dreams), the Indonesian adaptation of Sing to the Dawn; the voice recording took four months. She later cited it as a good learning experience. The following year, she appeared in her first feature-length film, Love in Perth, in which she played a shy student studying in Perth, Australia. She considered it challenging; for the most difficult part, {{a scene in which}} she had to cry, she practised in front of a <b>mirror.</b> <b>In</b> May 2011 she began dating her Love in Perth costar Derby Romero; the couple split up sometime before January 2012.|$|E

5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> several ways {{the story of}} Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City with a bomb in 1995. Caviezel and Scott did not deny this, and both admitted that the Oerstadt character was at least partly based on McVeigh. Ross Johnson of The New York Times also compared the ferry bombing at the film's beginning to the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E
5|$|Legacy of the Drow is a tetralogy, {{unlike the}} {{previous}} two trilogies. The 1993 short story, Dark <b>Mirror,</b> <b>in</b> the Realms of Valor anthology, describes events {{just prior to the}} series. The first three books, The Legacy, Starless Night, and Siege of Darkness, describe a drow attack on Mithril Hall. Wulfgar is seemingly slain by a yochlol, and Drizzt returns to Menzoberranzan to prevent his friends from being further attacked by dark elves. The drow launch a second attack against Mithril Hall during the Time of Troubles. It is eventually repelled and Drizzt returns to his friends.|$|E

5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Arriving {{back in the}} wilderness, {{the trio}} sets up camp when Snatchers find and chase them down. Hermione strikes Harry with a curse to {{disguise}} his features as the Snatchers take them all to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook the goblin. Bellatrix then tortures Hermione for information on how they got the sword of Gryffindor, which Bellatrix claims was in her vault at Gringott's. Harry requests help, communicating {{with a piece of}} broken <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm Draco Malfoy. Dobby drops a chandelier above Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage and find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby properly without any magic, which they all agree to do.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing {{there is not}} such a <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> creating a European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E

5|$|In {{support of}} Kaleidoscope Dream, Miguel {{embarked}} on a short promotional tour in the United States on September 26, 2012. He also promoted the record with television performances on 106 & Park, The Wendy Williams Show, Late Show with David Letterman, and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. He subsequently toured {{in support of the}} album for six months throughout North America and Europe, including concert dates as a supporting act on Trey Songz' Chapter V World Tour during November 2012 to February 2013, and a headlining tour in the UK and Ireland during January 2013. Miguel opened for Alicia Keys on her Set The World On Fire Tour during March and April. Although he did not choreograph his shows, he routinely rehearsed in a dance studio and practiced singing in front of a <b>mirror.</b> <b>In</b> concert, he performed dramatic leaps, staggers, and other moves fashioned after Little Richard and James Brown. He started ripping his shirt off during performances after being inspired by Songz' concerts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a two-way <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from her game. He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
5|$|Soma meets Arikado, who is {{initially}} angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma {{a letter and}} a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius, with the latter defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals. Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him. Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma {{to come to the}} castle's center.|$|E

5|$|The UK Albums Chart {{is based}} on Sunday to Saturday sales of both {{physical}} and digital albums. It is compiled by the Official Charts Company (OCC) {{on behalf of the}} UK music industry, and each week's new number one is first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show. The album chart was first published by Record <b>Mirror</b> <b>in</b> 1956. The record at number one on 25 December that year was the original soundtrack to the 1956 film The King and I, making it the first ever UK Christmas number one album; The King and I soundtrack was also Christmas number one in 1957, the following year. In 1958, the original soundtrack to South Pacific became the second Christmas number one album. Staying {{at the top of the}} album chart for a total of 115 weeks, it was also number one in 1959 and 1960. Soundtracks to the movies The Sound of Music and Grease also became Christmas number ones.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{features}} {{raster graphics}} on a CRT monitor displaying 4096 colors and amplified stereophonic sound. The visuals are reflected into view via a <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> the cabinet. The arcade cabinet is upright, with the marquee bearing the game's name protruding outward. There are large, blue plastic molds around the cabinet designed to resemble an alien cocoon. The music for Space Gun was composed by Norihiro Furukawa and Naoto Yagishita of Zuntata, Taito's music division. A soundtrack CD (a split release with the soundtrack for Taito game Liquid Kids) {{was released by}} Pony Canyon and Scitron on January 21, 1991. This album was also released as part of Taito 1500 Collector's Box on September 17, 1993.

5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective; other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E

5|$|The Phantom brings Christine {{back down}} to his lair. Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives, and he goes to rescue Christine. The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love, and orders Christine to marry him. Christine tries to {{convince}} the Phantom {{that she does not}} fear his ugliness, but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants. Just then, Raoul enters the lair, and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him. Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world. The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love {{for the first time in}} his life. Ashamed of his murderous actions, he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return. He finds comfort in a little monkey music box. Christine approaches the Phantom, who tells her that he loves her, and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by. After Christine and Raoul leave, the Phantom smashes every <b>mirror</b> <b>in</b> his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive. Upon entering, Meg finds only the Phantom's white mask.|$|E
