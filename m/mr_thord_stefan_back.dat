40|$|This {{project was}} {{conducted}} upon {{a request from}} the Swedish Agency for Transport Analysis (Trafikanalys), with a governmental assignment to annually report the rate of internalisation per mode for passenger and freight transports.

With this background, VTI was given the assignment to analyse ten freight routes in Europe within the Narvik (Norway) –Naples (Italy), and Oslo (Norway) – Rotterdam (the Netherlands) corridors.
