'Loupèd clothes' - (pronounced [...] "loup-ed" [...] {{in order}} for it to scan) It means 'looped', and refers to the exaggerated 'lace' binding <b>of</b> <b>button-holes,</b> or 'loops' that {{extended}} across the breast, which distinguished early grenadiers uniforms. This imitated the costume of eastern European troops and was intended, along with tall caps and moustaches, to give an impression of barbaric fierceness.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Bilateral {{inferior}} shoulder dislocation is rare; but the dislocation {{is almost}} always reducible by closed means. We present a unique case of irreducible bilateral inferior shoulder dislocation. Presentation of case: A 35 -year old male fell down from height. Direct axial loading while both shoulders were fully abducted resulted in bilateral inferior shoulder dislocation. All attempts of closed reduction failed. Open reduction revealed {{that the cause of}} irreducibility was the entrapment of the humeral head in a button-hole through the inferior joint capsule and the surrounding soft tissue envelope. At 6 months, there was almost full range of motion and no pain. Discussion: The direct axial loading resulted in a narrow defect in the inferior joint capsule/soft tissue envelope; and this may have led to <b>button-hole</b> entrapment <b>of</b> the dislocated humeral head and irreducibility. Open reduction required widening <b>of</b> the <b>button-hole</b> while protecting the axillary neurovascular bundle. Conclusion: We present a rare case of bilateral irreducible inferior shoulder dislocation. We highlight the pathomechanics <b>of</b> irreducibility: <b>button-hole</b> entrapment <b>of</b> the humeral head. We emphasize technical tips during open reduction such as widening <b>of</b> the <b>button-hole</b> and protection <b>of</b> the axillary neurovascular bundle. The outcome is good although some limitation of shoulder abduction is to be expected...|$|R

60|$|Arnold {{was almost}} dumbfounded. Any {{reference}} {{to the events of}} the preceding evening was, for the moment, beyond him. Mr. Weatherley calmly hung up his silk hat, took out the violets from the <b>button-hole</b> <b>of</b> his overcoat and carried them to his desk.|$|R
60|$|Then I fell to applauding, {{while the}} captain tried on (for {{he was not}} content with holding up) another frock of white drab, which, cuffs and pockets, I'll take my oath mounted no less than twenty-four: another plain one of pink cut-velvet; tail-coats of silk, heavily broidered with flowers, and satin {{waistcoats}} with narrow lace. He took an inconceivable enjoyment out of this parade, discoursing the while, like a nobleman with nothing but dress in his head, or, perhaps, like a mastercutter, about the turn {{of this or that}} lapel, the length from armpit to fold, and the number <b>of</b> <b>button-holes</b> that was proper. And finally he exhibited with evident pride a pair of doeskins that buttoned over the calf to be worn with high shoes, which I make sure he would have tried on likewise had he been offered the slightest encouragement. So he exploited the whole of his wardrobe, such an unlucky assortment of finery as I never wish to see again; all of which, however, became him marvellously, though I think he had looked well in anything. I hope I may be forgiven the perjury I did that day. I wondered greatly that such a foible should crop out in a man of otherwise sound sense and plain ability.|$|R

40|$|Background Pedoman Penggunaan Antibiotik (PPAB) {{is a book}} {{containing}} {{procedures and}} guides for using antibiotic properly. After the new revision, antibiotic prescription {{is expected to be}} proper with the written guidelines. Aim To measure quantity of antibiotic use in digestive cases before and after the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB. Methods This study is a prospective observational study. Subjects were patients in digestive surgery case hospitalizing in September and November. The use of antibiotic is compared between period of before and after the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB (October) using independent t test and Mann-Whitney test. Result DDD/ 100 patient days of antibiotic prophylaxis before the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB is 13, 54 decrease to 11, 96 after the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB, but the decrease is not significantly different in statistic test. The most antibiotic prophylaxis (ceftriaxone) before the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB (13, 13 DDD/ 100 patient days) declined (11, 18 DDD/ 100 patient days) after the <b>making</b> <b>of</b> PPAB.
