5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a {{painting}} on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but {{this is likely to}} be a <b>misprint</b> of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E
25|$|By 1905 he had {{returned}} to Dresden where he married Klara Voss, but the couple divorced in 1907. The Münchener Post (14 March 1923) reported that he was sentenced as a swindler and forger in 1909, which Goodrick-Clarke (1985: 251) insists is a <b>misprint</b> for 1908.|$|E
25|$|An atomic {{dielectric}} resonance survey {{carried out}} in November 2003 found traces of timbers forming {{the size and shape}} of the lower hull, indicating a substantial amount of timbers from below the waterline still in place. An old anchor of 1841 pattern was excavated. It was also found that the 1871 census recorded a new farmhouse in the name of William Murray and Thomas Rainer, leading to speculation that the merchant's name was a <b>misprint</b> for T. Rainer. The farmhouse was demolished in the 1940s, but a nearby boathouse incorporated timbers matching knee timbers used in Beagle. Two more large anchors similar to the one excavated from the ship's present location are known to have been found in neighbouring villages. It is believed that there were four anchors in the ship.|$|E

25|$|His best-known {{and most}} highly {{regarded}} {{work is the}} multi-volume novel The Book of the New Sun. Set in a bleak, distant future influenced by Jack Vance's Dying Earth series, the story details the life of Severian, a journeyman torturer, exiled from his guild for showing compassion {{to one of the}} condemned. The novel is composed of the volumes The Shadow of the Torturer (1980), The Claw of the Conciliator (1981), winner of the Nebula Award for Best Novel, The Sword of the Lictor (1982), and The Citadel of the Autarch (1983). A coda, The Urth of the New Sun (1987), wraps up some loose ends but is generally considered a separate work. Several Wolfe essays about the writing of The Book of the New Sun were published in The Castle of the Otter (1982); the title refers to a <b>misprint</b> of the fourth book's title in Locus magazine).|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a <b>misprint</b> on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in the engine block, allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|E
25|$|Tender is {{a member}} of the fanatical Creedish cult, which engaged in a mass suicide ten years previously. He is one of the Creedish members who was sent out into the world to work as a servant, and send his income back to the Creedish community. Creedish members have been {{steadily}} killing themselves since the mass suicide, in keeping with their belief that the deliverance is at hand. At the start of his story, Tender works as the housekeeper for a rich couple he never sees in Oregon. They issue directions via a daily planner and a speaker phone. At his dingy apartment, he gets phone calls from people who want to kill themselves - the result of a newspaper <b>misprint</b> which printed his phone number as the number for a suicide prevention hotline. Tender, enjoying the thrill of passing divine judgment on these people tells them to kill themselves as often as not, and sees this as an act of mercy. Although the newspaper prints a retraction, the calls keep coming, and when they dwindle, Tender prints up fliers for a fake crisis hotline with his number on them so the calls will continue.|$|E

500|$|... “The Elf Child” {{kept its}} {{original}} title {{in its first}} two printings, but Riley decided to change its title to [...] "Little Orphant Allie" [...] in an 1889 printing. The printing house incorrectly cast the typeset during the printing, unintentionally renaming the poem to [...] "Little Orphant Annie". Riley at first contacted the printing house to have the error corrected, but decided to keep the <b>misprint</b> because of the poem's growing popularity.|$|E
500|$|Other {{well-known}} {{writers who}} appeared in the two magazines included Damon Knight and David H. Keller. Knight's first published story, [...] "Resilience", appeared in the February 1941 issue of Stirring Stories, but the story was ruined by a <b>misprint</b> in a crucial word in the first sentence. [...] Keller was an established writer in the field, but Wollheim was aware that Keller occasionally donated material to fanzines, {{and was able to}} obtain a story from him. [...] The quality of the artwork was variable; it included Elliot Dold's last artwork in the science fiction field, for the cover of the July 1941 issue of Cosmic Stories, and several covers and interior drawings by Hannes Bok, who later became a well-known artist in the field.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1899 by American mycologist Harvey Willson Harkness as Secotium nubigenum. Harkness found the type collection growing on logs of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the Sierra Nevadas at {{an elevation of}} [...] Curtis Gates Lloyd discussed the species in a 1903 publication, but named it rubigenum, stating that nubigenum was incorrect because of typographical errors carried down from Pier Andrea Saccardo. The genus Nivatogastrium was circumscribed by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith in 1959, who set N.nubigenum as the type and only species. They considered Lloyd's spelling rubigenum to be a <b>misprint</b> (sphalma typographicum). The holotype specimen was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Modern molecular phylogenetic analysis has demonstrated that the species is nested within the genus Pholiota, and {{is closely related to}} Pholiota squarrosa and Pholiota multicingulata. Mycologist Scott Redhead transferred the species to Pholiota in 2014.|$|E

500|$|In 1815, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius {{analysed}} {{an unusual}} sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in Falun, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces {{of a white}} mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (oxide in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but {{he had made a}} public mistake once, announcing a new element, gahnium, {{that turned out to be}} zinc oxide. Berzelius privately named the putative element [...] "thorium" [...] in 1817 and its supposed oxide [...] "thorina" [...] after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in Vest-Agder, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral proved to be mostly yttrium orthophosphate. As the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken for a new element, the mineral was named kenotime by the French mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant as a rebuke of Berzelius, from the Greek words κενός (kenos; [...] "empty") and τιμή (timē; [...] "honour"). This became [...] "xenotime" [...] as a <b>misprint</b> from the beginning, blunting the criticism. This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξένος (xenos; [...] "alien") and τιμή, supposedly in reference to the small, rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as.|$|E
