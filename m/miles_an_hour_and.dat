5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park. In 1960 the speed limit in the park had been raised from 20 to 30 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> there were {{concerns}} that the roads in the park would be assigned to the main highway system as had recently happened in parts of Hyde Park. In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn. The speed limit was reduced to 20 miles {{an hour in the}} summer of 2004.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that the next big war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E

In July 2014, it was revealed the company was developing its 8th and 9th drone prototypes, some that could fly 50 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> carry 5-pound packages, and had applied to the FAA to test them.|$|E

2500|$|The Bridgeport Herald {{reported}} that Whitehead {{and another man}} drove to the testing area in the machine, which worked like a car when the wings were folded along its sides. Two other people, including the newspaper reporter, followed on bicycles. For short distances the Number 21's speed was close to thirty miles {{an hour on the}} uneven road, and the article said, [...] "there seems no doubt that the machine can reel off forty <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> not exert the engine to its fullest capacity.".|$|E

60|$|But {{the drag}} was a fearfully heavy one for men who, besides having walked {{so long and}} so far on the {{previous}} day, were, most of them, much weakened by illness and very unfit for such laborious work. The floes, too, were so rugged that they had frequently to lift the heavy sledge and its living load over deep rents and chasms which, in circumstances less desperate, they would have scarcely ventured to do. Work as they would, however, they could not make more than <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> night overtook them ere they reached the level floes.

50|$|One of the {{highlights}} of the school’s baseball roster included Jimmy Barefield, a 6-foot-5 pitcher and infielder from Redwood City who “was on the fast to becoming a poster boy for troubled youth,” when he arrived at Mid-Pen and became a standout player in 1999.

2500|$|Michigan {{concluded}} {{its regular}} {{season with a}} 10–0 victory over Ohio State in Columbus. [...] The game was played with winds blowing at 23 <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> temperatures in the low 20s. [...] Michigan scored its first touchdown on a 17-yard touchdown pass from Bob Timberlake to Jim Detwiler with 44 seconds remaining in the first half. [...] The touchdown followed a 50-yard punt by Stan Kempe. [...] Ohio State's Bo Rein lost the punt in the sun, fumbled, and the ball was recovered by John Henderson. [...] The only other points in the game came on a 27-yard field goal by Timberlake. [...] With the victory, Michigan won the Big Ten Conference championship {{for the first time}} in 14 years.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety <b>miles</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E

6000|$|The attack, it was understood, {{was to be}} made {{in column}} of brigades, Hazen's brigade of Wood's {{division}} leading. That such was at least Hazen's understanding I learned from his own lips during the movement, as I was an officer of his staff. But after a march of less than <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> further delay of three hours {{at the end of it}} to acquaint the enemy of our intention to surprise him, our single shrunken brigade of fifteen hundred men was sent forward without support to double up the army of General Johnston. [...] "We will put in Hazen and see what success he has." [...] In these words of General Wood to General Howard we were first apprised of the true nature of the distinction about to be conferred upon us.|$|R

60|$|It {{seemed to}} her that he drove rather too carefully, too slowly. He took curves and corners evenly. His face was as empty of expression, as unmelodramatic, as that of a jitney driver.

60|$|He did {{not stop}} a moment at the shed, not even {{entering}} it {{to see whether the}} heap of leaves had been displaced during the night, but went on straight to Medlicot's Mill. He rode the nine <b>miles</b> in <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> at once entered the building in which the canes were crushed. The first man he met was Nokes, who acted as overseer, having a gang of Polynesian laborers under him--sleek, swarthy fellows from the South Sea Islands, with linen trowsers on and nothing else--who crept silently among the vats and machinery, shifting the sugar as it was made.|$|R
60|$|The ark is {{one hundred}} and forty feet long; the {{dwelling}} is ninety feet long. The idea of the Indians is to drop softly and secretly from the arched sapling to the dwelling as the ark creeps along under it {{at the rate of}} <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> butcher the family. It will take the ark {{a minute and a half}} to pass under. It will take the ninety foot dwelling a minute to pass under. Now, then, what did the six Indians do? It would take you thirty years to guess, and even then you would have to give it up, I believe. Therefore, I will tell you what the Indians did. Their chief, a person of quite extraordinary intellect for a Cooper Indian, warily watched the canal-boat as it squeezed along under him, and when he had got his calculations fined down to exactly the right shade, as he judged, he let go and dropped. And missed the house! That is actually what he did. He missed the house, and landed in the stern of the scow. It was not much of a fall, yet it knocked him silly. He lay there unconscious. If the house had been ninety-seven feet long he would have made the trip. The fault was Cooper's, not his. The error lay in the construction of the house. Cooper was no architect.|$|R

60|$|In 1814 {{he made a}} {{locomotive}} for the Killingworth Colliery Railway.

60|$|The {{distance}} to the woods was some twelve <b>miles,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half {{from the moment of}} his starting Cuthbert was deep within its shades.

60|$|In {{the evening}} I {{set out on}} an {{excursion}} to St. Fé, which is situated nearly three hundred English miles from Buenos Ayres, {{on the banks of}} the Parana. The roads in the neighbourhood of the city, after the rainy weather, were extraordinarily bad. I should never have thought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along: as it was, they scarcely went at the rate of <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> man was kept ahead, to survey the best line for making the attempt. The bullocks were terribly jaded: it is a great mistake to suppose that with improved roads, and an accelerated rate of travelling, the sufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion. We passed a train of waggons and a troop of beasts on their road to Mendoza. The distance is about 580 geographical miles, and the journey is generally performed in fifty days. These waggons are very long, narrow, and thatched with reeds; they have only two wheels, the diameter of which in some cases is as much as ten feet. Each is drawn by six bullocks, which are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long: this is suspended from within the roof; for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is kept; and for the intermediate pair, a point projects at right angles from the middle of the long one. The whole apparatus looked like some implement of war.|$|R
60|$|After {{covering}} six <b>miles</b> in <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> <b>and</b> three-quarters, exaggerated by {{the guides}} to three, we suddenly sighted the inland fort. Its {{approach is that}} of a large encamping-ground, and such, indeed, it is; the Egyptian pilgrim-caravan here halts on the fourth day from El-Muwaylah. The broken, untidy environs, strewed with bones and rubbish, show low mounds that mean ovens; stone rings, where tents are pitched; and the usual graves, amongst which a reverend man, Shaykh Sálih, rests in a manner of round tower. The site is, in one point at least, admirably well-chosen, a kind of carrefour where four valleys and as many roads meet; and thus it commands the mouths of all the gorges leading inland.|$|R
