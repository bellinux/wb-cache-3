25|$|PGP {{supports}} {{message authentication}} and integrity checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes in the message will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a <b>message</b> <b>digest)</b> from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E
2500|$|Code signing uses public-key {{infrastructure}} to check if a file has been modified since being digitally signed by its publisher. Alternatively, a system owner or administrator {{can use a}} cryptographic hash function to compute a [...] "fingerprint" [...] at installation time that can help to detect subsequent unauthorized changes to on-disk code libraries. However, unsophisticated schemes check only whether the code has been modified since installation time; subversion prior to that time is not detectable. The fingerprint must be re-established each time changes are made to the system: for example, after installing security updates or a service pack. The hash function creates a <b>message</b> <b>digest,</b> a relatively short code calculated from each bit in the file using an algorithm that creates large changes in the <b>message</b> <b>digest</b> with even smaller changes to the original file. By recalculating and comparing the <b>message</b> <b>digest</b> of the installed files at regular intervals against a trusted list of message digests, changes in the system can be detected and monitored—as long as the original baseline was created before the malware was added.|$|E

50|$|The term message {{integrity}} code (MIC) is frequently substituted for the term MAC, especially in communications, where the acronym MAC traditionally stands for Media Access Control address. However, some authors use MIC {{to refer to}} a <b>message</b> <b>digest,</b> which is different from a MAC -- a <b>message</b> <b>digest</b> does not use secret keys. This lack of security means that any <b>message</b> <b>digest</b> intended for use gauging {{message integrity}} should be encrypted or otherwise be protected against tampering. <b>Message</b> <b>digest</b> algorithms are created such that a given message will always produce the same <b>message</b> <b>digest</b> assuming the same algorithm is used to generate both. Conversely, MAC algorithms are designed to produce matching MACs only if the same message, secret key and initialization vector are input to the same algorithm. Message digests do not use secret keys and, when taken on their own, are therefore a much less reliable gauge of message integrity than MACs. Because MACs use secret keys, they do not necessarily need to be encrypted to provide the same level of assurance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new hybrid {{concept is}} {{proposed}} {{by analyzing the}} principle of the hybrid cryptography based on the combination of symmetric and <b>message</b> <b>digesting.</b> Moreover, the security and performance of the proposed concept will also estimate. In proposed concept we designed a new symmetric encryption algorithm and combine with SHA- 1 <b>message</b> <b>digesting</b> function to provide hybrid nature. Now the proposed system will try to improve exiting problem. In proposed system symmetric key will use series of logical functions like XOR, Circular Shift (Right, Left), Feastel function [6] and these operations are time efficient operation as compared to mathematical operation for providing confidentiality and authentication. For integrity, proposed system use SHA- 1 [15] algorithm. Due to this reason proposed system is efficient then existing system. The experimental results based on combination of symmetric and <b>message</b> <b>digesting</b> will approve the effectiveness of the proposed concept, and the combination of symmetric and <b>message</b> <b>digesting</b> will show large variation in key space and provide high-level security. The cipher text generated by this method will be approximately double in size as the plaintext, and will be suitable for practical use in the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet. The purpose of hybrid cryptosystems is not to provide perfect or risk-free security. Rather, the purpose of cryptography-based security is to protect information resources by making unauthorized collection of the information or tampering with the information costly than the existing potential value that might be gained.

30|$|To adapt our {{protocol}} to the byzantine failure model, {{we make a}} few extra assumptions. We first assume {{that the number of}} servers is at least 3 f+ 1. This is the minimum to solve atomic broadcast with malicious faults [12]. We make use of <b>message</b> <b>digests</b> produced by collision-resistant hash functions to ensure data integrity [21], and public-key signatures to ensure communication authenticity [22]. We follow the common practice of signing <b>message</b> <b>digests</b> instead of signing messages directly. We also assume that each client-server pair and each pair of servers communicate using private channels that can be implemented using symmetric keys [5]. Finally, clients are authenticated and servers enforce access control. This forbids unauthorized clients from accessing the database, and prevents potentially byzantine servers from issuing transactions that may compromise the integrity of the database. Obviously, a byzantine server can compromise its local copy of the database, but this behavior is handled by our protocols.|$|R
