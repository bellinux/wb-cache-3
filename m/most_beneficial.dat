5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires {{are thought to be}} <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E
5|$|Movements of grey-headed {{flying foxes}} are {{influenced}} by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed disperses over 100 species of native trees and plants. The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a specific direction, but rather in the direction that will be the <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> at the time.|$|E

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> for the child.|$|E
5|$|The Palmyrene council {{consisted}} {{of about six}} hundred {{members of the local}} elite (such as the elders or heads of wealthy families or clans), representing the city's four-quarters. The council, headed by a president, managed civic responsibilities; it supervised public works (including the construction of public buildings), approved expenditures, collected taxes, and appointed two archons (lords) each year. Palmyra's military was led by strategoi (generals) appointed by the council. Roman provincial authority set and approved Palmyra's tariff structure, but the provincial interference in local government was kept minimal as the empire sought to ensure the continuous success of Palmyrene trade <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> to Rome.

Often, a patient will receive corrections to their treatment via on-line strategies during their first radiation session, and physicians make subsequent adjustments off-line during check film rounds.|$|E
25|$|One {{generally}} sees adjectives {{in their}} neuter form when used pronominally for this reason. For words {{more commonly used}} in this way (rather than to describe a noun) one sees their neuter forms more often than their masculine or feminine.

In these cases, however, the most practical form to learn first would be the neuter.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or no effect on humans, wildlife, pollinators and <b>most</b> other <b>beneficial</b> insects.|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> gift of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a growing}} concern over the {{treatment}} of multilingualism in education, especially in many countries that were once colonized. Deciding on which language of instruction would be <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> to effective communication on the local and state level is a task requiring thoughtful planning and is surrounded by debate. Some states prefer instruction only in the official language, but some aim to foster linguistic and thus social diversity by encouraging teaching in several (native) languages.

Some states prefer incorporating different languages {{in order to help}} students learn better by giving them diverse perspectives.|$|E

25|$|Pharmacogenomics: type {{of genetic}} testing that determines the {{influence}} of genetic variation on drug response. When a person has a disease or health condition, pharmacogenomics can examine an individual’s genetic makeup to determine what medicine and what dosage would be the safest and <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> to the patient. In the human population, there are approximately 11 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in people’s genomes, making them the most common variations in the human genome. SNPs reveal information about an individual’s response to certain drugs. This type of genetic testing {{can be used for}} cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A sample of the cancer tissue can be sent in for genetic analysis by a specialized lab. After analysis, information retrieved can identify mutations in the tumor which can be used to determine the best treatment option.|$|E
25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{circular}} migration {{has been described}} as a triple-win scenario, providing benefits for the host country, the home country, and the migrants themselves. Developed countries allow migrants to enter in order to fill labor shortages, but with the understanding that the settlement is not permanent, distinguishing it from immigration. Developing countries benefit in the sense that they are not truly losing their skilled migrants, as these workers will return after a period of time to continue working. The migrants themselves benefit through the skills they learn abroad, as well as their increase in wages. The form of benefits in this triple-win discourse often take three forms: financial capital, human capital, and social capital. Circularity is the <b>most</b> <b>beneficial</b> whenever migrants move voluntary between locations in the pursuit of different interests, as well as when migrants have positive experiences while abroad, including financial and educational success.|$|E
