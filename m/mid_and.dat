5|$|Tropical Storm Elena brought {{flooding}} to the Greater Houston area, {{with five}} deaths and about $10million in damage. However, little impact was reported elsewhere. Hurricane Henri remained offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and disrupted efforts {{to stop the}} Ixtoc I oil spill. Henri also caused flooding in portions of Mexico. In <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late-September, a tropical depression caused flooding in the Southern United States, especially Texas. Four deaths were reported, two in Texas and two in Kentucky. Toward the end of October, a brief subtropical storm struck Newfoundland, but left little impact. Other than Tropical Depression One and the tropical depression that brought flooding to the Southern United States in <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late-September, {{none of the other}} depressions caused significant effects of land. Collectively, the tropical cyclones of the season resulted in $4.63billion in damage and at least 2,136deaths. Pacific Storm Blanca originated in the basin.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1914 Essad Pasha {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Senate of Central Albania (established by the rebelling towns in <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> north Albania) to return to Albania to take control. His first task was to provide financial backing for his government. Therefore, he travelled to Niš, Kingdom of Serbia, where he and Serbian prime minister Pašić signed a secret treaty of Serbian-Albanian alliance on September17. In October1914 Essad Pasha returned to Albania. With Italian and Serbian financial backing he established armed forces in Dibër and captured the interior and Durrës {{at the beginning of}} October, without a fight.|$|E
5|$|In the Office for National Statistics Area Classification, local {{authorities}} are clustered into groups {{based in the}} six main census dimensions (demographic, household composition, housing, socio-economic, employment and industry sector). Most of the {{local authorities}} in <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> west Wales are classified {{as part of the}} 'Coastal and Countryside' supergroup. Most of the south Wales authorities, Flintshire and Wrexham are in the 'Mining and Manufacturing' supergroup; Cardiff is part of the 'Cities and Services' supergroup and the Vale of Glamorgan is part of 'Prospering UK'.|$|E

5|$|The Great Vowel Shift {{affected}} the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent {{shift in the}} vowel system. <b>Mid</b> <b>and</b> open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an abysmal financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} boundary {{was drawn}} to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 {{and the most recent}} historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, low-income housing projects, and the Uncle Sam Atrium, a large shopping mall downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods, for a total of 10% of the city's area.|$|E

5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are able to control the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly built}} Australian National University was expanded, and sculptures and monuments were built. A new National Library was {{constructed}} within the Parliamentary Triangle, {{followed by the}} High Court and the National Gallery. Suburbs in Canberra Central (often referred to as North Canberra and South Canberra) were further developed in the1950s, and urban development in the districts of Woden Valley and Belconnen commenced in the <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late 1960s respectively. Many of the new suburbs were named after Australian politicians, such as Barton, Deakin, Reid, Braddon, Curtin, Chifley and Parkes.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and Germantown Junction. A new station, which ushered in the Beaux-Arts style for large train stations, was built from 1896 to 1901. After a 1912–1915 enlargement, it was renamed as North Philadelphia. Despite several other renovations, its use {{declined}} in the <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> late 20th century; in 1991, Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks. The building was renovated once more in 1999 and is now used as commercial space. It {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places the same year.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of small named-places in and around Milnrow, {{including}} Clegg, Firgrove, Gallows, Haugh, Newhey, Kitcliffe, Ogden, and Tunshill. Newhey, at the south of Milnrow by Shaw and Crompton, is the most distinct of these areas, and, with its own parish church and Metrolink station, is invariably given as a separate village. The Gallows public house is said to occupy the land of an ancient execution site; Gallows, a former hamlet at northeastern Milnrow, is named in reference to a baronial gallows. Kitcliffe, Ogden and Tunshill, to the east of central Milnrow, are hamlets that occupy the upper, <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> lower Piethorne Valley respectively.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} network of caves, including Wookey Hole, underground rivers, and gorges, including the Cheddar Gorge and Ebbor Gorge. The county has many rivers, including the Axe, Brue, Cary, Parrett, Sheppey, Tone and Yeo. These both feed and drain the flat levels and moors of <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> west Somerset. In {{the north of}} the county the River Chew flows into the Bristol Avon. The Parrett is tidal almost to Langport, where there is evidence of two Roman wharfs. At the same site during the reign of King Charles I, river tolls were levied on boats to pay for the maintenance of the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Until {{late in the}} 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Abel, Nephilim, KOS-MOS {{and chaos}} choose {{to stay on}} Michtam, drawing all Gnosis to them and using a {{dimensional}} shift to move that region of space to Lost Jerusalem. Their actions {{and the release of}} chaos's Anima energy—which is accelerating the universe's death—will delay the universe's destruction, giving Shion time to find Lost Jerusalem and discover the key to changing humanity's will and saving the universe. During the escape, Jin sacrifices himself to save Shion. The resultant explosion of energy from the dimensional shift destroys the U.M.N., rendering faster-than-light travel impossible. Shion goes with Jr. and Allen on the Elsa to find Lost Jerusalem, while MOMO stays behind with Ziggy to reconstruct a new travel network with Scientia's help. In the <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> post-credit scenes, a badly-damaged KOS-MOS floats through space and is contacted by chaos, saying they will both awake when they are needed. KOS-MOS is last seen drifting towards Lost Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E
5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, <b>mid</b> <b>and</b> anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
