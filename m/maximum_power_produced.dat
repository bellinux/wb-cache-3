40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{traditional}} {{sources of}} energy are near exhaustion and alternative {{sources of energy}} are considered. One of the newest resources of energy is microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFC is a bioreactor that converts chemical energy in bonds of organic substrate to bioelectricity. The active biocatalysts such as microorganisms or enzymes, in the anode compartment, utilize substrate for growth maintenance; as a result electrons are supplied. Electrons and protons are produced by oxidation of substrate where electrons move from external resistance to the cathode surface while protons move across membrane to the cathode surface as well. Electrons and protons, with solution oxygen, combine to form water. In this study, this process is achieved by a new membrane-less MFC (MLMFC) which is low in cost {{when compared to other}} dual chamber MFCs. <b>Maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by MLMFC was 40. 43 mW/m 2 while COD removal was 66 %.

A previously derived theory is adapted to model the effect of turbine drag on the flow through the Minas Passage and the tidal amplitude in the Minas Basin. The theoretical <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> production over a tidal cycle {{is determined by the}} product of the amplitude of the forcing tide in the Bay of Fundy and the undisturbed volumetric flowrate through the Minas Passage. Although the extraction of the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> will reduce the flowrate through the Minas Passage and the tides in the Minas Basin by over 30 per cent, {{a significant portion of the}} <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> can be extracted with little change in tidal amplitude as the initial power generation causes only an increase in the phase lag of the basin tides. Two-dimensional, finite-element, numerical simulations of the Bay of Fundy–Gulf of Maine system agree remarkably well with the theory. The simulations suggest that a maximum of 7 GW of power can be extracted by turbines. They also show that any power extraction in the Minas Passage pushes the Bay of Fundy–Gulf of Maine system closer to resonance with the forcing tides, resulting in increased tidal amplitudes throughout the Gulf of Maine. Although extracting the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produces</b> significant changes, 2. 5 GW of power can be extracted with a maximum 5 per cent change in the tidal amplitude at any location.

Near the operator's ear, a sound power level of 85 dB(A) is not exceeded. Therefore, compared to ordinary blowers with the same volume-flow, this low-noise blower shows a reduced noise-emission of more than 10 dB(A). This noise-reducement was possible through technical advancement of some components. The rotational speed was lowered by more than 1000 min"-" 1 without reducing the produced volume - flow. The below listed measures were proceeded: increase of motor-power through tuned intake pressure charging, development of inlet and muffler silencer as Helmholtz resonator, avoidance of sharp edges in the ventilator's inside, enlargement of tongue radius, increase of relation of obstacles in the flow to casing. The accomplished measures can be taken over the production without any kind of restriction. The measures at the driving elements can also be applied to other motor powered gradening equipment.

In this paper, we propose to use the called Graham's scan algorithm in order to directly obtain the power vs. efficiency curve of a realistic Stirling engine model, which includes heat leakage, regenerator effectiveness, as well as internal and external irreversibilities. Coupled with an adapted optimization routine, this approach allows to design and optimize the same way simple or complex heat engine models.

40|$|Voltages {{produced}} by microbial fuel cells (MFCs) cannot be sustainably increased by linking them in series due to voltage reversal, which substantially reduces stack voltages. It was shown here that MFC voltages {{can be increased}} with continuous power production using an electronic circuit containing two sets of multiple capacitors that were alternately charged and discharged (every one second). Capacitors were charged in parallel by the MFCs, but linked in series while discharging to the circuit load (resistor). The parallel charging of the capacitors avoided voltage reversal, while discharging the capacitors in series produced up to 2. 5 V with four capacitors. There were negligible energy losses in the circuit compared to 20 - 40 % losses typically obtained with MFCs using DC-DC converters to increase voltage. Coulombic efficiencies were 67 % when power was generated via four capacitors, compared to only 38 % when individual MFCs were operated with a fixed resistance of 250 Ω. The <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> using the capacitors was not adversely affected by variable performance of the MFCs, showing that power generation can be maintained even if individual MFCs perform differently.

Several marine current turbines have been developed over the years, most of the turbines perform well at velocities over 2 m/s {{and need to be}} installed at depths of 20 - 40 m. Placing an appropriately designed duct or shroud around the turbine significantly improves the turbine’s performance. Ducted Savonius turbines can operate at low depths, since large clearance is not required because turbulent flow has little effect on the performance of the Savonius rotor. Ducted Savonius turbine has simple components and can be easily fabricated in Pacific Island Countries (PIC) and other places that do not have advanced manufacturing industries. A ducted Savonius turbine was designed for a location in Fiji, to operate at a rated marine current speed of 1. 15 m/s and cut in speed of 0. 2 m/s.

40|$|Solid-state {{frequency}} multipliers {{are used}} to produce tunable broadband sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by a single chip {{is limited by the}} electrical breakdown of the semiconductor and by the thermal management properties of the chip. The solution is to split the drive power to a frequency tripler using waveguides to divide the power among four chips, then recombine the output power from the four chips back into a single waveguide. To achieve this, a waveguide branchline quadrature hybrid coupler splits a 100 -GHz input signal into two paths with a 90 relative phase shift. These two paths are split again by a pair of waveguide Y-junctions. The signals from the four outputs of the Y-junctions are tripled in frequency using balanced Schottky diode frequency triplers before being recombined with another pair of Y-junctions. A final waveguide branchline quadrature hybrid coupler completes the combination. Using four chips instead of one enables using four-times higher power input, and produces a nearly four-fold power output as compared to using a single chip. The phase shifts introduced by the quadrature hybrid couplers provide isolation for the input and output waveguides, effectively eliminating standing waves between it and surrounding components. This is accomplished without introducing the high losses and expense of ferrite isolators. A practical use of this technology is to drive local oscillators as was demonstrated around 300 GHz for a heterodyne spectrometer operating in the 2 - 3 -THz band.

40|$|The {{energy demand}} in current times has {{increased}} greatly in last few years. This increasing demand {{calls for a}} sustainable and clean energy resource that would reduce the load on non-renewable resources. Wind energy is a renewable resource which is harnessed by mankind from an ancient era. So as to meet this increasing energy demands, innovation {{in the field of}} wind energy is required. A wind turbine generates electricity but achieving optimal power is a difficult task. In this case, the optimal power is defined as <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> but at the constraints that the fatigue loading of the wind turbine structure should be as minimum as possible. Also, the wind turbine parameters such as rotor speed and pitch activity should be in a safe operational region. The problem in controlling wind turbines is that they work in a highly uncertain environment where managing so many factors at the same time are difficult. Optimal control of wind turbine has helped in achieving maximum power with-in safe working limits. Due to high uncertainty in the operating conditions of a wind turbine, it is quite a daunting task to find optimal gains for a wind turbine controller. This thesis focuses on achieving optimal gain parameters for wind turbine controller by using an algorithm from machine learning community. In this thesis the problem is formulated as a supervised learning problem where input-output mapping has to be predicted. For this purpose, GPRT is used. The reason behind using GPRT is it takes fewer number of measurements to give good prediction compared to others. The property of GPRT where it deals with uncertain and non linear data with ease, making it a good choice for predicting wind turbine controller gains. The second part of this thesis contains optimisation of the surrogate model achieved by performing regression. The optimisation is done by Monte Carlo Maximum distribution and improved results were generated by applying sequential sampling to this algorithm. This helps us to get a likelihood of optimal gains where the wind turbine gives out rated power with minimal fatigue loads, pitch activity and least deviation of rotor speed from rated. The results obtained from the likelihood was tested for different operational wind speed and also tested for Extreme Operating Gusts as part of disturbance rejection and compared to current parameter used. The comparison shows considerable improvement in the fatigue loads and pitch activity with having improvement in power production. In second case study, more parameters were predicted and optimised using the same algorithm so that the potential of this algorithm can be estimated. This was also performed successfully which proves that this technique can successfully be used to solve higher dimensional problems of wind turbine control. Systems and Contro...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{to reduce}} energy {{consumption}} is increasing. The problem of vehicle fuel consumption and emissions is approached by exploring various vehicle propulsion options, assessing their net eff�ectiveness on a energy conversion basis {{and on a}} usability (consumer appeal) basis. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of various options indicates that internal combustion engine powered vehicles compare favourably because of low production cost in spite of only achieving modest energy conversion efficiency in operation. Spark ignition (SI) homogeneous charge engines have dominated as passenger vehicle power plants, {{and are likely to}} maintain their prevalence for passenger vehicle propulsion into the future, but efficiency improvements are required and achievable. Throttling losses are a signifi�cant contributor to reduced efficiency at low load for SI engines which is the load range most employed in standard driving behaviour. An Induction Air Motor (IAM) was conceived, designed, simulated and prototyped to evaluate the potential to recover some of the work the engine does to reduce its intake air pressure for low load operation. The prototyped IAM produced work which potentially could contribute to the engine output while reducing the intake pressure resulting in improved efficiency. However, further eff�ort is required to reduce the friction in the IAM and optimise the work produced by the IAM. An alternative strategy for efficiency improvement involves high Compression Ratio (CR) in conjunction with a reduced compression stroke volume achieved by Late Valve Closing (LVC). Such an arrangement of the Atkinson cycle is shown by simulation to produce improved brake efficiency in SI engines. In this cofin�guration, the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> by the engine is considerably lower than the maximum power that is achieved by the same displacement for a full compression stroke. To achieve both the improved efficiency at low load using the Atkinson confi�guration and the power achievable from a full induction stroke, the engine requires Variable Compression Ratio (VCR). Assessment of VCR concepts from literature and patents identifi�ed that the complexity of continuously variable compression ratio designs prevented their development to production-ready con�figurations. A simulation of fuel consumption over a standard driving cycle showed that a two-position VCR arrangement produces the same bene�t as a continuously variable CR for physically achievable piston-rod-crank cofin�gurations. Experiments with supporting simulations were performed for a previously patented two-position VCR device, an eccentric link in the big-end of the connecting rod. This work concludes that the eccentric link is not a viable VCR mechanism. An alternative VCR device involving a hydraulic connecting rod was prompted by further experiments and simulations which identifi�ed the behaviour of oil when compressed at high rates in a hydraulic cylinder impacted by a falling mass. The oil impact work suggested that oil chambers of cross-sectional area that could be arranged in a conventional connecting rod could readily support the loads experienced by the rod in a conventionally con�figured engine, so the design and prototyping of a hydraulic connecting rod proceeded. Experiments and simulation confi�rmed that a relatively easily manufactured hydraulic connection rod can be successfully operated in an engine, achieving controllable two-position VCR. Further development of the hydraulic connecting rod control device and improved production techniques are recommended for this new two-position hydraulic VCR device. ...|$|E

The power density of the linear harvester is determined to be 4. 44 e- 4 W/cm 3. Thereafter, optimization is done in comsol to improve the performance of the energy harvesting system. The optimized magnet to iron ratio is determined to be 3. 175 and permanent magnet to coil ratio of 0. 7938. The optimized ratios are used to develop an inertial type non-linear energy harvesting device. The structure of the non-linear harvester is same as the linear one except two stationary magnets are added at the top and bottom of the harvester that act as a non-linear spring. The non-linear harvesting device is tested and the power density of the system is determined to be 2. 738 e- 2 W/cm 3. The non-linear harvester was tested at acceleration level of 1 g and it was determined that the harvester worked best at natural frequency of 8. 66 Hz. The <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> was 38. 1 mW. The non-linear type of harvester is easy to assemble and optimize to match ambient natural frequency of numerous vibrating systems. Two frequency tuning methods are looked at for the non-linear energy harvesting system. One is by changing the magnetic air gap and the second is by changing the thickness of the stationary top and bottom magnets. It is determined that changing magnetic air gap is more effective at tuning for a range of natural frequencies. For applications where the natural frequency of the system doesn't exist, such as buoys and beacons at sea, the linear energy harvester works best. For applications where the system vibrates at a certain natural frequency, the non-linear harvester should be used. Finally, this thesis is concluded with a discussion on the electromagnetic micro-harvester and some suggestions for further research on how to optimize and extend the functionality of the energy harvesting system...|$|E
40|$|Four {{possible}} causes {{for the failure}} of the Mtera-Kidatu Reservoir System within the Rufiji River Basin in Tanzania in the early 1990 s were investigated. These were sudden decrease in inflows, sudden increase in losses, sudden increase in hydropower generation, and unnecessary spills; or a combination of these, and it was found out that unaccounted for and unnecessary spillage was the main cause. This paper proposes that consideration of the flows that are generated within the intervening catchment (i. e. catchment between Mtera and Kidatu) and the operational policy that <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> is <b>produced</b> at Kidatu most of the time must be the core in the management of the reservoir system. If this {{was the case in the}} past then the Mtera Reservoir should not have gone dry in the 1991 - 1994 period. The validity of this assertion was tested with the TALSIM 2. 0 model and an efficiency of 95 % was achieved, indicating a very good correlation with the investigative techniques employed in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} and {{insufficient}} catalytic activity of carbon-supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts {{are two main}} problems in the commercial deployment of microbial fuel cell (MFC). In an effort to address these barriers, three carbon-supported Pt-Ni alloy electrocatalysts with varying Pt:Ni atom ratios (Pt 3 -Ni/C, Pt 2 -Ni/C, Pt-Ni/C) were prepared by simple NaBH 4 reduction in glycerol at room temperature. All of the prepared Pt-Ni alloy nanoparticles (NPs) are highly dispersed on a carbon support and show a single-phase face-centered cubic structure with a particle size of 2. 4 - 3. 0 nm. The electrocatalytic performances of the synthesized Pt-Ni alloy catalysts were {{compared with that of}} commercial Pt/C by cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry; among these NPs, the Pt 2 -Ni/C catalyst exhibits the highest activity for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0. 1 M HClO 4. As the cathode catalyst, the <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> density <b>produced</b> from MFC with Pt 2 -Ni/C (1724 mW m- 2) was 22 % higher than that with commercial Pt/C (1413 mW m-...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{wind power}} {{has become an}} {{important}} and growing part of the electrical energy supply in many countries all over the world. Wind turbines are {{the main components of}} wind power stations and every single development on these turbines affects the market. Latest developments in wind turbine technologies caused to decrease in costs, thus, besides high-wind-speed regions, low-wind-speed regions are taken into account as a feasible option to generate electricity. The present work investigates the feasibility of a wind power station located in a low rated wind speed region of Turkey providing a general approach for selection of the suitable wind turbine. Economic analysis was performed by calculating the key financial figures such as net present value (NPV), basic payback period (BPP) and the internal rate of return (IRR) for five various options and hourly mean, monthly and seasonal power productions are simulated for the most feasible option using the wind speed measurements in the region. Results show {{that it is possible to}} obtain a reasonable capacity factor in low rated wind speed regions with wind turbines that have larger rotors. Although the average wind speed is low in the examined region, a wind power station is still found to be feasible. According to the simulation results, <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> is <b>produced</b> during the evening hours on a daily basis and during the summer months on a seasonal basis, ensuring power flow usually when <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> consumption levels are reached.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The {{mechanism}} of continuously chlorinated silver-silver chloride electrode performance was studied {{by using a}} wiped, rotating, partially submerged, cylindrical silver cathode. The cell performance using a zinc anode was measured, {{and the rate of}} chlorination of silver was calculated for several water saturated chlorine atmospheres. At 75 °F, with a chlorine partial pressure of 1. 00 atm and a rotation speed of 1. 36 RPS, a current density of over 100 ma/cm², based on the 13. 74 cm² submerged cathode area, was observed when the cathode polarization was 0. 19 volts (versus a silver-silver chloride reference electrode). The <b>maximum</b> <b>power</b> density <b>produced</b> was 32 milliwatts/cm² at a current density of 70 ma/cm² under the above operating conditions. The chlorination of silver followed the linear growth equation w = 1. 80 x 10 ⁻⁷ + 6. 65 x 10 ⁻⁷ t, (where w is the weight of chloride formed in g-atoms/cm², and t is exposure time in seconds) during exposures of 0. 2 to 2. 0 seconds in a 1. 00 atm water saturated chlorine atmosphere. At lower chlorine partial pressures, the growth of the chloride film was found to follow logarithmic growth equations of the form w = K₁ + K₂ 1 n t...|$|R

Since the available dynamometer systems in the market are limited to specific applications that require for the customization, their price normally very expensive. Since the current study on the RPE required a dynamometer unit, therefore, a new and cheaper dynamometer prototype that was suitable for RPE application has been developed. Using air as RPE working fluid, a case study {{has been carried out}} to measure its performance at different inlet fluid conditions, i. e., within 20 °C– 140 °C and 3 – 5 bars. The results observed that the performance of RPE was proportionally increased to the increased of inlet fluid pressure and temperature. The <b>maximum</b> brake <b>power</b> <b>produced</b> was 27 Watt when the RPE operated at 140 °C, 5 bars and the speed of 820 rpm. It also revealed that the changes in the pressure of inlet fluid can give significant change on the performance of the RPE due to its direct relation to the RPE actual rotating force. Although the RPE and dynamometer seem good being adapted to each other, both of them require some improvements to ensure both systems well operated and reliable...|$|R
