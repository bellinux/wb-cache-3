5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A <b>married</b> <b>woman</b> had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men had considerable latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a <b>married</b> <b>woman</b> could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{theoretically}} and empirically whether the commute times of <b>married</b> <b>women</b> follow a backward-bending pattern with respect to wage rates. The existing literature has shown that <b>married</b> <b>women</b> tend to choose short commutes because of their relatively low wages combined with comparatively heavy household responsibilities. However, a workleisure model, which includes the simultaneous decision wives take regarding commute times and wage rates, suggests that <b>married</b> <b>women</b> employed in highly paid positions also undertake short commutes, while <b>married</b> <b>women</b> with wage rates in the middle range choose long commutes. These results suggest that the commute times of <b>married</b> <b>women</b> display a backward-bending pattern. Applying an instrumental variable strategy that accounts for the endogeneity of wage rates, the empirical results for employed <b>married</b> <b>women</b> in Japan appear to support this nding. Moreover, one of our results suggests that highly paid <b>married</b> <b>women</b> can still secure greater leisure time with short commutes, despite retaining a heavy load of domestic responsibilities.

He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show how he could help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853.

These imbalances are {{measured in terms of}} sex ratios. These predictions follow from a competitive marriage market model that views women as suppliers of wife-services, recognizes that the sex ratio of marriage eligibles affects intra-marriage transfers and value of time, and models the labor supply of <b>married</b> <b>women</b> as an inverse function of a value of time conditioned by marriage market conditions (assuming a preference for avoiding work). The empirical analysis uses time series for 4 U. S. regions to test whether fluctuations in the sex ratio help explain changes in women’s labor force participation.
