That spirit of Christ by which we are guided is not changeable, so as once to command us from a thing as evil and again to move unto it; and we do certainly know, and so testify to the world, {{that the spirit of}} Christ, which leads us into all Truth, will never <b>move</b> <b>us</b> to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.|$|E
25|$|The Model {{is divided}} into three sections. In the first Scott defines poetry, making his debts to earlier theorists clear: All antiquity, {{following}} their great leader Aristotle, have defined poetry to be an art of imitation, or an instrument of reason, that consists in laying down the rules and way how in style to feign or represent things, with delight to teach to <b>move</b> <b>us</b> to good; as if one should say with the lyric Simonides (after whom Sir Philip Sidney saith) the poem is a speaking or wordish picture' (Cambridge edition, p. 6). Scott then discusses the 'genus' (matter), difference' (form) and 'end' of poetry in turn, dealing with such questions as the source of poetic inspiration, and the temperament required of the poet.|$|E
25|$|Interstate 795 {{began in}} 2007 as a {{renumbering}} of the US 117 freeway. Since oversized trucks couldn't use US 117 the state {{decided to get}} the road approved for Interstate designation. On September 28, 2007 AASHTO decided to approve the I-795 designation. The state quickly began to renumber mile posts, update signs and <b>move</b> <b>US</b> 117 back to its original designation. In 2008 major flaws in {{the surface of the}} highway began to develop. The thin road surface had begun to deteriorate mainly because of heavy truck use. The pavement was found to have flaws along the entire route and the FHWA decided that the highway should be resurfaced adding an extra 2.5 to 3 inches to the surface. The project of resurfacing the road was completed in 2010 and was later awarded the Sheldon G. Hayes Award for the best highway construction project and the smoothest road of 2011.|$|E

500|$|By the 1990s, many {{traffic lights}} along the segment of US 1 in West Windsor and Plainsboro were removed and {{replaced}} with exit ramps and overpasses. [...] As a result, the traffic lights at Scudders Mill Road, Plainsboro Road, Alexander Road, and Meadow Road were eliminated. This was followed by building ramps to replace the traffic light at US 130 and US 1 located North Brunswick Township, completed in 2003. [...] An environmental impact study has been conducted by Rutgers University’s Transportation Policy Institute and Center for Negotiation and Conflict Resolution to improve US 1 through the Penns Neck area. [...] This project [...] would eliminate the Penns Neck Circle where US 1 meets Washington Road (CR 571) and <b>move</b> <b>US</b> 1 onto a new freeway alignment in the area. [...] In addition, CR 571 is planned to be realigned to intersect US 1 further to the north. In 2009, the segment of US 1 between I-287 in Edison and the Garden State Parkway in Woodbridge was rebuilt to include new ramps at several intersections and removed access {{to a couple of}} roads in a $53.9 million project that was intended to alleviate traffic and make this section safer.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} novel a [...] "big-hearted, restless story" [...] and rated it an A minus. Lisa Zeidner of The Washington Post opined that Middlesex [...] "provides not only incest à la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of close reading manically busy." [...] Tami Hoag of People concurred, writing that [...] "this feast {{of a novel}} is thrilling in the scope of its {{imagination}} and surprising in its tenderness". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon agreed, praising Middlesex as an [...] "epic and wondrous" [...] novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised Middlesex for its [...] "dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary." [...] However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful {{with the story of}} the Greek immigrants, which he described as [...] "authenti", but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as [...] "unpersuasiv". The Economist review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of hermaphroditism would have made the book more [...] "fun to read". Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly praised Eugenides' portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that [...] "t's difficult to imagine any serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender." [...] Paul Quinn of Contemporary Literary Criticism commended the novel, writing: [...] "That Eugenides manages to <b>move</b> <b>us</b> without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation." [...] Christina McCarroll of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that [...] "Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Public Identity {{was written}} by Joe Casey and Justin Theroux, with art by Barry Kitson, and the three issues were {{published}} on April 28, May 5, and May 12, 2010, respectively. Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Iron Man 2, was able to show Casey [...] "a fairly finalized script" [...] before the two began work on the tie-in. In May 2010, Alejandro Arbona, who oversaw {{the creation of the}} comic, explained that the story of the tie-ins had to come [...] "organically from the stuff that happened in Iron Man —what would happen to a man who'd just revealed his super hero identity to the world?—and it had to <b>move</b> <b>us</b> toward the stuff we knew was going to be important in Iron Man 2". In September 2010, Casey noted that writing an MCU tie-in comic required working within the boundaries of the movie continuity and Marvel Studios' plan, as well as writing the characters as portrayed in the films (the [...] "movie version of Stark has a specific attitude" [...] that Casey tried to put in the comic, for example).|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music <b>move</b> <b>us</b> and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E
