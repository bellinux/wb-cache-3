5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the Satsuma domain had become {{closer to the}} British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British <b>military</b> <b>experts,</b> usually former officers, may have been directly involved in this military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma, or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy SEALs have {{distinguished}} {{themselves as}} an individually reliable, collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force. The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs {{from all other}} military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations, as they strike from {{and return to the}} sea. SEALs (SEa, Air, Land) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate. SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions. Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected. Because of the dangers inherent in their missions, prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> to be the toughest training regime in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{military}} situation soon tested Trotsky's managerial and organization-building skills.

25|$|The {{conclusion}} of U.S. <b>military</b> <b>experts</b> interviewed by Perry {{is that the}} IDF did not target Hamas sites specifically, simply to collapse Hamas tunnels, but rather laid down a 'walking barrage' to 'crater the neighbourhood' instead of using suppressive fire to protect their forward troops, a strategy they deemed 'indefensible'.

25|$|With {{religious}} approval granted, Saudi forces launched frontal {{assaults on}} {{three of the}} main gates.

25|$|During {{the twelfth}} {{day of the}} siege, the outnumbered Rangers {{continued}} to face repeated attacks by the enemy force.

In the end the coalition forces prevailed. <b>Military</b> <b>experts</b> believed that without the air support, especially the A-10s, the Rangers would not have won the battle. Not only did the coalition forces secure the Haditha Dam complex, but they seriously reduced the fighting effectiveness of the Iraqi Armored Task Force in the Haditha area.|$|E

Although the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, and (Yugoslav-dominated) Albania had granted military support as well, Yugoslav assistance was far more substantial. However, this Yugoslav foreign adventure also came to an end with the Tito–Stalin split, as the Greek communists, expecting an overthrow of Tito, refused any assistance from his government. Without it, however, they were greatly disadvantaged and were defeated in 1949.|$|E
