Here we study the spin dynamics of ultracold alkaline-earth atoms in an optical lattice when the two exchange interactions coexist.

40|$|The morphologic {{properties}} of the magnetic networks during Carrington Rotations (CR) 1955 to 2091 (from 1999 to 2010) have been analyzed by applying the watershed algorithm to magnetograms observed by the Michelson Doppler Interferometer (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. We find that the average area of magnetic cells on the solar surface at lower latitudes (within +- 50 degree) are smaller than those at higher latitudes (beyond +- 50 degree). Statistical analysis of these data indicates that the magnetic networks are of fractal in nature, and the average fractal dimension is D_f = 1. 253 +- 0. 011. We also find that both the fractal dimension {{and the size of}} the magnetic networks are anti-correlated with the sunspot area. This is perhaps because a strong magnetic field can suppress spatially <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillation,</b> compress the boundaries of network cells, leading to smoother cell boundaries. The fractal dimension of the cell deviates that predicted from an isobar of Kolmogorov homogeneous turbulence...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a common <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillation</b> {{spanning}} multiple time series is formalized, a method for the recovery of such a signal from potentially noisy observations is proposed, and the time-varying bias properties of the recovery method are derived. The method, an extension of wavelet ridge analysis to the multivariate case, identifies the common oscillation by seeking, at each point in time, a frequency for which a bandpassed version of the signal obtains a local maximum in power. The lowest-order bias is shown to involve a quantity, termed the instantaneous curvature, which measures the strength of local quadratic modulation of the signal after demodulation by the common oscillation frequency. The bias {{can be made to}} be small if the analysis filter, or wavelet, can be chosen such that the signal's instantaneous curvature changes little over the filter time scale. An application is presented to the detection of vortex motions in a set of freely-drifting oceanographic instruments tracking the ocean currents...|$|E

40|$|A <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillation</b> in two {{or three}} {{dimensions}} can be represented as the trajectory traced out in space by a particle orbiting an ellipse, the properties of which vary as a function of time. Generalizing ideas from signal analysis, the signal variability can be described in terms of kinematic quantities, the instantaneous moments, that formalize our intuitive notions of time-varying frequency and amplitude. On the other hand, if we observed an ellipse evolving in space we would seek to describe it in terms of its physical moments, such as angular momentum, moment of inertia, etc. The main result {{of this paper is to}} show that the two sets of moments are identical. Most significantly, an essential physical quantity [...] -the circulation [...] -is the same as the product of the two most important kinematic quantities, the instantaneous frequency and the squared instantaneous amplitude. In addition to providing a rich set of geometric tools for the analysis of nonstationary oscillations {{in two or}} three dimensions, this result also has implications for the practical problem of inferring physical ellipse parameters from the trajectory of a single particle on the ellipse periphery, as is frequently encountered in the study of vortex motions...|$|E
40|$|An exact {{and general}} {{expression}} for the analytic wavelet transform of a real-valued signal is constructed, resolving the time-dependent effects of non-negligible amplitude and frequency modulation. The analytic signal is first locally {{represented as a}} <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillation,</b> demodulated by its own instantaneous frequency, and then Taylor-expanded at each point in time. The terms in this expansion, called the instantaneous modulation functions, are time-varying functions which quantify, at increasingly higher orders, the local departures of the signal from a uniform sinusoidal oscillation. Closed-form expressions for these functions are found in terms of Bell polynomials and derivatives of the signal's instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. The analytic wavelet transform is shown to depend upon {{the interaction between the}} signal's instantaneous modulation functions and frequency-domain derivatives of the wavelet, inducing a hierarchy of departures of the transform away from a perfect representation of the signal. The form of these deviation terms suggests a set of conditions for matching the wavelet properties to suit the variability of the signal, in which case our expressions simplify considerably. One may then quantify the time-varying bias associated with signal estimation via wavelet ridge analysis, and choose wavelets to minimize this bias...|$|E
40|$|SummaryNeurons {{recruited}} for local computations exhibit rhythmic activity at gamma frequencies. The amplitude {{and frequency of}} these <b>oscillations</b> are continuously <b>modulated</b> depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in vivo and in vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously <b>modulate</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly <b>modulate</b> gamma <b>oscillations</b> over a wide band of frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Singular systems (or {{singular}} spectrum) analysis (SSA) {{was originally}} proposed for noise {{reduction in the}} analysis of experimental data and is now becoming widely used to identify intermittent or <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillations</b> in geophysical and climatic time series. Progress has been hindered by a lack of effective statistical tests to discriminate between potential oscillations and anything but the simplest form of noise, that is, “white” (independent, identically distributed) noise, in which power is independent of frequency. The authors show how the basic formalism of SSA provides a natural test for <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillations</b> against an arbitrary “colored noise” null hypothesis. This test, Monte Carlo SSA, is illustrated using synthetic data in three situations: (i) where there is prior knowledge of the power-spectral characteristics of the noise, a situation expected in some laboratory and engineering applications, or when the “noise” against which the data is being tested consists of the output of an independently specified model, such as a climate model; (ii) where a simple hypothetical noise model is tested, namely, that the data consists only of white or colored noise; and (iii) where a composite hypothetical noise model is tested, assuming some deterministic components have already been found in the data, such as a trend or annual cycle, {{and it needs to be}} established whether the remainder may be attributed to noise. The authors examine two historical temperature records and show that the strength of the evidence provided by SSA for interannual and interdecadal climate oscillations in such data has been considerably overestimated. In contrast, multiple inter- and subannual oscillatory components are identified in an extended Southern Oscillation index at a high significance level. The authors explore a number of variations on the Monte Carlo SSA algorithm and note that it is readily applicable to multivariate series, covering standard empirical orthogonal functions and multichannel SSA...|$|R

40|$|Transcranial {{alternating}} current stimulation (tACS) is a promising tool for <b>modulating</b> brain <b>oscillations,</b> {{as well as}} a possible therapeutic intervention. However, the lack of conclusive evidence on whether tACS is able to effectively affect cortical activity continues to limit its application. The present study aims to address this issue by exploiting the well-known inhibitory alpha rhythm in the posterior parietal cortex during visual perception and attention orientation. Four groups of healthy volunteers were tested with a Gabor patch detection and discrimination task. All participants were tested at the baseline and selective frequencies of tACS, including Sham, 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and 25 Hz. Stimulation at 6 Hz and 10 Hz over the occipito-parietal area impaired performance in the detection task compared to the baseline.

40|$|Abstract. A {{population}} of oscillatory Hodgkin–Huxley (HH) model neurons is shown numerically to exhibit a behavior {{in which the}} introduction of excitatory synaptic coupling synchronizes and dramatically slows firing. This effect contrasts with the standard theory that recurrent synaptic excitation promotes states of rapid, sustained activity, independent of intrinsic neuronal dynamics. The observed behavior is not due to simple depolarization block nor to standard elliptic bursting, although it is related to these phenomena. We analyze this effect using a reduced model for a single, self-coupled HH oscillator. The mechanism explained here involves an extreme form of delayed bifurcation in which {{the development of a}} vortex structure through interaction of fast and slow subsystems pins trajectories near a surface that consists of unstable equilibria of a certain reduced system, in a canard-like manner. Using this vortex structure, a new passage time calculation is used to approximate the interspike time interval. We also consider how changes in the synaptic opening rate can <b>modulate</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequency and can lead to a related scenario through which bursting may occur for the HH equations as the synaptic opening rate is reduced...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservative}} and dissipative dynamics of a two-degree-of-freedom system {{composed of a}} grounded linear oscillator coupled to a lightweight mass by means of both strongly nonlinear and linear negative stiffnesses is investigated. Numerical studies are presented aiming to assess the influence of this combined coupling on the transient dynamics. In particular, these studies are focused on passive nonlinear targeted energy transfer from the impulsively excited linear oscillator to the nonlinear bistable lightweight attachment. It is shown that the main feature of the proposed configuration {{is the ability of}} assuring broadband efficient energy transfer over a broad range of input energy. Due to the bistability of the attachment, such favorable behavior is triggered by different nonlinear dynamic mechanisms depending on the energy level. For high energy levels, strongly <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillations</b> occur, and the dynamics is governed by fundamental (1 : 1) and superharmonic (1 : 3) resonances; for low energy levels, chaotic cross-well oscillations of the nonlinear attachment as well as subharmonic resonances lead to strong energy exchanges between the two oscillators.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{multiple}} scales {{and the related}} method of averaging are commonly used to study slowly <b>modulated</b> <b>oscillations.</b> If the system of interest is a slightly perturbed harmonic oscillator, then these techniques can be applied easily. If the unperturbed system is strongly nonlinear (though possibly conservative), then these methods can run into difficulties due to the impossibility of carrying out required analytical operations in closed form. In this paper, we abandon the requirement of closed form analytical treatment at all stages. Instead, Galerkin projections are used to obtain approximate realizations of the method of multiple scales. This paper adapts recent work using similar ideas for approximate realizations of the method of averaging. A key contribution of the present work is in the systematic identification and removal of secular terms in the general nonlinear case, a procedure that is more difficult than for the perturbed harmonic oscillator case, and that is unnecessary for averaging.

Conventionally these signals quasi-annual and semi-annual signals are modeled by least-squares fitting harmonic terms with a constant amplitude and phase. In reality, however, such seasonal signals are modulated, i. e., {{they will have a}} time-variable amplitude and phase. Recently, Davis et al. (2012) proposed a Kalman filter based approach to capture the stochastic seasonal behavior of geodetic time series. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is a non-parametric method, which uses time domain data to extract information from short and noisy time series without a priori knowledge of the dynamics affecting the time series. A prominent benefit is that trends obtained in this way are not necessarily linear. Further, true oscillations can be amplitude and phase modulated. In this work, we will assess the value of SSA for extracting time-variable seasonal signals from GPS time series. We compare our SSA-based results to those obtained using 1) least-squares analysis and 2) Kalman filtering.
