The striking morphological similarities {{of the eyes}} of Waptia fieldensis to that of extant mysid shrimp <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> likely that they were capable of producing true visual images or were at least sensitive to motion. A median eye may have also been present. Nervous tissue, including a putative brain, has been identified.|$|E
5|$|The {{defenders}} {{expected the}} German and Ottoman attack {{to be one}} of containment against their prepared line of defence, and an all-out attack on the right south of Katib Gannit. They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for them to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was totally committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E

25|$|The Government {{does not}} permit non-Muslim clergy to enter {{the country for the}} purpose of {{conducting}} religious services, although some come under other auspices and perform religious functions in secret.

25|$|There {{are large}} variety of {{habitats}} inhabited by Australian frogs. Variations in rainfall, temperature, altitude and latitude {{have resulted in}} a large number of habitats in Australia, most of which are inhabited by frogs. In the Nullarbor Plain, daytime temperatures can reach 48.5°C nights can have freezing condition and rainfall is less than 200mm per year. These factors <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for frogs to survive, and few species are found in this area.|$|E

It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} {{are not merely}} external, but a core aspect of military life. Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers. The physical separation and differences between available activities <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult. Most military brats {{on a personal level}} do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.|$|E
25|$|This large {{rainforest}} {{region is}} irrigated by several large rivers and is sparsely populated. The area has 57% {{of the territory}} of the nation and most of its mineral resources. It has been heavily exploited, but much natural diversity remains. The Rio Coco is the largest river in Central America; it forms the border with Honduras. The Caribbean coastline is much more sinuous than its generally straight Pacific counterpart; lagoons and deltas <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> irregular.|$|E

25|$|The Harbach Round Barn is {{an example}} of a {{noteworthy}} design variation within round barn design, specifically because of its specially braced roof. It is not entirely unique; its cupola and roof <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> similar to the Fehr Round Barn. The main difference in the Fehr and Harbach Round Barns is the Harbach's lack of a central storage silo. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E
25|$|Fairfax County's average {{weekly wage}} {{during the first}} quarter of 2005 was $1,181, which is 52% more than the {{national}} average. By comparison, the average weekly wage was $1,286 for Arlington – the Washington metropolitan area's highest – $1,277 for Washington, D.C., and $775 for the United States as a whole. The types of jobs available in the area <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> attractive to highly educated workers. The relatively high wages may be partially due to the area's high cost of living.|$|E
25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E

25|$|The UK's {{reluctance}} {{to join the}} Schengen Area, through concerns over loss of independent border controls, is usually cited {{as the reason for}} not joining. Britain argued that, for an island, frontier controls are a better and less intrusive way to prevent illegal immigration than other measures, such as identity cards, residence permits, and registration with the police. Consequent difficulties for Ireland, given its location and shared border with the United Kingdom (at which border points would have to be set up), would then <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for Ireland to join without the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The strength, hardness, and {{flexibility}} of copper <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> {{easy to work}} with. Copper wiring can be installed simply and easily with no special tools, washers, pigtails, or joint compounds. Its flexibility {{makes it easy to}} join, while its hardness helps keep connections securely in place. It has good strength for pulling wire through tight places (“pull-through”), including conduits. It can be bent or twisted easily without breaking. It can be stripped and terminated during installation or service with far less danger of nicks or breaks. And it can be connected without the use of special lugs and fittings. The combination of all of these factors makes it easy for electricians to install copper wire.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of {{direct and indirect}} deaths from malnutrition caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices is estimated by the World Health Organisation to lead to 860,000 deaths per year in children under five years of age. The multiple interdependencies between malnutrition and infectious diseases <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to quantify the portion of malnutrition that is caused by infectious diseases which are in turn caused by unsafe WASH practices. Based on expert opinions and a literature survey, researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections {{as a result of}} unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, Jupiter-sized {{bodies that}} orbit {{too close to}} the {{habitable}} zone but not in it (as in 47 Ursae Majoris), or have a highly elliptical orbit that crosses the habitable zone (like 16 Cygni B) <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult for an independent Earth-like planet to exist in the system. See the discussion of a stable habitable zone above. However, during the process of migrating into a habitable zone, a Jupiter-size planet may capture a terrestrial planet as a moon. Even if such a planet is initially loosely bound and following a strongly inclined orbit, gravitational interactions with the star can stabilize the new moon into a close, circular orbit that is coplanar with the planet's orbit around the star.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> hard to copy.|$|E
25|$|A tectonic {{earthquake}} begins by an initial rupture {{at a point}} on the fault surface, {{a process known as}} nucleation. The scale of the nucleation zone is uncertain, with some evidence, such as the rupture dimensions of the smallest earthquakes, suggesting that it is smaller than 100 m while other evidence, such as a slow component revealed by low-frequency spectra of some earthquakes, suggest that it is larger. The possibility that the nucleation involves some sort of preparation process is supported by the observation that about 40% of earthquakes are preceded by foreshocks. Once the rupture has initiated, it begins to propagate along the fault surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood, partly because it is difficult to recreate the high sliding velocities in a laboratory. Also the effects of strong ground motion <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>very</b> difficult to record information close to a nucleation zone.|$|E
