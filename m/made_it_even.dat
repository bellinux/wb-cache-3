5|$|Newton Heath LYR Football Club {{was also}} founded as a cricket club, and the North Road ground {{was used by}} both {{branches}} of the club. However, the cricket and football seasons often overlapped, causing conflicts between the two sports. The ground was barely adequate for football, despite {{the best efforts of}} groundsmen Charlie and Ned Massey, but its use in the winter <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> less suitable for cricket in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
25|$|Lee Siegel from Harper's {{felt that}} most critics responded {{mainly to the}} {{marketing}} campaign and {{did not address the}} film on its own terms. Others felt that American censorship took an esoteric film and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> harder to understand.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in the 1960s, the car {{gained a}} {{following}} with hot rodders, {{as well as}} among drag racers. The 75 in wheelbase <b>made</b> <b>it</b> attractive, <b>even</b> compared to the Anglia.|$|R
50|$|One {{common use}} of AnywhereTS is {{recycling}} old computers into thin clients. The modest hardware requirements (Pentium II with 32 MB RAM) have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> possible <b>even</b> for many organizations {{in developing countries}} to convert PCs to thin clients.|$|R
50|$|The Pro Nites saw biggies like Karsh Kale, Backstratblues, perform live. The English Nite saw famous band ‘Monuments’ perform. The Hindi Nite {{was full}} of fun with Vishal-Shekhar and Priyanka Chopra joined them which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> an <b>even</b> ecstatic nite.|$|R
25|$|When bison populations {{collapsed}} in the mid-19th century, Aboriginal groups that relied on the bison had {{to find new ways}} to support themselves. In the 20th century, the Canadian government's conservationist policies that restricted hunting and requisitioned land to turn into national parks <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more difficult for Aboriginals to remain self-sufficient. Ultimately, it was not as difficult for Aboriginal groups to maintain self-sufficiency compared to the alternative of continuing their hunting practices, as Canadian bison would go extinct.|$|E
25|$|However, {{like the}} No 1, the No 2 {{required}} a special detonator that {{was similar to}} the one used in the No 1. This <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to get adequate supplies of the No 2 to the troops and further tied up supplies. Arguably, the No 2 made the grenade problem worse for the British, as there had to be separate detonators for the No 1 and No 2 that could only be made by a small group of firms.|$|E
25|$|A nuclear renaissance is {{possible}} but cannot occur overnight. Nuclear projects face significant hurdles, including extended construction periods and related risks, long licensing processes and manpower shortages, plus long‐standing {{issues related to}} waste disposal, proliferation and local opposition. The financing of new nuclear power plants, especially in liberalized markets, has always been difficult and the financial crisis seems almost certain to have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more so. The huge capital requirements, combined with risks of cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties, make investors and lenders very cautious, even when demand growth is robust.|$|E
50|$|However, Mike Newmark {{writing for}} PopMatters was {{critical}} of the album's length, and felt that the music's ambient nature <b>made</b> <b>it</b> seem <b>even</b> longer. Newmark also felt that the sound of Pinhas' guitar and Merzbow's noise was dated and no longer innovative.|$|R
5000|$|On August 16, 2007, the Arab American Institute {{issued a}} {{statement}} that said [...] "The threats were both intimidating and frightening - {{and the fact that}} the defendant was a 20-year career officer at the Department of State <b>made</b> <b>it</b> of <b>even</b> greater concern." ...|$|R
60|$|The tone {{in which}} she said those words <b>made</b> <b>it</b> impossible, <b>even</b> for old Mr. Ablewhite, to mistake her any longer. His {{thermometer}} went up another degree, and his voice when he next spoke, ceased to be the voice which is appropriate to a notoriously good-natured man.|$|R
25|$|Poet William Cullen Bryant {{similarly}} {{used his}} art to glorify the Catskills, helping to create {{interest in the}} region as a tourist destination. Steamboat service up the Hudson, and later the railroads, <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more accessible from New York City. Charles Beach took over a failing Catskill Mountain House in 1846 and turned it into one of mid-19th century America's most exclusive resorts, visited by presidents and other dignitaries. Guests explored the area, following paths and trails that still exist, to visit Kaaterskill Falls and other scenic spots.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the first}} {{examination}} for her tragedy class, {{she tried to}} straighten her abundance of frizzy hair, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more uncontrollable, and came down with a bad cold, which made her voice so nasal that she hardly recognized it. Furthermore, the parts assigned for her perform were classical and required carefully stylized emotions, while she preferred romanticism and fully and naturally expressing her emotions. The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet. Doucet recommended her to Edouard Thierry, the chief administrator of the Théâtre Français, who offered Bernhardt a place as a pensionnaire at the theater, at a minimum salary.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Final {{against the}} Sydney Roosters {{was always going}} to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime to triumph 16-13. This victory saw desperate Bulldogs defence absorb much {{punishment}} and keep the Roosters scoreless for the entire second half. It was a sweet result for the Bulldogs after enduring a number of nightmare seasons on and off the field. It showed the great character in the club and the values that can't be bought or manufactured. To defeat the Roosters <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> sweeter considering the rivalry and backgrounds of both clubs. Matt Utai scored two tries with Hazem El Masri also scoring. Willie Mason was named Clive Churchill Medal Winner. Stand-in captain Andrew Ryan, who ultimately make the winning tackle, stopping Roosters forward Michael Crocker from scoring the final seconds of the match.|$|E
25|$|As {{happened}} on the first Cascade Tunnel, too little compensation for tunnel gradient was <b>made.</b> <b>It</b> is worthwhile <b>even</b> in hindsight to consider how else the problem might have been addressed.|$|R
50|$|The Sidecar was {{developed}} by Commodore Germany, as was all of the Commodore PC-architecture based development. It was relatively expensive and it required a non-trivial amount of desktop space compared to the Amiga 1000 by itself. The device was also taller than the Amiga 1000, which <b>made</b> <b>it</b> seem <b>even</b> more aesthetically disconnected from the main system.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the temple}} is very ancient one but {{from time to}} time renovations and repairs and {{additions}} have been made to the temple. So it is in a very sound position.The temple has about 246 inscriptions which amply show that over the centuries, the temple was extended, renovated, rebuilt and additions were <b>made</b> to <b>it.</b> <b>Even</b> today the construction work is continuing.|$|R
25|$|Many of {{the natural}} {{resources}} in the Salween basin remained unexploited until the twentieth century as well. Prior to extensive logging activity in the upper watershed, the Salween's flow varied much less between the rainy and dry seasons, allowing for fertile riverbanks fed by soil deposits from the river. With the clear-cutting of the forests during the 20th century, specifically in 1997, soil began to erode away in great amounts and was unable to hold water, thus lowering the river's baseflow during the dry season and causing floods of greater size during the monsoon. The erosion has also made the Salween very silty. The construction of logging roads <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> easier for Burmese interests to enter the area, exploiting other resources and severely damaging the native way of life. Although strict limitations have been imposed on logging, illegal practices continue, including one in 2009 involving the discovery of teak logs floating in the river on the Thailand-Burma border.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} {{was first}} known as Timothyberg, {{in the vernacular}} of the early Dutch settlers of the Catskills. The area was first settled in the 1780s. Its location near the creeks and valleys made it ideal for barkpeeling, the first major industry of the Catskills. Bark from the many eastern hemlocks on its slopes was {{a rich source of}} tannin, and leather hides were often brought to the region to be tanned. The creek valley made it possible to easily transport them to and from the Hudson River at Kingston to the east, and the later development of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad (UDRR) <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> easier. The road up {{the south side of the}} mountain, which forest historian Michael Kudish calls the best example of an extant bark road in the Catskills, was built for this purpose. By the end of the century, since a synthetic process for creating tannin had made it less necessary to harvest large acres of forest, it was being used for quarrying instead.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the ongoing Darfur conflict in Sudan, the AU has deployed 7,000 peacekeepers, many from Rwanda and Nigeria, to Darfur. While a donor's conference in Addis Ababa in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, in July 2006 the AU said it would pull {{out at the end}} of September when its mandate expires. Critics of the AU peacekeepers, including Dr. Eric Reeves, have said these forces are largely ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring an area roughly the size of France has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June 2006, the United States Congress appropriated US$173million for the AU force. Some, such as the Genocide Intervention Network, have called for UN or NATO intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN has considered deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country until at least October 2007. The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission was set to expire on 31 December 2006 but was extended to 30 June 2007 and merged with the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur in October 2007. In July 2009 the African Union ceased cooperation with the International Criminal Court, refusing to recognise the international arrest warrant it had issued against Sudan's leader, Omar al-Bashir, who was indicted in 2008 for war crimes.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} Rings of Power, the One was unadorned. It bore only the {{inscription}} of the incantation Sauron spoke when he <b>made</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>even</b> that was invisible unless the ring was heated. Though the other rings could be destroyed in dragon-fire, the One could be unmade {{only in the}} unyielding fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.|$|R

2500|$|American {{football}} {{resulted from}} several major divergences from rugby from 1869 onwards, {{most notably the}} rule changes instituted by Walter Camp, considered the [...] "Father of American Football". Among these important changes were {{the introduction of the}} line of scrimmage and of down-and-distance rules. Later developments such as the forward pass, and professionalism in American football <b>made</b> <b>it</b> diverge <b>even</b> further from its rugby origins.|$|R
25|$|When Haeckel was {{a student}} in the 1850s he showed great {{interest}} in embryology, attending the rather unpopular lectures twice and in his notes sketched the visual aids: textbooks had few illustrations, and large format plates were used to show students how to see the tiny forms under a reflecting microscope, with the translucent tissues seen against a black background. Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer's opposing view, stated in von Baer's laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von Kölliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.|$|E
500|$|Many {{critics were}} {{extremely}} {{pleased with the}} call back to the teapot and Jim's note from [...] "Christmas Party". Adams felt that the scene, before the reveal of the note, was properly executed, and that the note <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> better. Sepinwall called it [...] "a fabulous payoff for longtime fans". Cornet called the sequence [...] "effective". Rick Porter of Zap2it wrote {{that it was a}} [...] "nice move" [...] {{on the part of the}} writers for [...] "not letting us know what Jim wrote on the card from 'Christmas Party' [...] it has to be pretty epic." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1935, McCracken {{returned}} to Philadelphia to join Littlefield's new ballet company, the Littlefield Ballet (later {{known as the}} Philadelphia Ballet). When the ballet company made its official debut in November 1935, McCracken was one of its principal soloists. [...] In 1937, she went on a European tour with the company, in {{what was the first}} tour of an American ballet company in Europe. This put a strain on her health. McCracken was recently diagnosed with type I diabetes (then known as [...] "juvenile diabetes"), which was difficult to treat with the medical technology at the time, and the European tour <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> harder for her to stay in compliance with her treatment regimen. McCracken kept her diabetes a secret throughout her life to prevent damage to her career. The disease made her prone to fainting spells, sometimes during performances, and led to medical complications later in her life.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2013 summer, he had {{offers from}} English side Tottenham Hotspur and Italian club Napoli. He {{was close to}} join the Italian side, but the deal fell through because [...] "sponsorship {{contracts}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> impossible". <b>Even</b> though the club bought Gonzalo Higuaín after failing to land the Brazilian striker, Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis later stated that Rafa Benítez wanted Damião instead of Higuaín.|$|R

500|$|At {{the same}} time as he sought to reform the coinage, Sherman worked for [...] "resumption"—the policy of {{resuming}} specie payment on all bank notes, including the greenbacks. The idea of withdrawing the greenbacks from circulation altogether had been tried and quickly rejected in 1866; the notes were, as Sherman said, [...] "a great favorite of the people". The economic turmoil of the Panic of 1873 <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> more clear that shrinking the money supply would be harmful to the average American. Still, Sherman (and others) desired an eventual return to a single circulating medium: gold. As he said in an 1874 speech, [...] "a specie standard is the best and the only true standard of all values, recognized as such by all civilized nations of our generation". If greenbacks were not to be withdrawn from circulation, therefore, they must be made equal to the gold dollar.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Bell's {{influence}} on Anna, director Chris Buck said her personality {{was just so}} fun and energetic. [...] "We had an Anna character but Kristen really came in and pushed it and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> funnier and even sweeter I think, and more believable as a three-dimensional character," [...] he said. He also admitted that he [...] "fell in love with 's voice and 's spirit". Director Jennifer Lee said that she loved Bell because the actress shared a similarity with her, that girls could be funny. [...] "So she was a fantastic collaborator," [...] Lee added. [...] Songwriting duo Kristen-Anderson Lopez and Robert Lopez later commented that they had written a lot of first songs for Kristen, for Anna but, [...] "The more we were working with Kristen Bell, the more, the more she influenced." [...] They quickly understand who Anna was because Anna's Kristen Bell.|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>even</b> easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit {{and the next thing you}} knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea for the first time on any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E
