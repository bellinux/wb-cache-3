[...] This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. [...] The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [...] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great deal <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> comprehended. [...] Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity {{one way or the}} other. [...] She was, as [...] Mr. [...] Giarritano put it , [...] "diffused" [...] -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. [...] That had {{as much to do with}} {{her original}} use of drugs [...] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women. [...] Were she so simple as the lesbians wished her to be or so free as her associates imagined! ...|$|E

I wonder if anything told his mind that I, a girl whom he had never seen, was really on the ship and in danger? Perhaps--at any rate, he came, and the odd thing is that from the moment I saw him, and especially from the moment I heard his voice, I felt as though I had known him all my life.

The chief advantage of a diary is that one may indulge in the luxury of telling the actual truth.

60|$|MY DEAR AND KIND WEG,--It was {{a lesson}} in {{philosophy}} that would have moved a bear, to receive your letter in my present temper. For I am now well and well at my ease, both by comparison. First, my health has turned a corner; it was not consumption this time, though consumption {{it has to be}} some time, as all my kind friends sing to me, day in, day out. Consumption! how I hate that word; yet it can sound innocent, as, e.g., consumption of military stores. What was wrong with me, apart from colds and little pleuritic flea-bites, was a lingering malaria; and that is now greatly overcome, I eat once more, which is a great amusement and, they say, good for the health. Second, many of the thunderclouds that were overhanging me when last I wrote, have silently stolen away like Longfellow's Arabs: and I am now engaged to be married to the woman whom I have loved for three years and a half. I do not yet know when the marriage can come off; for there are many reasons for delay. But as few people before marriage have known each other so long or made more trials of each other's tenderness and constancy, I permit myself to hope some quiet at the end of all. At least I will boast myself so far; I do not think many wives are better loved than mine will be. Third and last, in the order of what has changed my feelings, my people have cast me off, and so that thundercloud, as you may almost say, has overblown. You know <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> whether or not I loved my father.[27] These things are sad; nor can any man forgive himself for bringing them about; yet they are easier to meet in fact than by anticipation. I almost trembled whether I was doing right, until I was fairly summoned; then, when I found that I was not shaken one jot, that I could grieve, that I could sharply blame myself, for the past, and yet never hesitate one second as to my conduct in the future, I believed my cause was just and I leave it with the Lord. I certainly look for no reward, nor any abiding city either here or hereafter, but I please myself with hoping that my father will not always think so badly of my conduct nor so very slightingly of my affection as he does at present.|$|E
