2500|$|The Series II Land Rover {{launched}} in 1958 was larger, heavier {{and more complex}} than the original, and there was an ever-present need for higher powered engines. Also, the Rover petrol engines in use at the time, with the archaic Inlet-Over-Exhaust valve layout and were approaching the age of 20 years in design terms. A new, larger petrol engine specifically developed for the Land Rover was needed. The existing 2-litre diesel engine was used as a basis, but with a radically changed internal structure. The new engine was a ‘dry-liner' type, and a wider bore was used to improve low-speed torque output. Despite the numerous changes the petrol engine could use the same <b>machining</b> <b>line</b> as the diesel, establishing a design commonly used between Land Rover's petrol and diesel engines that would survive for decades. The 2.25-litre petrol was the most popular engine option right up to the mid-1980s and established a worldwide reputation for reliability and longevity. The engine's relatively low compression ratio [...] and general strong design made it tolerant of poor quality fuel and oil as well as infrequent servicing. With proper maintenance these engines can easily survive more than 250,000 miles of service. This was partly due to the commonality between petrol and diesel versions making the petrol version somewhat over-engineered for the job; they retained the extraordinary strength characteristics of the diesel while being much less stressed. The only major change to the design was the fitting of a 5-bearing crankshaft in 1980, which improved bottom-end strength and refinement. Despite its utilitarian origins, the 2.25-litre petrol is a quiet, smooth-running engine, and this enabled Rover to fit it to their P4 saloon car as the Rover 80. Various power outputs were available for this engine depending on the compression ratio and the amount of emissions regulation equipment fitted.|$|E

50|$|The engine {{manufacturing}} process started when cylinder blocks arrived {{from one of}} the supplying foundries, one of which was Morris's own. After being inspected, pickled, washed and dried, the blocks were placed on a hand-transfer <b>machining</b> <b>line</b> that carried out 53 operations in turn.

A second automated transfer machine, for the production of flywheels, was also set up in 1924. These machines were something Morris Engines Ltd. were justifiably proud of and they encouraged the public to see the process. American engineers judged the production systems to be 20 years ahead of their time.|$|E

40|$|URL] audienceWe study {{a problem}} {{related to the}} optimal design of a <b>machining</b> <b>line.</b> This type of line is used for a mass {{production}} of a single type of product. To produce an item of this product a given set of operations has to be performed. The line is a sequence of workstations, whose number has to be decided, and each workstation has to be assigned a number of processing modules (blocks). Each block performs a set of operations. A set of available blocks is given. There are the same basic cost associated with each workstation and different additional {{costs associated with the}} blocks. The problem is to design a minimum cost <b>machining</b> <b>line</b> of this type. The specicity {{of the problem is that}} all operations of the blocks assigned to the same workstation are performed in parallel. Furthermore, there are inclusion, exclusion and precedence relations that restrict the assignment of blocks and operations to the same workstation and the processing order of operations on the line. We suggest two combinatorial approaches for solving this problem, which are theoretically efficient if the number of blocks assigned to the same workstation and the number of workstations are upper bounded by given constants. The first approach is to combinatorially enumerate all feasible solutions, and the second consists in reducing the problem to the well studied maximum weight clique problem. A boolean linear program based on a set packing formulation of the latter problem is presented, and computer experiments with benchmark data are described...|$|E

It is important to mention that proactive actions were established {{in order to reduce the}} time wasted during these breakdowns. Reliability centered maintenance (RCM) methodology was used through the project since it includes recommendations for redesigning equipment, areas for improvement in training or work procedures and routine inspections for potential failures. Besides, Pareto tool was also used as support for failure analysis. This tool gives support to the RCM in regards to the study of failure modes. This study was developed in the <b>machining</b> <b>line</b> that belongs to the production area at Plycem Construsistemas de Costa Rica; line in which fibre – cement material is cut to produce different presentations of: siding, playdeck, playrock, cornice moldings and skirting board. Moreover, this project was carried out due to a request from the maintenance department at Plycem since the router and molder machines are the more important ones at the <b>machining</b> <b>line</b> production because the following process takes place in them: material is placed on conveyor belts, then it is moved to the router, which cuts the entire film in small sections, then each of these sections is carried through tables doucet rollers to the molder, this equipment is responsible for making the cuts according to the presentations mentioned above. As a consequence, if either of these machines fails production in the sub area will be immediately stopped.
