30|$|The <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> {{control and}} {{hierarchical}} secondary control [12, 17] require high bandwidth communication {{and is only}} effective when the loads and sources are closely connected.

This decentralized control approach without high bandwidth communication compared to <b>master</b> <b>slave</b> control is suitable for DC MG [18]. However, it has the disadvantage of output current sharing accuracy resulted by voltage drop across line impedance [12].
