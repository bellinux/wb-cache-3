When measuring liquid pressure, a loop filled with gas or a light fluid can isolate the liquids {{to prevent them}} from mixing but this can be unnecessary, for example when mercury is used as the <b>manometer</b> <b>fluid</b> to measure differential pressure of a fluid such as water.

This moves the free end of the tube which is linked to the pointer. The instrument would be calibrated against a manometer, which would be the calibration standard. For measurement of indirect quantities of pressure per unit area, the calibration uncertainty would be dependent on the density of the <b>manometer</b> <b>fluid,</b> and the means of measuring the height difference. From this other units such as pounds per square inch could be inferred and marked on the scale.|$|E
30|$|This {{particular}} {{headspace gas}} respirometer {{is designed to}} measure the amount of oxygen consumed by the biomass {{under the assumption that}} the evolved carbon dioxide will be completely absorbed by the caustic scrubber placed in the scrubber tube within the reactor. Although these measurements usually over-simplify the actual situation as they do not consider the effect of liquid-phase pH and oxygen and carbon dioxide transfer limitations. However, there is an option of indirect estimation of carbon dioxide (approximately) generated in the biodegradation process. To perform this type of analysis, the apparatus needs to orient in a particular fashion where three types of wastewater samples with two replicas from each group are to be placed in the six CSBRs of the respirometer. One sample from each group is placed in a reactor having carbon dioxide scrubbing system while the other is placed in the second reactor without the scrubber. Then the new positions of the <b>manometer</b> <b>fluid</b> after a certain interval are recorded to find out the amount of carbon dioxide generated during the biodegradation phase.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{pressure}} was once commonly measured by {{its ability to}} displace a column of liquid in a manometer, pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., inches of water). Manometric measurement {{is the subject of}} pressure head calculations. The most common choices for a <b>manometer's</b> <b>fluid</b> are mercury (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's density allows for a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to measure a given pressure.

40|$|The metal Barcroft respirometer is an {{accurate}} and rapidly operated micro-respirometer, suitable for small insects and other animals which can be maintained in an aerial environment {{for the period of}} experiment, and is particularly suitable for experiments in which different gas mixtures are employed. It is based on the principle of the differential (Barcroft) type of manometer, but its chief advantages are its small size and construction from a solid brass block. In consequence, the temperature surroundings of the two chambers are kept uniform by the high conductivity of the metal, and gaseous diffusion is very rapid throughout. Into a solid brass block ABCD are drilled two chambers, the experimental chamber (1) being 1 cm. in diameter and 1 cm. deep, the control chamber (2) being 2 cm. in diameter and 1 - 75 cm. deep. The chambers taper at the base and are continued as fine capillaries i-o sq. mm. in cross-section (EF and GH) {{to the base of the}} block, where they terminate in small brass collars.

40|$|For {{the next}} {{generation}} Single-Stage-To-Orbit (SSTO) Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV), the use of advanced composite materials is highly desirable and {{critical to the success}} of the mission. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has been working with the aerospace industry for many years to develop and demonstrate the cryogenic composite propellant tanks and feed lines technologies. A 50. 8 -mm diameter composite feed line for the Clipper Graham (DCY. A) was developed and tested. The purpose of the program is to demonstrate the LH 2 permeability, composite to composite and metal joints, as well as composite flange interface of the composite feed line. Stress analysis and permeability testing have been performed on this article. Recently, a larger composite feed line design is being investigated and developed at MSFC for potential use in future RLV. The diameter of the feed line is 203 mm and the overall length is approximately 2. 2 meters. This one piece unlined feed line consists of three straight tubular sections joined by two 90 degree elbows. The material chosen is IM 7 / 977 - 3 prepreg fabric. The lay-up pattern is [0 / 90, plus or minus 45]s and is built up to 18 plies to the flanges at both ends. A preliminary stress analysis has been conducted to identify potential critical stresses and to develop the finite element analysis (FEA) capability of composite feed lines. As expected, the critical stresses occurred at the rims of some flange holes and the onset of the tapered tubular sections. Further analysis is required to determine the loads, flange deflection, vibration, and combined maximum loads. Two permeability-testing apparatuses were also designed for both flat panel specimens and curved feed line sections after impact damage. A larger permeant gas exposed area is required to accurately determine the effect of impact damage on the permeability of the feed line materials. The flat panel tester was fabricated and assembled. Three test coupons were made of graphite/epoxy plain weave prepreg and unidirectional prepreg. The flow rate was calculated by measuring the change of <b>manometer</b> <b>fluid</b> height per unit time. The permeability of the coupons is then calculated according to Darcy's Law. The pressure increase due to the head rise in the manometer was not considered for the initial estimation. The result of the unidirectional composite coupon agreed with that obtained from the DC-XA feed line testing of a similar material. Further improvement on the design may be required to improve the accuracy and efficiency of permeability testing...|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{method for}} {{measuring}} tissue pressures has been designed. A pressure of 250 mm. Hg is imposed on a manometer. Then {{the system is}} allowed to discharge into a needle cannula inserted in the tissue. The <b>manometer</b> forces out <b>fluid</b> (about 10 c. mm.) until the pressure within {{it is the same}} as that within the tissue. Records of the pressure changes are made. Each observation takes about a minute. The method gives results that are closely comparable with other reports of tissue pressures. With this method, the pressure in the following organs of dogs was found to be: kidney, 26 mm. Hg, cerebral cortex, 0 to 5 mm., muscle, 1 to 10 mm., spleen, S to 16 mm., subcutaneous tissue, 0 to 3 mm., and liver – 2 to 14 mm. The reliability of the method was tested on the kidneys of decerebrate dogs. Measurements were found to be the same within narrow limits over a period of an hour; they were the same when taken simultaneously in different regions of the same kidney or in opposite kidneys. They were independent of the volume of fluid forced into the tissue. Similar pressures were observed with 1 or 5 or 10 holes bored in the shaft of the cannulating needle. The intrarenal pressure was also measured by inserting a needle cannula into the tissue and then allowing the pressure to reach equilibrium passively with a manometer. This method gave similar results. The intrarenal pressure has now found to be the same when measured by three different technics...|$|R
40|$|Various {{investigators}} have applied the nitrous oxide method (1) {{to the study}} of the effects of aging, vascular sclerosis, and hypertension upon the cerebral blood flow and metabolism. Frey-han, Woodford, and Kety (2) measured the cere-bral blood flow in cases manifesting psychoses secondary to advanced cerebral arteriosclerosis. Significant reductions of cerebral blood flow and oxygen utilization were noted. Scheinberg (3) reported reduction of both cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption in patients with histories of previous cerebrovascular accidents. Greater re-ductions in these measurements were noted in pa-tients who exhibited mental aberrations secondary to cerebrovascular disease. Fazekas, Alman, and Bessman (4) found a reduction of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption in individuals above 50 years of age with no clinical evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Kety, Hafkenschiel, Jef-fers, Leopold, and Shenkin (5) demonstrated the presence of a normal cerebral blood flow and oxy-gen consumption and an elevated cerebrovascular resistance in a series of cases of essential hyperten-sion. The present investigation is an attempt to clarify and extend knowledge concerning the inter-related effects of aging, hypertension, and arterio-sclerosis upon the cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism.

40|$|In an axial compressor, it {{is common}} to find out a {{complicated}} secondary flow (three dimensional flows) which occurred on interaction area between blade boundary layer and hub/ casing boundary layer. This phenomenon to some extent can decrease the compressor pressure. It is due to disturbance generated by this secondary flow affected the flow characteristics on the interaction area. Moreover, it can create a blockage effect and secondary losses which ultimately decreases the compressor pressure. As it has been known, the axial compressor secondary losses plays major parts (50 %) on total hydraulic losses while other losses contributed to the total hydraulic losses are annulus wall friction, friction and two dimensional separations on the axial compressor blade profiles. Hence, more serious effort should be devoted to increase the axial compressor performance by reducing the secondary losses. From previous research, geometrical arrangement and cascade compressor configuration have been proved to contribute on development of the secondary flow in an axial compressor. In this paper, the authors conducted three dimension separation flow characteristic visualization in blade passage. The visualization is represented by flow visualization, velocity vector distribution, pressure coefficient distribution (Cp) and pressure losses coefficient distribution (v). The authors also investigated some parameters that affected the cascade compressor configuration performance. One of the parameter is blade camber. The experiment was conducted on blade profile of British 9 C 7 / 32, 5 C 50 and 9 C 7 / 32, 5 C 50. Those profiles are similar in their geometry but have different camber. Wind tunnel experiments have been conducted with velocity of 20 m/s (Rel = 1. 6 x 105). Flow visualization was performed by method of oil flow visualization (OFV) using a mixture compound of titanium powder and bio oil. The pressure distributions along the blades were measured using pressure transducer and inclined <b>manometer.</b> Computational <b>Fluid</b> Dynamics was employed to modeling and analyzing the velocity vector with setting parameter of 3 d-dp, segregated, RNG k-ε. By using those methods, the authors capable to visualize flow separation inside blade passage and cascade output. In the cascade configuration, blade camber with fixed load angle has a significant role for the development of three dimensional flow separation (horse shoe vortex appears) in front of the leading edge. This phenomenon was started by the appearance of forward saddle point. This forward saddle point will move if the camber angle is changed. The increasing camber angle from θ = 32. 5 o to θ = 42. 5 o shifted the forward saddle point and changed three dimension separation line width. For blade airfoil 9 C 7 / 42, 5 C 50, the position of forward saddle point is far away in front of leading edge but almost in line with blade chord line. On the other hand for blade cascade with 9 C 7 / 32, 5 C 50, the position of forward saddle point is much closer to the leading edge but far below the blade chord line. The upper shifting of the forward saddle point for blade with higher camber also pushed the low pressure area on the upper side zone further back. It also pushed the high pressure area on lower side {{in the same direction as}} the one on the upper side. This phenomenon subsequently increasing the intensity of cross passage flow at the back side of blade passage and curl flow at the trailing edge. This increasing intensity of the secondary flow near hub junction will ultimately increase the blockage effect and total pressure losses. In Bahasa Indonesia: Pada kompresor aksial, fenomena aliran sekunder tiga dimensi yang sangat rumit terjadi pada interaksi antara lapisan batas sudu dengan lapisan batas hub/casing. Akibat yang ditimbulkan fenomena ini adalah terpengaruhnya karakteristik medan aliran di daerah interaksi tersebut yang pada akhirnya berkaitan dengan efek penyumbatan (blockage effect) serta kerugian sekunder (secondary losses) yang dapat menurunkan tekanan kompresor. Kerugian sekunder diketahui menyumbang sekitar 50 % dari total kerugian hidrolis yang terjadi pada kompresor aksial, sementara kerugian akibat friksi pada dinding annulus serta kerugian friksi dan separasi dua dimensi pada profil berkontribusi 30 % dan 20 %. Dengan demikian, upaya serius untuk mengurangi kerugian aliran sekunder akan banyak membantu meningkatkan kinerja (efisiensi) kompresor aksial. Berdasarkan kajian pustaka beberapa hasil eksperimen, bentuk geometri dan susunan konfigurasi kaskade (cascade) kompresor diduga mempunyai pengaruh signifikan terhadap terbentuknya aliran sekunder. Pada penelitian ini dilakukan visualisasi karakteristik (struktur) separasi aliran tiga dimensi di dalam lorong sudu berupa visualisasi jejak aliran, distribusi vektor kecepatan, distribusi koefisien tekanan (Cp) dan distribusi koefisien kerugian tekanan (v). Parameter yang berpengaruh terhadap susunan konfigurasi kaskade adalah Perubahan kelengkungan sudu, sedangkan profil sudu yang digunakan adalah profil sudu British 9 C 7 / 32, 5 C 50 dan 9 C 7 / 42, 5 C 50 yang secara geometris mirip satu sama lain namun memiliki kelengkungan berbeda. Eksperimen dilakukan pada lorong anginh dengan kecepatan 20 m/s (Rel = 1, 6 x 105) dan visualisasi aliran dengan teknik oil flow visualization (OFV) menggunakan campuran serbuk titanium dan minyak nabati. Pengukuran tekanan menggunakan pressure transducer dan inclined <b>manometer,</b> sedangkan Computational <b>Fluid</b> Dynamics (CFD) untuk mempresentasikan vektor kecepatan aliran menggunakan perangkat lunak Fluent 6. 0, 3 d-dp, segregated, RNG k-ε. Hasil penelitian terbukti mampu memvisualisasikan separasi aliran di dalam lorong sudu maupun di keluaran kaskade. Pada susunan konfigurasi kaskade, kelengkungan sudu pada sudut pembebanan yang tetap, sangat berpengaruh terhadap formasi separasi aliran tiga dimensi (terbentuknya horse shoe vortex) di depan leading edge yang diawali dengan terbentuknya forward saddle point. Pada kaskade 9 C 7 / 42, 5 C 50 posisi forward saddle point lebih jauh di depan leading edge namun hampir segaris terhadap chord line sudu, sebaliknya untuk kaskade 9 C 7 / 32, 5 C 50 posisi forward saddle point lebih dekat terhadap leading edge tetapi lebih jauh di bawah chord line sudu. Bergesernya lokasi saddle point lebih ke atas untuk sudu yang lebih lengkung juga berakibat bergesernya daerah tekanan rendah pada zona upper side dan daerah tekanan tinggi pada zona lower side lebih ke belakang. Hal inilah yang mendorong penguatan intensitas cross passage flow pada bagian belakang blade passage dan curl flow pada trailing edge sudu. Penguatan intensitas aliran sekunder di dekat hub junction tersebut, berakibat pada menguatnya penyumbatan aliran dan kerugian tekanan total.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of cerebral malaria, {{a clinical}} syndrome {{with a high}} mortality rate despite the best available chemotherapy, is complex and imperfectly understood. Both parasite sequestration and cytokines {{have been shown to}} be important. It has been hypothesized, but not proven, that high levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha induce nitric oxide synthase, and increased nitric oxide contributes to the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria by inhibiting neurotransrnission. Objectives: To assess the role of nitric oxide in the immune response to P. falciparum and its role in the immunopathogenesis of cerebral malaria, and to look for clinical and laboratory prognostic indicators in children with cerebral malaria. Setting: Children hospitalized into wards in general. paediatric and 'p,aediatric surgery at Muhimbili Medical Centre, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Patients and study design: A prospective cross sectional case control study was done. Markers of nitric oxide production was compared in 86 children with cerebral malaria with those in 45 children with non-cerebral malaria and 41 healthy controls. Urine was collected from all these participants on isopropanol. Urinary nitrates was measured by reducing 	-~~~~. ~~~- 	-~ - ~ [...] ~ 111 nitrates to nitrites with bacterial nitrate reductase coupled with Greiss reaction. Urinary creatinine was measured using creatinine sigma diagnostic kit, and then the spot urine nitrate: creatinine ratio was computed. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained from all children with cerebral malaria and analysed for nitrates. Simple bed side clinical and laboratory prognostic indicators was assessed in 88 children with cerebral malaria. History of witnessed convulsions within 3 hrs of admission was obtained and presence of decerebration and corneal reflex was looked. Level of conciosness was assessed by Blantyre coma score. Total white blood cell count was obtained using a coulter counter, and differential count was obtained manually. The parasite count was calculated on a thick film stained with Fields A and B stain. Methaemoglobin was calculated by using the method of Evelyn and Malloy. Cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure was measured using a spinal <b>fluid</b> <b>manometer.</b> Results: Nitric oxide production correlated inversely with the severity of the disease, the levels being lowest in fatal cerebral malaria, and highest in healthy controls. There was no evidence of increased nitric oxide production in the cerebrospinal fluid. The three groups were different from each other (ANOVA; P < 0. 0001). By-multiple comparison test, patients with cerebral malaria and those with non-cerebral malaria differed from healthy controls (P < 0. 05). Furthermore, patients with cerebral malaria differed from those with non-cerebral malaria (P < 0. 05). The clinical and laboratory features associated with poor prognosis were:- witnessed convulsions, presence of decerebration, absent corneal reflex, low level of •• IV coma and increased total white blood cell count. Conclusions: It appears that nitric oxide production is not increased in cerebral malaria. Rather, it is suppressed in both cerebral and non-cerebral malaria. The production is below the baseline levels of healthy controls, suggesting that both the constitutive and inducible isoforms are suppressed. These results suggest that nitric oxide is protective rather than harmful in malaria. Five clinical and laboratory features were associated with poor prognosis as mentioned above. However, differential total white blood cell count, level of parasiternia, methaemoglobin, and raised cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure did not correlate with poor outcome. Thus early recognition of the factors for poor prognosis and good medical and nursing care may reduce mortality...|$|R
