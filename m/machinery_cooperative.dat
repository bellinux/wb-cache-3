The two-phase metaheuristic performs the optimization of resources assignment and scheduling based on a simulated annealing (SA), a genetic algorithm (GA) and a hybrid Petri nets model. The initial and progressive states of farmlands and resources, moving sequence of <b>machinery,</b> <b>cooperative</b> work, and deadlock removal have been well handled in the proposed approach. In the computational experiment, the schemes of emphasizing the resource assignment optimization, initializing {{the population of the}} GA with chromosomes sorted by the waiting time, and inheriting the priority list from tasks in the previous resources assignment improved the evolution speed and solution quality. The simulated result indicated that the formulated schedule has a high ratio of resource utilization in sugarcane production. The proposed approach also contributes a referential scheme for applying the metaheuristic approach to other crop production scheduling...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} behind farm <b>machinery</b> <b>cooperatives</b> is {{that farmers}} club together {{to share the}} cost of buying and maintaining a tractor, trailer or threshing machine. In the South, in particular, {{the high price of}} farm machinery coupled with the small size of plots mean {{that it is hard to}} recoup one s investment. More and more farmers are discovering that the cooperative system offers a way of using equipment to make labour intensive farming jobs easier and more efficient, at a fraction of the normal cost. In Benin, the first two such cooperatives were launched in 1997. Today there are 17 in just one region, Borgou-Alibori, a cotton-producing area in the northeastern part of the country, and demand for more cooperatives is growing. Compared with the classic service offered by private suppliers, these organisations guarantee a greater variety of equipment, ensuring better quality work for the farmers. They also provide access to credit from banks.

40|$|In Western European agriculture, an {{increasing}} number of conventional farmers are actively augmenting the autonomy of their farm enterprises. They do so, amongst others, through decreasing the external inputs, whilst simultaneously improving the use of internal resources. Thus, low external input farming systems emerge that increasingly enhance ecological processes. Simultaneously, the farmers involved may maintain key features of their entrepreneurial mode of farming. In this context, the network of French farm <b>machinery</b> <b>cooperatives</b> witnesses a movement of collective innovation experienced by farmer members to become more autonomous. The present paper aims at better understanding this phenomenon visible within some French farm machinery co-ops. Our methodology is based on an exploratory survey of 15 machinery co-ops and a range of six in-depth case studies among them. Our work combines a farming system and a sociological approach. Most of the studied farmers mainly seek to become more autonomous from markets, notably from input markets. A part of them also claim to gain autonomy from advisory services and regulatory institutions. The current price volatility context appears as one of several decisive factors, of many of the farmers interviewed to seek the means to become more autonomous. The collective organisation provided by the socio-technical network of farmers’ arrangements associated with their machinery co-op, has allowed them to benefit from favourable conditions under which to undertake the new practices. We conclude by suggesting some lessons from these experiences to strengthen local networks of farmers’ sharing arrangements as a conducive arena for agroecological transition...|$|R

Methods: Basic data from 199, 275 units of tractor, rice transplanter (riding type), and combine was offered by the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation and Korea Agricultural <b>Machinery</b> Industry <b>Cooperative.</b> Those agricultural machines were supplied by the government’s loan support from 2003 to 2012. Results: Recent supply of tractor is only 13, 000 units or so per annum, thereby being stagnated. Rice transplanter and combine in 2012 corresponded to 3, 810 units and 2, 490 units, respectively. The domestic market share of the imported agricultural machinery accounted for 60. 0 % in tractor, 99. 5 % in saddle rice transplanter, and 80. 9 % in combine, thereby having been sharply increased 33. 1 %p, 42. 0 %p and 53. 6 %p compared to the ones in 2003.

40|$|The {{role of the}} MTS (Maschinen-Traktoren Stationen), instituted in 1952 from MAS (Maschinen- Ausleihen Station), was not {{confined}} to giving the farm machinery service. It gained the political functions for advancing the rural socialism. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain their historical significance by analyzing 1) the formation of new rural cadres through the MTS, 2) the conflict between the MTS and farmers on the use of the maschinery, 3) the function of MTS-"instructors" for the collectivization. The site of our study is Kreis Bad Doberan in Bezirk Rostock. This county was divided into 4 MTS-districts: MTS Jennewitz, MTS Radegast, MTS Rerik, and MTS Ravensberg. 　 1) The MTS was a important apparatus for the formation of new rural communist cadres. We would focus upon three groups in the MTS; the political cadre, the agricultural technocrat, and the tractor driver. Firstly the conflict on political power within the MTS arose mainly between the MTS-director and the leader of political sections. Secondly we could find 2 paths of young agronomists for moving up the social ladder. Some became from agronomist assistants into influential "instructors". Others, mainly educated and provided by the new agricultural school system in GDR, became often the directors of new cooperatives founded in 1957 - 1961. They were different from other cadres in that they showed, even if partially, the independence as a technocrat. In contrast, few tractor drivers made a career path for the political cadre. They consisted of rural young men and showed the higher mobility than others, in which we could find the difference from industrial workers in the social behavior. However, they did not always identified themselves with the farmers, as was recognized in their consciousness against the shift drivers. 　 2) Analyzing the utilization of the MTS-machinery, we could find the difference in working process of seed cultivation, harvest and threshing, and digging the potato. While in cultivation both farmers and cooperatives did without MTS-tractors any more, we could find the village farmers taking the leadership to avail sheaf-binders harvester and thresh machines within the villages. It was most difficult to mobilize the machines and workers for potatoes and beets, which cause to damage especially cooperatives. Concerning potatoes, strong-new-farmers did not depend upon the MTS-machinery. They confined it to the grain. 　The establishment of the MTS brigade satellite center covering the 3 - 4 villages was a measure to arrange the relation between the MTS and farmers. The dissolution of MTSs and the absorption of their <b>machinery</b> into large <b>cooperative</b> type III would finally solved these problems. We could not deny that it damaged individual farmers depending upon MTS-tractors. However, tractor drivers opposed against joining the cooperatives. While some drivers left their MTS, others could take the preferential treatment in the cooperatives, which means that the conflict between the MTS and farmers became included in the new large cooperatives. 　 3) "Instructors" of a political section, a remarkable characteristic of the MTS, had the task not only to control the discipline of MTS-organ. They had a strong influence on the village politics to advance SED political power. It is worthy to notice that many "instructors" came from rural population, although firstly engaged as a employee in the MTS. Therefore we could not regard them as a strange activist. In addition, some influential "instructors" of the MTS political section employed about 1952 / 53 were engaged in the activities as "district instructors" in 1958 - 1960. These "district instructors" had played the critical role of the collectivization after the end of 1957. They made and implemented the well-laid agitation plan for collectivization, mobilizing many kinds of rural cadres from both inside and outside of village. We could regard it as the sophisticated violence, that was one reason why the forced collectivization of GDR didn't caused the physical violence...|$|R

It is a democratic economic system based on [...] "cooperation for use" [...] and not [...] "competition for profit." [...] It is the Economy of Abundance instead of Scarcity. These are some of its proven Principles and Practices—which really make [...] "life, liberty {{and the pursuit of}} happiness" [...] possible for ALL.:Consumers' Cooperation means Consumers' Ownership and Control. In as much as consumers furnish the market, which is the most essential thing in an economy of abundance, organized consumers must have the ownership and control of the means of production and distribution so that they can regulate production to their needs of consumption, can supply themselves with pure products without adulteration, and do so without competitive wastes in the processes of production and distribution.:Consumers' Cooperation is Economic Democracy. Consumers, who are everybody, become the owners. Voting is by person and not by property -- one person, one vote. Proxy voting is eliminated -— members must attend meetings and be active. Membership is open to everyone. We now have management control largely in industry, not even stockholder control. Under a cooperative system consumers control and the management executes their will.:Consumers' Cooperatives Distribute Profits Justly. So-called profits, which in cooperatives are really overcharges or savings, are paid back to the consumer-member-owners on the basis of purchases, as patronage refunds. Those who produce the profits get them in proportion to the contribution they make towards them by their purchases. John T. W. Mitchell, the great leader of the C.W.S. says, [...] "Those who pay the profits should get them back.":Consumers' Cooperation results in Security -— not Speculation. Capital is hired at the lowest cost. A minimum rate of interest is paid. There are no excessive earnings for investors so there is no watering of stock to cover them up. Stock cannot be sold at more than par value. Consumers' cooperatives require no governmental stock market security regulation because there is no speculation in cooperative stocks.:Consumers' Cooperation Increases the Income of Every Consumer-Member.

They are large enough to secure trained experts for managing large scale industry, but not excessive, as under the present management control of corporation policies and payrolls.:Consumers' Cooperatives Abolish Secrecy. Whatever cannot survive in the open in a democracy is wrong. Balance Sheets. Profit and Loss Statements and every other figure and fact are open to consumer-member-owners in a cooperative. It is the business of all.:Consumers' Cooperatives Strive for Cash Business, not Credit. Credit was said by {{one of the men who}} organized the first Rochdale Cooperative in England to be [...] "The invention of the Devil." [...] The only real reasons for credit business are competition for customers and inequality in the distribution of wealth, both of which cooperation eliminates. Under Consumers' Cooperation the money you invest buys a stock of goods which is carried on hand. The cash you then pay for each purchase enables the inventory to be replenished, ready for you the next time you need it.:Consumers' Cooperation Produces Pure Food and Goods, not shoddy products nor poison for profit. There is no reason for adulteration when consumers own their own business and buy for themselves. Deception is the result of the attempt to make more private profit for a few owners. Under cooperation the truth can be told in advertising and over the counter.:Consumers' Cooperation Prevents Waste and Produces True Economy. Duplicated milk wagons, delivery trucks, and all the wastes of competitive factories and distribution systems organized as a result of the urge for private profits are eliminated under cooperation.

We have thought of ourselves as producers and organized into occupational groups. [...] "For a century and a half," [...] says Professor Fairchild, who wrote the book [...] "Profits or Prosperity," [...] "we have been trained to think of ourselves as producers instead of as consumers -- one of the most remarkable instances of inverted logic on a large scale that mankind has ever displayed." [...] Organizing as producers is, as Beatrice Webb says, organizing the servant side of our lives, while organizing as consumers is organizing as masters of our lives. George W. Russell says, that when we organize as producers and not as consumers we are like an army that gives back to the enemy all it has won at the end of each week. Organizing as producers only is [...] "fighting with one hand behind our backs." [...] Organizing as consumers into Cooperatives will give us ownership and real power. The dollar we spend is more powerful than the dollar we get.:Consumers' Cooperative Organization Gives Us Democratic Liberty with Economic Justice which Political State Organizations Do Not. Political State organizations suppress liberty.—they are compulsory. Consumers' Cooperation gives us economic democracy—it is voluntary. While we are getting economic justice we must also have democratic freedom.:Consumers' Cooperation will Complete the Struggle for Liberty and Justice for ALL. We have deceived ourselves into thinking that religious, educational and political liberty were really possible without economic liberty and justice. Now we know they are not. Consumers' Cooperation finally fulfills liberty and justice for ALL. It gives every consumer equality in the control of business. It is democracy in our economic life.|$|R
