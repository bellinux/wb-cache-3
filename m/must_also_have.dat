50|$|The {{qualifications}} to be {{a candidate}} for the House of Representatives were outlined in Section 101, Part 2, Chapter 6 of the 2007 Constitution. The candidate had to be a citizen of Thailand by birth only. The citizen had to be at the age of twenty-five or older on election day and had been born in the province in which he or she intended to stand as a candidate. The candidate must have been a voter and therefore had to be on the electoral register {{for at least five years}} directly before the election, and he or she <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> a house or have been in public service in the province for five years. The candidate <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> been a member of an educational institution in that province for at least five consecutive years. Politically, a candidate had to be a member of one political party for a period of at least ninety days before election day, except in cases of dissolution where thirty days was the minimum period. This was done to discourage party switching before the election. For party list candidates, they <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>had</b> to meet the same qualifications except for the provincial restrictions. They were instead divided in lists based on provincial groups.|$|R

5|$|Criticisms of Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E
5|$|Attalus was now {{forced to}} return to Asia, for he had learned at Opus that, at the {{instigation}} of Philip, Prusias I king of Bithynia, related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Soon after, the Romans also abandoned Greece to concentrate their forces against Hannibal, their objective of preventing Philip from aiding Hannibal having been achieved. In 206BC the Aetolians sued for peace on conditions imposed by Philip. A treaty was drawn up at Phoenice in 205BC, formally ending the First Macedonian War. Attalus was included as an adscriptus {{on the side of}} Rome. He retained Aegina, but had accomplished little else. Since Prusias was also included in the treaty, the war between Attalus and Prusias <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> ended by that time.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred in}} circumstances where {{the author has}} the right to be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, or when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along his path, he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the warmth they feel <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been felt by Saint Peter. Suddenly, he asks if the widows have been reading the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{was conducted by}} voice vote, a qualified elector would tell the returning officer at a polling station who {{he was going to}} vote for and the results would be tallied. Under the terms of the Act eligible electors were males who had reached the age of majority, which was 21 years of age at that time. The act specified that electors must be bona fide males who were not aliens or unenfranchised Indians. Electors <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> resided in the territory for at least 12 months to the day of the writ being dropped.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} {{to run for the}} Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen and be at least 25 years old. They <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> lived in the state for at least one year, and must have lived in the district in which they are to run for at least six months, assuming the district has existed with its current boundaries for at least that long. No elected or appointed official of the United States government, including the military, may serve in the Senate, excluding those serving in the military reserves and National Guard. Similarly, no employees of the state government may serve, except for law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the emperor Hadrian the {{proportion}} of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably {{a direct result of the}} changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: limes) were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect more attractive to locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated Praetorian Guard <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd centuryAD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially Illyria. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: barbari) were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.|$|E

5|$|Carlos {{arranged}} bus and plane {{travel for}} his team and 42 of the original 63 hostages, with stops in Algiers and Tripoli, planning to fly eventually to Baghdad, where Yamani and Amuzegar were to be killed. All 30 non-Arab hostages were released in Algiers, excluding Amuzegar. Additional hostages were released at another stop in Tripoli before returning to Algiers. With only 10 hostages remaining, Carlos held a phone conversation with Algerian President Houari Boumédienne, who informed Carlos that the oil ministers' deaths would result in {{an attack on the}} plane. Boumédienne <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> offered Carlos asylum at this time and possibly financial compensation for failing to complete his assignment. Carlos expressed his regret at not being able to murder Yamani and Amuzegar, then he and his comrades left the plane. All the hostages and terrorists walked away from the situation, two days after it began.|$|E
5|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{demands of}} the Punic Wars, {{in addition to a}} shortage of manpower, exposed the tactical weaknesses of the manipular legion, {{at least in the short}} term. In 217BC, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners when slaves were pressed into naval service; around 213BC, the property requirement was reduced from 11,000 to 4,000 asses. Since the Romans are unlikely to have preferred to employ slaves over poor citizens in their armies, it must be assumed that, at this point, the proletarii of the poorest citizens <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> been pressed into service despite their lack of legal qualification. By 123BC, the financial requirement for military service was slashed again from 4,000 asses to just 1,500 asses. By this time, therefore, it is clear that many of the property-less former proletarii had been nominally admitted into the adsidui.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-cult {{groups also}} {{considered}} the church a cult. The local {{branch of the}} Centre contre les manipulations mentales (CCMM, or Centre Roger Ikor) directed an intense campaign against the group with repeated warnings in the media, and the President of the Union nationale des associations de défense des familles et de l'individu (UNADFI), Catherine Picard, said on television that she considered the church a cult. Criticism against the Church includes methods of recruitment (considered aggressive proselytism) in psychiatric hospitals, schools, buses and similar environments directed to suffering people, a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, pressure on prospective members to quickly join the group, family breakdowns, identical language and clothing of followers reflecting a loss of individuality, education of children that is considered indoctrination, many banned activities (among them music, television, makeup and trousers for women who <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> long hair covered with a scarf), an hysterical environment at worship, desocialization of the faithful, excessive appeals for money, unverifiable and dubious healings that may be detrimental to members' health and the strong influence on members and lack of qualifications of Kennel. A delegate from the CCMM said that criticism was based on facts collected from former members and their families, some {{of which had been}} used in court (as in Vesoul). In response to writer in the Protestant journal Réforme Benoît Hervieu-Léger, who contended that a sole case in Besançon would have been sufficient to criticize the whole federation, the delegate also stated that complaints did not come exclusively from the church of Besançon. The association also noted many similarities with another Pentecostal church it considered a cult, the Mission of Full Gospel - Christian Open Door. As of 2010, MIVILUDES continued to monitor the Church of Besançon because of its hold over the faithful.|$|E
