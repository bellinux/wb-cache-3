500|$|Gina {{struck the}} island of Tikopia that had already {{sustained}} catastrophic damage from Cyclone Zoe {{less than two months}} previously. The storm brought high winds and torrential rains that triggered landslides. Dozens of homes were damaged and many areas newly re-planted after Cyclone Zoe were devastated again. The impacts of Gina reportedly set back recovery efforts by nearly six months. A total of 112 newly built houses and 128 newly built kitchens were severely damaged, and another 37 homes sustained minor damage. The newly planted winter crop was lost due to sea spray, and 143 bags of rice, given as relief supplies after Cyclone Zoe, were lost. Following the storm, additional relief supplies and food were rushed to residents to ensure their safety. [...] These consisted of local foods, sago and <b>mesh</b> <b>wiring,</b> worth $14,400. A ship carrying five people became stranded in the Coral Sea during the storm when their engine failed on June 7. A mayday signal was put out by the captain but rough seas produced by the storm hampered rescue efforts. The five were safely rescued later that day, but two more people were discovered to be missing.|$|E

Evaporation raises the storage requirements of water bodies and lowers the yield. Covering of water bodies can help in reducing evaporation. The work presented in this study aims at investigating the use of palm fronds as shaded cover for the reduction of evaporation from the open water surface so as to increase the storage efficiency. The material used for cover was locally available palm fronds which are a massive agricultural waste and environmental friendly by-product in Saudi Arabia. Pan evaporimeters {{were used in the}} present study. One pan was covered like a shade made of palm fronds, which were tied up on <b>mesh</b> <b>wiring</b> while the other was kept without any cover. Initially a single layer of cover was used as shaded cover which was replaced by a cover of two layers of palm fronds in order to see the effect of thickness of cover on overall evaporation. It was observed that the average reduction in evaporation in the covered pan (with single layer of cover) was about 47 % as compared to the evaporation from the open pan. However, the average reduction in evaporation in the covered pan (with double layer of cover) was about 58 % as compared to the evaporation from the open pan...|$|E

40|$|Greenhouses are a well-accepted {{containment}} {{strategy to}} grow and study genetically modified plants (GM) before release into the environment. Various containment levels are requested by national regulations to minimize GM pollen escape. We tested the amount of pollen escaping from a standard greenhouse, {{which can be used}} for EU containment classes 1 and 2. More specifically, we investigated the hypothesis whether pollen escape could be minimized by insect-proof netting in front of the roof windows, since the turbulent airflow around the <b>mesh</b> <b>wiring</b> could avoid pollen from escaping. We studied the pollen flow out of greenhouses with and without insect netting of two non-transgenic crops, Ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and Corn (Zea Mays). Pollen flow was assessed with Rotorod® pollen samplers positioned inside and outside the greenhouse’ roof windows. A significant proportion of airborne pollen inside the greenhouse leaves through roof windows. Moreover, the lighter pollen of Lolium escaped more readily than the heavier pollen of Maize. In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify any reduction in pollen flow with insect netting in front of open windows, even under induced airflow conditions. We conclude that insect netting, often present by default in greenhouses, is not effective in preventing pollen escape from greenhouses of wind-pollinated plants for containment classes 1 or 2. Further research would be needed to investigate whether other alternative strategies, including biotic ones, are more effective. ...|$|E

The low-frequency magnetic shielding afforded by mesh enclosures is considered.

There are several advantages of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers over squeeze film dampers, including: temperature insensitivity, oil-free operation, and the ability to contain large amplitude vibrations. Furthermore, due to their direct damping and lack of cross-coupled stiffness, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reduces the response to imbalance and increases the stability of the system.
