The Corte Madera Gabbro pluton lies within the Peninsular Ranges batholith approximately 50 km east of San Diego, California. The gabbro intruded into metamorphosed pelitic rocks and was, in turn, intruded by more silicic plutons. The gabbroic rocks have been divided into three groups based on structural, textural, and mineralogical parameters. The A group consists of hornblende leucogabbro, troctolite, olivine gabbronorite, pyroxene-hornblende gabbronorite, minor anorthosite, and an occurrence of clinopyroxenite. The B group consists of orthopyroxene hornblende gabbronorite and hornblende gabbro, and the C group consists primarily of biotite-quartz norite. The A group contains cumulate textures, mineral layering, and synplutonic faults, and forms a basinal structure which is tilted to the southwest. The B group forms a cryptically zoned lobe with steeply dipping foliation. The C group forms a fairly homogeneous mantle around the A group and contains inclusions of prebatholithic rocks. The pluton is generally high in Al 2 O 3, and low in K 2 O, TiO 2, and total alkalis. The geochemistry of the major trace elements emphasizes the differences between the three groups. The C group is consistently richer in SiO 2, total alkalis, P 2 O 5, Rb, Sr, Y, Ba, Zr, and Nb. Based on various differentiation indices, the A group is least fractionated and the C group is most fractionated. The A and B groups show a continuous iron-enrichment trend, whereas the C group shows no consistent trend. The jump in concentration of many elements between the B and C groups cannot be explained by simple fractionation models. The parent magma for the pluton was a hydrous high-alumina basalt with island-arc affinities. The magma rose from a Jurassic Benioff zone to an intermediate crustal level (total pressure greater than 5 kb) where clinopyroxene began to crystallize. The magma continued upward in a series of pulses to the present erosional level (2 kb). Blocks of country rock sank into and contaminated the first pulse of magma. The contaminated magma became fairly homogeneous and crystallized in place to form the C group rocks. A second pulse of magma intruded the C group rocks and plagioclase and olivine began to crystallize to form the A group rocks. Differential heat loss caused intermittent convective overturn producing a rhythmic layering and other sedimentary structures. Tectonic events triggered slumping and faulting of the unconsolidated rhythmic layers. A portion of the melt became isolated in a side chamber or old conduit zone and differentiated in-situ as the B group...|$|E

It is important to understand this change because property value is linked to many other issues. Some of these issues include property tax rates, mortgage and rent prices, insurance rates, displacement issues, and economic development of the entire city. In one way or another, changing property values from the proposed LRT in Madison will affect everyone in the area. In order to get a better idea on how Madison area property values will be affected by the proposed light rail system, we have looked at many cities that have implemented similar public transit systems. With these studies, we have considered the recurring variables that appear to be the most influential on property value. There appears to be a relationship between these variables and property value, and we hope to understand the trends in order to assert what the likely effects the proposed LRT system will have on property value in the Madison area...|$|R
