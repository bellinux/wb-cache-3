50|$|Corner blocks {{are used}} to join the corners of a soft-cover flat. They are {{normally}} made of 1/4 in plywood, and are triangles with corners of 45°, 45°, and 90°. They are most often made by ripping the plywood at 6+1/2 in and then <b>mitering</b> it at 45 degree angles to create triangles with 9 in legs.|$|E

5000|$|A primary {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} <b>miter</b> saw is the <b>miter</b> index that allows {{the angle of the}} blade to be changed relative to the fence. While most <b>miter</b> saws enable precise one-degree incremental changes to the <b>miter</b> index, many also provide [...] "stops" [...] that allow the <b>miter</b> index to be quickly set to common angles (such as 15°, 22.5°, 30°, and 45°).|$|R
5000|$|Power <b>miter</b> saws {{have been}} {{available}} in various forms since the 1970s as specialized cross cut saws but with limited width of cut, especially compared to radial arm saws. Simple <b>miter</b> saws allowed the saw table to pivot allowing <b>miters</b> to be cut in one plane. Compound <b>miter</b> saws also provided saw head tilting allowing compound <b>miters</b> to be cut. <b>Miter</b> saws with abrasive cutting wheels are often used in metal work where they are known as [...] "drop saws" [...] or more commonly [...] "chop saws".|$|R
25|$|<b>Miter</b> gauge: The table has {{one or two}} slots (grooves) {{running from}} front to back, also {{parallel}} to the cutting plane of the blade. These <b>miter</b> slots (or <b>miter</b> grooves) are used to position and guide either a <b>miter</b> gauge (also known as a crosscut fence) or crosscut sled. The <b>miter</b> gauge is usually set to be at 90 degrees to {{the plane of the}} blade's cut, to cause the cut made in the workpiece to be made at a right angle. The <b>miter</b> gauge can also be adjusted to cause the cut to be made at a precisely controlled angle (a so-called <b>miter</b> cut).|$|R
50|$|The Leonard Gordon Homestead, Hexagonal Grain Crib is a {{historic}} farm outbuilding in rural White County, Arkansas. It is located off County Road 69, north of Bald Knob. It is a single-story wood frame structure, finished in board and batten siding and topped by a hexagonal hip roof. It exhibits a high quality of craftsmanship in the <b>mitering</b> of its structural members, suggesting {{it was intended to}} be a visually striking structure. Built about 1920, it is the only hexagonal structure identified in an architectural survey of the county.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, Cooper left A.S. Gillott {{to build}} frames {{under his own}} name, and by 1970 set up a small shop in Honor Oak Park, South East London. Cooper then worked in Dartford, approx 18 km (11 miles) from his old shop in Honor Oak Park as sole fabricator, making bespoke steel frames using the {{traditional}} method of free hand brazing rather than jigs, {{in order to avoid}} stresses to be built into the frame, which calls for careful <b>mitering</b> and took about two days to make. Some reviews claim Cooper's frame builds provide more stability, neutrality of handling, and responsiveness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{assembly}} required special arrangements with the AFL-CIO [...] - [...] a national trade union center [...] - [...] and the multinational crew which {{carried out the}} work wore hardhats emblazoned with both Chinese and American flags. The American contribution was limited to preparing the modern infrastructure of ducts and circuitry, staining the wood, plastering, and painting; all other work was performed {{by a team of}} twenty-seven from the Suzchou Garden Administration. [...] The workers included carpenters, tile workers, masons, and rock experts. Most of the fabrication had been done in China and the pieces were numbered for assembly. The wood structures rely on mortise-and-tenon and <b>mitering</b> techniques of joinery as old as the fourth century BC, and of uncommon sophistication; one pillar is joined to over fifteen architectural members without nails, and secured with wood pins with just a firm tap of a mallet for added stability. [...] It sits on a stone plinth without additional anchor. Fundamentally similar woodworking methods are used for furniture and traditional buildings, terms for which translate essentially as [...] "small woodwork" [...] and [...] "large woodwork". The prepared joinery pieces were quickly assembled. [...] "The entire frame of pillars and beams for the Ming Room, for instance, went up in several days, and with amazing precision. The woodworkers, using a frame handsaw and bow hand drill, were more like cabinetmakers than carpenters."Stone and masonry work took longer. The grey terra-cotta floor tiles, which are laid on edge in groups of four (a pattern called jian fang) on a bed of packed sand, and held with a hand-mixed mastic of ground lime, bamboo, and tung oil. [...] Hand saws were used in shaping tiles around pillars. The colonnade is edged by a low railing of hand-polished terra-cotta tiles.The work of dressing, finishing, and assembling, was completed in less than five months. The Astor Court opened in June 1980.|$|E
50|$|A <b>miter</b> gauge is {{a device}} used for holding {{workpieces}} at a set angle while being cut on table saws, band saws or sanded on stationary disk sanders. The <b>miter</b> gauge slides in a slot on the worktable (known as a <b>miter</b> slot) {{on the machine}} being used. Typically, the <b>Miter</b> Gauge and the workpiece are held together by hand and moved across the worktable making the cut (or sanded edge). Although, there are more sophisticated <b>miter</b> gauges that {{have the ability to}} clamp the workpiece or have adjustable stops for repetitive machining of workpieces.|$|R
5000|$|Electric <b>miter</b> saw or [...] "chop saw," [...] or [...] "cut-off saw" [...] or [...] "power <b>miter</b> box": {{for making}} {{accurate}} cross cuts and <b>miter</b> cuts. The basic version has a circular blade fixed at a 90° {{angle to the}} vertical. A [...] "compound <b>miter</b> saw" [...] has a blade that can be adjusted to other angles. A [...] "sliding compound <b>miter</b> saw" [...] has a blade that can be pulled through the work, in an action {{similar to that of}} a radial-arm saw, which provides more capacity for cutting wider workpieces.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Crown was {{originally}} made for Otto I (probably in the workshops of Reichenau abbey, the single arch {{of the crown}} {{from front to back}} originally separating the two halves of the now collapsed inner cap like the ribbon which similarly caused the 10th bishops' <b>miters</b> to bulge up on either side. Thus the Imperial Crown is the first example of the <b>miter</b> crown worn as a unique privilege of the Holy Roman Emperors and Empresses. Later personal crowns of the Emperors were worn over <b>miters</b> with points like that of contemporary bishops' <b>miters,</b> the <b>miter</b> eventually becoming a part of the crown itself, although in the Baroque period the two halves of the <b>miter</b> took the form of two hemispheres.|$|R
40|$|For {{printed antenna}} systems, {{microstrip}} feeding networks may become quite complex, including several right-angled bends. In designing feed networks {{we have to}} consider reflection levels at and electrical lengths of the bends. Removing a part of the area of metallization in the bend’s corner can compensate for the excess capacitance and reduce the reflection level of the bend. Full wave simulations have been performed for unmitered and (50 %) mitered right-angled bends in microstrip on FR 4 and FR 4 -like substrates in the frequency range 868 MHz – 60 GHz. The simulations revealed that for reflection levels below- 15 dB, up to 10 GHz <b>mitering</b> is unnecessary. For reflection levels below- 20 dB, <b>mitering</b> must be applied for frequencies in excess of 2. 5 GHz. A slight modification of the centreline approach for unmitered bends leads to an equivalent electrical length for unmitered bends with an absolute accuracy of less than one degree for all frequencies and substrates, where the reference planes may be brought back {{all the way to the}} bend. Applying this modification to 50 %-mitered bends, having the reference planes at 0. 2 λg distance from the bend, λg being the wavelength in the substrate, leads to an absolute error in electrical length of less than two and a half degrees for all frequencies and substrates. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, design and {{analysis}} of a 2. 4 GHz printed dipole antenna for wireless communication applications are presented. Measurements on return loss and radiation pattern of this antenna configuration are included in this investigation. The printed dipole is combined with the feeding structure of a microstrip via-hole balun and is fabricated on an FR- 4 printed-circuit-board substrate. Two inevitable discontinuities are introduced by this antenna architecture {{in the form of}} right-angle bends in the microstrip feed line and in the dipole’s gap, respectively. The impact of <b>mitering</b> these bends in the reflection coefficient, resonance bandwidth and radiation pattern of antenna has been investigated by means of simulation and experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} are {{to compare the}} airborne asbestos concentrations resulted from <b>mitering</b> of abestos cement roof sheets by a high-speed motor and a hand saw, and to monitor whether other workers near the test sites are vulnerable to the fibers exceeding the occupational exposure limit. Four test cases were carried out and altogether 7 personal and 4 area air samples were collected. The NIOSH method 7400 was employed for the air samplings and analysis. Using the phase contrast microscopy, fiber counting was conducted under Rule A. The study showed that the fiber concentration medians for personal air samples gathered from the two tools were 4. 11 fibers/cc (ranged: 1. 33 - 12. 41 fibers/cc) and 0. 13 fibers/cc (ranged: 0. 01 - 5. 00 fibers/cc) respectively. The median for the area samples was 0. 59 fibers/cc (ranged: 0. 14 - 3. 32 fibers/cc). Comparing each study case, the concentration level caused by the high-speed motor saw was {{more than twice that}} of the hand saw. According to the area samples, the workers nearby the test site are at risk from high exposure to asbestos...|$|E

40|$|A <b>miter</b> joint connects two beams, {{typically}} of {{the same}} cross section, at an angle such that the longitudinal beam edges continue across the joint. When more than two beams meet in one point, like in a tree, we call this a branching joint. In a branching <b>miter</b> joint, the beams’ longitudinal edges match up properly. We survey some principles of branching <b>miter</b> joints. In particular, we treat joints where three beams with identical cross sections meet. These ternary <b>miter</b> joints {{can be used to}} construct various branching structures. We present two works of art that involve branching <b>miter</b> joints...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we study}} the {{characteristics}} of a novel miniaturized optical delay line, which delays light in a meandering photonic crystal waveguide, and describe the design steps. We show how lattice parameters and refractive index difference of the pho-tonic crystal affect the bandgap width and suggest a criterion to select these parameters. Next, we focus on the parallel waveguide channels in photonic crystal, and analyze the impact of the channel length and the interchannel spacing on crosstalk. We suggest a method for <b>mitering</b> the sharp corners in meandering lines which reduces the undesired reflections by 8 dB. Considering all these guidelines, we examine the propagation of light in the proposed delay line through calculating time-delay and insertion loss. To achieve longer delays in a small device area, we concentrate on coupled cavities in photonic crystals and propose an approximate method for calculating the group velocity of light in the coupled defects. We show how by replacing waveguide channels of a mean-dering delay line with coupled defects we achieve time-delays more than 9 ps within a device size around 27 m, which corresponds to a miniaturization factor of 100. Index Terms—Coupled cavities, crosstalk, finite difference time domain (FDTD), group velocity, optical delay line, photonic crystal. I...|$|E
