60|$|Then I {{let down}} my rod and dove {{for the short}} rope to lasso the {{sweeping}} tail. Fortunately he kept quiet a moment in which I got the loop fast. It was then Xiphius gladius really woke up. He began a tremendous beating with his tail. Both gaff ropes began to loosen, and the rope on his tail flew out of my hands. Dan got it in time. But it was slipping. He yelled for me to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>hitch</b> somewhere. I was pulled flat in the cockpit, but scrambled up, out on the stern, and held on to that rope grimly while I tried to fasten it. Just almost impossible! The water was deluging us. The swordfish banged the boat with sodden, heavy blows. But I got the rope fast. Then I went to Dan's assistance. The two of us pulled that tremendous tail {{up out of the}} water and made fast the rope. Then we knew we had him. But he surged and strained and lashed for a long while. And side blows of his sword scarred the boat. At last he sagged down quiet, and we headed for Avalon. Once more in smooth water, we loaded him astern. I found the hook just in the corner of his mouth, which fact accounted for the long battle.|$|E

50|$|One {{instance}} where <b>a</b> half <b>hitch</b> {{stands on}} its own without additional embellishment is when added to <b>a</b> timber <b>hitch</b> to help stabilize a load {{in the direction of}} pull. <b>A</b> timber <b>hitch</b> is tied on {{the far end of the}} load to bind it securely and <b>a</b> half <b>hitch</b> made at the forward end to serve as a guide for the rope.
