40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsTo {{study the}} clinico-pathological features, {{treatments}} and outcomes of gastric carcinoma (GC) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly (⩾ 65 years) and the non-elderly Egyptian patients. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included 168 patients with histologically confirmed GC treated at Tanta Cancer Center between 2003 and 2007. ResultsCompared to the non-elderly, elderly patients {{had significantly higher}} proportion of tumors involving the cardia (p= 0. 034) and of adenocarcinoma NOS histology (p= 0. 032). Treatments were largely comparable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two groups. Response to palliative chemotherapy was achieved in 44. 4 % of the elderly and 25. 5 % of the non-elderly patients (p= 0. 417). The median overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 6, 17 and 3 months, respectively. The median OS was 4 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly compared to 9 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-elderly (p= 0. 005). The median DFS was 4 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly compared to 20 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-elderly (p= 0. 004). The median PFS was 2 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly compared to 3 <b>months</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-elderly (p= 0. 685). In multivariate analysis, poor performance status was an independent predictor of poor OS, DFS and PFS. Non-curative or no surgery and lack of chemotherapy use were independent predictors of poor OS. Age was an independent predictor of poor DFS. ConclusionsCompared to <b>the</b> non-elderly, GC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly has similar clinico-pathological characteristics and exhibits comparable outcomes with the same treatment options. Treatments should be tailored to each patient...|$|R
