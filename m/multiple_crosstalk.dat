40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} are divided into, firstly, a generic model of {{crosstalk}} attack and its monitoring with three levels of crosstalk attack propagation are determined. Secondly, the determined crosstalk attack and monitor model is investigated and a method which has the capability to detect and locate <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> attacks under sparse monitoring, where only a set of nodes is selected as monitor node in AON, is proposed subsequently. Two problems are addressed in this research study regards the crosstalk attack localisation under sparse monitoring in AON, namely the determination of placement of monitoring device in a network by the use of Greedy Monitor Placement Algorithm and the subsequent development of the identification and localisation algorithm of <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> attack in AON. The use of sparse monitoring for crosstalk attack localisation in AON significantly reduces the cost of equipping all nodes with monitoring device. Lastly, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithms, a worst­case scenario where all­to­all connections are assumed to contaminate with crosstalk in all the nodes in a network. The proposed algorithms are tested in several networks with different attacks...|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} different experimental model {{systems to}} define the role of GATA 4, beta-catenin, and steroidogenic factor (SF- 1) transcriptional factors in the regulation of monkey luteal inhibin secretion. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions and western blotting analyses show high expression of inhibin-alpha, GATA 4, and beta-catenin in corpus luteum (CL) of the mid-luteal phase. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist-induced luteolysis model suggested the significance of luteinizing hormone (LH) in regulating these transcriptional factors. Inducible cyclic AMP early repressor mRNA expression was detected in the CL and no change was observed in different stages of CL. Following amino acid sequence analysis, interaction between SF- 1 and beta-catenin in mid-stage CL was verified by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments coupled to immunoblot analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis support the role of SF- 1 in regulating luteal inhibin-alpha expression. Our results suggest a possible <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> of Wnt, cAMP, and SF- 1 in the regulation of luteal inhibin secretion...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength {{division}} multiplexing (WDM) {{has been}} proposed for fibre, intersatellite, free space and indoor optical communication systems. Digital pulse position modulation (DPPM) is a more power efficient modulation format than on-off keying (OOK) and a strong contender for the modulation of free-space systems. Although DPPM obtains this advantage {{in exchange for a}} bandwidth expansion, WDM systems using it are still potentially attractive, particularly for moderate coding levels. However, WDM systems are susceptible to interchannel crosstalk and modelling this in a WDM DPPM system is necessary. Models of varying complexity, based on simplifying assumptions, are presented and evaluated for the case of a single crosstalk wavelength. For a single crosstalk, results can be straightforwardly obtained by artificially imposing the computationally convenient constraint that frames (and thus slots also) align. <b>Multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> effects are additionally investigated, for the most practically relevant cases of modest coding level, and using both simulation and analytical methods. In general, DPPM maintains its sensitivity advantage over OOK even in the presence of crosstalk while predicting lower power penalty at low coding level in WDM systems...|$|E

We attribute this to an imperfect signal extinction ratio. In this letter, simple analytical relations for crosstalk induced power penalties are derived taking the signal extinction ratio into account and excellent agreement with 10 -Gb/s experiments is obtained. Both theory and experiments show {{the importance of the}} signal extinction ratio in connection with interferometric crosstalk...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that exposures to environmental agents {{are associated with}} reproductive disorders in human populations has generated much public interest recently. Phthalate esters are used most commonly as plasticizers in the food and construction industry, and di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most abundant phthalate in the environment. Daily human exposure to DEHP in the U. S. is significant, and occupational and clinical exposures from DEHP-plasticized medical devices, e. g., blood bags, hemodialysis tubing, and nasogastric feeding tubes, increase body burden levels. We investigated the effects of chronic exposures to low environmentally relevant DEHP levels on testicular function. Our data show that prolonged exposures to this agent induced high levels of the gonadotropin luteinizing hormone and increased the serum concentrations of sex hormones [testosterone and 17 β-estradiol (E 2) ] by > 50 %. Increased proliferative activity in Leydig cells was evidenced by enhanced expression of cell cycle proteins, as determined by RT-PCR. The numbers of Leydig cells in the testis of DEHP-treated rats were 40 – 60 % higher than in control rats, indicating induction of Leydig cell hyperplasia. DEHP-induced elevations in serum testosterone and E 2 levels suggest the possibility of <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalks</b> between androgen, estrogen, and steroid hormone receptors, whereas the presence of estrogen receptors in nonreproductive tissues, e. g., cardiovascular system and bones, implies that the increases in serum E 2 levels have implications beyond reproduction, including systemic physiology. Analysis {{of the effects of}} phthalate exposures on gonadotropin and steroid hormone levels should form part of overall risk assessment in human populations...|$|R

40|$|In this review, {{we address}} aspects of Wnt, R-Spondin (RSPO) and Hippo signalling, in both healthy and {{transformed}} intestinal epithelium. In intestinal stem cells (ISCs), the Wnt pathway {{is essential for}} intestinal crypt formation and renewal, whereas RSPO-mediated signalling mainly affects ISC numbers. In human colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant Wnt signalling is the driving mechanism initiating this type of neoplasia. The signalling role of the RSPO-binding transmembrane proteins, the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGRs), is possibly more pleiotropic and not only limited to the enhancement of Wnt signalling. There is growing evidence for <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> between Hippo and Wnt/β-catenin signalling. In the ON state, Hippo signalling results in serine/threonine phosphorylation of Yes-associated protein (YAP 1) and tafazzin (TAZ), promoting formation of the β-catenin destruction complex. In contrast, YAP 1 or TAZ dephosphorylation (and YAP 1 methylation) results in β-catenin destruction complex deactivation and β-catenin nuclear localization. In the Hippo OFF state, YAP 1 and TAZ are engaged with the nuclear β-catenin {{and participate in the}} β-catenin-dependent transcription program. Interestingly, YAP 1 /TAZ are dispensable for intestinal homeostasis; however, upon Wnt pathway hyperactivation, the proteins together with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors drive the transcriptional program essential for intestinal cell transformation. In addition, in many CRC cells, YAP 1 phosphorylation by YES proto-oncogene 1 tyrosine kinase (YES 1) leads to the formation of a transcriptional complex that includes YAP 1, β-catenin and T-box 5 (TBX 5) DNA-binding protein. YAP 1 /β-catenin/T-box 5 -mediated transcription is necessary for CRC cell proliferation and survival. Interestingly, dishevelled (DVL) appears to be an important mediator involved in both Wnt and Hippo (YAP 1 /TAZ) signalling and some of the DVL functions were assigned to the nuclear DVL pool. Wnt ligands can trigger alternative signalling that directly involves some of the Hippo pathway components such as YAP 1, TAZ and TEADs. By upregulating Wnt pathway agonists, the alternative Wnt signalling can inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway activity...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} {{has been}} {{and will continue to}} be a primary driving force in the evolution of hardware design and associated technologies. The objective of this research is to design low-cost signal acquisition systems for characterizing wideband and high-speed signals. As the bandwidth and the speed of such signals increase, the cost of testing also increases significantly; therefore, innovative hardware and algorithm co-design are needed to relieve this problem. In Chapter 2, a low-cost multi-rate system is proposed for characterizing the spectra of wideband signals. The design is low-cost in the sense of the actual component cost, the system complexity, and the effort required for calibration. The associated algorithms are designed such that the hardware can be implemented with low-complexity yet be robust enough to deal with various hardware variations. A hardware prototype is built not only to verify the proposed hardware scheme and algorithms but to serve as a concrete example that shows that characterizing signals with sub-Nyqusit sampling rate is feasible. Chapter 3 introduces a low-cost time-domain waveform reconstruction technique, which requires no mutual synchronization mechanisms. This brings down cost significantly and enables the implementation of systems capable of capturing tens of Gigahertz (GHz) signals for significantly lower cost than high-end oscilloscopes found in the market today. For the first time, band-interleaving and incoherent undersampling techniques are combined to form a low-cost solution for waveform reconstruction. This is enabled by co-designing the hardware and the back-end signal processing algorithms to compensate for the lack of coherent Nyquist rate sampling hardware. A hardware prototype was built to support this work. 	Chapter 4 describes a novel test methodology that significantly reduces the required time for crosstalk jitter characterization in parallel channels. This is done by using bit patterns with coprime periods as channel stimuli and using signal processing algorithms to separate <b>multiple</b> <b>crosstalk</b> coupling effects. This proposed test methodology can be applied seamlessly in conjunction with the current test methodology without re-designing the test setup. More importantly, the conclusion derived from the mathematical analysis shows that only such test stimuli give unbiased characterization results, which are critical in all high-precision test setups. Hardware measurement results and analysis are provided to support this methodology. This thesis starts with an overview of the background and a literature review. Three major previously mentioned works are addressed in three separate chapters. Each chapter documents the hardware designs, signal processing algorithms, and associated mathematical analyses. For the purpose of verification, the hardware measurement setups and results are discussed at the end of these three chapters.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of crosstalk on single victim due to multiple aggressors in the same metal layer is studied. We develop here a crosstalk fault model based on the consideration of usual distributed coupling capacitance and RLGC parasitics of interconnects in addition to mutual conductance (resistive bridging) {{in order to deal}} the crosstalk influence. Here, we estimate the crosstalk influence for worst case input signal combinations on aggressors, which induce more crosstalk on single victim. Our model helps the System-on-Chip (SoC) designers by providing sufficient insights into Signal Integrity problems. Experimental simulations with our crosstalk model, carried out using Philips CMOS 12 (130 nm) technology parameters, further validated with PSPICE simulations reveal that coupling capacitance’s effect is more on crosstalk glitch and signal delay on victim’s output whereas, the mutual conductance affects more on the final steady state value of the victim’s output signal.

40|$|Hypoxia is {{a common}} micro-environmental stress which is {{experienced}} by cells during a range of physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. The identification of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) as the master regulator of the transcriptional response to hypoxia transformed {{our understanding of the}} mechanism underpinning the hypoxic response at the molecular level and identified HIF as a potentially important new therapeutic target. It has recently become clear that multiple levels of regulatory control exert influence on the HIF pathway giving the response a complex and dynamic activity profile. These include positive and negative feedback loops within the HIF pathway as well as <b>multiple</b> levels of <b>crosstalk</b> with other signaling pathways. The emerging model reflects a multi-level regulatory network that affects multiple aspects of the physiologic response to hypoxia including proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. Understanding the interplay between the molecular mechanisms involved in the dynamic regulation of the HIF pathway at a systems level is critically important in defining new appropriate therapeutic targets for human diseases including ischemia, cancer, and chronic inflammation. Here, we review our current knowledge of the regulatory circuits which exert influence over the HIF response and give examples of in silico model-based predictions of the dynamic behaviour of this system...|$|R
40|$|In nature, plants {{interact}} {{with a wide}} range of microbial pathogens and herbivorous insects. During the evolutionary arms race between plants and their attackers, primary and secondary immune responses evolved to recognise common or highly specialised features of the attacker encountered, resulting in sophisticated mechanisms of induced defence. Induced resistance mechanisms are characterised by a broad-spectrum effectiveness and often act systemically in plant parts distant from the site of primary attack, thereby protecting the plant against subsequent invaders. Plant hormones are key players in the regulation of the defence signalling pathways involved. Because induced defence responses entail ecological fitness costs, plants must possess elaborate regulatory mechanisms that efficiently coordinate the activation of attacker-specific defences so that fitness costs are minimised while optimal resistance is attained. A major focus in plant defence signalling research is to uncover key mechanisms by which plants tailor their responses to different attackers, and to investigate how plants cope with simultaneous interactions with <b>multiple</b> aggressors. Pathway <b>crosstalk</b> and priming for enhanced defence emerged as important regulatory mechanisms that enhance the efficiency of the plant’s inducible defence arsenal.

40|$|Caenorhabditis elegans vulval {{development}} {{provides an}} important paradigm {{for studying the}} process of cell fate determination and pattern formation during animal development. Although many genes controlling vulval cell fate specification have been identified, how they orchestrate themselves to generate a robust and invariant pattern of cell fates is not yet completely understood. Here, we have developed a dynamic computational model incorporating the current mechanistic understanding of gene interactions during this patterning process. A key feature of our model is the inclusion of <b>multiple</b> modes of <b>crosstalk</b> between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and LIN- 12 /Notch signaling pathways, which together determine the fates of the six vulval precursor cells (VPCs). Computational analysis, using the model-checking technique, provides new biological insights into the regulatory network governing VPC fate specification and predicts novel negative feedback loops. In addition, our analysis shows that most mutations affecting vulval development lead to stable fate patterns in spite of variations in synchronicity between VPCs. Computational searches for {{the basis of this}} robustness show that a sequential activation of the EGFR-mediated inductive signaling and LIN- 12 / Notch-mediated lateral signaling pathways is key to achieve a stable cell fate pattern. We demonstrate experimentally a time-delay between the activation of the inductive and lateral signaling pathways in wild-type animals and the loss of sequential signaling in mutants showing unstable fate patterns; thus, validating two key predictions provided by our modeling work.

Many in vivo {{studies have shown}} their therapeutic benefits, {{paving the way for}} clinical translation. The 3 D model of cardiospheres (CSs) represents a unique niche-like in vitro microenvironment, which includes CPCs and supporting cells. CSs have been shown to form through a process mediated by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). β 2 -Adrenergic signaling significantly affects stem/progenitor cells activation and mobilization in <b>multiple</b> tissues, and <b>crosstalk</b> between β 2 -adrenergic signaling and EMT processes has been reported. In the present study, we aimed at investigating the biological response of CSs to β 2 -adrenergic stimuli, focusing on EMT modulation in the 3 D culture system of CSs. We treated human CSs and CS-derived cells (CDCs) with the β 2 -blocker butoxamine (BUT), using either untreated or β 2 agonist (clenbuterol) treated CDCs as control. BUT-treated CS-forming cells displayed increased migration capacity and a significant increase in their CS-forming ability, consistently associated with increased expression of EMT-related genes, such as Snai 1. Moreover, long-term BUT-treated CDCs contained a lower percentage of CD 90 + cells, and this feature has been previously correlated with higher cardiogenic and therapeutic potential of the CDCs population. In addition, long-term BUT-treated CDCs had an increased ratio of collagen-III/collagen-I gene expression levels, and showed decreased release of inflammatory cytokines, overall supporting a less fibrosis-prone phenotype. In conclusion, β 2 adrenergic receptor block positively affected the stemness vs commitment balance within CSs through the modulation of type 1 -EMT (so called "developmental"). These results further highlight type- 1 EMT to be a key process affecting the features of resident cardiac progenitor cells, and mediating their response to the microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{technology}} has permitted {{an exponential growth}} in transistor count and density. However, making efficient use of the available transistors in the design has become exceedingly difficult. Standard design flow involves synthesis, verification, placement and routing followed by final tape out of the design. Due {{to the presence of}} various undesirable effects like capacitive crosstalk, supply noise, high temperatures, etc., verification/validation of the design has become a challenging problem. Therefore, having a good design convergence may not be possible within the target time, due to a need for a large number of design iterations. ^ Capacitive crosstalk {{is one of the major}} causes of design convergence problems in deep sub-micron era. With scaling, the number of crosstalk violations has been increasing because of reduced inter-wire distances. Consequently only the most severe crosstalk faults are fixed pre-silicon while the rest are tested post-silicon. Testing for capacitive crosstalk involves generation of input patterns which can be applied post-silicon to the integrated circuit and comparison of the output response. These patterns are generated at the gate/Register Transfer Level (RTL) of abstraction using Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) tools. In this dissertation, an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based ATPG technique for maximizing crosstalk induced delay increase at the victim net, for <b>multiple</b> aggressor <b>crosstalk</b> faults, is presented. Moreover, various solutions for pattern generation considering both zero as well as unit delay models is also proposed. ^ With voltage scaling, power supply switching noise has become one of the leading causes of signal integrity related failures in deep sub-micron designs. Hence, during power supply network design and analysis of power supply switching noise, computation of peak supply current is an essential step. Traditional peak current estimation approaches involve addition of peak current associated with all the CMOS gates which are switching in a combinational circuit. Consequently, this approach does not take the Boolean and temporal relationships of the circuit into account. This work presents an ILP based technique for generation of an input pattern pair which maximizes switching supply currents for a combinational circuit in the presence of integer gate delays. The input pattern pair generated using the above approach can be applied post-silicon for power droop testing. ^ With high level of integration, Multi-Processor Systems on Chip (MPSoC) feature multiple processor cores and accelerators on the same die, so as to exploit the instruction level parallelism in the application. For hardware-software co-design, application programming model is based on a Task Graph, which represents task dependencies and execution/transfer times for various threads and processes within an application. Mapping an application to an MPSoC traditionally involves representing it in the form of a task graph and employing static scheduling in order to minimize the schedule length. Dynamic system behavior is not taken into consideration during static scheduling, while dynamic scheduling requires the knowledge of task graph at runtime. A run-time task graph extraction heuristic to facilitate dynamic scheduling is also presented here. A novel game theory based approach uses this extracted task graph to perform run-time scheduling in order to minimize total schedule length. ^ With increase in transistor density, power density has gone up substantially. This has lead to generation of regions with very high temperature called Hotspots. Hotspots lead to reliability and performance issues and affect design convergence. In current generation Integrated Circuits (ICs) temperature is controlled by reducing power dissipation using Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques like frequency and/or voltage scaling. These techniques are reactive in nature and have detrimental effects on performance. Here, a look-ahead based task migration technique is proposed, in order to utilize the multitude of cores available in an MPSoC to eliminate thermal emergencies. Our technique is based on temperature prediction, leveraging upon a novel wavelet based thermal modeling approach. ^ Hence, this work addresses several optimization problems that can be reduced to constrained max-satisfiability, involving integer as well as Boolean constraints in hardware and software domains. Moreover, it provides domain specific heuristic solutions for each of them. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfrican trypanosomiases are vector-borne {{diseases}} {{of human and}} their livestock, with devastating socio-economical consequences for the Sub-Saharan African continent. These diseases are caused by flagellated unicellular parasites named African trypanosomes that are almost exclusively transmitted by the bite of tsetse flies. Here, {{both male and female}} tsetse flies are obligatory blood feeders able to carry and transmit trypanosomes during their entire life span. Two species of African trypanosomes are responsible for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in Central/West Africa and T. b. rhodesiense in East/Southern Africa. The T. b. gambiense transmission cycle is mostly from human to human with an occasional involvement of an animal reservoir. The T. b. rhodesiense transmission cycle mainly involves wild and domestic animals, but intensified human-to-human transmission may occur during epidemics. There are no prophylactic drugs or vaccines available to prevent HAT and the few available treatments present a complex posology and severe side effects (Fevre et al., 2006; Brun et al., 2009). In 2011, less than 10, 000 new cases were reported (Simarro et al., 2012), with many more cases probably remaining undetected as sleeping sickness occurs in remote rural areas. It is estimated that approximately 70 million people within tsetse-fly infested areas are at different levels of risk of contracting HAT, especially in countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, South-Sudan, and the Central African Republic (Simarro et al., 2012; WHO, 2012). In addition to their importance in public health, at least seven other species of African trypanosomes cause severe disease in livestock known as African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana. T. vivax and T. con-golense are the major pathogens of cattle and other ruminants, while T. simiae, T. godfreyi, and T. suis causes high mortality in domestic pigs. Animal African Trypanosomiasis restricts agricultural development on the African continent despite the availability of prophylactic and curative drugs. Moreover, it is worrying to see drug effectiveness seriously threatened by an increasing resistance in animal trypanosomes (Delespaux et al., 2008). Successful transmission is primarily the outcome of a crosstalk between the trypanosomes and the tsetse fly vector. This enables the parasite to undergo successive rounds of differentiation, proliferation, and migration in different locations of the fly, resulting in a final infective stage that is transmitted to a new mammalian host during each tsetse fly blood-feeding event. This Research Topic hosted in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology focuses on the state-of-the-art on some key aspects of the fascinating biological interplay between African trypanosomes and the tsetse fly. To prepare for life cycle progression, T. brucei parasites present in the bloodstream of an infected mammalian host have to generate stumpy forms that are pre-adapted to survive in the tsetse fly once they are taken up by the fly blood feeding. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the production of these stumpy forms and their signal perception pathways upon entry into the tsetse fly are detailed under the lights of recent discoveries in the review of Vidal et al., 2013. In the tsetse fly, trypanosomes have to go through specific developmental programs in order to survive and produce transmissible stage. Here, a mini-review will focus on the major advancements in our understanding of this trypanosome development in the tsetse fly (Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013). The different types of parasite cycle and the critical stages of the three epidemiologically most relevant try-panosome species, namely T. vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei will be compared. More emphasis is on T. brucei development since the parasite undergoes multiple morphological changes during the successive invasion of the tsetse alimentary tract to finally achieve the mammalian-infective stage in the salivary glands. Another review will attempt to elucidate how these morphological changes are possible for a parasite that has evolved a highly robust cell structure to survive the chemically and physically diverse environments in the fly (Ooi and Bastin, 2013). During their journey in the tsetse fly, trypanosomes are challenged by a robust innate defense system. This is reviewed in the paper of Haines (Haines, 2013) with a focus on the tissues intimately associated with host defense. Moreover, the established symbiotic associations of tsetse flies with bacterial and viral microorganisms also modulate its vector competence for trypanosomes. A first review article will provide {{a detailed description of the}} tsetse symbiotic microbiome, and describes the physiology underlying host-symbiont and symbiont-symbiont interactions that occur in this fly (Wang et al., 2013). The diversity of the gut bacterial flora in the tsetse fly and the possible impact of newly identified bacteria to the vector competence will also be discussed in mini-review of Geiger et al. (2013). In combination to the <b>multiple</b> trypanosome-tsetse <b>crosstalk,</b> environmental factors can also affect the parasite developmental barriers in the fly. Here, experimental work from Burkina Faso demonstrated that temperature stress could increase th...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{excitation}} energy transfer (EET) and electron transfer (ET) {{are of the}} fundamental importance to biochemical processes and solar energy conversion. The goal of this thesis is to develop and apply theoretical and computational tools to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of EET and ET in selected molecular systems with the aim to control and boost their efficacy. Specifically, this thesis focuses on three subjects: (1) computational study of energy transfer and its pathways in Ruthenium based metal organic frameworks (MOFs), (2) developing a general analytical model to describe the kinetics of energy transfer/electron transfer in condensed media, and (3) developing theoretical frameworks to describe multiple electron/exciton transfer processes. In the study of energy transfer in Ruthenium based MOFs, {{we found that the}} excitation transport kinetics was well described by a Dexter (exchange) triplet-to-triplet incoherent multi-step hopping mechanism. The sensitive distance dependent rate for Dexter energy transfer in different MOF structures establishes unique energy transport pathways. For example, both one- and three-dimensional exciton-hopping networks were found in mixed Ru/Os MOFs. As such, Dexter energy transfer may potentially be helpful for spatially directing {{excitation energy}} along specific direction, for example, towards reaction centers, and an amenable for designing high efficiency energy transfer materials. Significant amount EET processes happen in condense media and the nature of energy migration kinetics depends heavily on the donor (D) and acceptor (A) distribution in the media, especially for organic photovoltaic devices. The EET in the condense phase allow us to study the impact of ordered, partially ordered, and disordered DA distribution on the solar energy harvesting efficiency. To better account for the EET in condense phase, we developed a general analytical model for the description of the time-dependent luminescence decay emphasizing on the actual D-A spatial distribution. Applications of the developed model have been made to investigate the long-range excitation energy transfer in disordered polymer systems. By fitting the experimental transient luminescence spectra, we found that the derived EET kinetics showed better agreement with experimental observed luminescence decay both in short and long times, a significant improvement over the earlier models by Inokuti and Hirayama. Our model is more reliable {{in a wide range of}} time and acceptor density and can also be used for electron transfer. The frontiers of ET and EET are moving from single particle one-step reactions to coupled multi-particle and multi-step processes. To understand the leading features that mediate the two-electron transfer in catalysis, we developed a two-electron transfer superexchange model that focuses on the roles of these features including (1) the one- and two-electron virtual intermediate states that mediate the ET, (2) the number of virtual intermediates with system size, and (3) the multiple classes of pathways interferes. Key questions, including how bridge structure and energetics influence multi-electron superexchange and interference between singly- and doubly-oxidized (or reduced) bridge virtual states are investigated. We found that even simple linear donor-bridge-acceptor systems have pathway topologies that resemble those seen for one-electron superexchange through bridges with multiple parallel pathways. The simple model two-electron transfer systems studied here exhibit a richness that is amenable to experimental exploration by manipulating the <b>multiple</b> pathways, pathway <b>crosstalk,</b> and changes in the number of donor and acceptor species. The features that emerge from these studies may assist in developing new strategies to deliver multiple electrons in condensed phase redox systems, including multiple-electron redox species, multi-metallic/multi-electron redox catalysts, and multi-exciton excited states. Finally, to understand the role of structural and environmental disorder on incoherent ET, we developed a perturbative model based on the kinetic master equation to examine incoherent ET in non-equilibrium and non-Markovian regime. The developed method provides an effective way to explicitly investigate how a general (non-Gaussian) fluctuation in ET rate can modify the ET kinetics. Applications of this method have been made to study the ET kinetics for donor-bridge-acceptor systems with the structural and environmental fluctuations. Changing in ET kinetics with structural fluctuations of different nature was examined. Dominant fluctuation characters that significantly boost or reduce ET rate were identified. These findings may be helpful in designing efficient ET materials and provide strategies in modulating ET rate. Dissertatio...|$|R
