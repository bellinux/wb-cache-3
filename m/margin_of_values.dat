The thesis {{is based on a}} case study, where a Finnish online service provider Whitevector Ltd. was taken into inspection through value chain analysis.

40|$|Many say {{the market}} for the shares of smaller companies—so called small-cap and mid-cap stocks—offers greater {{opportunity}} for active management to add value than does the large-cap market. The underlying notion is that {{the market for}} small and medium caps is less efficient than the large-cap market, and, therefore, security mispricing is more prevalent there. It is true that fewer securities analysts follow small- and mid-cap companies, and they are less widely held by portfolio managers. But is there evidence that active management is really more productive in the small- and mid-cap arena than in the large-cap arena? A survey of the literature turns up no compelling evidence that managers add value with greater consistency in portfolios dominated by smaller companies. As {{far as we can}} tell the active-small-cap thesis results from casual inspection of fund databases that sometimes show the majority of small-cap funds outperforming a popular index of smaller stocks over a particular timeframe. Three performance-evaluation errors contribute to what we claim is actually the small-cap-alpha myth. The first is ignoring management fees. The second is using an inappropriate benchmark. The third is ignoring survivorship effects and other biases that inflate the average return of portfolios in commercial databases. Here is an illustration of the three at work. VANISHING ALPHAS We constructed a sample of 128 products from the Mobius Group M-Search database—a popular database of institutional commingled funds and composites of separate accounts—that represent themselves as active small-cap. 1 As is the case with most such databases, the vast majority (90 %) of the products in the sample report only gross-of-fee returns.

We {{found out that the}} region is characterized by shallow Curie depths and high heat flow. The Ikogosi Warm Spring area is underlined by an average Curie point depth of 15.1 [*]±[*] 0.6  km. This shallow CPD implies a heat flow of 91.2 [*]±[*] 2.1  mW/m 2. We were however constrained by the lack of additional information about temperature measurements at depth so we compare our calculated heat flow result with the value expected in Precambrian basement complex. We observed that our value lies within the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> 37.6 [*]±[*] 50.2  mW/m 2 (Verheijen and Ajakaiye [1979]) and conclude that our calculations seem satisfactory. We also consider the relationship between heat flow density and radioactive heat production rate to further confirm our CPD results. Our estimated equivalent depth extent of heat flow density and radioactive heat production also falls within the <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the CPD <b>values</b> for the region, despite that they were computed independent of each other. We conclude that the equivalent depth extent in this respect could represent the depth of change in mineralogy in the crust. Generally, we conclude that the shallow CPD observed is due to magmatic intrusion at depth. The seismic activities recorded close to this region, a major fault presence (Ifewara fault), multiple fractures in the rock units and low CPDs could be results of movement of, or within, thin magmatic intrusions. We therefore recommend detailed temperature measurement at various depths through a series of boreholes to be located at adequate intervals within the crystalline basement complex of Nigeria. This would provide the much needed data for further studies of the origin, emplacement, geophysical and geological characteristics of the basement complex. The results obtained in this work have provided important geophysical/geological inputs which are useful to further geothermal energy exploration in the region.|$|R

About half of the samples analysed presented benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) concentrations exceeding 2 lg/kg, which is proposed as a regulatory limit for dietary supplements. A product-by-product approach (based on maximum recommended dosage) was used to calculate PAH exposure. Even thought the majority of the samples gave low exposure levels when compared to expo- sure levels from other diet constituents, PAH intakes deriving from a daily consumption of some of the investigated products provided an important contribution to the total dietary intake and lead to <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> exposure (MOE) <b>values</b> which are <b>of</b> concern for human health...|$|R
