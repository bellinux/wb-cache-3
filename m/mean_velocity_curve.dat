40|$|The {{blood flow}} in the uvea in cats and monkeys during acute {{increases}} of arterial blood pressure is well controlled by a sympathetic mechanism protecting the eye from overperfusion. Ocular macrocirculation (ophthalmic artery) and ocular microcirculation (iris) were examined in 22 healthy subjects during acute increases of arterial blood pressure induced by physical exercise (125 W). With a data acquisition and storage software in real time mode several parameters of ocular perfusion and systemic functions were measured simultaneously. Blood flow parameters were measured in the ophthalmic artery by pulsed Doppler sonography and in the iris by laser Doppler flowmetry. Systolic, diastolic, and <b>mean</b> <b>velocities</b> of the ophthalmic artery peak <b>velocity</b> pulse <b>curve,</b> the ophthalmic artery <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> pulse <b>curve,</b> and the iris <b>velocity</b> pulse <b>curve</b> were estimated off line.

The iris <b>velocity</b> pulse <b>curve</b> was calculated by a special statistic procedure (ALDF).

The pulse curve of the ophthalmic artery showed significantly increased systolic and decreased diastolic velocities. The vascular resistance of the branches of the ophthalmic artery increased significantly. The iridal vasculature showed no significant change in blood cell velocity but an increased vascular resistance. It was observed that the elevated perfusion pressure was associated with an increased vascular resistance and a constant <b>mean</b> blood <b>velocity</b> in the ophthalmic artery and iridal vessels. The parallel elevation of vascular resistance and blood pressure during exercise may be the reason for a constant blood {{flow in the}} ophthalmic artery and the iris.

The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the accuracy of speckle tracking derived mitral annulus velocity compared with conventional pulsed wave Doppler measurements. METHODS: 2 D speckle tracking was acquired from the apical 4 -chamber view (QLab, Speckle SQ, Philips, Andover, MA) in 169 subjects. While using texture tracking, two small regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the septal (IVS) and lateral corners (LAT) of the mitral annulus. The software automatically tracked the ROIs frame-by-frame, yielding regional <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> of the mitral annulus throughout the cardiac cycle (synthetic pulsed wave Doppler; SPW). From these curves, peak systolic, early- and late-diastolic velocities of the mitral annulus (S'-SPW, E'-SPW, and A'-SPW) were measured. Peak systolic, early- and late-diastolic velocity in the mitral annulus (S', E', and A') by conventional pulsed wave tissue Doppler tracing were also obtained. RESULTS: Adequate ROI tracking was observed in 150 / 169 subjects in IVS and 139 / 169 subjects in LAT of the mitral annulus. All annular velocities derived from SPW were significantly lower than corresponding velocities obtained from conventional method in both IVS and LAT regions of the mitral annulus. However, significant correlation between S' (E', A') -SPW and S' (E', A') was observed. In particular, a good correlation between E'-SPW and E' was noted in both IVS (r= 0. 89, P 26 for predicting E/E' in IVS> 15, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 83 %, 97 %, and 94 %, respectively.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relation}} of the mitral flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> to left ventricular filling pressures in patients with two different types of myocardial problems: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Background. Previous studies have suggested that assessment of Doppler-derived mitral flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> can be used to predict left ventricular filling pressures in specific disease entities. However, it is unclear whether information derived from specific mitral flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> obtained from one disease entity can be valid in other disease states. Methods. The study group consisted of 42 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (group A) and 55 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (group B); both groups underwent simultaneous cardiac catheterization and were studied by Doppler echocardiography. High fidelity measures of left atrial and left ventricular pressures were obtained simultaneously with mitral flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves.</b> Results. There was a significant relation between the Doppler echocardiographic variables and mean left atrial pressure in group A patients. The left atrial pressure was directly related to the E/A ratio (r = 0. 49, p = 0. 004) and inversely related to the deceleration time (r = 0. 73, p < 0. 001). The sensitivity and specificity of the deceleration time, < 180 m/s, which indicated a mean left atrial pressure ≥ 20 mm Hg, were both 100 %. In group B patients, there was no significant relation between mean left atrial pressure and deceleration time. Conclusions. Doppler echocardiographic mitral flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> are useful in predicting and estimating left ventricular filling pressures in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. However, because of the complexity of the multiple interrelated factors that determine diastolic filling of the left ventricle, these flow <b>velocity</b> <b>curves</b> cannot be used in patients with other disease entities, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the clinical usefulness of the amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> method for quantitation of mitral regurgitation. Background. Amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> is a nonvolumetric method for calculating the mitral regurgitant fraction. Its previous validation at one center mandated an independent assessment of its usefulness and limitations. Methods. In 56 patients with and 16 patients without mitral regugitation, the regurgitant fraction was measured simultaneously by amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity,</b> quantitative Doppler study and quantitative two-dimensional echocardiography. In 16 patients, multiple gain settings were used to determine the influence of this variable on amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity.</b> Results. In ptients without regurgitation, amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> showed more scattering of regurgitant fraction (− 18 % to 23 %) than Doppler (p = 0. 016) or two-dimensional echocardiography (p = 0. 022). The absolute value of regurgitant fraction was (mean ± SD) 8 ± 6 %, 4 ± 2 % and 4 ± 3 %, respectively (p = NS). With increasing gain, the amplitudeweighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> mitral and aortic integrals increased, but the calculated regurgitant fraction remained unchanged. In patients with mitral regurgitation, significant correlation was found between amplitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> and Doppler study (r = 0. 79, p = 0. 0001) and between implitude-weighted <b>mean</b> <b>velocity</b> and two-dimensional echocardiography (r = 0. 76, p = 0. 0001) for calculated regurgitant fraction, but the standard error of the estimate (12 %) was large.

Compared with Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography, It shows more scattering of values in patients without regurgitation, but the methods correlate significantly in patients with mitral regurgitation.
