50|$|The {{roots of}} the American Welding Society stretch back to World War I, when the sudden demands of swiftly {{producing}} military equipment brought {{about the need for}} standardization of the manufacturing industry. An evolving <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> process, welding, suddenly became very necessary to enhance the war effort.

50|$|In {{high-temperature}} <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> processes (welding, brazing and soldering), {{the primary}} purpose of flux is to prevent oxidation of the base and filler materials. Tin-lead solder (e.g.) attaches very well to copper, but poorly to the various oxides of copper, which form quickly at soldering temperatures. Flux is a substance which is nearly inert at room temperature, but which becomes strongly reducing at elevated temperatures, preventing the formation of metal oxides. Additionally, flux allows solder to flow easily on the working piece rather than forming beads as it would otherwise.|$|E

40|$|Dissertation {{consists}} of introduction, four chapters, conclusions {{and a list}} of literature of 118 designations. Total dissertation size is 151 pages. It contains 23 tables, 5 figures, 45 graphs and 4 photographs. Actuality of the theme was substantiated, object and tasks of work were formulated, scientific novelty of obtained results and their practical significance were reported, tenets of defense were formulated and also publications of work results were enlisted. Review of scientific literature both on question of physical-mechanical features of metal surfaces and on question of interaction of conjugated surfaces during static contact and under shear conditions was implemented. Earlier known methods of use of surface coatings for <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> were reported and short review of foundation hypothesis of <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> during their combine plastic deformation was given. On base of analysis of existing "cold" methods of <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> (cold welding, cold soldering, cold shear welding) a conclusion was drawn considering necessity of an experimental testing of use of soft metal coatings in combination with shear in order to join metal specimens - so called cold shear soldering. Both experiment equipment and experiment method was described. Optimal routing for strenght test of soldered joining was worked out. After testing the well-known methods of experiments on strenght of joining it was decided to characterize the strenght of joining through strenght on edge (under normal load which equal to zero) that is carried out in the same direction because in this case there were obtained more stable results. Deduction of nondiscrete-logical model of process of cold shear soldering was implemented. On NL-model basis main technological parameters of process was determined. Afterwards their preliminary optimization was fulfilled. As pre-optimization result there were obtained values of parameters which were used later for optimization process by Box-Wilson method. Influence of main technological parameters to the process of cold shear soldering was investigated. Optimization of process using method of many-factors experiment planning was accomplished and optimal mode cold shear soldering was refined. The largest strenght of specimens joining was observed for specimens which were treated with emery paper M 40. Time of specimens hold-up on air after their treatment till shear has no significant influence of result. Optimal parameters were obtained as follows: thickness of tin covering on copper - equal to 0. 130 mm, value of specimens shear relatively each other -equal to 7 mm. Value of mormal loading is limited with experiment conditions. For our conditions of experiment optimal value was declared equal to 2600 N and shear exertion equal to 8500 N. Comparative analysis of rating and experimental values of actual contact area was implemented. Dependence of value of actual contact area on the main technological parameters was investigated. Basic normality of interaction of being sheared relatively each other metal solids and basic normality of joining formation mechanism under condition of simultaneous affection on contacting specimens the normal load and tangential displacements was described. Work contains results that confirm expediency of further study of cold shear soldering process. Possibility of its practical application is substantiated.

40|$|Abstract: The {{patenting}} of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{process in}} 1991 {{opened up a}} process that was known within a relatively small circle of researchers to the entire research community. As a ground-breaking process {{in the field of}} joining, FSW offered a chance for the types of joining that had been fraught with lots of difficulties using the prevalent traditional means of joining. Dissimilar <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> had been plagued with more challenges compared to similar <b>metal</b> <b>joining</b> due to issues related to differences in thermal expansion and conductivity, wettability, melting properties, microstructural properties and other material properties. Fusion welding of some dissimilar materials such as Aluminium and titanium; Aluminium and Steel had been nearly impossible; the few welds that were successful resulted in defects (like wormhole, lack of penetration, porosity, cracks) and welding imperfections. Hence, the advent of FSW, a solid state welding technique, provided {{a way out of the}} many difficulties that arise in the joining of dissimilar metals. Aluminium and copper are also two of such dissimilar metals whose material properties make them useful for a wide range of applications. However, due to the wide differences in their material properties, both metals had been difficult to join using the fusion welding technology. Recently, lots of successes have been achieved in the joining of both dissimilar metals using FSW and a lot of these are recorded in the open literature. Nonetheless, most of the successes recorded in the FSW of aluminium and copper have been in the butt weld configuration. Literatures abound on the FSW of aluminium and copper in butt configuration, while there are [...] . M. Phil. (Mechanical Engineering...|$|E

Another effect of braze welding is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings. The disadvantages are the loss of strength when subjected to high temperatures and the inability to withstand high stresses.|$|R
