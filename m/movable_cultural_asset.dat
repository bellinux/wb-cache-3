The {{fiduciary}} custody of cultural property under severe threat in the source state is limited in time and must occur under the auspices of UNESCO. To this end, international treaties are concluded; these also lay down the rules governing such arrangements. The provision of safe havens is in keeping with the Swiss humanitarian tradition. Indeed, Switzerland was the first country in the world to offer refuge of this kind.|$|R
30|$|Finally, the PROPAINT project, “Improved {{protection}} of paintings during exhibition, storage and transit”, (2007 − 2010) is implemented within the EU 6 th Framework Programme, Priority 8.1 “Policy oriented research” [64]. Measurements {{of air pollution}} and climate inside and just outside of microclimate frames with and without paintings in 12 museum sites and 1 frame making company in Europe have been performed. It was shown that levels of volatile organic acids should also be considered, and this is currently being followed up in the new MEMORI project. The MEMORI project, “Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on <b>Movable</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Assets.</b> Innovative Research for Market Transfer”, is implemented within the EU 7 th Framework Programme. The project started on November 1, 2010 and has a duration of 36 month. The aim of the MEMORI project is to provide the conservation market with innovative, non destructive, early warning technology for easy assessment of environmental impact on indoor cultural heritage. In addition a preventive strategy to secure the conservation of <b>movable</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> in protective enclosures has been developed. Also, the current pollution situation and management of perhaps materials emitting unsuitable or corrosive gases were explored. In addition, correlations between the expenses for collection care (preventive conservation; monitoring of the environmental conditions (T/RH/HV); pollutant measurement (airborne pollutants and dust/particles/soiling) and the possible influencing factors were analyzed. For this propose univariate and bivariate frequency distributions were used. Its study design {{is based on the}} interviews were organized by an online questionnaire and an automatically readable pdf-questionnaire [65].|$|R

Therefore, risk assessment studies should maintain periodicaly to avoid deterioration of the cultural heritage objects which are located indoor. National and international conservation standards should ensured which are existed under threshold values for cultural heritage objects (museum colections and library-archive materials that ensure unique knowledge) where in key areas (display, reading, storage etc.) In this study, it is emphasized that both indoor and outdoor oriented air pollutants exposure effects to objects. One of the EU Projects (EU-FP 7) MEMORI (Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on <b>Movable</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Assets</b> – Innovative Research for Market Transfer) dosimeters (EWO, GSD) are used for exposure measurements. To limit and to eliminate of the indoor and outdoor oriented air pollutant effects preventive measures should be taken and implemented “extensive air pollutants management” at the museum, library and archive institutions. To understand existing air pollution risk monitoring (diagnostic), cleanliness, material selection, filtration such proactive measure methods should be implemented (protection) and it is {{needs to be addressed}} on priority basis that precious cultural heritage objects should be transferred for future generations safely...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary studies}} {{and work in}} progress {{in the framework of}} two FP 7 projects: MEMORI (Measurement, Effect Assessment and Mitigation of Pollutant Impact on <b>Movable</b> <b>Cultural</b> <b>Assets</b> - Innovative Research for Market Transfer) and NANOFORART (Nano-materials for the conservation and preservation of movable and immovable artworks). One of the aims of the MEMORI project is the determination of threshold levels of damage to exposed organic-based heritage objects as {{little is known about the}} impact of organic compounds, especially volatile organic acids, on organic-based cultural objects. In the previous PROPAINT project (Protection of Paintings during Exhibition, Storage Transit) it was recently demonstrated that levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were often much higher in the micro-climate frames used to protect paintings than recommended levels. In this paper, examples will be given of changes observed in varnished strips exposed at selected sites. Studies on the effect on collagen-based materials will also be presented. Techniques used in both projects include Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA), micro-thermal analysis (μ-TA), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The NANOFORART project explores the effects of using nanoparticle-based conservation treatment on cellulosic and collagen-based cultural materials. It builds on previous work performed on deacidification of canvas paintings using conventional materials. For collagen-based materials, no previous conservation treatment using nanoparticles has been performed on historical parchment or leather objects. Preliminary work is directed at understanding the type of nanoparticles to use to improve the physicochemical state of collagen-based objects.

We apply this framework to the case of transposition and implementation of the EU rules regarding <b>movable</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage in Bulgaria. We find different implementation outcomes stemming from one and the same formal policy. Due to high levels of polarization between political decision makers, the implementing actors have broad discretion to apply different informal policies. In depth analysis of implementation also suggests that under these conditions different implementing players have followed their normative orientations and applied completely different informal policies. Different implementing actors apply different policies and, thus, as it were, they live in parallel universes where different implementation practices exist...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic {{justification for the}} protection of cultural property rights of indigenous groups. Cultural property either in the form of traditional knowledge or folklore carries the potential to increase wealth by adding to the knowledge base of an economy. But in order to ensure efficient use of <b>cultural</b> <b>assets,</b> the law should provide protection from overexploitation which is likely to occur as <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> can be characterized as a common pool resource. In contrast to other intellectual property such as inventions cultural goods are primarily provided by intrinsic motivation. External effects of using them in the production of other goods could crowd out this motivation. If <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> are part of the knowledge base of an economy, as argued here, protection of <b>cultural</b> <b>assets</b> should be implemented by either specific regulation by the state or the creation of property rights which can be traded on markets. International law should endeavour to provide a framework with lowest possible transaction costs while securing <b>cultural</b> <b>assets.</b> Intellectual property rights, Cultural property rights, common pool resource, knowledge base...|$|R
