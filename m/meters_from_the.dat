5|$|Construction of {{the launch}} site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the {{majority}} of the system was built above ground in a single-floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half-pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of <b>meters</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 <b>meters</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prior location, with the original location still being used for staff meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed tables. On each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} {{keep an eye on the}} chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E

It is located many hundred <b>meters</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> metro station, and the two do not offer inter{{connection}}s. There is a shorter connection to the Gjøvik Line at Storo (that connects with Grefsen Station). Nydalen also serves several bus routes. Line 37 via the city center to Helsfyr operates from across the street at Nydalen, while additional buses are located somewhat further away. They consist a feeder service to Lillo Terrasse (line 55) as well as lines 30 to Bygdøy, 51 to Maridalen and 58 to Helsfyr.|$|E
5|$|With no {{easy way}} to cross the river, Castañeda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 <b>meters)</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river. Three Texians hurried to bury the cannon, while others {{traveled}} to nearby communities to ask for assistance. By the end of the day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus. Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.|$|E
5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, the Syrians started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} armored vehicles and an infantry company. The Syrians pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred <b>meters</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, the Syrians halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E

The lateral distribution shows a characteristic hump {{at a distance}} of approx. 135 <b>meter</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> core.
