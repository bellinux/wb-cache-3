According to different fitness habits, sixty four middle-aged women {{were divided into two}} groups:fitness group and non fitness group. After gathering the information of their BFP, body circumference and two derived indices BMI and WHR respectively during the independent measuring, correlation analysis and stepwise sifting regression analysis were made. Finally, the predicted regressive equation of estimating the middle-aged female BFP was worked out. To the women in fitness group,the correlation of WHR and BFP reaches <b>maximum,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>r</b> = 0. 854; the correlation of BMI and BFP reaches minimum, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>r</b> = 0. 657. To the women in non fitness group, the correlation of BMI and BFP reaches <b>maximum,</b> <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>r</b> = 0. 877; the correlation of WHR and BFP reaches minimum, <b>i.</b> <b>e.</b> <b>r</b> = 0. 753. That is to say,it is different for fitness group and non fitness group to identify obesity levels by using BMI,WC,HC and WHR. This study established the proper formula to calculate the fat percentage for middle-aged women: Fat % to fitness group by y = 38. 514 × WHR - 1. 7043; Fat % to non fitness group by y = 3. 481 + 0. 112 × HC + 0. 943 × BMI. It is different for fitness group and non fitness group to identify obesity levels of middle-aged women by using single criterion (BMI or WHR). BFP of middle-aged women could be easily worked out via the optimized equation, which takes BMI, WHR and body circumference as independent variables and BFP of middle-aged women as dependent variable and sets up the regressive equation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Leslie {{matrices}} {{and life}} tables are demographic models {{commonly used to}} evaluate the ability of specific elasmobranch life history strategies to sustain given levels and patterns of fishing pressure. These models are generally density independent and provide an instantaneous rate of population growth for a specified set of life history traits that correspond to a specific population size. Many investigators are using these models to compute rates of population growth that they claim are estimates of the maximum population growth rate (r intrinsic); they then use these estimates to compute purported estimates of maximum sustainable fishing mortality. However, neither a Leslie matrix nor a life table can be used to estimate r intrinsic without additional information, except in the special case where a severely depleted population is modeled. Only in a severely depleted population will competition for resources be at a minimum and both density-dependent compensation and the rate of population growth be at a <b>maximum</b> (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> at <b>r</b> intrinsic). The fundamental problem is to determine the life history parameters that would occur if the population were extremely depleted becaus...|$|R

40|$|The {{origins of}} neural systems remain unresolved. In {{contrast}} to other basal metazoans, ctenophores (comb jellies) have both complex nervous and mesoderm-derived muscular systems. These holoplanktonic predators also have sophisticated ciliated locomotion, behaviour and distinct development. Here we present the draft genome of Pleurobrachia bachei, Pacific sea gooseberry, together with ten other ctenophore transcriptomes, {{and show that}} they are remarkably distinct from other animal genomes in their content of neurogenic, immune and developmental genes. Our integrative analyses place Ctenophora as the earliest lineage within Metazoa. This hypothesis is supported by comparative analysis of multiple gene families, including the apparent absence of HOX genes, canonical microRNA machinery, and reduced immune complement in ctenophores. Although two distinct nervous systems are well recognized in ctenophores, many bilaterian neuron-specific genes and genes of 'classical' neurotransmitter pathways either are absent or, if present, are not expressed in neurons. Our metabolomic and physiological data are consistent with the hypothesis that ctenophore neural systems, and possibly muscle specification, evolved independently from those in other animals.
