40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} capital {{charging}} system {{implemented in the}} National Health Service in Scotland, probing its intellectual coherence and implementa- tion. Asset valuations may be too high because {{of the decision to}} value at Depreciated Replacement Cost (even when higher than market value) and the decision to disregard the issues raised by <b>Modern</b> <b>Equivalent</b> <b>Asset</b> methodology. The incentive effects of capital charges are complex: historically good maintenance may be penalised, and economic and financial appraisal of new projects may give conflicting signals. Capital charging differently affects Hospital Trusts and Directly Managed Units. Moreover, the interaction of capital charging and the public corporation status of Hospital Trusts inflates gross public expenditure on health...|$|E
40|$|Capital {{charging}} {{occurs when}} public or quasi-public providers of public services must explicitly {{pay for their}} capital through the mechanism of an annual charge based upon the value of assets used in service provision. The rationale is that no longer treating capital as a 'free good' will lead to improvements in productive efficiency. Attempts to make public sector financial management more closely approximate private sector models inevitably encounter the twin problems of measuring public sector output and valuing public sector capital. For asset valuation, use {{has been made in}} the National Health Service (NHS) of depreciated replacement cost (DRC), making the assumption that existing assets will be replaced on a like-for-like basis, rather than valuing with reference to the <b>modern</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>asset.</b> Four interrelated technical problems with DRC in the NHS are distinguished, all suggesting overvaluation: it cannot safely be assumed that a building is worth the sum of its component parts; hospitals consist of different vintages of buildings, of markedly different suitabilities for current healthcare provision; the configuration of buildings on particular sites can dramatically affect rationalization possibilities; and there are profound difficulties within the DRC framework of determining what constitutes capital expenditure. Further complications arise from the fact that a growing proportion of hospital buildings is architecturally listed, and from the new policy commitment to expand the role of privately financed assets (which fall outside the capital charging system) ...|$|E
40|$|In many {{countries}} worldwide access networks {{are in the}} transition from copper to fiber access. During the transition phase copper and fiber networks are operated in parallel. All regulators facing this situation of technological change have {{to decide how to}} price unbundled access to the copper loop in this transition phase. Should they keep the usual forward looking long-run incremental cost standard charge, or should they move to some different approach? The authors propose to price copper access based on the <b>modern</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>asset</b> (MEA) of fiber access. Since fiber access is superior to copper access, the cost of fiber access (as a basis for pricing copper access) should, however, be corrected by the performance delta between copper and fiber access. Instead of using quality of service (QoS) differences, the authors determine the performance delta based on the market valuation of services provided over the copper and fiber access represented by the end-user prices of services and corrected by cost differences downstream of the access provision. Under this approach an access seeker becomes indifferent (on the margin) between using the copper or the fiber access network and wholesale pricing (or regulation) becomes competitively neutral towards technology choice between copper and fiber access and does not distort the platform competition towards cable. To test its practicability numerical simulations of the approach are performed by means of a quantitative competition model. The model analysis suggests that the approach leads to unique and robust results. Its main conclusion is that the method tends to be conservative relative to the theoretical case of pure vertical product differentiation, meaning that the measured performance delta underestimates the theoretical performance delta...|$|E
