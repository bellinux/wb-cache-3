5|$|A year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the {{organization}} had exceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production had declined only slightly from its peak, world markets {{appeared to be}} oversupplied by at least 2 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> despite war-torn Libya pumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major adjustments to withstand prices as low as the $40s, Indonesia was rejoining the export organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder, Iranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international sanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were committing to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies were becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these market pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling until the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-fourth of its high from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Oil shale {{is one of}} the world‘s most {{important}} energy resources. The world resource of oil shale is estimated to be 1500 trillion (1. 5 ~ 1014) short tons with an energy content of approximately 10 I 6 barrels. A rich oil shale will yield 30 - 40 barrels of oil/ton of oil shale. A <b>million</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> industry would require the processing of approximately 5 X 10 R tons/yr of shale (a single plant would process 25 X 106 tons/yr). Interdisciplinary research being conducted to determine the potential impact of such a large industry on human health is described, in such areas as release of suspected carcinogens and toxic trace metals, worker safetv. and exDosure to oil. gas. and water. Research by other groups in the U. S. working on _, this important issue is also summarized. Oil shale is an organic-rich shale which yields 10 - 100 gallons of oil/ton by the use of conventional distilla-tion methods. There are important oil shale deposits throughout the world and, indeed, oil shale {{has been used as a}} source of oil in various parts of the world for the past 125 years.

He added that the production of oil had reached 1.55 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> the previous week, almost pre-war levels. However, by September 2013, armed groups were blockading oilfields, cutting production to about 100,000 barrels per day, leading to some fuel shortages and blackouts.

25|$|Iran {{has been}} storing some unsold oil on tankers in the Persian Gulf, {{and it is}} {{building}} new storage tanks on shore. Iran has stored excess oil (21 million barrels, according to Citigroup Global Markets) {{to try to keep}} production levels up—shutting down wells risks harming them and it is costly and time consuming to resume production at a well that has been shut. However, since July 2012, Iran reportedly has been forced to shut down some wells, and overall oil production has fallen to about 2.6 <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>day</b> from the level of nearly 4.0 mbd at the end of 2011.|$|E

About 80 {{percent of the}} world's readily accessible reserves {{are located in the}} Middle East, with 62.5 percent coming from the Arab 5: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait. A large portion of the world's total oil exists as unconventional sources, such as bitumen in Canada and extra heavy oil in Venezuela. While significant volumes of oil are extracted from oil sands, particularly in Canada, logistical and technical hurdles remain, as oil extraction requires large amounts of heat and water, making its net energy content quite low relative to conventional crude oil.

40|$|The Nation has {{embarked}} on an aggressive program to develop its indigenous resources of geothermal energy. For more than a decade, geothermal energy has been heralded {{as one of the}} more promising forms of energy alternate to oil and gas for electric power generation, but during the last fifteen years, the total capacity in the U. S. has reached 502 MWe, about half the size of a single modern nuclear power plant. And yet, the United States, especially its western and Gulf coast states, is believed to possess a vast resource base of geothermal heat at depths up to 3 to 10 km. Many estimates of these potential resources suitable for the production of electric power have been published and they range over a spectrum of more than a factor of 100. This variation suggests that the potential is essentially unknown. Table 1 gives a range of published forecasts for the year 1985 and the equivalent potential in number of 1000 Mwe power plants and in oil consumption in <b>millions</b> of <b>barrels</b> <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> In view of the estimated construction of about 200 to 250 nuclear power reactors by 1985 - 90, the pessimistic forecasts clearly show that the contribution of geothermal energy to the Nation's energy supply may indeed be small. The optimistic forecasts represent more than 15 % of the total electric power requirements estimated for the year 1985. The Task Force for Geothermal Energy, in the Federal Energy Administration Project Independence Blueprint report of November 1974, established a national goal for 1985 of 20, 000 to 30, 000 MWe, the latter value representing an equivalent energy supply of one <b>million</b> <b>barrels</b> of oil <b>per</b> <b>day.</b> This goal was clearly a compromise between what is worth a national effort and what might be realistically achieved.
