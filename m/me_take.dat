5|$|Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical film {{depicting}} {{the murder of}} John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was {{written and directed by}} Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche.|$|E

25|$|Following the murder, and for {{the first}} six years in Attica, Chapman refused all {{requests}} for interviews. James R. Gaines interviewed him and wrote a three-part, 18,000-word People magazine series in February and March 1987. Chapman told the parole board he regretted the interview. Chapman later gave a series of audio-taped interviews to Jack Jones of the Democrat and Chronicle. In 1992 Jones published a book, Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon.|$|E

The song was {{released}} as the album's second single on 15 August 2012. It was written, composed and produced by Yasutaka Nakata. The song is a dance pop track, which features instrumentation from synthesizers and keyboards.

500|$|Keeping in {{line with}} the most {{prominent}} theme of Beyoncé, [...] "Rocket" [...] explores frank female sexuality. It opens with Beyoncé expressing feelings of lust in the first line, [...] "Let me sit this assssss [...] on ya" [...] for which she adopts a soft and sultry vocal style. She further sings about love-making with a male lover and the second line includes the lyrics: [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> this off while you watch me / that's my'ass appeal". It features explicit and metaphorical lyrics throughout and sees Beyoncé instructing her love interest to watch her perform a striptease. She further talks about how their evening together is going to proceed with lyrics such as [...] "If you like you can touch it babe, do you wanna touch it baby?".|$|E
500|$|Ahead of {{the second}} season, Fazekas {{explained}} that after Carter turned Sousa {{down at the end}} of the first season, saying [...] "Oh, let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> a rain check. I have something to do", Carter felt like a potential relationship was something she could consider, while Sousa [...] "felt like he missed an opportunity there." [...] Because of that, Sousa moved to Los Angeles to avoid Carter, and [...] "They haven’t spoken since he left. There’s that interesting awkward [...] when they start working together again. But now Sousa has got a girlfriend and it’s very serious, so that’s a new thing for Peggy to deal with." [...] Though Sousa and Carter do eventually get together in the second season finale, the executive producers warned that this did not necessarily mean Sousa is Carter's future husband, who was first mentioned in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.|$|E

500|$|The real Mark David Chapman is {{currently}} incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, {{he has not}} spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title [...] "Chapter 27" [...] suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has 26 chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, {{to the point of}} attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.|$|E

Nevertheless, Halifax pulled away with the 125–91 victory, putting them one win away from the title. Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us. A couple of us can play like that, myself included, and we came out tonight and I told them 'hey, let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> the hits, I'm used to that. You guys play your normal game.' We play the way we play, and it doesn't matter how they play." [...] According to The Chronicle Herald, [...] "the game featured several incidents that threatened to escalate into a full-scale brawl." [...] The teams' coaches would frequently have to break up skirmishes and confront officials for what they felt were bad calls.|$|E

The recording lyrically finds Sarkodie discussing that he's the [...] "new guy" [...] in the music industry. [...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> you to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's up to me to make sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E

500|$|As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino {{developed}} {{the story for}} Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would [...] "death-proof" [...] their cars. As {{long as they were}} driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60mph (97km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his [...] "death-proof" [...] car. Tarantino remembers, [...] "I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Kapadia {{portrayed the}} title role of Leela in Leela, an American {{production}} directed by Somnath Sen and co-starring Deepti Naval, Vinod Khanna and Amol Mhatre. Kapadia's part—written specially for her—is that of a forty-year-old married woman and a Mumbai University professor, who, {{after the death of}} her mother, loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California. The story follows Leela's acclimation to her new surroundings and particularly her relationship with one of her students there, Kris (Mhatre), a young Indian-American man. Kapadia noted about working in the film, [...] "While in production, I'm all tensed up, and that is what makes <b>me</b> <b>take</b> my acting to the next level." [...] Maitland McDonagh from TV Guide wrote, [...] "Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama... intelligent, nuanced performance is the film's highlight." [...] Ziya Us Salam from The Hindu called her [...] "a charmer all the way. Exhilarating is the air she breathes, bewitching is the glance she casts and enticingly vulnerable is her condition." ...|$|E
500|$|Canadian singer Bryan Adams has {{released}} thirteen studio albums, six compilation albums, two soundtrack albums, four live albums, and sixty-nine singles. After {{the success of}} his debut single, [...] "Let <b>Me</b> <b>Take</b> You Dancing" [...] (1979), Adams signed a recording contract with A Records. Bryan Adams (1980), his debut album, peaked at number 69 on the Canadian RPM Albums Chart. Adams followed this with You Want It You Got It (1981), which peaked at number 118 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold in Canada. Cuts Like a Knife, his third release, became his first successful work outside Canada. The album charted within the top ten in Canada and the United States and was certified three-times platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Reckless (1984), his fourth studio album, selling over 12 million copies worldwide and featured the hit singles [...] "Run to You", [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Summer of '69".

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{three distinct}} {{versions of the}} song. After Lennon played the song for the other Beatles on his acoustic guitar, the band recorded the first take. Lennon played an Epiphone Casino; McCartney played a Mellotron, a tape replay keyboard instrument purchased by Lennon in August 1965 (with another model hired in after encouragement from keyboardist Mike Pinder of the Moody Blues); George Harrison played electric slide guitar, and Ringo Starr played drums. The first recorded take began with the verse [...] "Living is easy …", instead of the chorus, [...] "Let <b>me</b> <b>take</b> you down", which starts the released version. The first verse also led directly to the second, with no chorus between. Lennon's vocals were automatically double-tracked from the words [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] {{through the end of}} the last verse. The last verse, beginning [...] "Always, no sometimes", has three-part harmonies, with McCartney and Harrison singing [...] "dreamy background vocals". This version was soon abandoned and went unreleased until the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996.|$|E
500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed <b>me!</b> <b>Take</b> the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Théodore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".|$|E
500|$|Momolo Mortara {{followed}} the Italian Army into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he {{was preceded by}} his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his {{hand in front of}} him and shouted: [...] "Get back, Satan!" [...] When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: [...] "Before you get any closer to <b>me,</b> <b>take</b> off that assassin's uniform." [...] Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: [...] "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [...] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." [...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E
