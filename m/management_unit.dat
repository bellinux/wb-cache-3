5|$|Teaching {{design to}} {{managers}} was pioneered at the London Business School (LBS) in 1976 by Peter Gorb (1926-2013), the first Honorary Fellow of the DMI and a long-standing Fellow of the RSA. Gorb had previously embedded design {{management in the}} Burton Retail Group before joining LBS where he later founded the Design <b>Management</b> <b>Unit</b> in 1982 (in collaboration with Charles Handy) which he led for over 20 years. In 1979 his talk at the RSA entitled Design and its Use by Managers provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, and {{an appreciation of the}} power of design as a management resource. Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design <b>Management</b> <b>Unit</b> at LBS, Design Talks (1988) with Eric Schneider and Design Management: Papers from the London Business School (1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design, design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).|$|E

Several Canadian outfitters provide trips on the river near Kootenay National Park ranging from a few hours to several days. Canoeing in the numerous sloughs, side-channels and distributaries of the Kootenay that thread through the wetlands of the Kootenay Flats has the additional benefit of watching birds and wildlife in the Creston Valley Wildlife <b>Management</b> <b>Unit</b> and other surrounding marshes. Larger craft such as houseboats are able to travel on Kootenay and Koocanusa Lakes.

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{specific}} {{role in the}} fate of natural resources of landscapes, riparian lands are considered as landscape <b>management</b> <b>units.</b> Yet, {{they are part of}} many farms: In what way does this influence their land use and sustainability? In this article, farm riparian land was defined as the set of riparian fields of a given farm. Our aim was to evaluate farm riparian lands as farm <b>management</b> <b>units</b> and the balance between technical and ecological functions associated with farm riparian land-use types. Technical functions designated the role of land use in elaborating farm production and maintaining farm territory. Ecological functions corresponded to farm riparian land-use intensity and ratio of permanent vegetation. The analysis was carried on 102 farms from 5 study sites representative of dairy agriculture and landscapes in a region straddling Brittany and Normandy (France). Farm riparian land-use types were identified using statistical clustering. Technical and ecological functions associated with land-use types were expressed in the light of agronomy and landscape ecology expertise. Descriptors of farm holdings and farm riparian land were tested as explanatory factors of farm riparian land-use types. The use of farm riparian lands was diverse but well defined; they proved to be farm <b>management</b> <b>units.</b> Compatibilities or antagonisms between technical and ecological functions were underscored according to farm riparian land-use type. We argued that decision support could gain in combining perspectives on riparian lands as landscape <b>management</b> <b>units</b> and farm <b>management</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
