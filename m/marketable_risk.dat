Firstly, this paper established the profit model of supply chain without any insurance. Then the crop revenue insurance is introduced into the supply chain, {{and the impact of}} supply chain is discussed and profit optimization of the supply chain with yield insurance and crop revenue insurance is analyzed as well. Finally, a numerical example is used to verify the results. The study shows that the supply chain system can be optimized through crop revenue insurance based on the principle of sharing insurance cost and claim, which can make up profit loss of natural risk and market price risk...|$|E
40|$|Microeconomic theory {{shows that}} only under certain {{conditions}} higher background risk increases the propensity to insure against independent <b>marketable</b> <b>risks.</b> We pro-vide empirical evidence for the case of labor income risk and car insurance in the UK. The main result is that households with higher labor income risk spend more on insur-ance. This {{finding is consistent with}} microeconomic theory if the utility function is of the HARA type. Moreover, we find that households spend more on insurance if they participate in the stock market. ...|$|R
40|$|Microeconomic theory {{predicts that}} under certain {{regularity}} conditions higher idiosyncratic risk increases the propensity to insure against independent <b>marketable</b> <b>risks.</b> We apply these predictions {{to the specific}} case of labor income risk and car insurance {{using data from the}} UK. The main empirical results are: ? higher labor income risk induces a higher demand for car insurance. ? the effects of increases in labor income risk after 1979 seem to be more than offset by a more liberal financial market. ? the effects seem to be important on the macro level in the 70 s whereas they become negligible in the 80 s and 90 s...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{management}} in agriculture {{is a major}} policy issue in current EU agriculture policy reforms. Public support systems may play two different roles, one as a device to deliver disaster assistance and another to enhance insurance for <b>marketable</b> <b>risks.</b> This paper {{contributes to the literature}} by analysing the trade-offs between providing catastrophic assistance and subsidizing insurance premiums. The goal of the study is to highlight policy options that are coherent in stabilizing income volatility while limiting distortions of public intervention. In this study, farmer incomes were first modelled using Monte Carlo simulation, and options were then ranked by applying the stochastic efficiency with respect to a function. The results suggest that, if catastrophic assistance is available, even higher insurance support is needed to make it a preferred option. The results highlight the fact that well defined and credible ex ante rules for the use of disaster assistance are essential to enable insurance markets to develop. One possibility would be to make a farmer’s eligibility for disaster aid conditional on his or her participation in the insurance programmes. 201...|$|R

The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, <b>marketable</b> intermediate <b>risks</b> that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The main focus of risk management policy in Australia is drought risk and this paper assesses the objective and instruments of the country. s national drought policy framework. climate change, agricultural policy, catastrophic risk, bio-security, cost sharing, index insurance, risk-management, drought policy...|$|R

The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, <b>marketable</b> intermediate <b>risks</b> that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The Spanish risk management system is dominated by public insurance. Two main policy issues are discussed in this paper. First, {{the contribution of the}} insurance system to market efficiency; this comes from the information sharing arrangement in the public private partnership, rather than from the premium subsidies. Second, the insurance system as a device for catastrophic assistance. public-private partnerships, agricultural policy, catastrophic risk insurance, information sharing, risk-management...|$|R

The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, <b>marketable</b> intermediate <b>risks</b> that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The main policy issue in this report {{is the definition of}} the boundaries of these different layers. In Canada the system is overcrowded with policies and unable to signal risk layers in which farmers should take their own responsibility of management. Policies include AgriInvest, AgriInsurance, AgriStability, AgriRecovery and ad hoc measures. The analysis of AgriStability provides insights about the economics of agricultural income stabilization policies. agricultural policy, montecarlo simulations, catastrophic risk income stabilization, policy targeting, insurance, risk-management...|$|R

The policy analysis is structured around three layers of risk that require a differentiated policy response: normal (frequent) risks that should be retained by the farmer, <b>marketable</b> intermediate <b>risks</b> that can be transferred through market tools, and catastrophic risk that requires government assistance. The main risk-related policies in the Netherlands are implemented {{as part of the}} EU policy framework. Specifically, national policies focus on the management of catastrophic risks by promoting public-private partnerships, such as Livestock Veterinary Fund, to manage the costs of livestock epidemics. The mutual insurance companies specialised in the coverage of specific types of risks are also promoted, with some of them receiving start-up capital and re-insurance support. The recently launched subsidised multi-peril yield insurance exploits the new opportunities created by the EU framework. agricultural policy, muti-peril insurance, pest and disease risk, risk-management, risk perceptions, Livestock Veterinary Fund...|$|R
40|$|Lifetime consumption-portfolio {{rules are}} {{analyzed}} {{for individuals with}} nonmarketable income. Future income for which liquidity constraints are not binding is "effectively marketable" and is capitalized, while other income is not capitalized. If the age-income profile is humped, then, for a given level of <b>marketable</b> wealth, relative <b>risk</b> aversion to gambles in marketable wealth is low for the middle-aged and high for the retired in the special case of isoelastic utility. The existence of these clienteles suggests that equilibrium security prices are determined, in part, by the distribution of wealth over age groups in the economy.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether two {{well documented}} financial market anomalies - the "Mehra & Prescott puzzles" and the dividend controversy - {{can be resolved}} by allowing {{for the effects of}} uninsurable risks. The dissertation contains an extensive review of the theory of consumption based asset pricing and the Mehra & Prescott puzzles. This provides more comprehensive coverage of this material than any previous review of the area: see chapters 2 & 3. The role that uninsurable risk might play in resolving market anomalies is clearly demonstrated. Three chapters of substantive original contribution follow that examine: (i) the predicted equity premium when <b>marketable</b> and nonmarketable <b>risks</b> are independent (ii) the potential relevance of aggregate dividends to equilibrium asset prices in economies with idiosyncratic endowment shocks and (iii) the response of the stock market and riskfree rate to unemployment shocks. The main findings are: (i) Chapter 4 : an integrated approach to local proper risk aversion is presented and a new form of risk aversion emerges naturally (ii) Chapter 4 : it will not, in general, be possible to make accurate quantitative predictions concerning the impact of a small probability, high impact, negative shock to endowment ("unemployment") on asset prices on the basis of current knowledge concerning investor preferences (iii) Chapter 5 : aggregate dividends are shown {{to play an important role}} in helping individuals to consumption smooth in incomplete markets if the level of aggregate investment is uncertain. The observed behaviour of dividend smoothing and concentrating rights issues into times of economic prosperity is consistent with the model that is presented (iv) Chapter 6 : the rise (fall) in the riskfree rate prior to "bad" ("good") unemployment news does not appear to be consistent with precautionary savings behaviour. It is concluded that, while incomplete market models have great theoretical strength and some empirical support, 'Current applications of this theory leave many issues unresolved...|$|R
