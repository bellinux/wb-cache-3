25|$|The term heterophobia is {{confusing}} {{for some people}} for several reasons. On the one hand, some {{look at it as}} just another of the many <b>me-too</b> social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} gameplay, and the game's use of analog controls. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution {{wrote that the}} {{innovative}} controls {{were one of the}} game's standout features. GameSpot's Peter Bartholow declared the controls [...] "beautifully executed", praising the ease of use. Doug Perry of IGN felt that, while the controls are initially difficult, using the analog sticks became [...] "new and refreshing". Scott Alan Marriott of AllGame similarly noted the initial difficulty of the controls, but found it easier upon continued play, particularly praising the raft controls.

5000|$|On March 1, 2008, channel 48 {{adopted a}} new {{programming}} format as [...] "MeToo", {{serving as an}} extension of WWME's MeTV classic television format; accordingly, the station changed its callsign to WMEU-CA. The ethnic programming that was dropped by WMEU returned to WCIU through the launch of a new locally programmed service called [...] "FBT" [...] on digital subchannel 26.6 (FBT was dropped on December 1, 2010 and was replaced by a simulcast of WCIU-TV until the subchannel was removed on December 15). Prime time feature films were added to the station's schedule on June 30, 2008, when WMEU-CA debuted <b>Me-Too's</b> Movie Classics, which showcased classic films from the 1950s to the 1970s without editing - outside of necessary removal of inapporiate content - at 7:00 p.m. each weeknight. In an effort to streamline the schedules of both MeTV stations, on September 14, 2009, WMEU's MeToo schedule was restructured to feature only dramatic programs and films while the MeTV schedule on WWME was reformatted to mainly feature comedic series.|$|R

GameDaily named Rufus the strangest {{of the new}} characters introduced in Street Fighter IV, placing him 12th on their [...] "Most Bizarre Fighting Characters" [...] list and noting his high attack speed despite his weight. IGN described Rufus {{as one of the}} most interesting new characters introduced in the title, due to the [...] "juxtaposition between his comical size and impressive speed" [...] and added that his attack set [...] "shows that if you can get past Rufus' comical exterior, a capable fighter hides within." [...] IGN AU stated that while they felt the character was the ugliest in the game, they enjoyed his unpredictability and acrobatics, as well as his attitude. 1UP.com called Rufus a worthy addition to the series, [...] "despite...outward, <b>me-too</b> appearances". Anime News Network described Rufus as well-designed and engaging, despite initial reservations regarding the character. VideoGamer.com praised Rufus as one of the game's better new characters in the title, in heavy contrast to other additions such as Crimson Viper. GameTrailers praised the character and noted he [...] "definitely offered something different", adding [...] "You may not have expected a game's most obvious jiggle physics to apply to a male character." [...] Stars and Stripes noted the level of detail in Rufus's animations and movements, describing his mobility as [...] "weirdly awesome".|$|E

Nevertheless, Bruce Roth and his bosses, Roger Newton and Ronald Cresswell, in 1985 convinced company executives to move the compound into expensive clinical trials. Early results comparing atorvastatin vs. simvastatin demonstrated that atorvastatin was significantly more potent and displayed fewer side effects.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII.

5000|$|A <b>Me-too</b> drug is a {{drug product}} that {{contains}} an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API, or in common parlance the drug) which is chemically related, and usually very structurally similar, to an existing active pharmaceutical ingredient.

This term is usually used in a negative way (the idea being the [...] "me-too" [...] drug simply rode the coattails of the research and development done to develop the prototype API), but {{it is worth noting that}} <b>me-too</b> drugs can be novel compounds themselves, and drug products containing them can serve as market competition, driving prices down. [...] "This has meant that as soon as a prototype drug becomes available several other similarly active compounds immediately follow.
