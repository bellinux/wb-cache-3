Her work {{is described as}} a <b>material</b> <b>exploration</b> and the visual depiction of an interior and mysterious world. Her work is compared to that of Willem De Kooning, Jean-Paul Riopelle [...] and Anselm Kiefer. Everett describes her work as, “the desire to give substance to things in the world that are not visible - the internal, the emotional, the spiritual -a way of attempting to assign to these concerns a more specific place in a world that seems to have already too much weight, gravity, density”.|$|E
50|$|When {{she began}} making art {{her work was}} largely collage and drawings. She {{was working in the}} 1960s, when Abstract Expression was popular, and she was torn between {{abstract}} art and her love for <b>material</b> <b>exploration.</b> At 23, Grossman had her first solo exhibition at the Kasner gallery in New York City. Her artwork included collages, constructions, drawings, and paintings. In 1964 she moved to Elderidge Street in Chinatown and continued to work there. Her move afforded her more space, so she began assembling free standing pieces and wall assemblages of at least six feet by four feet.|$|E
30|$|Framing {{the design}} process by means of <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> allows a {{designer}} to continuously try out new ideas, and thus expand the design space, or broad context of use (e.g., relaxation, protection, cocktail dress). However, it doesn’t support decision-making or depth. There is always a new context, a new application, a new idea that can alter the design. Moreover, the concepts remain in an early stage, a first answer to a challenge (e.g., what if it could…). In this approach, reasoning is driven by how ideas fit with materials at hand, making it imagined but not lived. This process is not uncommon in DIY communities where statements like wouldn’t it be cool to… exemplify a continuous search for the ‘next cool thing’. <b>Material</b> <b>explorations</b> {{for the sake of}} <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> may thus avoid engaging in deep ways with personal meaning and societal value.|$|R
30|$|The {{design process}} for Open Up {{relied heavily on}} <b>material</b> <b>explorations</b> of {{mechanisms}} that can trigger movement: wind-catching nets, rods, and their attachment to the body through a garment. The principle design action throughout was <b>material</b> <b>explorations,</b> undertaken on a table, then transferred to the body. As each new idea emerged, the context of application {{and the role of}} the body shifted. Open Up began as a relaxation aid that allows the wearer to feel at one with the environment. When the context changed to walking in a city, the wearable’s use transformed into visualizing the distance between the wearer and others. Finally, visualizing distance was used to create a dramatic entrance effect in parties when approaching the crowd.|$|R
