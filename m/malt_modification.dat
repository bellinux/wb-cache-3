The research integrates research on (1) the effects of barley genetics and production environment on the contribution of barley to beer flavor, (2) the effects of degree of <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> on barley contributions to beer flavor and (3) a genetic analysis of low temperature tolerance (LTT) and vernalization (VRN) sensitivity. The first manuscript reports the relative impacts of barley genotype and environment on sensory descriptors of beers brewed from a subsample of a bi-parental mapping population grown at three locations. The second manuscript addresses the effects of genotype and degree of <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> on beer flavor based on two experiments involving: a) length of grain storage prior to malting using samples {{from one of the}} environments utilized in the first experiment and b) alterations of malting protocol to produce three levels of <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> in two varieties. The third manuscript describes the results from association mapping of LTT and VRN sensitivity in a large sample of diverse barley accessions that were extensively phenotyped and genotyped. The results of the analysis are applied in the context of facultative growth habit – a tool for dealing with the challenges of climate change on barley production. These manuscripts comprise a roadmap for integrating sensory science with contemporary breeding methods for the development of value-added barley varieties...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{that affect}} wort {{fermentability}} were investigated with 180 doubled haploid lines from an Arapiles/Franklin cross. Barley, grown in South Australia during 2001, was micromalted and analysed using standard methods. Samples {{were found to}} have a wide range in malting quality with lines both superior and inferior to the parents for all traits analysed. QTL and statistical analysis of data indicated, for this population, that poor <b>malt</b> <b>modification,</b> beta-glucan in particular, had the greatest negative effect on fermentability. Fermentability was also negatively correlated with the maltotetrose content of wort. A significant QTL for this sugar was coincident with the chromosome 4 H locus for the heat-stable beta-amylase (sd 2 H). Lines with the heat stable enzyme, inherited from Arapiles, had improved fermentabilities of IOB extracts but not of EBC extracts. Glucose, possibly coming from beta-glucan hydrolysis, was found to {{have a positive effect on}} fermentability. A significant QTL for wort fructose was in the area of the sdw semi-dwarfing gene on chromosome 3 H, highlighting the potential impact of agronomic traits on the genetic analysis of malt quality...|$|E
40|$|Based {{on prior}} {{research}} that showed significant genetic differences between barley genotypes for beer sensory descriptors, {{the effects of}} degree of <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> on these descriptors were assessed in two experiments. The first experiment involved sensory assessment of nano-beers made from micro-malts of Golden Promise, Full Pint, 34 doubled haploid progeny, and a check CDC Copeland. Average degree of modification was assessed by sampling grain {{from each of the}} 37 genotypes stored for three post-harvest intervals prior to malting and brewing. The second experiment involved sensory assessment of pilot beers made from intentionally under-properly-and over-modified pilot malts of two barley varieties: Full Pint and CDC Copeland. In both experiments, genotypes were the principal sources of significant variation in sensory descriptors. Degree of modification and genotype x modification interactions were also significant for some descriptors. Based on the results of this study, the genetic characterization of and selection for barley contributions to beer flavor is warranted, even with under-modified malts. The contribution of barley variety to beer flavor will likely be modest compared to the flavors developed during the malting process, and the flavors contributed by hops and yeast. However, in certain beer styles, the contributions of barley genotype may be worth the attention of maltsters, brewers, and consumers...|$|E
40|$|Four {{levels of}} N, P and K {{nutrition}} (poor, moderate, satisfactory and high) {{and all their}} possible combinations with 64 treatments in two replications (128 plots) were studied {{in a long term}} field trial on barley yield and malting quality. A standard East-European spring barley "Opal" (bred in Czechoslovakia) was grown in 1986, 13 th year of the agricultural experiment, involving various crops in previous years, on a calcareous loamy chernozem soil. The optimum fertility levels for yield enhancement resulted in the poorest <b>malting</b> quality: low <b>modification</b> and extract but long saccharification time and high protein. To solve this problem the brewing industry will have to apply the well-known technological methods available since growers are not likely to give up their fertilizers. Applying soil and plant analysis data, having knowledge about both soil and plant optimum values, the danger of the excessive use of fertilizers can be realized and decreased. ...|$|R
40|$|Barley is {{the basic}} raw {{material}} for brewing. Its chemical composition, brewing, and technological indices are highly determinative for the beer quality and the economical efficiency of the brewing process. Barley is rich in protein, carbohydrates, dietary fibers, minerals, and vitamins. The presence of non starch polysaccharides as mixed linkage (1 - 3),(1 - 4) -β-D-glucans and arabinoxylans together with the enzymes are responsible for barley <b>modification.</b> <b>Malting</b> is a complex process that involves many enzymes; important ones are α-amylase, β-amylase, α-glucosidase, and limit dextrinase. During the process of malting and brewing, the by-products left after separation of the wort are rich in protein, fibers, arabinoxylans, and β-glucan. This review summarizes and integrates barley grain with respect to nutritional, functional, and compositional changes that take place during malting and brewing. It also explores in-depth the several by-products obtained after brewing and their potential for various food applications. Barley brewing by-products offer an opportunity for cereal-based baked and extruded products with acceptable sensory and nutritional characteristics...|$|R
40|$|During {{production}} of malt from barley seeds, cell walls and starch granules in the endosperm are degraded. Although this modification process {{is important for}} <b>malt</b> quality, the <b>modification</b> patterns of individual barley seeds {{have yet to be}} reported. The use of destructive microscopy methods have previously limited the investigations to ensemble averages. X-ray dark-field radiography is a recent non-destructive imaging method which is sensitive to microstructural variations. In this study, the method was applied for quantitative in-situ monitoring of barley seeds. Microstructural changes relating to water uptake and modification were monitored over a 43 - 55 h period. Sub-resolution stress cracks as well as a dark-field signal believed to originate from starch granules were detected. The evolution of the dark-field signal followed the known modification pattern in barley seeds. Through image analysis, quantitative parameters describing the movement of the front of the observed pattern were obtained. Based on these findings, X-ray dark-field radiography presents a possible novel approach to monitor the modification of germinating barley seeds. Comment: 5 figures, 2 tables, 16 page...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the interaction between sorghum grain hardness and sorghum malt quality in terms of diastatic power and free amino nitrogen with endosperm modification during malting. The changes in kernel hardness during malting of four commercial sorghum cultivars of differing quality in terms of endosperm texture and potential malt quality were measured using tests for hardness and density, and endosperm modification was followed by scanning electron microscopy. The general pattern of modification during sorghum malting was confirmed {{to start at the}} ensdosperm-scutellum interface, then into the floury endosperm towards the kernel distal end. Significantly, a cultivar of intermediate hardness and low malting quality remained harder and modified more slowly than a harder cultivar of high malting quality. It appears that intrinsic grain hardness and malt amylase and protease activity both affect malt hardness and endosperm modification, but amylase and protease activity have a greater effect due to their degradation of endosperm starch and protein. Of the hardness and density tests studied, the Tangential Abrasive Dehulling Device (TADD) gave the best measure of hardness throughout malting; maximum range 24 % to 100 % kernel removed over 5 days malting. Also, the data agreed with the observed <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> rates. Thus, the TADD may have application as a simple and rapid test for estimating sorghum malt quality.

The potential to improve malting quality of hulless barley was investigated with a two-row doubled haploid population (TR 251 /HB 345). TR 251 is a covered, malt breeding line with good malting potential while HB 345 is a hulless line with good agronomic traits and the gene for heat stable -amylase (sd 2 H). Barley grown in standard yield test plots at Brandon, Manitoba during 2002 was micromalted and analysed using standard conditions. The 62 hulless lines, on average, had {{significantly higher levels of}} malt extract than the 62 covered lines. A significantly lower percentage of the hulless extract was fermentable but the hulless lines still fermented a greater amount of total extract. Levels of diastatic power were similar among hulless and covered malts but -amylase was significantly lower in the hulless lines. Heat stable -amylase improved fermentability but not significantly. Samples showed an acceptable degree of <b>malt</b> <b>modification</b> but -glucan levels still had a negative effect on fermentability. Levels of total free amino acids were similar among hulless and covered worts; however, levels of several individual amino acids were significantly lower in the hulless worts which had a negative effect on fermentability. In summary, hulless malt had some superior attributes compared to covered malt but increased levels of some specific enzymes would further enhance its appeal. M. J. Edney, W. G. Legge, B. G.

40|$|Barley grain {{carries a}} numerous, variable, and complex {{microbial}} population that mainly consists of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi {{and that can}} partly be detected and quantified using plating methods and microscopic and molecular techniques. The extent and the activity of this microflora {{are determined by the}} altering state of the grain and the environmental conditions in the malt production chain. Three ecological systems can be distinguished: the growing cereal in the field, the dry barley grain under storage, and the germinating barley kernel during actual malting. Microorganisms interact with the malting process both by their presence and by their metabolic activity. In this respect, interference with the oxygen uptake by the barley grain and secretion of enzymes, hormones, toxins, and acids that may affect the plant physiological processes have been studied. As a result of the interaction, microorganisms can cause important losses and influence malt quality as measured by brewhouse performance and beer quality. Of particular concern is the occurrence of mycotoxins that may affect the safety of malt. The development of the microflora during malt production can to a certain extent be controlled by the selection of appropriate process conditions. Physical and chemical treatments to inactivate the microbial population on the barley grain are suggested. Recent developments, however, aim to control the microbial activity during malt production by promoting the growth of desirable microbial cultures, selected either as biocontrol agents inhibiting mycotoxin-producing molds or as starter cultures actively contributing to <b>malt</b> <b>modification.</b> Such techniques may offer natural opportunities to improve the quality and safety of malt. status: publishe...|$|E
