40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} current {{understanding}} {{of the principles of}} operation of open-gradient dry <b>magnetic</b> <b>separators.</b> The physics of separation in low and high-intensity devices is described. The fundamental laws of magnetostatic fields are presented and the concept of magnetic potential energy is used to develop the expression for the force on a particle in a magnetic field. The forces which compete with the magnetic forces in dry <b>magnetic</b> <b>separators</b> are described. These are applied to the analysis of the acceleration of particles on roll-type separators and the definition of the point of departure from the roll. The drag forces which affect the motion of particles through air are defined for low and high velocity particles. The interparticle forces between magnetic and non-magnetic particles which determine how pure the products of the separation will be are also discussed. This review highlights the fact that, while the physics of dry magnetic separation is reasonably well understood, few {{attempts have been made to}} exploit this knowledge to develop comprehensive mathematical models of industrial separators. This is due to the lack of fundamentally derived mathematical descriptions of the magnetic fields generated in these separators. Studies of these fields which combine direct measurements with fundamental techniques such as the Laplace solution are now required. When the magnetic fields within dry <b>magnetic</b> <b>separators</b> are better understood there will be few impediments to the development of reliable mathematical models of these devices...|$|R

50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the <b>magnetic</b> <b>separator</b> and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{separation}} {{is a process}} in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite, such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Separator</b> (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844-1906)1 was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day.This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture {{with the help of a}} magnet is called magnetic separation..|$|E
40|$|A new, efficient, {{and highly}} {{accurate}} {{method for tracing}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>separators</b> in global magnetospheric simulations with arbitrary clock angle is presented. The technique is to begin at a magnetic null and iteratively march along the separator by finding where four magnetic topologies meet on a spherical surface. The technique is verified using exact solutions for separators resulting from an analytic magnetic field model that superposes dipolar and uniform magnetic fields. Global resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed using the three-dimensional BATS-R-US code with a uniform resistivity, in eight distinct simulations with interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angles rang-ing from 0 (parallel) to 180 degrees (anti-parallel). <b>Magnetic</b> nulls and <b>separators</b> {{are found in the}} simulations, and it is shown that separators traced here are accurate for any clock angle, unlike the last closed field line on the sun-Earth line that fails for southward IMF. Trends in magnetic null locations and the structure of <b>magnetic</b> <b>separators</b> as a func-tion of clock angle are presented and compared with those from the analytic field model. There are many qualitative similarities between the two models, but quantitative dif-ferences are also noted. Dependence on solar wind density is briefly investigated. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inability}} of landfills to properly {{deal with the}} disposal of tires has spurred the research into ways to successfully recycle tires into commodities and resources, such as concrete, asphalt and other tires. To convert the waste tire into a valuable product, it must first be reduced in size and then recycled. The recycling process begins first by shredding tires into small manageable chips, which are then cooled to cryogenic temperatures, causing the pieces to become brittle. These brittle pieces are then pulverized into a material that must be screened to remove large chunks of rubber or polymer. Finally, the remaining fibre and magnetic material are separated from the pulverized material using a <b>magnetic</b> <b>separator</b> and a vibrational separator. This form of recycling is environmentally friendly, and allows a valuable resource to be used again and again.There is a potential for using waste tire rubber to make activated-carbon adsorbents for air-quality control applications. Such an approach provides a recycling path for waste tires {{and the production of}} new adsorbents from a low-cost waste material.Also, recycled rubber from tires is used as a component of various products commonly known as [...] "tire derived products".
