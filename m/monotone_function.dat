25|$|Besides the {{previous}} representation results, {{there are some}} other statements that can be made about complete lattices, or that take a particularly simple form in this case. An example is the Knaster–Tarski theorem, which states that the set of fixed points of a <b>monotone</b> <b>function</b> on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice. This is easily seen to be a generalization of the above observation about the images of closure operators, since these are exactly the sets of fixed points of such operators.|$|E

500|$|Most {{functions}} {{that occur in}} practice have derivatives at all points or at almost every point. [...] Early {{in the history of}} calculus, many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points. [...] Under mild conditions, for example if the function is a <b>monotone</b> <b>function</b> or a Lipschitz function, this is true. [...] However, in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. [...] This example is now known as the Weierstrass function. [...] In 1931, Stefan Banach proved that the set of {{functions that}} have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions. Informally, this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} there is a {{one-to-one}} correspondence between operator <b>monotone</b> <b>functions</b> on the nonnegative reals and finite Borel measures on the unit interval. This correspondence appears as an integral representation of special operator <b>monotone</b> <b>functions</b> x 1 !_t x for t ∈ [0, 1] with respect to a finite Borel measure on [0, 1], here !_t denotes the t-weighted harmonic mean. Hence such functions form building blocks for arbitrary operator <b>monotone</b> <b>functions</b> on the nonnegative reals.
