In this paper, the model of polynomial s-curve <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> is generalized in a recursive form. Based on that, a general algorithm to design s-curve trajectory with time-optimal consideration is proposed. In addition, a special strategy for planning s-curve <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> using a trigonometric model is also presented. The algorithms are implemented on a linear motor system. Experimental results show the effectiveness and promising application ability of the algorithms in s-curve <b>motion</b> <b>profiling...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{reason for}} the by far bigger jerk in the first way to brake is a {{discontinuity}} of the acceleration, which is initially at a constant value, due to the constant force on the pedal, and drops to zero immediately, when the wheels stop rotating.

40|$|Residual {{vibrations}} affect {{machines at}} the end of commanded motion and represent an amplification factor for the work cycle. Furthermore, in repetitive cyclic movements, residual vibrations can lead to an important degeneration of the executed motion, due to a summation effect of undesired dynamic phenomena. For these reasons, the problem of residual vibrations is widely studied in literature and it is faced with different techniques. A first type of approach consists in the production of a structural device realized with proper mechanical solutions devoted to avoid the sources of vibrations. The second approach consists in introducing passive/active physical elements able to attenuate vibrations, by passively consuming their mechanical power or by actively counteracting them with external mechanical power. A third approach is the smart definition of the <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> of each machine movable part to minimize the vibrational effects. The proposed work is addressed in this direction, with an optimization approach based on the Fourier transformation of the <b>motion</b> <b>profile.</b> More precisely, the natural frequencies of the system are evaluated through experimental tests, the designed <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> is transformed with a Fourier analysis, a band around the natural frequencies of the system is suppressed from the <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> spectrum, an antitransformation is implemented to obtain a temporal function, and, finally, a proper optimization is implemented to respect desired kinematical constraints.

40|$|Among the {{techniques}} to improve energy efficiency of mechatronic systems, {{the synthesis of}} optimized <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> has been {{proved to be an}} effective and almost costless method. In order to boost the use of this approach, this paper proposes an analytical method for improving energy efficiency in rest-to-rest motion through optimal planning, by selecting both the optimal motion law and the optimal motion time (duration). The proposed technique is suitable for constant inertia systems. As a matter of fact, this kind of mechatronic systems covers a wide range of applications in production, packaging or logistic plants. The method practical application is straightforward, since it just relies on the knowledge of the task specifications and of some system parameters to compute the optimal motion time for each selected trajectory and to compare analytically different <b>motion</b> <b>profiles.</b> The limitations due the servo-actuator (torque, speed, bandwidth), to machine throughput requirements, as well as the smoothness specifications (acceleration and jerk limitations, degree of continuity) are explicitly accounted for through bounds, to ensure the feasibility of the <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> developed. Since the proposed method proposes an analytical algebraic equation, it does not require either time-consuming simulations and trial-and-error evaluations, or numerical optimizations. Hence, it is well suited for industrial mechatronic applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{large body}} of {{research}} shows that the Central Nervous System (CNS) integrates multisensory information. However, this strategy should only apply to multisensory signals that have a common cause; independent signals should be segregated. Causal Inference (CI) models account for this notion.

We hypothesized that CI does occur, but that characteristics of the <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> affect multisensory processing. Participants estimated heading of visual-inertial motion stimuli with several different <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> and a range of intersensory discrepancies.

40|$|Passive {{movement}} through an environment typically involves {{a combination of}} several signals, including, visual and vestibular information. Recently {{it has been shown}} that if different sensory signals are spatially or temporally discrepant they may not combine in a statistically optimal fashion; however, this has not been evaluated for visual-vestibular integration. In this study, participants were seated on a Stewart motion platform and judged which of two heading intervals was more to the right. Motion/heading information (displacement, velocity and acceleration) was presented via stereo visual information alone, vestibular information alone or both cues combined. In the combined condition, the visual <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> and the vestibular <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> differed, therefore creating a discrepancy between the two signals. Specifically, the vestibular motion consisted of a raised cosine velocity profile, while the visual motion consisted of a constant velocity profile. The results show that visual-vestibular inputs combine in a statistically optimal fashion even if the motion profiles do not correspond. Considering that, for linear motion the visual system is more sensitive to velocity and displacement than acceleration, while the vestibular system is a predominantly acceleration-based sensory system, different components of the <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> may be optimally detected by each of the individual sensory systems...|$|E

Synchronous external motions promise to allow fast convergence and assembly times. XBot is a modular system that uses synchronous external actuation, {{but has a}} limited range of reachable configurations stemming from a single motion primitive of a module rotating about another.

A parameterization of the external actuation <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> is ex-plored to define a space of physically valid <b>motion</b> <b>profiles.</b> The larger the space, the more robust the motion primitives will be to inexact initial conditions and to imprecision in the external actuation mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract—The twin-pulse <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> {{is still}} perhaps the {{simplest}} profile {{in existence for}} reducing residual vibration. Its primary drawback is that of narrow bandwidth, i. e., it is effective for attenuating only a very narrow range of frequencies about its design frequency. This {{has led to the}} inclusion of more pulses to improve robustness to frequency variation. However, one cost of adding pulses is extending the duration of the resulting motion. This paper presents several techniques whereby the basic twin-pulse <b>motion</b> <b>profile</b> can be expanded to reduce its frequency sensitivity while still preserving its advantages. These techniques include intentionally mis-aligning the null points of ideal twin pulses and a convolved boxcar function, then adding a trapezoidal profile component, finally culminating in what we term a misaligned boxcar / trapezoidal / twin pulse (M-BC:TZ:TP) <b>motion</b> <b>profile.</b> This expanded profile and a basic twin-pulse profile were both evaluated on a ten-pendula system with natural frequencies varying over a range of nearly 10 %. Simulation results showed an overall reduction of 97 % with the expanded twin-pulse profile, and notably all ten frequencies were attenuated; only one frequency was attenuated with the standard twin-pulse profile. Experiments using a linear rail transport system and the ten pendula device validated the simulation. These expanded profiles retain the simplicity and short duration of the twin-pulse with increased robustness to frequency variations. I...|$|E

This increased stability of human motion pattern, in turn increases the recognition accuracy and thereby the stability of the tactile feedback as a result [33].

40|$|Reaction times (RTs) to purely {{inertial}} self-motion stimuli {{have only}} infrequently been studied, and comparisons of RTs for translations and rotations, to our knowledge, are nonexistent. We recently proposed a model [1] which describes direction discrimination thresholds for rotational and translational motions {{based on the}} dynamics of the vestibular sensory organs (otoliths and semi-circular canals). This model also predicts differences in RTs for different <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> (e. g., trapezoidal versus triangular acceleration profiles or varying profile durations). In order to assess these predictions we measured RTs in 20 participants for 8 supra-threshold <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> (4 translations, 4 rotations). A two-alternative forced-choice task, discriminating leftward from rightward motions, was used and 30 correct responses per condition were evaluated. The results agree with predictions for RT differences between <b>motion</b> <b>profiles</b> as derived from previously identified model parameters from threshold measurements. To describe absolute RT, a constant is added to the predictions representing both the discrimination process, and the time needed to press the response button. This constant is approximately 160 ms shorter for rotations, thus indicating that additional processing time is required for translational motion. As this additional latency cannot be explained by our model based on {{the dynamics of the}} sensory organs, we speculate that it originates at a later stage, e. g. during tilt-translation disambiguation. Varying processing latencies for different self-motion stimuli (either translations or rotations) which our model can account for must be considered when assessing the perceived timing of vestibular stimulation in comparison with other senses [2, 3]...|$|R
