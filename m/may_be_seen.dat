5|$|An {{example of}} a {{developing}} nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in southern Brazil. Elements of both of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present.|$|E
5|$|Burgoyne's failed campaign, as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by {{the titles}} {{of some of the}} books that cover it in detail, marked a major turning point in the war. After the battle, he withdrew his men 10–15 miles north, near present-day Schuylerville, New York. General Burgoyne {{returned}} to England and was never given another commanding position in the British Army.|$|E

Yellow deposits of cholesterol-rich fat <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in various {{places on the}} body such as around the eyelids (known as xanthelasma palpebrarum), the outer margin of the iris (known as arcus senilis corneae), and in the tendons of the hands, elbows, knees and feet, particularly the Achilles tendon (known as a tendon xanthoma).|$|E
5|$|Many Maya {{archaeological sites}} have stelae {{on display in}} their {{original}} locations, in Guatemala these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Aguateca, Dos Pilas, ElChal, Ixkun, Nakum, Seibal, Takalik Abaj, Uaxactun, and Yaxha. In Mexico, stelae <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at Yaxchilan, and the site museum at Toniná.|$|E
5|$|Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows {{tunnelled}} into vertical sandy banks, {{often at}} the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for the young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.|$|E

5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, hummingbird hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} seen, {{particularly in the}} woods at Holkham, along with the common butterfly and moth species. In some years the clouded yellow, Camberwell beauty, painted lady or diamondback moth <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen,</b> and the silver Y can sometimes occur in huge numbers. The dune tiger beetle is a nationally rare denizen of moist sand dunes.|$|E
5|$|The pinna helps {{direct sound}} through {{the ear canal}} to the eardrum. The complex {{geometry}} of ridges on the inner surface of some mammalian ears helps to sharply focus sounds produced by prey, using echolocation signals. These ridges {{can be regarded as}} the acoustic equivalent of a fresnel lens, and <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> {{in a wide range of}} animals, including the bat, aye-aye, lesser galago, bat-eared fox, mouse lemur and others.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin and}} oral cavity telangiectasias are {{visually}} identifiable on physical examination, and similarly the lesions {{in the nose}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on endoscopy of the nasopharynx or on laryngoscopy.

5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on the Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, {{and again in the}} small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|A band of Middle Devonian {{limestone}} runs west to {{east from}} Cremyll to Plymstock including the Hoe. Local limestone <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in numerous buildings, walls and pavements throughout Plymouth. To the north and north east {{of the city is}} the granite mass of Dartmoor; the granite was mined and exported via Plymouth. Rocks brought down the Tamar from Dartmoor include ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals. There is evidence that the middle Devonian limestone belt at the south edge of Plymouth and in Plymstock was quarried at West Hoe, Cattedown and Radford.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and {{are associated with the}} Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
