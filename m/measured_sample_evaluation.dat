30|$|Our {{data shows}} that the {{gentamicin}} ELISA requires a lower amount of hapten to be coated {{to the surface of}} the microtiter plate well as compared to the vancomycin ELISA. This difference might be related to the size of the individual antibiotic compounds. Gentamicin is a relatively small molecule in comparison to vancomycin (about 1 / 3 in molecular weight). To achieve the coating of an equimolar amount of vancomycin as compared to gentamicin, it is imperative that more V-BSA hapten is coated to the well. However this does not fully explain the 100 -fold larger coating dose required for the vancomycin ELISA. In addition this could also be attributed by a difference in cross-linking efficiency during hapten formation, as seen in the immunoblotting results where the cross-linking of gentamicin resulted in BSA di-mers and tri-mers. Furthermore, the applied individual antibodies for the detection of gentamicin and vancomycin are different and will differ in their antibody-antigen binding affinity. This difference in antibodies might thus influence the detection ranges in the assays and provide an explanation why we need to coat more V-BSA hapten to the well than G-BSA hapten. Although the gentamicin antibody does not detectably interact with vancomycin and the vancomycin antibody does not interact with gentamicin, we cannot exclude that other antibiotics might cause aspecific interactions with the herein described antibodies, potentially resulting in incorrect calculations of the antibiotic concentration in the <b>measured</b> <b>sample.</b> Future application-specific <b>evaluation</b> of this potential bias should be performed, depending on the antibiotic.|$|R

30|$|Although {{the methods}} {{do not give}} an {{estimate}} of the sample eigenvalues themselves, they can still be useful. One application is to use them to test whether the candidate population eigenvalue sets match with the <b>measured</b> <b>sample</b> eigenvalues. First the sample eigenvalue density corresponding to this candidate population eigenvalue set is estimated. If this estimated sample eigenvalue density does not match the empirical density of the <b>measured</b> <b>sample</b> eigenvalues, the candidate population eigenvalue set is probably not a good candidate. One particular candidate could be the <b>measured</b> <b>sample</b> eigenvalues themselves. If they do not match, then the <b>measured</b> <b>sample</b> eigenvalues are probably considerably biased estimates of the original population eigenvalues as well.|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we look at}} {{the problem}} of multi-class image {{classification}} in a semi-supervised learning framework. Given a small set of labeled images, and a much larger set of unlabeled images, we propose a semi-supervised learning method that combines bootstrapping with <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation,</b> to continuously update the learned models for each class. Bootstrapping involves using self-labeled images to re-train the learned models. To overcome the semantic drift that naive boot-strapping is prone to, we use additional <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods based on the ideas of co-training and pairwise constraints, {{to determine whether or not}} a newly classified instance should be used for re-training. Experimental results show the usefulness of <b>sample</b> <b>evaluation,</b> when used in conjunction with bootstrapping. In particular, our method is able to achieve a 8 % improvement in overall accuracy over baseline bootstrapping, on a 15 class subset of the SUN (Scene UNderstand-ing) dataset. ...|$|R

The performance of an FRM PM 10 inlet was characterized in a wind tunnel at a wind speed of 8 km/h. Data were also collected for 20 and 25 m m particles at wind speeds of 2 and 24 km/h. Results of the present <b>sampler</b> <b>evaluation</b> compared well with those of previous studies for a similar inlet near the cutpoint, and the sampler passed the criteria required for certification as a FRM sampler when tested at 8 km/h. Sampling effectiveness values for particles with nominal diameters of 20 and 25 m m exceeded 3 % for 8 and 24 km/h wind speeds in the present study and were statistically higher than both the ?ideal? PM 10 sampler (as defined in 40 CFR 53) and the ISO (1995) standard definition of thoracic particles (p < 0. 05) for 25 m m particles leading to the potential for significant sampling bias relative to the ?ideal?
