30|$|Every {{sensor node}} has sensing, processing, transmitting, moving, locating, and {{electrical}} power elements; some elements are optional, {{such as the}} moving or locating element. Sensor nodes are placed {{in a particular area}} and integrated with each other to yield high-quality information about the environment [14]. Every sensor node not only can capture the sensed data and route it to other sensors or base stations, but also can determine <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> or scheduling according to the mission, the received data, and the status of the sensor node.

50|$|As {{the initial}} TCP/IP network grew {{to become the}} Internet during the 1980s, {{the need for more}} {{flexible}} addressing schemes became increasingly apparent. This led to the successive development of subnetting and CIDR. The network class distinctions were removed, and the new system was described as being classless, with respect to the old system, which became known as classful. In 1993, the Internet Engineering Task Force published a new set of standards, RFC 1518 and RFC 1519, to define this new concept of allocation of IP address blocks and new <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> IPv4 packets.

40|$|A core {{feature of}} Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is {{opportunistic}} content caching in routers. It enables routers to satisfy content requests with in-network cached copies, thereby reducing bandwidth utilization, decreasing congestion, and improving overall content retrieval latency. One major drawback of in-network caching is that content producers {{have no knowledge}} about where their content is stored. This is problematic if a producer wishes to delete its content. In this paper, we show how {{to address this problem}} with a protocol called BEAD (Best-Effort Autonomous Deletion). BEAD achieves content deletion via small and secure packets that resemble current CCN messages. We discuss several <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> <b>routing</b> BEAD messages from producers to caching routers with varying levels of network overhead and efficacy.
