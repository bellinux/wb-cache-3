This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I {{have never seen a}} document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E
500|$|A. Yes, that as well, I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> too. The {{transports}} to the camps, the transports {{from the}} camps {{to the work}} sites, the transfers from camp to camp following {{the interests of the}} Economic-Administrative Head Office, the work inside the concentration camp - all of these concepts are covered by [...] "special treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{during the}} war I never disobeyed an order, but when General Seidemann ordered Graf and me to fly to the British sector and {{surrender}} to avoid the Soviets, {{with the rest of}} the wing to surrender to the Soviets, I could not leave my men. [...] That would have been bad leadership.|$|E

500|$|By {{the third}} night, the London Figaro could report: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{not a single}} hitch in the {{performance}} is now to be perceived, and that the applause and evident delight of the audience from beginning to end, the piece occupying a space of time within two hours." [...] On 6 January 1872, the Penny Illustrated Paper commented that [...] "Mr. Gilbert's Gaiety extravaganza grows in public favour and deservedly so". On 9 January, the Daily Telegraph reported a visit by His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh. By 27 January, the Illustrated Times noted that [...] "a chance playgoer will certainly not find {{a seat at the}} Gaiety.... Thespis can, after all, boast the success which was predicted". Land and Water reported on 3 February that [...] "Thespis is now in capital working order." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1998, Rollins {{felt that}} the {{relationship}} with his backing band had run its course, and the line-up disbanded. He had produced a Los Angeles hard rock band called Mother Superior, and invited them {{to form a new}} incarnation of the Rollins Band. Their first album, Get Some Go Again, was released two years later. The Rollins Band released several more albums, including 2001's Nice and 2003's [...] After 2003, the band became inactive as Rollins focused on radio and television work. During a 2006 appearance on Tom Green Live!, Rollins stated that he [...] "may never do music again", a feeling which he reiterated in 2011 when talking to Trebuchet magazine. In an interview with Culture Brats, Henry admitted he had sworn off music for good – [...] "... and I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I miss it every day. I just don't know honestly what I could do with it that's different." ...|$|E
500|$|Bayern {{president}} Franz Beckenbauer recognised {{that it was}} a loss {{of concentration}} in the last few minutes that led to his side's defeat: [...] "That was the cruellest defeat possible because victory was so close. We already had victory in the bag and {{there were only a few}} seconds to go. But those few seconds were enough for Manchester to get back into the game. We were playing well in the last 20 minutes and should have been able to hold on to victory. But in the end, Manchester deservedly won." [...] Manager Ottmar Hitzfeld seemed more stunned by the result in his reaction: [...] "I feel so sorry for my team because they were so close to winning this match but they have lost. It's really difficult to digest and this is inconceivable for us but then this is what football is all about. Normally when the opposition equalise you are expecting extra-time and it was a shock to our team when they scored the winner two minutes later. It could take days or even weeks to recover from this but I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Manchester are great champions." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself was terribly amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was above}} all {{influenced}} by Odd Man Out (1947) - [...] "I still {{consider it as}} one of the best movies I've ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "It is true {{that the}} music I traffic in, along with Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and others, has never gained a great popularity. But that was true of the {{so-called}} difficult music of earlier centuries, too. And I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I have noticed, as we have held our ground, {{that there has been a}} softening of response. There are now those who are beginning to find expressive beauty in a music that was at first rejected entirely." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before marrying Rita Wilson, Hanks {{converted}} to the Greek Orthodox Church, {{the religion of}} Wilson and her family. Hanks said, [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> when I go to church—and I do go to church—I ponder the mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people'... The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hazare {{once told}} the Bala {{that he was}} [...] "not aware of the {{exchange}} between him (Shodhan) and Vinoo, but I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Vinoo was not too keen that Deepak play. I suppose Vinoo found Deepak's attitude casual. ... (Shodhan) {{was not interested in}} touring (after the final Test of the series) ... Maybe {{it had to do with}} his business commitments. He had made himself unavailable for the tour of Pakistan and it might have been because Vinoo was the captain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese's {{performance}} in the 1991 Rugby World Cup semi-final {{has been described by}} former Australian coach Bob Dwyer as Campese's signature Test in his career. In an ABC documentary entitled The Rise and Rise of Australian Rugby Dwyer stated that, [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> throughout the 1991 World Cup, and this semi-final match in particular, Campo was a standout performer. We all know what a great player he was over such a long period of time, but I’m sure that his first-half performance that day has never been beaten." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I have {{something}} to say to you," [...] he persisted. [...] "I {{have something}} new, something I <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> something <b>that</b> has just come to me. You must listen, Ruth." ...|$|R

I've been working really hard this season, and I'm very grateful.. It [...] would be on my mind, but the only thing I can do is to go on and perform to my best. If the coach or the {{selectors}} see it fit, then they will select me. I can't say that I deserve a game or not. So I'll just wait and see what they'll do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Międzyrzec [...] "strip-search" [...] {{of young}} Jewish women was {{introduced}} by Gnade before executions dubbed [...] "mopping up" [...] actions by the Germans. Gnade's first sergeant later said: [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> First Lieutenant Gnade gave me {{the impression that the}} entire business afforded him a great deal of pleasure." [...] By the spring of 1943 most towns of the Lublin reservation were Judenfrei therefore the battalion was tasked with [...] "Jew hunts" [...] in the deep local forests, or in the potato fields and around distant farmlands. Thousands of Jews were shot face to face.|$|E
2500|$|Dirac's {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) made {{predictions}} that were – {{more often than}} not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as renormalisation was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, [...] "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!" [...] His refusal to accept renormalisation resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was much}} talk but little really {{known about the}} reasons for the break-up. While many fans focused on Enigk being a reborn Christian, Enigk and other band members later downplayed that aspect. In a letter {{addressed}} [...] "To Seth and other readers", Enigk responded to rumors regarding his faith. Dismissing the connection between his conversion and their break-up, Enigk wrote, [...] "I took a shot on calling upon God. He answered me. My pain was gone. I was full of joy. I had hope again. I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the true God is the one who is in the Bible, Jesus Christ," [...] and, [...] "I would be a fool to say that He hasn't worked miracles in my life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) {{responded to}} Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, {{as well as}} other {{differences}} between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of skepticism. [...] Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, [...] "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."

2500|$|John Knowles from Metal Exiles and Kenneth Morton from Highwire Daze were at {{the press}} {{presentation}} on May 1, 2013 in The Viper Room. Morton recalls: [...] "the songs contained within were absolutely breathtaking. The album is sure to go down as a big and glorious comeback for the legendary band", and Knowles said that, [...] "While I didn't hear anything on this record that was truly unlike anything else from a previous Queensrÿche release, I <b>must</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this record reveals a band that has been rejuvenated, and showcases the sounds fans have wanted to relive on a Queensrÿche record for many years. (...) Queensrÿche prove {{that they have the}} drive to reinvent themselves, and release a solid album they and the fans can be proud of." [...] Following this presentation, Century Media made digitally watermarked review copies available to select reviewers, requesting them to not publish their review until the first week of June.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] Rochester remarked drily. [...] "I <b>must</b> <b>say,</b> Mary, <b>that</b> I {{gave you}} credit for greater perspicuity. The man is an intriguer. Naturally, {{he was only}} too anxious to be of service to so charming a lady." ...|$|R
