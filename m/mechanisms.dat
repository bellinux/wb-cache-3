5|$|Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, {{and thereby}} avoid {{detection}} and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense <b>mechanisms</b> have also evolved {{to recognize and}} neutralize pathogens. Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system {{in the form of}} enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections. Other basic immune <b>mechanisms</b> evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These <b>mechanisms</b> include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense <b>mechanisms,</b> including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.|$|E

Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain <b>mechanisms,</b> but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible <b>mechanisms</b> that they have not tested or even thought of.
