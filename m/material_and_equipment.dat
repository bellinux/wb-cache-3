25|$|In {{addition}} to this a major new technique in glass production had been introduced during the 1st century AD. Glassblowing allowed glass workers to produce vessels with considerably thinner walls, decreasing the amount of glass needed for each vessel. Glass blowing was also considerably quicker than other techniques, and vessels required considerably less finishing, representing a further saving in time, raw <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although earlier techniques dominated during the early Augustan and Julio-Claudian periods, by the middle to late 1st century AD earlier techniques had been largely abandoned in favour of blowing.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{from the}} town of Buena Vista and with a very limited budget, the Decentralized Unit of the Santa Cruz Forest Development Center took charge of the park’s first management, {{consisting}} essentially in flora and fauna inventories, a census of the park’s human population and a few information campaigns. This period saw the construction of the Mataracú, Saguayo, La Chonta, and Macuñucú ranger stations, administered by a liaison office, 10 park rangers, <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment.</b> With support from TNC’s Parks in Peril (PiP) program, the Fundación Amigos de la Naturaleza (FAN) took part in the management of the park’s Southern Zone, with offices in Samaipata and Comarapa.|$|E
25|$|In , ElBaradei {{said that}} the {{changing}} landscape of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament may be defined {{by the emergence of}} an extensive black market in nuclear <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> the proliferation of nuclear weapons and sensitive nuclear technology, and the stagnation in nuclear disarmament. To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material {{out of the hands of}} extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts. ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience and no role in our security.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly conceding that it did not expect the return of every piece of <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as political rhetoric to keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent. This in turn helped to ensure that the United States would be the world's strongest most prosperous industrial power {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|In 1945, Britain and Canada made {{an early}} {{call for an}} {{international}} discussion on controlling atomic power. At the time, the US had yet to formulate a cohesive policy or strategy on nuclear weapons. Taking advantage of this was Vannevar Bush, who had initiated and administered the Manhattan Project, but nevertheless had a long-term goal of a ban on nuclear weapons production. As {{a first step in}} this direction, Bush proposed an international agency dedicated to nuclear control. Bush unsuccessfully argued in 1952 that the US pursue a test ban agreement with the Soviet Union before testing its first thermonuclear weapon, but his interest in international controls was echoed in the 1946 Acheson–Lilienthal Report, which had been commissioned by President Harry S. Truman to help construct US nuclear weapons policy. J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had led Los Alamos National Laboratory during the Manhattan Project, exerted significant influence over the report, particularly in its recommendation of an international body that would control production of and research on the world's supply of uranium and thorium. A version of the Acheson-Lilienthal plan was presented to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission as the Baruch Plan in June 1946. The Baruch Plan proposed that an International Atomic Development Authority would control all research on and <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> involved in the production of atomic energy. Though Dwight D. Eisenhower, then the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, was not a significant figure in the Truman administration on nuclear questions, he did support Truman's nuclear control policy, including the Baruch Plan's provision for an international control agency, provided that the control system was accompanied by [...] "a system of free and complete inspection." ...|$|E

The topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road. Stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins. Final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding, planting, watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas.

In 1968, Sweden signed the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) and thereby publicly committed itself against [...] the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Shortly after joining the NPT, Sweden became {{a founding member of}} the Zangger Committee, which was designed to work out the exact definitions of the <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> to be restricted by the NPT.

Criticizing the problems, UNITA leader Samakuva and PDP-ANA leader Sindiangani Mbimbi said that the election should be canceled and held over again. According to Samakuva, some of his party's delegates had [...] "received false credentials, or were given wrong addresses of non-existent polling stations", {{and he said that}} there was widespread confusion in Luanda; meanwhile, Mbimbi condemned the election as [...] "political theatre". As a result of the problems, the electoral commission announced that 320 polling stations would open again on September 6; however, it also asserted that the election had proceeded properly at most polling stations. The election reportedly became more orderly and functional in Luanda later in the day on September 5, and most of the country reportedly avoided the problems that plagued the vote in Luanda.|$|E

2500|$|In early March 1943 the {{provision}} of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted. This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: [...] "Now I know he has gone mad", wrote Pringle. Pringle’s colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator and British RAOC personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though {{they thought it would}} take three months to make the tools needed. To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a [...] "watch repairing factory" [...] to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment. In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang. Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of [...] "Freddie", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who sorted the power supply: records are unclear) meant that <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> was soon obtained.|$|E
