2500|$|Parker {{died the}} {{following}} morning in Las Vegas, Nevada, {{at the age of}} 87. His death certificate listed his country of birth as the Netherlands and his citizenship as American. His funeral was held at the Hilton Hotel and was attended by friends and former associates, including Eddy Arnold and Sam Phillips. Priscilla attended to represent the Elvis Presley Estate and gave a eulogy that, to many in the room, summed up Parker perfectly: [...] "Elvis and the Colonel made history together, and the world is richer, better and far more interesting because of their collaboration. And now I need to locate <b>my</b> <b>wallet,</b> because I noticed there was no ticket booth on the way in here, but I'm sure that the Colonel must have arranged for some toll on the way out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} version leaked early on several mixtapes. Then, a second version, {{with the first}} two verses from the {{original version}}, a verse from Cory Gunz and the final verse from the album version, was released prior to the album version. [...] "A Milli" [...] was played several times when sampling the record before its release, and was originally slated to appear on Tha Carter III in multiple versions as [...] "skit-like" [...] tracks, featuring artists such as Tyga, Cory Gunz, Hurricane Chris, and Lil Mama though the tracks never made the final cut. [...] They were rumored {{to appear on the}} re-release of Tha Carter III, until Wayne revealed that the aforementioned album would be a rap rock album called Rebirth with no connection to Tha Carter III. [...] "A Milli" [...] was ranked the #1 Hip-Hop song of 2008 by MTV. The song samples [...] "Don't Burn Down the Bridge" [...] by Gladys Knight & the Pips. The sample is different in both early and final versions. While the early version plays the sample as it is, the final version adds a filter effect to the sample. In addition, the main vocal sample is from the Vampire Mix of [...] "I Left <b>My</b> <b>Wallet</b> in El Segundo" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. The line [...] "I'm okay, but my watch sick" [...] was originally from [...] "Go Crazy" [...] by Young Jeezy.|$|E

60|$|I was {{set down}} at the Adam-street Hotel, a house much frequented by Americans. The respectable woman who has so long kept it {{received}} me with quiet civility, saw that I had a room, and promised me a dinner in a few minutes. While the latter was preparing, having {{got rid of the}} dust, I went out into the streets. The lamps were just lighted, and I went swiftly along the Strand, recalling objects at every step. In this manner I passed, at a rapid pace, Somerset House, St. Clement's-le-Dane, St. Mary-le-Strand, Temple-bar, Bridge-street, Ludgate-hill, pausing only before St. Paul's. Along the whole of this line I saw but little change. A grand bridge, Waterloo, with a noble approach to it, had been thrown across the river just above Somerset House, but nearly everything else remained unaltered. I believe my manner, and the eagerness with which I gazed at long-remembered objects, attracted attention; for I soon observed I was dogged around the church by a suspicious-looking fellow. He either suspected me of evil, or, attracted by my want of a London air, he meditated evil himself. Knowing my own innocence, I determined to bring the matter to an issue. We were alone, in a retired part of the place, and, first making sure that <b>my</b> watch, <b>wallet,</b> and handkerchief had not already disappeared, I walked directly up to him, and looked him intently in the face, as if to recognize his features. He took the hint, and, turning on his heels, moved nimbly of. It is surprising how soon an accustomed eye will distinguish a stranger in the streets of a large town. On mentioning this circumstance next day to ----, he said that the Londoners pretend to recognize a rustic air in a countess, if she has been six months from town. Rusticity in such cases, however, must merely mean a little behind the fashions.|$|R

6000|$|Ulys. Time hath, <b>my</b> lord, a <b>wallet</b> at his back, [...] Wherein he puts alms for oblivion, [...] A great-siz'd {{monster of}} ingratitudes: [...] These scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd [...] As {{fast as they}} are made, forgot as soon [...] As done: Pers√©verance, dear my lord, [...] Keeps honour bright: To have done, is to hang [...] Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail [...] In monumental mockery. Take the instant way; [...] For honour travels in a strait so narrow, [...] Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path; [...] For {{emulation}} hath a thousand sons, [...] That one by one pursue: If you give way, [...] Or hedge aside from the direct forthright, [...] Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by, [...] And leave you hindmost.-- [...] Or, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank, [...] Lie there for pavement to the abject rear, [...] O'er run and trampled on: Then {{what they do in}} present, [...] Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours: [...] For time is like a fashionable host, [...] That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand; [...] And with his arms out stretch'd, as he would fly, [...] Grasps-in the comer: Welcome ever smiles, [...] And Farewel goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek [...] Remuneration for the thing it was; [...] For beauty, wit, [...] High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service, [...] Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all [...] To envious and calumniating time. [...] One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,-- [...] That all, with one consent, praise new-born gawds, [...] Though they are made and moulded of things past; [...] And give to dust, that is a little gilt, [...] More laud than gilt o'er-dusted. [...] The present eye praises the present object: [...] Then marvel not, thou great and complete man, [...] That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax; [...] Since things in motion sooner catch the eye, [...] Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee, [...] And still it might, and yet it may again, [...] If thou would'st not entomb thyself alive, [...] And case thy reputation in thy tent; [...] Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late, [...] Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves, [...] And drave great Mars to faction.|$|R
6000|$|It is true, Sir, you are {{a gentleman}} of rank and fortune, and I am a poor devil; {{you are a}} feather in the cap of society, and I am a very hobnail in his shoes; yet I have the honour {{to belong to the}} same family with you, and on that score I now address you. You will perhaps suspect that I am going to claim {{affinity}} with the ancient and honourable house of Kirkpatrick. No, no, Sir. I cannot indeed be properly said to belong to any house, or even any province or kingdom; as my mother, who for many years was spouse to a marching regiment, gave me into this bad world, aboard the packet-boat, somewhere between Donaghadee and Portpatrick. By our common family, I mean, Sir, the family of the Muses. I am a fiddler and a poet; and you, I am told, play an exquisite violin, and have a standard taste in the belles lettres. The other day, a brother catgut gave me a charming Scots air of your composition. If I was pleased with the tune, I was in raptures with the title you have given it, and, taking up the idea, I have spun it into the three stanzas inclosed. Will you allow me, Sir, to present you them, as the dearest offering that a misbegotten son of poverty and rhyme has to give? I have a longing to take you by the hand and unburden my heart by saying, [...] "Sir, I honour you as a man who supports the dignity of human nature, amid an age when frivolity and avarice have, between them, debased us below the brutes that perish!" [...] But, alas, Sir! to me you are unapproachable. It is true, the Muses baptised me in Castalian streams; but the thoughtless gipsies forgot to give me a name. As the sex have served many a good fellow, the Nine have given me a great deal of pleasure; but, bewitching jades! they have beggared me. Would they but spare me a little of their cast-linen! Were it only to put it in my power to say, that I have a shirt on my back! But the idle wenches, like Solomon's lilies, [...] "they toil not, neither do they spin;" [...] so I must e'en continue to tie my remnant of a cravat, like the hangman's rope, round my naked throat, and coax my galligaskins to keep together their many-coloured fragments. As to the affair of shoes, I have given that up. My pilgrimages in my ballad-trade, from town to town, and on your stony-hearted turnpikes too, are not what even the hide of Job's behemoth could bear. The coat on my back is no more: I shall not speak evil of the dead. It would be equally unhandsome and ungrateful to find fault with my old surtout, which so kindly supplies and conceals the want of that coat. My hat, indeed, is a great favourite; and though I got it literally for an old song, I would not exchange it for the best beaver in Britain. I was, during several years, a kind of fac-totum servant to a country clergyman, where I picked up a good many scraps of learning, particularly--in some branches of the mathematics. Whenever I feel inclined to rest myself on my way, I take my seat under a hedge, laying <b>my</b> poetic <b>wallet</b> on the one side, and my fiddle-case on the other, and placing my hat between my legs, I can by means of its brim, or rather brims, go through the whole doctrine of the Conic Sections. However, Sir, don't let me mislead you, as if I would interest your pity. Fortune has so much forsaken me, that she has taught me to live without her; and, amid all my rags and poverty, I am as independent, and much more happy than a monarch of the world. According to the hackneyed metaphor, I value the several actors in the great drama of life, simply as they act their parts. I can look on a worthless fellow of a duke with unqualified contempt, and can regard an honest scavenger with sincere respect. As you, Sir, go through your role with such distinguished merit, permit me to make one in the chorus of universal applause, and assure you that with the highest respect, I have the honour to be, etc.|$|R
