30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to map the camel milk value chain and {{establish}} the predisposing factors for increase in <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> in milk along the chain. Isiolo County was chosen for the study. Data collection was done through key informant interviews, structured interview schedules, observation and microbial analysis of milk samples. During milk sampling, milk temperature, environmental temperature, time and volume of milk from which the sample was taken were recorded. Along the value chain, <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> in milk increased significantly from log 10 4.91 [*]±[*] 1.04  CFU/ml at production to log 10 7.52 [*]±[*] 1.32  CFU/ml at Nairobi market for total viable counts and log 10 3.68 [*]±[*] 1.28  CFU/ml at production to log 10 6.42 [*]±[*] 1.13  CFU/ml at the Nairobi market for coliform counts. At production, milking persons neither washed their hands nor cleaned the camels’ udder before milking, and plastic, non-food grade containers were the only form of receptacles used for milk along the chain. The relationship between <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> and time taken to transport milk along the chain was significant while the volume of milk in the receptacle had no effect on <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> The milk was held at a temperature of between 28 and 32.5  °C before delivery to secondary collection centres from 10 : 15 am to 6 : 30 pm for cooling. Training on milk quality for milk handlers at the collection centre had no effect on <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> Affordable access to low-cost food grade plastic containers as well as cooling milk in the individual receptacles within two hours of milking, without bulking and refilling again into the receptacles for transportation, as is the practice, would reduce <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> Similarly, training on milk quality should start at production where milk contamination is initiated. Finally, milk value addition would improve milk shelf-life enabling access to distant markets. This would greatly improve the livelihoods of the pastoral camel milk producers.|$|R
30|$|Time and {{temperature}} {{are two of}} the most important extrinsic factors affecting microbial growth, and generally, milk should be cooled to 4  °C within two hours of milking (Jay et al. 2005). In this study, between production and secondary collection, milk was held at an ambient temperature of between 28 and 32  °C for up to 12  h. This substantially increases <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> of the milk and accounts for significant increase in microbial loads from production to the secondary collection centre. There was indeed a significant relationship between time and TVC between production and the secondary collection centre despite the result having a low adj. R 2 which can be attributed to transforming <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> to log 10. Since the secondary collection centres have cooling facilities, microbial growth could be curtailed if milk was delivered less than two hours after milking. Cooling the milk to 4  °C overnight at the secondary collection centre, then transporting it to Nairobi at ambient temperature, a journey of seven hours, compounds the problem of increased <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> In this study, regressing <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> against temperature was not found to have a significant relationship because of a small range in the milk temperature from production to secondary collection centres.|$|R

The compensation method and pattern recognition based on PCA are discussed in the current paper. PCA compensation can be used for all storage temperatures, however, pattern recognition differs according to storage conditions. Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and aerobic bacterial counts of the samples were measured simultaneously with the standard indicators of hairtail fish and pork freshness. The PCA models based on TVBN and aerobic bacterial counts were used to classify hairtail fish samples as “fresh” (TVBN ≤ 25 g and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> ≤ 106 cfu/g) or “spoiled” (TVBN ≥ 25 g and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> ≥ 106 cfu/g) and pork samples also as “fresh” (TVBN ≤ 15 g and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> ≤ 106 cfu/g) or “spoiled” (TVBN ≥ 15 g and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> ≥ 106 cfu/g).

It was verified that after water wash the <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> decreased to 48. 5 % while after sodium hypochlorite disinfection <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> decreased to 99. 99 %. ConclusionDental impression materials can act as vectors transmitting a significant amount of microorganisms. Sodium hypochlorite disinfection is an efficient disinfection method for alginate impressions. Tap water rinsing reduces microbial load but does not eliminate the cross-infection potential of alginate...|$|E
40|$|For its {{chemical}} and nutritional composition donkey milk {{is an excellent}} substitute for human breast milk. In fact, woman’s milk and donkey one are quite similar for their composition and for certain intrinsic properties. Based on these considerations, we performed {{a study on the}} microbiological characteristics of 86 jannet’s milk in 10 farms. Special attention was given to the aspects of health quality of the milk samples examined, referring to the analysis of total <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> and pH, the possible presence of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms, especially by seeking the bacteria Escherichia coli O 157, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Campylobacter spp. The samples of milk were picked up from January to March 2010. Our research showed a situation quite positive in terms of sanitation, finding levels of total <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> (on average 1, 8 · 104 cfu/ml) and pH (mean 7, 02) entirely in line with data found in previous investigations of other Authors and with values reassuring in terms of healthiness of the product. Regarding the detection of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, only a milk sample of 86 tested was positive for E. coli O 157; in an other sample low charges of Campylobacter spp. have been measured. Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were not found in all samples. Total <b>microbial</b> <b>count</b> confirm the good quality of the donkey milk. However, occasional isolation of E. coli O 157 and Campylobacter spp. suggests careful attention is to be done to the correct procedures of milking hygiene...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} in order to evaluate the quality properties of Kimchi containing 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of oriental melon peel parts. The Kimchi was fermented for 28 days at a temperature of 15 ℃. The pH, titratable acidity, total <b>microbial</b> <b>counts,</b> and lactic acid counts were measured, and the sensory characteristics including taste, color, chewiness, and overall acceptability were evaluated. During the 28 days of fermentation, the pH dramatically decreased between the 7 th and 21 st day of the fermentation period, and maintained thereafter in control (0 %). However, the pH in peel-added groups slightly increased up to the 14 th day and decreased up to the 21 st day with 4. 13 ∼ 4. 41. The total <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> in control {{were significantly higher than}} those in the peel-added groups. This trend was maintained throughout the fermentation period. A similar trend was found in the lactic acid <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> throughout the fermentation period. During the sensory analysis, the values of taste were significantly higher in the 20 % and 30 % peel-added Kimchi, while the chewiness and overall acceptability were significantly higher in the 20 % peel-added Kimchi than those in control. This study showed an improvement in the storage period of Kimchi products with 20 % of oriental melon peel, as well as the possibility of a commercial Kimchi manufacture...|$|R
30|$|During the waste-loading period, {{the fresh}} organic waste {{fed into the}} bin was sampled and {{analyzed}} weekly. Biweekly compost samples were randomly taken from the middle portion of the bins to determine pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> After the waste-loading period, weekly to biweekly compost samples were randomly taken from the middle portion of the bins to analyze pH, EC, moisture content, C, N, volatile solids (VS) and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts.</b> The temperature {{in the middle of}} the waste layer was measured daily. At the end of the composting period, the compost was weighed and piled for another 30  days to allow the compost to mature. Finally, the composts were analyzed for pH, EC, moisture content, C, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), germination index (GI), and N, P and K values. All analyses for each sample were conducted in triplicate.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{investigated}} and compared the fermentation characteristics of intact kimchi and brined baechu cabbage and seasoning fermented separately. Fermentation characteristics of kimchi, brined baechu cabbage and season-ing, such as pH, acidity, <b>microbial</b> <b>counts,</b> and springiness were measured during the fermentation period (4 weeks at 4 °C). Changes in pH, acidity, and <b>microbial</b> <b>counts</b> of the seasoning fermented separately were slower {{than those of}} brined baechu cabbage and kimchi itself. The fermentation characteristics of brined baechu cabbage were {{very similar to those}} of kimchi during the fermentation period. Additionally, we manufactured and fermented kimchi, after which baechu cabbage and seasoning were separated shortly before the measurements. Baechu cabbage and seasoning separated instantly from kimchi showed similar fermentation characteristics to their separately fermented counterparts. Changes in springiness of kimchi itself and brined baechu cabbage fermented separately were similar during the fermen...|$|R
