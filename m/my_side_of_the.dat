500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. All I can do is stick to <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004, Moore {{was stopped}} and {{detained}} by Special Branch {{officers at the}} Welsh port of Holyhead, taken into an office and questioned about the lyrics of his songs. The following day, he released a statement saying: [...] "My driver and I were stopped and held for two hours at Holyhead last Monday, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002. My driver and I were held separately in two interrogation rooms. I found the whole experience threatening. I was questioned about the contents of my briefcase." [...] Despite initial reports to the contrary, the singer's van, which was full of musical equipment, was not searched. [...] "I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was {{asked a lot of}} personal questions about members of my family and my children and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner", he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very [...] "saddening". [...] "I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. I found the whole affair quite frightening." ...|$|E

40|$|Why the {{interest}} in Hawaiian? The first three generations <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandfather’s <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family in these Islands were fluent in it: Asa Thurston, the missionary, spoke it, preached in it and translated books <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible into Hawaiian. His son, speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom’s House <b>of</b> Representatives before his death at age 32, learned it in Kona as a boy and was as fluent in it as in English. His son, Lorrin A., the Rev-olutionist, was the same. He could catch <b>the</b> detailed nuances <b>of</b> other speakers in the Legislature {{when he was in}} it, especially if they thought they could get away with a wisecrack to their colleagues about him. And on <b>my</b> great-grandmother’s <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, her father, Lor-rin Andrews, put together the first Hawaiian dictionary in 1836 and followed it with an expanded edition in 1865. It was an unsophisti-cated product compared with <b>the</b> outstanding works <b>of</b> Mary Pukui and Samuel Elbert, but they saluted it for its pioneering thoroughness. They quoted H. W. Williams, a critic of Hawaiian dictionaries, as say...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> focus <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to analyze the way in which my family members viewed {{education}} after immigrating from México to the United States. I used portraiture methodology to conduct interviews and narratives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maternal and paternal <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family. They were all in agreement that education is important, and that it is a key tool for social mobility here in the United States. These ideas were consistent throughout <b>the</b> interviews, regardless <b>of</b> generational status and regardless <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> person attended college or not. The differences came in <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> navigating <b>the</b> educational system in this country. There was a stark contrast between the paths to success of my maternal and paternal <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. I propose that because <b>my</b> dad's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family immigrated sooner and assimilated faster in American society, they were {{able to take advantage of}} more resources available to them. Their view of and goals for a higher education were more established and attainable than for <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom’s <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family who faced different barriers including having to learn English...|$|R
6000|$|The next morning, while I was dressing, {{the steward}} of <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship {{came to me}} as usual to see what I wanted. But {{the first thing he}} said to me was--'Rather a bad job, sir--a {{passenger}} missing.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{reason for}} this praise of their quality, if the reason needs to be stated, lies in my feeling of {{definite}} indebtedness to them. They furnished much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charm and poetic suggestion of my childhood. Most of what I have in <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> feeling for music, for rhythm, I derive from <b>my</b> mother's <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house, for it was almost entirely Celt in every characteristic. She herself was a wordless poet, a sensitive singer of sad romantic songs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose all men," [...] said Ann Veronica, {{in a tone}} of {{detached}} criticism, [...] "get {{some such}} entanglement. And, anyhow, it doesn't matter to us."

60|$|If Lee {{would come}} to <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river I would keep {{on the same side}} and fight him, or act on the defensive, {{according}} as might be my estimate of his strength relatively to my own. But these are mere suggestions, which I desire to be controlled by the judgment of yourself and General Halleck.|$|E
60|$|That's how I came to lose Ann. At {{intervals}} {{during her}} remarks I {{tried to put}} <b>my</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, {{but it was no}} good. She wouldn't listen.
