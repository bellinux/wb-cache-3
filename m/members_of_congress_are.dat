5|$|There {{were four}} Saxbe fixes for appointees of presidents prior to Barack Obama. The first two rollbacks {{concerned}} appointees of Republicans William Howard Taft and Richard Nixon, {{and the last}} two were implemented for appointees of Democrats Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Congress approved two more in the weeks preceding Obama's presidency in preparation for his designated Cabinet nominees. Since the 1980s, Saxbe fixes have only been temporary, extending to {{the conclusion of the}} term for which the sitting member of Congress was elected. The Clause has received relatively little scholarly or judicial attention; the sparse extant debate centers on whether the reduction of salary satisfies the Ineligibility Clause, or whether affected <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> ineligible for appointment in spite of the reduction.|$|E
25|$|In {{the face}} of budget pressure, hiring {{challenges}} and some high-profile lapses in its protective service role in 2014, the Brookings Institution and some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> asking whether the agency's focus should shift more to the protective mission, leaving more of its original mission to other agencies.|$|E

25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members of Congress have staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a series}} of court-ordered re-drawings that made the 10th {{district}} substantially more Democratic, Webster announced he would instead run for the open seat of the 11th district. The re-tooled 11th District boundaries includes a swath of Webster's former 10th district. He opted to maintain his residence in Winter Garden, within the borders of the 10th; <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> only required to live in the state they wish to represent. Webster won the Republican primary 60%-40% over Justin Grabelle. He followed up with a 65%-32% victory in the general election over Democrat Dave Koller.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Hastert's firm Dickstein Shapiro and the {{lobbying}} firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist Dick Gephardt split a $1.4 million annual lobbying {{contract with the}} government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert and Gephardt traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt [...] "allowed those members of Congress who were there to have a fuller experience." [...] A National Journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which [...] "lobbyists who can't legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lessig {{believes}} that real progress is effectively impossible with today's political inequality, because <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> beholden {{to the very}} few who can contribute the large sums they need to win elections.

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Supreme Court {{has treated}} {{campaign}} contributions {{as a free}} speech issue. Some see money as a good influence in politics since it [...] "enables candidates to communicate with voters." [...] Few members retire from Congress without complaining about {{how much it costs}} to campaign for reelection. Critics contend that <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> not {{required}} to disclose their exact net worth, {{organizations such as the}} nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) prepare estimated ranges based on public disclosures.

In contrast, the average annual family income in 1958 was around $5,000 and a factory worker in Philadelphia was averaging about $4,500 a year.

2500|$|When the Senate held up annual {{payments}} to the district because of debate over whether {{the federal government should}} continue to pay for holding the district's partisan elections, Barry called for public hearings on the matter. He also commented, [...] "Since it is a known fact that the majority makeup of an elected government will be black, the conferees' agreement indicates to me that some <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> saying that black people cannot be fiscally responsible, and therefore, have to have a predominantly white Congress overseeing how our monies are spent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{election}} the Democrats won {{both houses of}} Congress. The White House Bulletin, published by Bulletin News, cited rumors of Rove's impending departure from the White House staff: [...] "'Karl represents the old style and he's got to go if the Democrats are going to believe Bush's talk of getting along', said a key Bush advisor." [...] However, while allowing that many Republican <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> [...] "resentful {{of the way he}} and the White House conducted the losing campaign", the New York Times also stated that, [...] "White House officials say President Bush has every intention of keeping Mr. Rove on through the rest of his term." ...|$|E

Wade and Harris discussed MZM's desire for a $10million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris's 2006 Senate campaign. Regarding the MZM contributions, the Sentinel article goes on to say [...] "The Justice Department has said Wade, who personally handed many of the checks to Harris, did not tell Harris the contributions were illegal".

2500|$|Levitt's 1994 {{paper on}} {{campaign}} spending employs a unique identification strategy {{to control for}} the quality of each candidate (which in previous work had led to an overstatement of the true effect). It concludes that campaign spending has a very small impact on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending. On the subject of federal spending and elections, previous empirical studies were not able to establish that <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>are</b> rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district because of omitted variables bias. [...] Levitt and Snyder (1997) employ an instrument which circumvents this problem and finds evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents; they find that an additional $100 per capita spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.|$|E

Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
