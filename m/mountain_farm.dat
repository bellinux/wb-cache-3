25|$|The common {{mountain}} or {{forest pasture}} used for transhumance in summer is called seter or bod / bua. The same term {{is used for}} a related mountain cabin, which {{was used as a}} summer residence. In summer (usually late June), livestock is moved to a <b>mountain</b> <b>farm,</b> often quite distant from a home farm, in order to preserve meadows in valleys for producing hay. Livestock were typically tended for summer by girls and younger women, who also milked and made cheese. Bulls usually remained at the home farm. As autumn approached and grazing became in short supply, livestock are returned to a home farm.|$|E

The rear of the column was continually and disastrously engaged with the enemy pouring after. It is perhaps the saddest chapter {{in the history of}} the war. My grandmother, Mrs. Hankey (née Pillworthy), then a young girl on a <b>mountain</b> <b>farm</b> on the line of the retreat, distinctly remembers giving a soda biscuit, which was greedily received, to Colonel Diggory Jacks, then in command of our division, and lending him an umbrella, which was never returned.
