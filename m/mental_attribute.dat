I have called this the method of statistics by intercomparison. There is no bodily or <b>mental</b> <b>attribute</b> in any race of individuals that can be so dealt with, whether our judgment in comparing them be guided by common-sense observation or by actual measurement, which cannot be gripped and consolidated into an ogive with a smooth outline, and thenceforward be treated in discussion as a single object.|$|E

60|$|What, again, are the {{particular}} attributes {{in human beings}} which {{seem to have a}} more especial reference to Progress, and do not so directly suggest the ideas of Order and Preservation? They are chiefly the qualities of mental activity, enterprise, and courage. But are not all these qualities fully as much required for preserving the good we have as for adding to it? If there is any thing certain in human affairs, it is that valuable acquisitions are only to be retained by the continuation of the same energies which gained them. Things left {{to take care of themselves}} inevitably decay. Those whom success induces to relax their habits of care and thoughtfulness, and their willingness to encounter disagreeables, seldom long retain their good fortune at its height. The <b>mental</b> <b>attribute</b> which seems exclusively dedicated to Progress, and is the culmination of the tendencies to it, is Originality, or Invention. Yet this is no less necessary for Permanence, since, in the inevitable changes of human affairs, new inconveniences and dangers continually grow up, which must be encountered by new resources and contrivances, in order to keep things going on even only as well as they did before. Whatever qualities, therefore, in a government, tend to encourage activity, energy, courage, originality, are requisites of Permanence as well as of Progress, only a somewhat less degree of them will, on the average, suffice for the former purpose than for the latter.|$|E

60|$|In {{variations}} {{caused by}} the direct action of changed conditions, of which several instances have been given, {{certain parts of the}} body are directly affected by the new conditions, and consequently throw off modified gemmules, which are transmitted to the offspring. On any ordinary view it is unintelligible how changed conditions, whether acting on the embryo, the young or the adult, can cause inherited modifications. It is equally or even more unintelligible on any ordinary view, how the effects of the long-continued use or disuse of a part, or of changed habits of body or mind, can be inherited. A more perplexing problem can hardly be proposed; but on our view we have only to suppose that certain cells become at last structurally modified; and that these throw off similarly modified gemmules. This may occur at any period of development, and the modification will be inherited at a corresponding period; for the modified gemmules will unite in all ordinary cases with the proper preceding cells, and will consequently be developed at the same period at which the modification first arose. With respect to mental habits or instincts, we are so profoundly ignorant of the relation between the brain and the power of thought that we do not know positively whether a fixed habit induces any change in the nervous system, though this seems highly probable; but when such habit or other <b>mental</b> <b>attribute,</b> or insanity, is inherited, we must believe that some actual modification is transmitted (27/69. See some remarks to this effect by Sir H. Holland in his 'Medical Notes' 1839 page 32.); and this implies, according to our hypothesis, that gemmules derived from modified nerve-cells are transmitted to the offspring.|$|E

40|$|Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} area of research. Current {{research and development}} primarily focuses on the analysis, design and implementation of agent based software whereas testing is less prioritised. Software testing is an important and indispensable part of software development process.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} a {{scientific}} basis for “presence ” as it’s usually understood in virtual environments research, cannot be established {{on the basis of}} postexperience presence questionnaires alone. To illustrate the point, an arbitrary <b>mental</b> <b>attribute</b> called “colorfulness of the experience ” is conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74 respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested that colorfulness of yesterday’s experiences was associated with {{the extent to which a}} person accomplished their tasks, and also associated with yesterday being a “good, ” “pleasant, ” but not frustrating day. The meaninglessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity or behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{essay is}} {{on the subject of}} the changes that the Swedish {{military}} is undergoing. This essay will take the old ways of alignment thinking, were the military was to protect the nation against an invasion and compare it to the newer way of alignment thinking, where the military is to go abroad and do peacekeeping operations as there main objective. This comparison will be done by using Bengt Abrahamson theory about professions. He uses three parts one is specialised theoretical knowledge, another is ethics and the last is corps spirit. This theory will then be connected to four interviews. Two with officers representing the defence thinking and two officers representing the peacekeeping thinking. Through this theory and interviews there will be a comparison which tells the different skills and <b>mental</b> <b>attribute</b> the soldiers of the different alignment way of thinking requires. The results shows that the soldiers from the defensive alignment are not capable to do the samet hings as the soldiers from the peacekeeping alignment, but the soldiers from the peacekeeping alignment can handle both the defence and the peaces keeping. Most importantly it shows that there is a difference in the mental attitude between the two ways of alignment thinking. Something I think should be looked upon further to show if it has any effect on how the different soldiers act depending on which alignment they have been trained under. Can the soldiers from these two alignments be combined, or are they too different to do so...|$|E

They are therefore public in the sense that every agent who has overheard the session, has the same beliefs about the mental attitudes of the role. Second, the moves permitted to the dialogue participants in the same dialogue game are based on the role only, such that different kind of moves can be specified in different types of dialogue games. Obligations are associated to roles related to institutions which can enforce them by means of sanctions. Third, expectations are based both on the mental attitudes ascribed to the agent and to the role. 1 Multiple sessions {{at the same}} time Consider an agent who informs another agent that his web services can be used by all other agents, informs a third agent that his services can only be used by agents with the appropriate certificates, requests from a fourth agent a document, and informs a fifth agent that he does not have a goal to obtain this document. The semantics of speech acts in mentalistic approaches like FIPA [8], specified in terms of plan operators whose preconditions refer to the beliefs, goals and intentions of agents, cannot model such an insincere agent.
