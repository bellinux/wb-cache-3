In particular, their excellent reliability and minimal maintenance requirements make series compensation the most cost effective method of enhancing the power transfer capability {{of an existing}} or proposed interconnection. E. H. V. lines employing series capacitors however, pose difficult problems for the line protection relays, not encountered with plain feeders. One important cause of these problems is the resonance between the series capacitor and the line series inductance, which in turn imposes a sub-synchronous oscillation on the system signals. Also, the rapid changes in the circuit parameters, resulting from {{the operation of the}} capacitor protection equipment, namely the spark gaps, introduce some difficulties for the line protection schemes, especially an impedance <b>measuring</b> <b>relay.</b> These spark gaps are installed in parallel with the series capacitors to prevent the development of very high voltages across the capacitor which could cause excessive damage to the equipment. The work presented herein describes a new digital distance relay suitable for series compensated line applications. The errors in the impedance measurement for a phase to earth fault when the spark gaps do not flash over, are discussed and new methods are proposed to compensate for these errors. The new concept of a complex residual compensation factor, as opposed to a real one, is also discussed. A new adaptive filtering is incorporated in the relay in order to minimise the detrimental effect of the subsynchronous oscillation on the relay decision logic. Finally, the relay is thoroughly tested for many different system configurations, to fully evaluate the relay response...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} discusses uncertainty quantication as {{posed in}} the Data Collaboration framework. Data Collaboration is a methodology for combining experimental data and system models to induce constraints {{on a set}} of uncertain system parameters. The framework is summarized, including outlines of notation and techniques. The main techniques include polynomial optimization and surrogate modeling to ascertain the consistency of all data and models as well as propagate uncertainty {{in the form of a}} model prediction. One of the main methods of Data Collaboration is using techniques of nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming to provide both lower and upper bounds on the various objectives. The Lagrangian dual of the NQCQP provides both an outer bound to the optimal objective as well as Lagrange multipliers. These multipliers act as sensitivity <b>measures</b> <b>relaying</b> the effects of changes to the parameter constraint bounds on the optimal objective. These multipliers are rewritten to provide the sensitivity to uncertainty in the response prediction with respect to uncertainty in the parameters and experimental data. It is often of interest to find a vector of parameters that is both feasible and representative of the current community work and knowledge. This is posed as the problem of finding the minimal number of parameters that must deviate from their literature value to achieve concurrence with all experimental data constraints. This problem is heuristically solved using the l 1 -norm in place of the cardinality function. A lower bound on the objective is provided through an NQCQP formulation. In order to use the NQCQP techniques, the system models need to have quadratic forms. When they do not have quadratic forms, surrogate models are fitted. Surrogate modeling can be difficult for complex models with large numbers of parameters and long simulation times because of the amount of evaluation-time required to make a good fit. New techniques are developed for searching for an active subspace of the parameters, and subsequently creating an experiment design on the active subspace that adheres to the original parameter constraints. The active subspace can have a dimension signicantly lower than the original parameter dimension thereby reducing the computational complexity of generating the surrogate model. The technique is demonstrated on several examples from combustion chemistry and biology. Several other applications of the Data Collaboration framework are presented. They are used to demonstrate the complexity of describing a high dimensional feasible set of parameter values as constrained by experimental data. Approximating the feasible set can lead to a simple description, but the predictive capability of such a set is significantly reduced compared to the actual feasible set. This is demonstrated on an example from combustion chemistry...|$|R

They could identify which relays {{were on a}} target Tor user’s path by building paths {{one at a time}} through every Tor relay and introducing congestion. However, the original attack was performed on only 13 Tor relays on the nascent and lightly loaded Tor network. We show that the attack from their paper is no longer practical on today’s 1500 -relay heavily loaded Tor network. The attack doesn’t scale because a) the attacker needs a tremendous amount of bandwidth to <b>measure</b> enough <b>relays</b> during the attack window, and b) there are too many false positives now that many other users are adding congestion {{at the same time as}} the attacks. We then strengthen the original congestion attack by combining it with a novel bandwidth amplification attack based on a flaw in the Tor design that lets us build long circuits that loop back on themselves. We show that this new combination attack is practical and effective by demonstrating a working attack on today’s deployed Tor network. By coming up with a model to better understand Tor’s routing behavior under congestion, we further provide a statistical analysis characterizing how effective our attack is in each case. ...|$|R
