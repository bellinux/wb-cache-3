Experimental results using architectural and interconnect simulators show that the new low-overhead subsystem facilitates employment of thermal and delay-aware dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. In contrast to using existing on-chip interconnect resources to communicate <b>monitor</b> <b>data,</b> the new subsystem provides necessary bandwidth for <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> traffic without impacting application data traffic.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Consistent spatial–temporal yield {{patterns}} {{should help}} determine spatial production potential. Our {{objective was to}} evaluate methods for using yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> to develop spatial yield goal maps. Three to seven years of yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> were analyzed for five sprinkler–irrigated cornfields in central and western Kansas. Yield data were block–averaged to 55 m square cells, normalized based on the mean yield, and then used to develop spatial yield goals for subsequent years using six different methods. One method used a uniform yield goal, two methods combined normalized yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> with a uniform yield goal (transitional), and three methods used only normalized yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> from previous years. Methods were evaluated based {{on their ability to}} predict the spatial yield pattern of the subsequent year better than the uniform method. Yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> were also segregated based on the temporal CV of each field {{during the time of the}} study, and the six methods were evaluated only on the data that were deemed temporally stable. The result of incorporating yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> into yield goals was inconsistent across sites and years. For one site, the two transitional and three yield monitor methods were significantly better predictors of normalized yield. On another field, the uniform method was a better predictor of normalized yield than the yield monitor methods in three of six years, while the yield monitor methods were better than the uniform method in another year. On a third field, the yield monitor method predicted normalized yield better than the uniform method in one of four years with no difference in the other three years. In general, when the correlation coefficient between two years of yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> exceeded 0. 70, the methods tha...|$|R

The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{even though}} volcanoes pose {{significant}} threats to local communities and any sizable eruption would affect Canada's economy, {{the work of}} understanding the frequency and eruption characteristics at volcanoes in Canada is a slow process. This is because most of Canada's dormant and potentially active volcanoes are located in isolated jagged regions, very few scientists study Canadian volcanoes {{and the provision of}} money in the Canadian government is limited. Because of these issues, scientists studying Canada's volcanoes have a basic understanding of Canada's volcanic heritage and how it might impact people in the future. Volcanologists are aware that certain areas in Canada have higher levels of volcanic activity than others and how eruptions in these areas might affect people and the environment they live in. When a volcano is showing evidence of volcanic activity, quick action will be required to better understand the process. The lowest possibility for an eruption in Canada per year is approximately 1/200; for a passive lava eruption the possibility is about 1/220, and for a major explosive eruption it is about 1/3333. Even though volcanoes {{do not seem to be}} part of the everyday reality of Canadians, recurrent earthquakes and the formation of large mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest indicate this part of Canada is still geologically active. The possibility of an eruption, even a large explosive one, cannot be ruled out. Quiet as they currently seem, volcanoes in Northern and Western Canada are part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Along with volcanoes associated with recent earthquake activity, a scenario of an eruption at Mount Cayley in southwestern British Columbia illustrates how Western Canada is in danger to a volcanic eruption, which has not erupted for at least 310,000years. This impact is becoming even more likely as population in the Pacific Northwest increases and development spreads. The scenario is based on former eruptions in the north-south trending Garibaldi Volcanic Belt and includes both explosive and passive eruptions. Its effect is mostly due to the attention of defenseless public services in canyons. However, the threat from volcanoes outside of Canada seems much greater than the threat from volcanoes within Canada because of the lack of <b>monitoring</b> <b>data</b> at Canadian volcanoes and the age of most volcanoes in Canada is poorly known. But for some, their minimal degree of erosion indicates they formed much less than 10,000years ago, including the Milbanke Sound Group on Price Island, Dufferin Island, Swindle Island, Lake Island, and Lady Douglas Island in the Milbanke Sound area of coastal British Columbia. However, it is known volcanoes in the U.S. states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California have been more active in historic times than those within Canada. Therefore, volcanoes in the United States are monitored with caution and attention by the United States Geological Survey.|$|E

40|$|At {{precision}} agriculture {{data analysis}} workshops {{there are often}} diverging views {{on the kind of}} statistics that is appropriate for sensor based or remotely sensed data such as yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> and imagery. One view is that yield <b>monitor</b> <b>data</b> represent a sample. In that case, some sort of sampling theory applies and well-known tools from spatial statistics and geostatistics should be utilized. The concurrent view is that precision agriculture data on yields actually represent the population; the use of sample statistics is therefore not pertinent and simple averages or proportions referring to this one state-of-the-world can be calculated without having to evoke statistical inference. At first sight, it may seem natural to believe that taking simple averages from treatment blocks and comparing these to other averages provides useful decision making information.
