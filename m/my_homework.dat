Hill and Pras began {{under the name}} Tranzlator Crew, chosen {{because they wanted to}} rhyme in different languages. Another female vocalist was soon replaced by Michel's cousin, multi-instrumentalist Wyclef Jean. The group began performing in local showcases and high school talent shows. Hill was initially only a singer, but then learned to rap too; instead of modeling herself on female rappers like Salt-n-Pepa and MC Lyte, she preferred male rappers like Ice Cube and developed her flow from listening to them.

500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at five in the morning, go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish <b>my</b> <b>homework,</b> and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E

Actively, one gives or delivers a bollocking to someone; in the building trade one can 'throw a right bollocking into' someone.|$|E

We will use Datastream or other vendors {{as a source for}} financial data, and EViews software to build ARCH and other time series models. There will be homework and a paper but no exam. There is a lot of reading. The bold references will be distributed one week in advance. The others will be available for lending in <b>my</b> office. The <b>homework</b> assignments will frequently be computer exercises which will be presented in class. EViews is available in the computer lab but I recommend that you buy a copy or upgrade to version 4. 0 which has ARCH software as well as GMM, cointegration etc. This course presumes familiarity with finance as well as a course in graduate econometrics.

30|$|People {{also require}} {{awareness}} of the mind wandering triggers. Previous work has suggested that people might not actually be aware of how a stimulus influences their behavior but will still report a relationship when asked (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977), suggesting that people might infer a relationship based on causal theories or expectations. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} some triggers were inferred rather than remembered. That said, we aimed to avoid this by making reporting of the trigger voluntary. Specifically, we ask participants whether there was “something in the [text/video] that triggered this thought,” and explicitly gave instruction for both options (“If yes then please describe what it was and if no then leave blank”). The fact that participants reported triggers for around half of the thoughts suggests that they indeed did not feel compelled to report a trigger for every thought. Furthermore, the ~[*] 10 % of the thought–trigger pairs for which thoughts and triggers were (inadvertently) reported together provide some insight into the validity of reported triggers. Examples suggest that these thoughts are triggered by a specific aspect of the stimuli, rather than post-hoc inference of the relationship: “The word “good” reminded me of <b>my</b> philosophy <b>homework</b> I haven’t finished,” “The boy was headed somewhere with his briefcase and it reminded me of what I have to do,” “I read the words “don’t know” and it reminded me of Socrates basically saying we don’t know wisdom, only God does.” Furthermore, there is also the possibility that it might be easier to remember and therefore report semantically associated triggers. These are known limits of verbal protocols and we are unaware of any alternative to obtain the contents of consciousness.|$|R
3000|$|Other {{respondents}} also {{highlighted the}} growing problem {{of conflict and}} tension between parents and children. One woman told us that her teen-aged daughter was {{getting more and more}} annoyed and irritated with her because she didn’t like her (mother’s) controlling behavior. She further said: “My daughter distances herself from me [mother] because according to her I am nobody to control her dressing and movements.” Some women (9 of 32) expressed some fears such as aolad-say-fasila (intergenerational gap) as a cause of conflict and stress in families while living in Germany. Almost every respondent expressed a desire to preserve and transmit Pakistani values to their children. “If these values are under threat, we will simply go back; we cannot compromise”, said one mother of three small daughters. Another participant in her mid-thirties with a university degree pointed out: “Because of the language barrier, I cannot help my children in their school <b>homework.</b> <b>My</b> children think that I am a lay person, know nothing and they consider me backward. This is sometimes distressing for me.” [...]...|$|R

40|$|In {{this action}} {{research}} study of my classroom of 11 th grade geometry, I investigated {{the use of}} rubrics to help me assess <b>my</b> students during <b>homework</b> presentations. I {{wanted to know more}} about the processes students went through as they did their homework problems, so homework presentations were implemented with the rubrics being the main form of assessment. I discovered that students are willing to speak about mathematics and can gain more understanding of mathematical processes as a result of homework presentations. The scores of the class improved after they talked about the homework assignments with each other. As a result of this research, I plan to keep on using <b>homework</b> presentations in <b>my</b> classroom to talk about homework, but discontinue the use of rubrics in assessment of students in mathematics. I also found students going to the board to solve problems in small groups are another helpful way to use presentations prior to assessment to help me understand where the students are with a new concept prior to assigning homework or giving an assessment...|$|R

I also {{wanted to see what}} the actual conditions are when they do their <b>homework.</b> <b>My</b> second purpose is to see what their teachers think about homework and what they think are the positive and negative effects of homework. To be able to answer my main purpose I made a questionnaire with the pupils. The teachers were interviewed one by one. I decided to compare the results that the questionnaire had provided with the answers I got from the teachers. This way I could see if there was any similarity or difference between the answers. I also analysed and compared the answers the teachers gave with the theories I found in different literary or other material. This made it possible for me to compare if the positive and negative effects that the teachers experienced and whether these effects agree with the theories researchers make of the subject: homework...|$|R
40|$|This brief {{analysis}} utilizes a CA {{perspective to}} deepen {{our understanding of}} the ways in which participants in interactions are able to handle more than one activity simultaneously. Many of the studies on multi-tasking, as Good (2009) noted, address this from a cognitive science perspective (e. g. Salvucci, 2005; Salvucci, Taatgen, & Kushleyeva, 2006), focusing on the brain’s ability to attend to several tasks at once. According to this work, we humans do a less than stellar job at balancing more than one thing at a time. In fact, with each task we add to the mix, our performance suffers that much more. As a social scientist, I find these conclusions enlightening and worthy of further study. As a mother, I chuckle, because even as I write this, my ear is bent to <b>my</b> daughter doing <b>homework</b> and the dinner that is on the stove, and I have gotten up from my workstation twice to wipe the bedroom wall clean of all traces of marker from my son’s dirty hands. Since at the end of the day, every member of my family is fed, cleaned, and accounted for, I proclaim that I do my job successfully. Thus, I agree wholeheartedly with the argument (Good, 2009) that by looking at the social action of multi-tasking as it happens in real time, as it happens so many nights in the lives of families, we might complicate the notion that it is something that humans simply cannot do well...|$|R

40|$|We {{subscribe}} to an online encyclopedia to help one of <b>my</b> sons with <b>homework,</b> and because I placed the order, their “This Day in History” feature {{comes to my}} inbox. China rarely figures, which isn’t that surprising. After all, they need brief, punchy items that will catch readers’ attention, and that means items familiar enough to a general audience that a five word title is understandable, and that only three sentences are needed {{to remind us of}} what happened and why we should care. So I’m not crusading for “ 1644 : Manchus enter Beijing with the help of Wu Sangui” to replace D-Day as the entry for June 6. Still, anniversaries are good hooks for thinking about how history matters, and Chinese history has plenty of them. From that perspective, starting a blog in 2008 is less than ideal, because so many of the familiar modern anniversaries end in “ 9,” not “ 8 ”: the May 4 th movement (1919), the founding of the P. R. C. (1949), Tiananmen (1989). Over the course of this year, I’ll be ruminating on a bunch of the “ 8 ” anniversaries, including some that may seem pretty obscure. The obvious ones are recent –The Great Leap Forward begins in 1958, Deng Xiaoping solidifies his power and launches his reforms in 1978, Disney releases Mulan in 1998 (OK, they may not all be world-historical events) – but I like the challenge of starting way back, especially since it’s not the period I research. So to begin with… 8 C. E. (2, 000 years ago) : Wang Mang usurps the throne, bans slavery, and institutes radical land reform – but still falls to peasant rebels. The background to this is some horribly complicated court politics, but Wang Mang (45 BCE- 23 CE) was an official from a very elite family that had inter-married with the imperial lineage; the emperor Chengdi, who came to the throne in 32 BCE, was his first cousin. Chengdi was not much interested in governing and a succession of regents did so in his stead; Wang Mang was appointed regent in 8 BCE. The emperor then died without an heir two years later. Wang was up and down during political struggles over the next 15 years, but by 6 CE he had installed his daughter as empress, a one-year old as emperor and himself as regent and “acting emperor. ” Two years later, after an intensive propaganda campaign that included the appearance of many engineered “portents,” considerable pressure mounted for him to assume the throne; after demurring a few times over the course of 8 C. E. (increasing his reputation for Confucian virtue) he finally accepted. He proclaimed that the Han had lost the mandate of heaven, and proclaimed himself first emperor of the Xin 新 (“New”) Dynasty on January 10, 9 C. E. (OK, it didn’t all happen in the year 8. ...|$|R
