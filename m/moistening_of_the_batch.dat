Wettability of plant protein isolates is dependent on particle sizes and therefore on spray-drying and agglomeration conditions. <b>The</b> particle sizes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proteins are determined with a Malvern Mastersizer S measuring system. In a testing device, specially designed for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> proteins and fibres the time is measured for <b>the</b> complete <b>moistening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> samples.

40|$|The eastward-propagating intraseasonal {{oscillation}} {{represented by}} the Chikira-Sugiyama cumulus scheme in a general circulation model was investigated focusing on <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free-tropospheric humidity. <b>The</b> net effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical advection and cloud process amplifies the positive moisture anomaly in the mature phase, supporting the moisture-mode theory. The horizontal advection causes <b>the</b> eastward propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. <b>The</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moisture profile is accurately understood by using environmental vertical velocity outside cumuli. The velocity is regulated by a thermodynamic balance under a weak temperature gradient. A nondimensional parameter α {{plays an important role}} in the moisture variation, which characterizes <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>moistening</b> (drying) induced by external heating (cooling). In the middle and lower troposphere, the major moistening factor is the radiative warming anomaly, which induces the upward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. <b>The</b> reevaporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precipitation works as drying, since its cooling effect induces the downward environmental vertical velocity anomaly. Snow melting significantly cools and thereby dries <b>the</b> midtroposphere. <b>The</b> <b>moistening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midtroposphere is important for moistening the lower troposphere through <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> α. <b>The</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>moistening</b> depends on <b>the</b> heating profile, and congestus clouds play an important role in it. The heating profile, which maximizes <b>the</b> <b>moistening</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free troposphere, is realized in the mature phase. The atmosphere is marginally unstable even in the mature phase, which is a favorable condition for the congestus clouds to occur...|$|R
