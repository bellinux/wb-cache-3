40|$|ABSTRACT: Determination of the {{topology}} of peptides in membranes {{is important}} for characterizing and understanding the interactions of peptides with membranes. We describe a method that uses fluorescence quenching arising from resonance energy transfer (“FRET”) for determining the topology of the tryptophan residues of peptides partitioned into phospholipid bilayer vesicles. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} a novel lyso-phospholipid quencher (lysoMC), N-(7 -hydroxyl- 4 -methylcoumarin- 3 -acetyl) - 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -hydroxy-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine. The design principle was to anchor the <b>methylcoumarin</b> quencher in the membrane interface by attaching it to the headgroup of lyso-phosphoethanolamine. We show that lysoMC can be incorporated readily into large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles to yield either symmetrically (both leaflets) or asymmetrically (outer leaflet only) labeled bilayers. LysoMC quenches the fluorescence of membrane-bound tryptophan by the Förster mechanism with an apparent R 0 that is comparable to the thickness of the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer (25 Å). Consequently, the <b>methylcoumarin</b> acceptor predominantly quenches tryptophans that reside in the same monolayer as the probe. The topology of a peptide’s tryptophan in membranes can be determined by comparing the quenching in symmetric and asymmetric lysoMC-labeled vesicles. Because it is essential to know that asymmetrically incorporated lysoMC remains so under all conditions, we also developed a second type of FRET experimen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{attached}} the conformational probe <b>methylcoumarin</b> acetate (MCA) {{specifically to the}} junctional foot protein (JFP) moiety of triads, and monitored conformational changes in the JFP during polarization and depolarization of the T-tubule moiety. The MCA fluorescence decreased upon T-tubule polarization, and the fluorescence changes were blocked by preventing T-tubule polarization or by a nimodipine block of the T-tubule-to-sarcoplasmic reticulum communication. Depolarization of the T-tubule reversed the MCA fluorescence decrease which had been produced by T-tubule polarization. These {{results suggest that the}} conformational and functional states of the JFP are regulated by T-tubule polarization and depolarization in a reciprocal fashion...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a series of}} phthalimide derivatives as fl uorescent probes for moni- toring of cationic photopolymerization of monomers by Fluorescence Probe Technology (FPT) has been studied in comparison to the {{performance of}} a 7 -diethylamino- 4 - <b>methylcoumarin</b> (Coumarin 1) probe. It was found that the phthalimide probes are much more stable than Coumarin 1 under cationic polymerization conditions. Moreover, the aminophthalimide probes turned out to be long-wavelength sensitizers for the dia- ryliodonium photoinitiators used to initiate the polymerization process. The sensitizing effect of the probes compensates in excess the inhibiting effect of their amino groups on the cationic polymerization kinetics...|$|E
30|$|The test {{compounds}} {{were evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to inhibit the catalytic activity of human CYP 1 enzymes by means of high throughput fluorometric detection assays conducted in 96 -well microtitre plates as described elsewhere [16, 17]. 7 -Ethoxyresorufin (ERes) was used as a substrate for detecting activity of CYP 1 B 1 and 7 -ethoxy- 3 -cyanocoumarin (CEC) was used as a substrate for both CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 A 2. Further, the substrates, 3 -[2 -(N N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl]- 7 -methoxy- 4 <b>methylcoumarin</b> (AMMC), 7 -benzyloxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin (BFC), and CEC were used as substrates for CYP 2 D 6, CYP 3 A 4, and CYP 2 C 19, respectively. The reactions were monitored fluorometrically at 37 °C, using a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. All inhibitors were dissolved in a solvent of 20 % acetonitrile in water and less than 0.3 % of acetonitrile was used in the final assay.|$|E
40|$|In {{the central}} and {{peripheral}} nervous systems, the neuropeptide precursor proenkephalin must be endoproteolytically cleaved by enzymes known as prohormone convertases 1 and 2 (PC 1 and PC 2) to generate opioid-active enkephalins. in this study, we have investigated the specificity of recombinant mouse PC 2 for proenkephalin-related internally quenched (IQ) peptides, for <b>methylcoumarin</b> amide-based fluorogenic peptides, and for recombinant rat proenkephalin. IQ peptides exhibited specificity constants (k(cat) /K-m) between 9. 4 x 10 (4) M- 1 s(- 1) (Abz-Val-Pro-Arg-Met-Glu-Lys-Arg-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Gln-EDDnp; where Abz is ortho-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) ethylenediamine)) and 0. 24 x 10 (4) M- 1 s(- 1) (Abz-Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Arg-Val-Gly-Arg-Pro-Glu-EDDnp), with the peptide B to Met-enk-Arg-Phe cleavage preferred (Met-enk is met-enkephalin). Fluorogenic substrates with P 1, P 2, and P 4 basic amino acids were hydrolyzed with specificity constants ranging between 2. 0 x 10 (3) M- 1 s(- 1) (Ac-Orn-Ser-Lys-Arg-MCA; where MCA is <b>methylcoumarin</b> amide) and 1. 8 x 10 (4) M- 1 s(- 1) (<Glu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA; where <Glu is pyroglutamic acid). Substrates containing only a single basic residue were not appreciably hydrolyzed, and substrates lacking a P 4 Arg exhibited k(cat) of less than 0. 05 s(- 1). Substitution of ornithine for Lys at the P 4 position did not significantly affect the k(cat) but increased the K-m 2 -fold. Data from both sets of fluorogenic substrates supported the contribution of a P 4 Arg to PC 2 preference. Analysis of proenkephalin reaction products using immunoblotting and gel permeation chromatography demonstrated that PC 2 can directly cleave proenkephalin and that the generation of small opioid peptides from intermediates is mediated almost entirely by PC 2 rather than by PC 1, These results are {{in accord with the}} analysis of PC 2 knock-out brains, in which the amounts of three mature enkephalins were depleted by more than three-quarters.

Many drugs, including anticoagulants, tranquilizers and general anesthetics are transported in the blood while bound to albumin.

40|$|Rates of {{substrate}} hydrolysis by nonattached {{bacteria and}} by bacteria attached to particles derived from marine diatom frustules were estimated by using two substrates, a dipeptide analog and a protein. Adsorption {{of the two}} substrates onto the particles was also evaluated. Methyl-coumarinyl-amide-leucine (MCA-leucine) was used to estimate hydrolysis of dipeptides by measuring an increase in fluorescence as MCA-leucine was hydrolyzed to leucine and the fluorochrome <b>methylcoumarin.</b> To examine hydrolysis of a larger molecule, we prepared a radiolabeled protein by 14 C-methylation of bovine serum albumin. The rate of protein hydrolysis in samples of particle-attached or nonattached bacteria was estimated by precipitating all nonhydrolyzed protein with cold trichloroacetic acid and then determining the trichloroacetic acid-soluble radiolabeled material, which represented methyl- 14 C-peptides and -amino acids. About 25 % of the MCA-leucine adsorbed to the particles. MCA-leucine was hydrolyzed faster by nonattached than attached bacteria, which was probably related to its tendency to remain dissolved in the liquid phase.

Radical Scavenging activity of tested compounds or plant extracts was measured by modified DPPH test use program SIA (sequential injection analysis). Singificant radical scavenging activity exhibited polyfenols, namely gallic acid (EC 50 = 0, 0025 ± 0, 002 mg/ml) and ethyl-gallate (EC 50 = 0, 0038 ± 0, 001 mg/ml). Also the pure latex of Croton lechleri exhibited significantly radical scavenging activity (EC 50 = 0, 0347 ± 0, 018 mg/ml). From the group of tested methylcoumarins, the excelent antioxidant aktivity exhibited ortho-dihydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarins, espicially 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 4 - <b>methylcoumarin</b> and its derivatives (EC 50 = 24, 9 ± 2, 7 μM). Further was the antioxidant activity tested by FRAP methods modified to used micropalates P 400 μl.

40|$|The {{substrate}} specificity {{of the major}} cysteinyl proteinase of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (cruzipain) was investigated, by combinatorial replacement of amino acid residues at positions P 5 -P' 5, using a fluorescent quenched solid-phase library assay. Positively charged residues {{appear to be a}} general preference in the P 5 -P 3 and the P' 5 -P' 3 positions, while a hydrophobic residue was always required at the P 2 position. A broad range of amino acids could be accepted at the P' 1 position. A clear difference in terms of specificity between cruzipain and human cathepsin L was observed for the accommodation of Pro at the P 2 position. The P 1 specificity was investigated by a more detailed enzyme kinetic analysis using peptidyl-MCA (where MCA is <b>methylcoumarin</b> amide) and Abz-peptidyl-EDDnp [where Abz is o-aminobenzoic acid and EDDnp is N-(2, 4 -dinitrophenyl) ethylenediamine] as substrates, and the results were compared with those obtained using human cathepsin L. Cruzipain showed a clear preference for benzyl-Cys or Arg at the P 1 position. Human cathepsin L presented similar behaviour to that of cruzipain for the hydrolysis of the epsilon-NH 2 -Cap-Leu-Xaa-MCA (where Cap is epsilon-aminocaproyl) and Abz-Lys-Leu-Xaa-Phe-Ser-Lys-Gln-EDDnp series, whereas the mammalian enzyme was able to tolerate large P 1 residues, such as phenylalanine, better than cruzipain in the latter series...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} whether fasting plasma Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP 4) activity and active Glucagon-Like Peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) were predictive of {{the onset of}} metabolic syndrome. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted of 2042 adults (863 men and 1, 179 women) aged 18 - 70 years without metabolic syndrome examined in 2007 (baseline) and 2011 (follow-up). Baseline plasma DPP 4 activity was determined as the rate of cleavage of 7 -amino- 4 - <b>methylcoumarin</b> (AMC) from the synthetic substrate H-glycyl-prolyl-AMC and active GLP- 1 was determined by enzymoimmunoassay. Results: During an average of 4 years of follow-up, 131 men (15. 2 %) and 174 women (14. 8 %) developed metabolic syndrome. In multiple linear regression analysis, baseline DPP 4 activity was an independent predictor {{of an increase in}} insulin resistance over a 4 -year period (P, 0. 01). In multivariable-adjusted models, the odds ratio (OR) for incident metabolic syndrome comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles of DPP 4 activity and active GLP- 1 were 2. 82, 0. 45 for men and 2. 48, 0. 36 for women respectively. Furthermore, plasma DPP 4 activity significantly improved the area under the ROC curve for predicting new-onset metabolic syndrome based on information from metabolic syndrome components (Both P, 0. 01). Conclusions: DPP 4 activity is an important predictor of the onset of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in apparently healthy Chinese men and women.

BackgroundIn heart failure, {{the interaction between}} the N-terminal and central domains of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the domains where many mutations have been found in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), is defective, as shown in our recent report. MethodsSarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were isolated from canine left ventricular muscle (normal or 4 -weeks rapid ventricular pacing). The RyR was labeled with the fluorescent conformational probe <b>methylcoumarin</b> acetate (MCA) with DPc 10 (a synthetic peptide corresponding to Gly 2460 -Pro 2495 of RyR, one of the mutable domains in CPVT) as a site-direction carrier. ResultsNormal cardiac function was well preserved in carvedilol-treated/paced dogs (CV+) but not in the untreated/paced dogs (CV−). In CV−, the interdomain interaction within RyR was defective (i. e., in an unzipped state), as determined by the fluorescence quenching technique. However, in CV+, the domain interaction remained normal (i. e., in a zipped state). In CV−, oxidative stress of RyR (reduction in the number of free thiols) was severe, but it was negligible in CV+. In (CV−) failing cardiomyocytes, incubation with low-dose CV (30 nmol/l), which eliminated intracellular reactive oxygen species with no acute effect on cell shortening, markedly improved the contractile function and Ca 2 +transient. However, after domain unzipping by DPc 10, CV was without effect. ConclusionsCarvedilol, at a concentration that is sufficient to produce antioxidant effect, improves the intracellular Ca 2 +handling and contractile dysfunction by correcting defective interdomain interaction within the RyR in the failing heart...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the effect of dantrolene, a drug generally used to treat malignant hyperthermia, on the Ca 2 +release and cardiomyocyte function in failing hearts. BackgroundThe N-terminal (N: 1 – 600) and central (C: 2000 – 2500) domains of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) harbor many mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia in skeletal muscle RyR (RyR 1) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in cardiac RyR (RyR 2). There is strong evidence that interdomain interaction between these regions {{plays an important role}} in the mechanism of channel regulation. MethodsSarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and cardiomyocytes were isolated from the left ventricular muscles of dogs (normal or rapid ventricular pacing for 4 weeks), for Ca 2 +leak, transient, and spark assays. To assess the zipped or unzipped state of the interacting domains, the RyR was labeled fluorescently with <b>methylcoumarin</b> acetate in a site-directed manner. We used a quartz-crystal microbalance technique to identify the dantrolene binding site within the RyR 2. ResultsDantrolene specifically bound to domain 601 – 620 in RyR 2. In the sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from pacing-induced failing dog hearts, the defective interdomain interaction (domain unzipping) had already occurred, causing spontaneous Ca 2 +leak. Dantrolene suppressed both domain unzipping and the Ca 2 +leak, demonstrating identical drug concentration-dependence (IC 50 = 0. 3 μmol/l). In failing cardiomyocytes, both diastolic Ca 2 +sparks and delayed afterdepolarization were observed frequently, but 1 μmol/l dantrolene inhibited both events. ConclusionsDantrolene corrects defective interdomain interactions within RyR 2 in failing hearts, inhibits spontaneous Ca 2 +leak, and in turn improves cardiomyocyte function in failing hearts. Thus, dantrolene may have a potential to treat heart failure, specifically targeting the RyR 2...|$|E
40|$|The general {{potential}} of plant cystatins {{for the development}} of insect-resistant transgenic plants still remains to be established given the natural ability of several insects to compensate for the loss of active cysteine proteases following inhibitor ingestion. Here we assessed the {{potential of}} cystatins {{for the development of}} banana lines resistant to the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus, a major pest of banana and plantain in Africa. Protease inhibitory assays were first conducted with protein and <b>methylcoumarin</b> (MCA) peptide substrates to measure the inhibitory efficiency of different cystatins in vitro, followed by a diet bioassay with cystatin-infiltrated banana stem disks to monitor the impact of two plant cystatins, oryzacystatin I (OC-I, or OsCYS 1) and papaya cystatin (CpCYS 1), on the overall growth rate of young weevil larvae. As observed earlier for other Coleoptera, banana weevils produce a variety of proteases for dietary protein digestion, including in particular Z-Phe-Arg-MCA-hydrolyzing (cathepsin L-like) and Z-Arg-Arg- MCA-hydrolyzing (cathepsin B-like) proteases active in mildly acidic conditions. Both enzyme populations were sensitive to the diagnostic cysteine protease inhibitor E- 64 and to different plant cystatins including OsCYS 1. In line with these broad inhibitory effects of cystatins, OsCYS 1 and CpCYS 1 caused an important growth delay in young larvae developing for 10 days in cystatininfiltrated banana stem disks. These promising results, which illustrate the natural susceptibility of C. sordidus to plant cystatins, are discussed in the light of current genomic data on coleopteran cysteine cathepsins and recent hypotheses suggesting a key role for digestive cathepsin B-like enzymes as a determinant for resistance or susceptibility to plant cystatins in Coleoptera.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{phospholipids}} on the trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolysing {{activities of the}} so-called latent form of the rat liver multicatalytic proteinase was studied, assaying them with the following substrates: N-Cbz-ARR- 4 MNA (N-Cbz, N-benzyloxycarbonyl; 4 MNA, 4 -methoxy-beta-naphthylamide), N-Suc-LLVY-MCA (N-Suc, N-succinyl; MCA, <b>methylcoumarin)</b> and N-Cbz-LLE-beta-NA (beta-NA, beta-naphthylamide) respectively (amino acids are shown as their one-letter symbol). For the most part neither lysophospholipids nor phospholipids at 20 micrograms/ml {{have any effect on}} the activity of the enzyme (assayed at 50 microM peptide), except for phosphatidylserine, which activates 2 -fold the hydrolysis of N-Suc-LLVY-MCA, and phosphatidylinositol, which inhibits by 20 % the hydrolysis of N-Cbz-LLE-beta-NA. By contrast, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) is a strong activator of the hydrolysis of N-Suc-LLVY-MCA (60 -fold) and N-Cbz-LLE-beta-NA (30 -fold), with half-maximal activation at concentrations of 0. 15 micrograms/ml and 1. 5 micrograms/ml respectively. The activation of N-Suc-LLVY-MCA hydrolysis is due to an increase of the affinity of the enzyme for the peptide and to an increase in the Vmax. (30 -fold). The activation of N-Cbz-LLE-beta-NA hydrolysis is explained by suppressing the co-operativity for this substrate, producing hyperbolic kinetics with a Km of 60 microM and a 15 -fold increase in the Vmax. of the enzyme. This activation by cardiolipin was completely suppressed by micromolar concentrations of fluophenazine, a drug known to inhibit other phospholipid-regulated process. Cardiolipin activation and the known activation by SDS are additive, either at suboptimal or optimal concentrations of both activators. Cardiolipin also activates the in vitro degradation of some proteins from metabolically labelled total cellular extracts by the latent multicatalytic proteinase. These results clearly show that cardiolipin is a natural positive modulator of the peptidase and proteolytic activities of the multicatalytic proteinase, probably acting through a binding site different from that of SDS...|$|E
40|$|African trypanosomes contain {{cysteine}} proteases (trypanopains) {{the activity}} {{of which can be}} measured by in vitro digestion of fibrinogen, after electrophoresis in fibrinogen-containing SDS/polyacrylamide gels. When assessed by this procedure, trypanopain from Trypanosoma brucei (trypanopain-Tb) is estimated to have a molecular mass of 28 kDa. However, two additional bands of trypanopain activity (87 kDa and 105 kDa) are observed if serum is added to the trypanopain before electrophoresis. Formation of the 87 and 105 kDa bands is frequently accompanied by a reduction in the intensity of the 28 kDa activity which suggests that the extra bands are complexes of the 28 kDa trypanopain-Tb and a molecule from rat serum called rat trypanopain moledulator (rTM). The rTM-induced activation of cysteine proteases is not restricted to T. brucei as it is also observed with proteases from other protozoan parasites such as bloodstream forms of Trypanosoma congolense and the mammalian-infective in vitro-derived promastigote forms of Leishmania donovani and Leishmania major. The physical properties of rTM resemble those of the kininogen family of cysteine protease inhibitors. rTM is an acidic (pI 4. 7) heat-stable 68 kDa glycoprotein with 15 kDa protease-susceptible domains. This resemblance between rTM and kininogens was confirmed by the positive, albeit weak, immunoreactivity between anti-(human low-molecular-mass kininogen) antibody and rTM as well as anti-rTM antibody and human low-molecular-mass kininogen. Furthermore, commercial preparations of human-low-molecular-mass kininogen and chicken egg white cystatin mimicked rTM by forming extra bands of proteolytic activity in the presence of trypanopain-Tb. In some instances, low-molecular-mass kininogen was also observed to increase the rate of hydrolysis of 7 -(benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-arginyl-amido) - 4 - <b>methylcoumarin</b> by live T. brucei. Although this effect was rather erratic, in no instance was significant inhibition observed when this putative cysteine protease inhibitor was used under these conditions.

40|$|Warfarin {{is often}} used as a {{site-specific}} probe for examining the binding of drugs and other solutes to Sudlow site I of human serum albumin (HSA). However, warfarin has strong binding to HSA and the two chiral forms of warfarin have slightly different binding affinities for this protein. Warfarin also undergoes a slow change in structure when present in common buffers used for binding studies. This report examined the use of four related, achiral compounds (i. e., coumarin, 7 -hydroxycoumarin, 7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin, and 4 -hydroxycoumarin) as possible alternative probes for Sudlow site I in drug binding studies. High-performance affinity chromatography and immobilized HSA columns were used to compare and evaluate the binding properties of these probe candidates. Binding {{for each of the}} tested probe candidates to HSA was found to give a good fit to a two-site model. The first group of sites had moderate-to-high affinities for the probe candidates with association equilibrium constants that ranged from 6. 4 × 103 M− 1 (coumarin) to 5. 5 × 104 M− 1 (4 - hydroxycoumarin) at pH 7. 4 and 37 °C. The second group of weaker, and probably non-specific, binding regions, had association equilibrium constants that ranged from 3. 8 × 101 M− 1 (7 -hydroxy- 4 - <b>methylcoumarin)</b> to 7. 3 × 102 M− 1 (coumarin). Competition experiments based on zonal elution indicated that all of these probe candidates competed with warfarin at their high affinity regions. Warfarin also showed competition with coumarin, 7 -hydroxycoumarin and 7 -hydroxy- 4 - methycoumarin for their weak affinity sites but appeared to not bind and or compete for all of the weak sites of 4 -hydroxycoumarin. It was found from this group that 4 -hydroxycoumarin was the best alternative to warfarin for examining the interactions of drugs at Sudlow site I on HSA. These results also provided information on how the major structural components of warfarin contribute to the binding of this drug at Sudlow site I...|$|E
40|$|The {{purification}} and {{characterization of}} the buffalo liver microsomal transacetylase (TAase) catalyzing the transfer of acetyl groups from a model acetoxy drug: 7, 8 -diacetoxy- 4 -methylcoumarin (DAMC) to GST 3 - 3 has been described here. The enzyme was routinely assayed using DAMC and cytosolic GST as the substrates and was partially purified from microsomes of the buffalo liver. The enzyme {{was found to have}} approximate molecular of weight 65 kDa. The action of TAase and DAMC on liver cytosolic GST resulted in the formation of monoacetoxymonohydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin (MAMHC) and 7, 8 -dihydroxy- 4 - <b>methylcoumarin</b> (DHMC), although the former was the major metabolite. The buffalo liver microsomal TAase exhibited hyperbolic kinetics and yielded K m (1667 μM) and Vmax (192 units) when the concentration of DAMC was varied keeping the concentration of GST constant. After having characterized the nature of the substrates and a product of the TAase-catalyzed reaction, we set out to identify the acetylated protein which is another product of the reaction. GST 3 - 3 was used as a model protein substrate for the action of TAase using DAMC as the acetyl donor. The subunit of control and modified GST 3 - 3 were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel pieces and analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). The data search for calibrated and labeled mass peaks of peptides was performed on the Matrix Science Server using the search engine Mascot. The peptide maps so obtained covered 97 % of the GST 3 - 3 sequence. On comparison of MALDI peptide maps of modified and control GST, seven new peaks were recognized corresponding to the potentially acetylated peptides in peptide map. The mass value of each of them was 42 Da higher than the theoretical mass of a non-modified GST 3 - 3 tryptic peptide, strongly suggesting acetylation. By examining the fragmentation patterns and by comparing experimental and predicted values for MS/MS daughter ions, the identity of the seven acetylated GST tryptic peptides could be confirmed by the application of LC/MS/MS. In the modified GST, N-terminal proline and six lysines (Lys 51, Lys 82, Lys 123, Lsy 181, Lys 191 and Lys 210) were found to be acetylated. The structure of acetylated GST revealed that the lysines that underwent acetylation were peripheral in positions. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are a {{group of}} enzymes {{involved}} {{in the production of}} structurally diverse secondary metabolites, polyketides in plants. Compounds, such as chalcones, chromones, stilbenes and coumarins possess a variety of important biological roles for the plants, such as protection against oxidative stress, pests and diseases, herbivory and UV irradiation. From the human use perspective, polyketides or their derivatives serve as antifungal compounds, immunosuppressants, anticancer drugs, antibiotics and insecticides. Type III PKS are small (40 - 45 kDa) proteins functioning as homodimers. They catalyze the sequential decarboxylative condensation reaction between malonyl-CoA and a variety of CoA-linked starter molecules in a biosynthesis, which closely resembles fatty acid biosynthesis. Gerbera (Gerbera hybrida) expresses three genes encoding chalcone synthases (CHS), which are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants. In addition, it has three genes encoding 2 -pyrone synthases (G 2 PS 1 - 3), which differ from the CHSs with altered substrate specificity and the amount of decarboxylative malonyl-CoA condensation reactions. It was previously shown that G 2 PS 1 is a triketide synthase, responsible for the biosynthesis of 4 -hydroxy- 6 -methyl- 2 -pyrone (triacetolactone, TAL), a putative precursor for two antimicrobial compounds, gerberin and parasorboside in gerbera. In this study, the G 2 PS 2 and G 2 PS 3 were functionally characterized as pentaketide synthases and their role in the biosynthesis of another antimicrobial compound, 4 -hydroxy- 5 <b>methylcoumarin</b> (HMC) was demonstrated. Using protein modelling and mutagenesis studies, the structural differences in the active site cavity of gerbera 2 -pyrone synthases were demonstrated. The gerbera type III PKS family was extended by characterizing two additional 2 -pyrone synthases and determining their expression patterns. The newly discovered GASCL 1 and GASCL 2 are anther specific chalcone synthase like enzymes (ASCLs), which in many other plant species have been shown to take part to the biosynthesis of sporopollenin, the main component of a exine layer of the pollen grain.

Ensimmäinen julkaisuni koskee gerberan polyketidisyntaaseja, jotka ovat vastuussa antimikrobiaalisen yhdisteen biosynteesistä (4 -hydroksi- 5 -metyylikumariini). Toisessa julkaisussani määritin kaksi muuta gerberan tyypin III polyketidisyntaasia, jotka osallistuvat siitepölyhiukkasen soluseinän biosynteesiin. Kolmas artikkeli koskee glukosyylitransferaaseja, entsyymejä jotka liittävät sokerimolekyylejä kasvien sekundaarimetaboliitteihin...|$|E
