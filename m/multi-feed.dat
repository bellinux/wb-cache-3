40|$|Second {{generation}} bioethanol {{production is}} becoming established in production plants across the world. The process {{can also be}} viewed as a model biorefinery concept for biotechnological conversion of recalcitrant lignocellulosic raw materials to a range of chemicals and other products. We have developed a <b>Multi-Feed</b> SSCF process, which is a systematic, model-driven design of feeding schemes of solid substrate, active and robust cell factories that are adapted to the present substrate, and enzymes, to fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation of steam-pretreated lignocellulosic materials in standard stirred tank reactors. The concept has been applied not only to ethanol production with S. cerevisiae, but also to lactic acid production from wheat straw by a thermophilic, cellulolytic strain of Bacillus coagulans(MA- 13), isolated from bean processing waste. High Gravity operation, i. e. fermentation at high concentrations of water insoluble solids (WIS), pushes the process towards higher product concentrations and productivities, and improved energy and water economy.

40|$|Due to its low {{environmental}} impact and high maturity {{of the fuel}} ethanol market, lignocellulosic ethanol is a promising option for reducing the carbon footprint in the transport sector. The characteristics of lignocellulosic feedstocks, such as varied sugar composition, low sugar density, low solubility, recalcitrance to enzymatic degradation, and inhibitors formed during thermochemical pretreatment, have so far limited the production process, and costs for conversion of lignocellulosic materials to ethanol are still high. In this thesis, I describe {{the development of a}} bioconversion process that pushes the limits of simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) to achieve higher ethanol titre, yield and productivity on lignocellulosic feedstocks. I propose an integrated fed-batch strategy, <b>Multi-Feed</b> SSCF, including feeds of substrates, enzymes and adapted cells to tackle the technical challenges in operating a SSCF process at high substrate loadings. Using insights from experiments and a model-based feeding design, lignocellulose saccharification and fermentation at water insoluble solids (WIS) levels greater than 20 % (w/w) was achieved. The <b>multi-feed</b> SSCF concept and model-aided substrate feeding design allowed rapid, reproducible, and scalable bioconversion of lignocellulose, as proven on several lignocellulosic feedstocks in both laboratory and demonstration scales. Ethanol production above 50 g/L in SSCF processes was found to be severely inhibited by the combined effects of ethanol, lignocellulose-derived inhibitors, and higher than standard cultivation temperature (35 °C). Cell viability and fermentation improved significantly in a <b>multi-feed</b> SSCF process with a step change in temperature from 35 to 30 °C, compared to operation at 35 °C throughout. However, introducing the Erg 3 Tyr 185 point mutation which has been reported to render thermotolerance in yeast, did not offer any significant improvement. Cell concentrations were determined by counting in a hemocytometer and colony forming unit assay. Their accuracy and reproducibility in lignocellulosic media, were verified by Design-of-Experiment-based calibration. Applic-ability of real time qPCR and dielectric spectroscopy as potential cell quantification methods was also investigated. With <b>multi-feed</b> of solid substrates, enzyme preparations, and adapted cells, the SSCF process produced > 60 g/L ethanol within 120 h, equivalent to 70 % of the theoretical yield of the total sugar input, and 90 % of the consumed sugar.

40|$|Voltage sag {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious power {{problems}} that the industrial customers are facing nowadays. Voltage sag is a momentary reduction of rms voltage. These momentary reductions are, sometimes, sufficient to cause tripping of sensitive equipment of an industrial installation. One such tripping can cause production loss worth of several hundred thousands to few millions of rupees depending on the nature of the industry (e. g. Glass industry). Voltage sags can be remedied at 'system-level' as well as 'device-level'. The system level solutions are costly because controlling the voltage sag events of a power system involves large amount of money and effort. On the other-hand, every customer. fed by a power system is not affected by voltage sags. Only few customers have sensitive equipment such as process controllers- which need protection from sags. Therefore a device-level solution provided at the customers' doorstep is more attractive in economic terms. Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is one of such 'device-level' mitigating devices that could be used to protect a customer from voltage sags. The basic theory behind the DVR is the series voltage compensation. In case of a sag of the incoming supply voltage to a customer installation, the DVR injects the balance of voltage in series with the incoming voltage so that the load does not see any abnormal condition. Since a sag continues within a few fractions of a second, the DVR has to respond fast enough to compensate the sag. Therefore, the control method adopted in the DVR has a vital role in its satisfactory performance. In this research project, three different control options, namely open-loop control system, close-loop control system and <b>multi-feed</b> back control system were designed, analysed and digitally simulated. This thesis contains the details of those design, analysis and simulation. Out of the three control options, the <b>multi-feed</b> back controlled DVR has shown superior performance compared with the other two options and therefore, this option is recommended for practical use in protecting an important load. From the analysis and also the digital simulations, it has been proved that the <b>multi-feed</b> back controlled DVR is capable of protecting any load up to 5 MVA (power factor from 0. 6 to unity) against system voltage sags...|$|E

40|$|A {{wellbore}} pressure – temperature (p-T) {{model for}} geothermal wells with multiple feed zones is presented. The flow rate, temperature and pressure may {{vary depending on}} the feed zones. The fluid considered is water containing low amount of CO 2. Especially in Turkey, geothermal waters contain considerable amounts of CO 2 dissolved in water. The presence of CO 2 leads to two phase flow at higher pressure conditions than the vapor pressure of water. The wellbore model considers all these conditions. The model assumes that the flow is in steady state and Henry’s law is valid for CO 2 ’s partial pressure calculations. The main inputs of the model are reservoir properties and the depths of the feed points. The main outputs are pressure and temperature profiles. If measured profiles of temperature and pressure are available then the model can be used to estimate the mass fraction of CO 2. Dynamic temperature profiles measured at some wells in Afyon Omer-Gecek geothermal field in Turkey showed <b>multi-feed</b> wellbore behavior.

40|$|The Italian {{radio telescopes}} {{currently}} undergo a major upgrade period {{in response to}} the growing demand for deep radio observations, such as surveys on large sky areas or observations of vast samples of compact radio sources. The optimised employment of the Italian antennas, at first constructed mainly for VLBI activities and provided with a control system (FS – Field System) not tailored to single-dish observations, required important modifications in particular of the guiding software and data acquisition system. The production of a completely new control system called ESCS (Enhanced Single-dish Control System) for the Medicina dish started in 2007, in synergy with the software development for the forthcoming Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT). The aim is to produce a system optimised for single-dish observations in continuum, spectrometry and polarimetry. ESCS is also planned to be installed at the Noto site. A substantial part of this thesis work consisted in designing and developing subsystems within ESCS, in order to provide this software with tools to carry out large maps, spanning from the implementation of On-The-Fly fast scans (following both conventional and innovative observing strategies) to the production of single-dish standard output files and the realisation of tools for the quick-look of the acquired data. The test period coincided with the commissioning phase for two devices temporarily installed – while waiting for the SRT to be completed – on the Medicina antenna: a 18 - 26 GHz 7 -feed receiver and the 14 -channel analogue backend developed for its use. It is worth stressing that it is the only K-band <b>multi-feed</b> receiver at present available worldwide. The commissioning of the overall hardware/software system constituted a considerable section of the thesis work. Tests were led in order to verify the system stability and its capabilities, down to sensitivity levels which had never been reached in Medicina using the previous observing techniques and hardware devices. The aim was also to assess the scientific potential of the <b>multi-feed</b> receiver for the production of wide maps, exploiting its temporary availability on a mid-sized antenna. Dishes like the 32 -m antennas at Medicina and Noto, in fact, offer the best conditions for large-area surveys, especially at high frequencies, as they provide a suited compromise between sufficiently large beam sizes to cover quickly large areas of the sky (typical of small-sized telescopes) and sensitivity (typical of large-sized telescopes). The KNoWS (K-band Northern Wide Survey) project is aimed at the realisation of a full-northern-sky survey at 21 GHz; its pilot observations, performed using the new ESCS tools and a peculiar observing strategy, constituted an ideal test-bed for ESCS itself and for the multi-feed/backend system. The KNoWS group, which I am part of, supported the commissioning activities also providing map-making and source-extraction tools, in order to complete the necessary data reduction pipeline and assess the general system scientific capabilities. The K-band observations, which were carried out in several sessions along the December 2008 -March 2010 period, were accompanied by the realisation of a 5 GHz test survey during the summertime, which is not suitable for high-frequency observations. This activity was conceived in order to check the new analogue backend separately from the <b>multi-feed</b> receiver, and to simultaneously produce original scientific data (the 6 -cm Medicina Survey, 6 MS, a polar cap survey to complete PMN-GB 6 and provide an all-sky coverage at 5 GHz). ...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} address these limitations, a {{hydraulically}} informed graph theoretic measure of pipe criticality is proposed in this paper, called Water Flow Edge Betweenness Centrality (WFEBC). WFEBC is derived from random walk betweenness centrality for the resilience analysis of complex WDNs and the estimation of energy losses. WFEBC is applied to two case study networks. The proposed analytical framework includes a network skeletonisation step, {{in the form of}} a forest-core decomposition of a network, in order to facilitate the application of the proposed resilience estimation to large scale operational networks. The surrogate measure is benchmarked against a traditional hydraulic analysis. The results show that WFEBC provides unique insights into the criticality of individual links and identifies low resilience sectors of a system for further hydraulic analysis. It is applied to compare the resilience of a sectorised operational network (single-feed DMAs) to the resilience of the same network following the implementation of a dynamically adaptive topology (<b>multi-feed</b> DMAs). Finally, a summary of the results is presented together with suggestions about the applicability and improvements of the proposed method.|$|E
