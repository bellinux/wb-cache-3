In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Q, he said that using mushrooms [...] "really forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at myself" [...] but added {{that he had never}} abused drugs. [...] On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, he stated that he stopped using prescription drugs after his first experience with prescription drug Ambien, which left him unconscious for an hour.|$|E

The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at you and {{you to look at}} me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E

"I {{had just}} said to Dick McMullen, 'Be sure not to fire until they reach that mullein stalk,' when a commotion {{in the rear of}} our line caused <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> behind us, and to my dismay, my eyes rested upon the largest line of cavalry I had ever seen. There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance. Major [...] Boyd, commanding our regiment, quickly said: 'We are prisoners,' {{and that was the end}} of the Nineteenth Virginia Infantry as a body of armed soldiers." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1865, Menelik married Woizero Befana Wolde Michael, whom he {{divorced}} in 1882; the marriage produced no children. Her brother was Dejazmatch Tewende Belay Wolde Michael. Woizero Bafena was implicated in {{a plot to}} overthrow Menelik when he was King of Shewa. She was widely suspected of being secretly in touch with Emperor Yohannes IV in her ambition to replace her husband on the Shewan throne {{with one of her}} sons from a previous marriage. With the failure of her plot, Woizero Befana was separated from Menelik, but Menelik apparently was still deeply attached to her. An attempt at reconciliation failed, but when his relatives and courtiers suggested new young wives to the King, he would sadly say [...] "You ask <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at these women with the same eyes that once gazed upon Befana?", paying tribute both to his ex-wife's great beauty and his own continuing attachment to her.|$|E

He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You seem to be very interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and he told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kamo later {{discussed}} his experiences at feigning insanity {{for over three}} years: [...] "What can I tell you? [...] They threw me about, hit me over the legs and the like. [...] One of the men forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into the mirror. [...] There I saw − not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. [...] I thought to myself, 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But {{they do not know}} the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine. [...] In Tiflis, they didn't torture me. [...] Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{members of}} the Rocko's Modern Life staff created other {{successful}} ventures. Stephen Hillenburg pitched SpongeBob SquarePants to Nickelodeon in 1997. Murray said of the pitch, [...] "If it goes well, it'll be a blessing to us all." [...] The network bought the show, which premiered in 1999, {{and it became a}} popular, critical and financial success, and one of the biggest shows on Nick. Hillenburg stated that he [...] "learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV" [...] from his time on Rocko's Modern Life. Two writers for the series, Dan Povenmire and Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, went on to create Phineas and Ferb for the Disney Channel; the show became a ratings success and received numerous award nominations. When Murray returned with a new animated series, Camp Lazlo, in 2005, much of the former staff of Rocko's Modern Life joined him. Murray stated that [...] "We always kept in touch and they told <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> them up if I ever did another project", adding that the crew already knew his sensibilities and an extra decade worth of experience. Carlos Alazraqui, who played Rocko, also ended up playing the main character of Lazlo. Derek Drymon and Nick Jennings, both part of the staff, went on to be responsible for the tone and visual looks of a lot of very successful animated series that came later.|$|E

2500|$|Language is {{of primary}} {{importance}} in the play insofar as Valentine and Proteus speak in blank verse, but Launce and Speed speak (for the most part) in prose. More specifically, the actual content {{of many of the}} speeches serve to illustrate the pompousness of Valentine and Proteus' exalted outlook, and the more realistic and practical outlook of the servants. This is most apparent in Act 3, Scene 1. Valentine has just given a lengthy speech lamenting his banishment and musing on how he cannot possibly survive without Silvia; [...] "Except I be by Silvia in the night/There is no music in the nightingale./Unless I look on Silvia in the day/There is no day for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> upon" [...] (ll.178–181). However, when Launce enters only a few lines later, he announces that he too is in love, and proceeds to outline, along with Speed, all of his betrothed's positives ("She brews good ale"; [...] "She can knit"; [...] "She can wash and scour"), and negatives ("She hath a sweet mouth"; [...] "She doth talk in her sleep"; [...] "She is slow in words"). After weighing his options, Launce decides that the woman's most important quality is that [...] "she hath more hair than wit, and more faults than hairs, and more wealth than faults" [...] (ll.343–344). He announces that her wealth [...] "makes the faults gracious" [...] (l.356), and chooses for that reason to wed her. This purely materialistic reasoning, as revealed in the form of language, is {{in stark contrast to the}} more spiritual and idealised love espoused by Valentine earlier in the scene.|$|E
