The researcher created three formulae to do subtraction of <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers.</b> This study is a priori study to determine the effectiveness of using the three formulae which is called the “Formula Method” in doing subtraction of <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers.</b> The study involved five Year 5 Malaysian Primary school pupils in an urban primary school who were selected from 20 students who sat for a test on subtraction of <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers.</b> The participants for the study were pupils who demonstrated difficulties doing subtraction of <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>numbers</b> or {{fraction}} {{in general}} {{have been a}} problem for students. Students have difficulty not only understanding the concept of the numbers since its differences to natural number, but also they also have a difficulty in understanding the operation of it because students see the operation as the algorithm. That is why it is not surprising when they have more difficulty in learning <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers</b> operation such as addition. This research will address students’ problem in learning addition <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers</b> and fractions. Furthermore, the purpose of his research is to develop a theory and materials related to helping students to understand the notion of <b>mixed</b> <b>numbers</b> and their addition. In order to develop the theory, this research will use design research as the method. The data in this research is collected by generating the video recording of the classroom’s event, student’s written work, students’ result from pretest and posttest, the result of interview, and also the fields’ note from the observation. This data gathered throughout the teaching experiment in a group of four of fourth grade students in SD Pusri, Palembang.

2500|$|A decimal {{fraction}} is a fraction whose denominator is not given explicitly, but {{is understood to}} be an integer power of ten. Decimal fractions are commonly expressed using decimal notation in which the implied denominator {{is determined by the}} number of digits to the right of a decimal separator, the appearance of which (e.g., a period, a raised period (•), a comma) depends on the locale (for examples, see decimal separator). Thus for 0.75 the numerator is 75 and the implied denominator is 10 to the second power, viz. 100, because there are two digits {{to the right of the}} decimal separator. In decimal numbers greater than 1 (such as 3.75), the fractional part of the number is expressed by the digits to the right of the decimal (with a value of 0.75 in this case). 3.75 can be written either as an improper fraction, 375/100, or as a <b>mixed</b> <b>number,</b> [...]|$|E
