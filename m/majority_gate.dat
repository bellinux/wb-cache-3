We observe that a simple combination of their result with the H*astad switching lemma yields the following seemingly much stronger result: The same function f cannot be computed by polynomial size circuits consisting of two layers of <b>MAJORITY</b> <b>gates</b> at the top and an arbitrary AC 0 circuit feeding the <b>MAJORITY</b> <b>gates.</b> 1 Introduction During the 1980 's and 1990 's significant progress was made understanding thepower of bounded depth computation, i. e. computation performed by unbounded fan-in circuits of constant depth and polynomial size containing layers of gates ofvarious kinds.

40|$|Abstract—The {{importance}} of the reliability of majority-based structures stems from their use in both conventional fault-tolerant architectures and emerging nanoelectronic systems. In this paper, analytical models are developed {{in order to gain}} a better under-standing of the reliability of majority logic in these contexts. A minimally biased input scenario for N-input <b>majority</b> <b>gates</b> (N odd) occurs when only a minimal majority of the inputs are in con-sensus. In a tree of gates with these inputs, this paper determines 1) that any nonzero error rate of the <b>majority</b> <b>gates</b> and/or of its initial inputs will result in an unreliable output and 2) that the use of <b>majority</b> <b>gates</b> with a larger number of inputs leads to a less reliable structure. These results are extended to N-input minority gates for odd N. Although these findings are based on tree struc-tures, their implications to circuit design are explored by investi-gating several fault-tolerant and nanoelectronic architectures. The simulation results show that the increased probability of error in nanoscale devices may impose serious constraints on the reliability of emerging nanoelectronic circuits, as well as their fault-tolerant counterparts. The worst case reliability must be accounted for in a fault-tolerant design to ensure reliable operation.

5000|$|In {{his report}} [...] Muller {{proposed}} to realize C-element as a <b>majority</b> <b>gate</b> with feedback. However, to avoid hazards linked with skews of internal delays, the <b>majority</b> <b>gate</b> must have as {{small number of}} transistors as possible [...] Generally, C-elements with different timing assumptions [...] can be built on AND-OR-Invert (AOI) [...] or its dual, OR-AND-Invert (OAI) gate [...] and inverter. Yet another option patented by Varshavsky et al. is to shunt the input signals {{when they are not}} equal each other. Being very simple, these realizations dissipate more power due to the short-circuits. Note that connecting an additional <b>majority</b> <b>gate</b> to the inverted output of C-element, we obtain inclusive OR (EDLINCOR) function: [...] Note also that some simple asynchronous circuits like pulse distributors [...] can be built solely on majority gates.Semistatic C-element stores its previous state using two cross-coupled inverters, similar to an SRAM cell. One of the inverters is weaker {{than the rest of the}} circuit, so it can be overpowered by the pull-up and pull-down networks. If both inputs are 0, then the pull-up network changes the latch's state, and the C-element outputs a 0. If both inputs are 1, then the pull-down network changes the latch's state, making the C-element output a 1. Otherwise, the input of the latch is not connected to either [...] or ground, and so the weak inverter dominates and the latch outputs its previous state. There are also versions of semistatic C-element built on devices with negative differential resistance (NDR). It should be noted however, that NDR is usually defined for small signal. So, it is difficult to expect that such a C-element will operate in full range of voltages or currents.|$|E
