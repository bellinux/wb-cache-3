5|$|Cribb et al. (2014) {{suggest that}} Bontius' account {{referred}} not to apes (which were not known from Java) {{but rather to}} humans suffering some serious medical condition (most likely endemic cretinism) and that {{his use of the}} word was <b>misunderstood</b> by Nicolaes Tulp, who was the first to use the term in a publication.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his career, Racz {{has also}} {{conducted}} research and co-authored articles with other experts in pain management to improve {{diagnosis and treatment}} of complex regional pain syndromes (CRPS), a long-term disorder of the nervous system which is a challenging pain problem that is often <b>misunderstood</b> and misdiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|Both of Jackson's {{parents have}} denied the longstanding abuse {{allegations}} and Katherine acknowledges {{that although the}} whippings are viewed as child abuse by current generations, such disciplinary methods were normal back then.

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{quantity}} and excellent {{quality of the}} fossil material, Plateosaurus {{was for a long}} time one of the most <b>misunderstood</b> dinosaurs. Some researchers proposed theories that were later shown to conflict with geological and palaeontological evidence, but have become the paradigm of public opinion. Since 1980 the taxonomy (relationships), taphonomy (how the animals became embedded and fossilized), biomechanics (how their skeletons worked), and palaeobiology (life circumstances) of Plateosaurus have been re-studied in detail, altering the interpretation of the animal's biology, posture and behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Pig (debut: December 30, 2001) is the {{character}} that receives the most abuse from Rat (though ironically, he is Rat's only friend). He is kind by nature, but extremely stupid. Pig's jokes generally involve his stupidity; Pastis once stated that Pig {{is easy to}} write for because he <b>misunderstands</b> everything said to him, and, once it is explained, he <b>misunderstands</b> the explanation. Pig has a habit of talking to inanimate objects such as food, stop lights, or bait. Pig's moody on-and-off girlfriend, Pigita, often <b>misunderstands</b> his ignorant statements and will often become violent toward him.|$|R
5|$|In {{the book}} Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina, biographer Robert D. Crassweller {{claims that the}} English-speaking nations of North America and Europe largely <b>misunderstood</b> Argentina's {{response}} {{to the death of}} Perón as well as the ornate funeral she was granted. Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Peróns and Argentina, saying that the Peróns were of the Hispanic tradition and that their opposition was largely of British ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Love Among the Walnuts: or How I Saved My Family from Being Poisoned is a farcical, satirical {{young adult}} novel with fairy tale {{elements}} written by Jean Ferris. The story revolves around a young man, Sandy, whose family is poisoned by his scheming uncles {{in a bid}} to gain the family fortune. He moves them to Walnut Manor, a neighboring convalescent home, where, {{with the help of the}} nurse Sunnie, he tries to save his family and benefit the manor's <b>misunderstood</b> residents.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eleven}} poems the Gosen Wakashū {{attributed}} to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira {{and one by}} Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The Shin Kokinshū and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, {{but many of these}} were likely <b>misunderstood</b> to have been written by him because of their appearance in The Tales of Ise. Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.|$|E

This means that the police detainee/suspect/witness does not misunderstand the questions asked or that he/she is not <b>misunderstood</b> by the Investigation Officer, ensuring that statements recorded are reliable.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who <b>misunderstood</b> the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring nighttime retreat has been seen by some historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|A {{supportive}} {{environment and}} family generally gives those with Tourette's {{the skills to}} manage the disorder. People with Tourette's may learn to camouflage socially inappropriate tics or to channel the energy of their tics into a functional endeavor. Accomplished musicians, athletes, public speakers, and professionals {{from all walks of}} life are found among people with Tourette's. Outcomes in adulthood are associated more with the perceived significance of having severe tics as a child than with the actual severity of the tics. A person who was <b>misunderstood,</b> punished, or teased at home or at school will fare worse than children who enjoyed an understanding and supportive environment.|$|E

5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines. Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often <b>misunderstood</b> and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or <b>misunderstood</b> data.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had <b>misunderstood</b> both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|Discovering {{that many}} of his satraps and {{military}} governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa. As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops <b>misunderstood</b> his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} his {{approach}} to the work illustrated a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but his approach was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat <b>misunderstood</b> the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E
