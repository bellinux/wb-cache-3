40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Jan. 21, 2014 - Jan. 1, 2016 In advanced integrated circuit (IC) processes, the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> inserted to meet foundry imposed density requirements degrades the performance of interconnects and passive components which ultimately affects the overall circuit performance. Accounting for this degradation through electromagnetic and equivalent circuit modeling is becoming a critical aspect of IC design. However, electromagnetic simulation of interconnects and passive components including <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> quickly becomes prohibitive due to the large problem complexity while the modeling methods in the literature are limited in accuracy and ignore important effects. This thesis investigates fast and scalable modeling methods for interconnects and spiral inductors {{in the presence of}} <b>metal</b> <b>fill.</b> We demonstrate a novel three dimensional problem reduction approach to model the parasitic capacitance due to <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> in multiconductor interconnects. Further, we demonstrate a unique technique for modeling <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> in spiral inductors. We present a systematic on-wafer measurement characterization approach for model verification. Ultimately, the research presented in this thesis will enable efficient metal-fill-aware design of integrated circuits through fast and accurate models for interconnects and passive components in the presence of <b>metal</b> <b>fill...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the process}} of {{integrated}} circuit design and manufacturing, dummy <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> can improve the planarity of layout after Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP). However, it will also cause lithography distortion and Critical Area (CA) variation. This paper compares and analyzes the influences of lithography distortion due to <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> on CA {{from the perspectives of}} different defect particles based on 45 nm technology node. The results indicate that dummy <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> can increase open CA after lithography and the defect particle with the diameter of 0. 066 um leads to the largest increment percentage of open CA, which will take up almost 10 %.

40|$|Thickness range, i. e. the {{difference}} between the highest point and the lowest point of the chip surface, is a key indicator of chip yield. This paper presents a novel <b>metal</b> <b>filling</b> algorithm that seeks to minimize the thickness range of the chip surface during the copper damascene process. The proposed solution considers the physical mechanisms in the damascene process, namely ECP (which is the process used to deposit Cu in the trenches) and CMP (which is the process used to polish Cu after ECP), that affect thickness range. Key predictors for the final thickness range, which is the thickness range after ECP & CMP, that can be computed efficiently are identified and used to drive the <b>metal</b> <b>filling</b> process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first <b>metal</b> <b>filling</b> algorithm that uses an ECP model among other things to guide <b>metal</b> <b>filling.</b> Experimental results are very promising and indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the thickness range after <b>metal</b> <b>filling.</b> This is in sharp contrast with the density-driven approaches which often increase the thickness range after <b>metal</b> <b>filling,</b> thereby potentially adversely impacting yield. In addition, the proposed method inserts significantly smaller amount of fill when compared to the densitydriven approaches. This is desirable as it limits the impact of <b>metal</b> <b>filling</b> on timing. ...|$|E

40|$|This project takes a {{fresh look}} at the ''white side'' of the lost foam casting process. We have {{developed}} the gel front hypothesis for foam pyrolysis behavior and the magnetic metal pump method for controlling lost foam casting <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event. The subject of this report is work done in the improvement of the Lost Foam Casting Process. The original objective of this project was to improve the control of <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> by understanding the influence of foam pattern and coating properties on the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event. Relevant pattern properties could then be controlled, providing control of the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event. One of the original premises of this project was that the process of <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> was relatively well understood. Considerable previous work had been done to develop fluid mechanical and heat transfer models of the process. If we could just incorporate measured pattern properties into these models we would be able predict accurately the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event. As we began to study the pyrolysis behavior of EPS during the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event, we discovered that the chemical nature of this event had been completely overlooked in previous research. Styrene is the most prevalent breakdown product of EPS pyrolysis and it is a solvent for polystyrene. Much of the styrene generated by foam pyrolysis diffuses into intact foam, producing a molten gel of mechanically entangled polystyrene molecules. Much of the work of our project has centered on validation of this concept and producing a qualitative model of the behavior of EPS foam undergoing pyrolysis in a confined environment. A conclusion of this report is that styrene dissolution in EPS is a key phenomenon in the pyrolysis process and deserves considerable further study. While it is possible to continue to model the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event parametrically using empirical data, we recommend that work be undertaken by qualified researchers to directly characterize and quantify this phenomenon for the benefit of modelers, researchers, and workers in the field. Another original premise of this project was that foam pattern and coating properties could be used to efficiently control <b>metal</b> <b>fill.</b> After studying the structure of EPS foam in detail for the period of this contract, we {{have come to the conclusion}} that EPS foam has an inherent variability at a scale that influences <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> behavior. This does not allow for the detailed fine control of the process that we originally envisioned. We therefore have sought other methods for the control of the <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> event. Of those, we now believe that the magnetic metal pump shows the most promise. We have conducted two casting trials using this method and preliminary results are very encouraging. A conclusion of our report is that, while every effort should continue to be made to produce uniform foam and coatings, the use of the magnetic metal pump should be encouraged and closed loop control mechanisms should be developed for this pouring method...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Variability in circuit {{performance}} due {{to process}} defects {{is a major}} concern in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. Advanced IC manufacturing processes employ Chemical-Mechanical Polishing (CMP) for planarization of oxide and metal layers. CMP defects result in variations in the oxide and metal topographical profile. To reduce these topographical variations, electrically non-functional (dummy) metal features are added in low metal density regions. These <b>metal</b> <b>fills</b> degrade the performance of on-chip interconnects and components, and the overall circuit due to the additional electrical parasitics. Therefore, it is important to characterize the parasitic effects of <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> on critical structures such as interconnects and spiral inductors. This thesis presents a study of the impact of <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> placement, size, and shape on the electrical performance of representative on-chip transmission line structures and spiral inductors. We separate the electric and magnetic effects of different <b>metal</b> <b>fill</b> designs by studying their impact on parasitic capacitance and eddy-current loss. The study is done through simulation using a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator and measurement of a test chip fabricated in a 180 nm BiCMOS process, and is supported through theoretical considerations.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 With {{increasing}} transistor operating frequencies, interconnects {{and passive}} devices are becoming performance limiters in integrated circuit (IC) designs. To combat this, the interconnect layers above the active silicon are trending toward low-κ dielectrics and Cu metallization.

Unfortunately, the mechanical trade-offs of CMP require metal pattern density uniformity and additional dummy <b>metal</b> shapes <b>fill</b> in regions of low density.

40|$|Random {{impedance}} {{networks are}} widely used as a model to describe plasmon resonances in disordered metal-dielectric nanocomposites. In order to study thin films, two-dimensional networks are often used {{despite the fact that}} such networks correspond to a two-dimensional electrodynamics (J. P. Clerc et al, J. Phys. A 29, 4781 (1996)). In the present work, we propose a new model of two-dimensional systems with three-dimensional Coulomb interaction and show that this model is equivalent to a planar network with long-range capacitive connections between sites. In a case of a metal film, we get a known dispersion ω∝√(k) of plane-wave two-dimensional plasmons. In the framework of the proposed model, we study the evolution of resonances with decreasing of <b>metal</b> <b>filling</b> factor.

This study was performed {{for a set}} of films differing in both metallic nanowire dimensions, as well as metal content.

Specifically, this photothermal technique is particularly useful to investigate a film that may exhibit relevant scattering phenomena, as for metallic nanowire films.
