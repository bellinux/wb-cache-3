Number born alive (NBA) and litters per sow per year (LSY) records were obtained from a large swine breeding company which maintains a database consisting of nucleus, multiplier, commercial, and rotational cross herds. The dataset included 187, 674 litters from 46, 749 Landrace (LR); 117, 782 litters from 31, 665 Large White (LW); and 295, 163 litters from 76, 925 LR ÃÂ LW (F 1) females, respectively. Variance components for each breed were calculated in REMLF 90 using bivariate models with one purebred trait and the respective F 1 trait.

40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is a mucohaemorrhagic colitis of grower/finisher pigs classically {{resulting from}} infection by the anaerobic intestinal spirochaete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. This study aimed {{to determine whether}} B. hyodysenteriae isolates from pigs in three healthy German multiplier herds supplying gilts to other farms differed from isolates from nine German production herds with SD. Isolates were subjected to whole genomic sequencing, and in silico multilocus sequence typing showed that those from the three multiplier herds were of previously undescribed sequence types (ST 132, ST 133 and ST 134), with all isolates from the same herd having the same ST. All isolates were examined {{for the presence of}} 332 genes encoding predicted virulence or virulence lifestyle associated factors, and these were well conserved. Isolates from one <b>multiplier</b> <b>herd</b> were atypical in being weakly haemolytic: they had 10 amino acid substitutions in the haemolysin III protein and five in the haemolysin activation protein compared to reference strain WA 1, and had a disruption in the promoter site of the hlyA gene. These changes likely contribute to the weakly haemolytic phenotype and putative lack of virulence. These same isolates also had nine base pair insertions in the iron metabolism genes bitB and bitC and lacked five of six plasmid genes that previously have been associated with colonisation. Other overall differences between isolates from the different herds were in genes from three of five outer membrane proteins, which were not found in all the isolates, and in members of a block of six plasmid genes. Isolates from three herds with SD had all six plasmid genes, while isolates lacking some of these genes were found in the three healthy herds-but also in isolates from six herds with SD. Other differences in genes of unknown function or in gene expression may contribute to variation in virulence; alternatively, superior husbandry and better general health may have made pigs in the two multiplier herds colonised by "typical" strongly haemolytic isolates less susceptible to disease expression...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundOur recent {{research}} showed that antibody response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), measured as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio, is highly heritable {{and has a}} high genetic correlation with reproductive performance during a PRRS outbreak. Two major quantitative trait loci (QTL) on Sus scrofa chromosome 7 (SSC 7; QTLMHC and QTL 130) accounted for ~ 40  % of the genetic variance for S/P. Objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate genetic parameters for PRRS S/P in gilts during acclimation, identify regions associated with S/P, and evaluate the accuracy of genomic prediction of S/P across populations with different prevalences of PRRS and using different single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sets. MethodsPhenotypes and high-density SNP genotypes of female pigs from two datasets were used. The outbreak dataset included 607 animals from one <b>multiplier</b> <b>herd,</b> whereas the gilt acclimation (GA) dataset included data on 2364 replacement gilts from seven breeding companies placed on health-challenged farms. Genomic prediction was evaluated using GA for training and validation, and using GA for training and outbreak for validation. Predictions were based on SNPs across the genome (SNPAll), SNPs in one (SNPMHC and SNP 130) or both (SNPSSC 7) QTL, or SNPs outside the QTL (SNPRest). ResultsHeritability of S/P in the GA dataset increased with the proportion of PRRS-positive animals in the herd (from 0. 28 to 0. 47). Genomic prediction accuracies ranged from low to moderate. Average accuracies were highest when using only the 269 SNPs in both QTL regions (SNPSSC 7, with accuracies of 0. 39 and 0. 31 for outbreak and GA validation datasets, respectively. Average accuracies for SNPALL, SNPMHC, SNP 130, and SNPRest were, respectively, 0. 26, 0. 39, 0. 21, and 0. 05 for the outbreak, and 0. 28, 0. 25, 0. 22, and 0. 12, for the GA validation datasets. ConclusionsModerate genomic prediction accuracies can be obtained for PRRS antibody response using SNPs located within two major QTL on SSC 7, {{while the rest of the}} genome showed limited predictive ability. Results were obtained using data from multiple genetic sources and farms, which further strengthens these findings. Further research is needed to validate the use of S/P ratio as an indicator trait for reproductive performance during PRRS outbreaks...|$|E

We analysed the Danish pig movement network using static and temporal network analysis tools to provide deeper insight in the connection between holdings dealing with pigs, such as breeding and <b>multiplier</b> <b>herds,</b> production herds, slaughterhouses or traders. Pig movements, which occurred between 1 st January 2006 and 31 st December 2015 in Denmark, were summarized to investigate temporal trends such as the number of active holdings, the number of registered movements and the number of pigs moved. To identify holdings and holding types with potentially higher risk for introduction or spread of diseases via pig movements, we determined loyalty patterns, annual network components and contact chains for the 24 registered holding types. The total number of active holdings as well as the number of pig movements decreased during the study period while the holding sizes increased. Around 60 - 90 % of connections between two pig holdings were present in two consecutive years and around one third of the connections persisted within the considered time period. Weaner herds showed the highest level of in-loyalty, whereas we observed an intermediate level of in-loyalty for all breeding sites and for production herds. Boar stations, production herds and trade herds showed a high level of out-loyalty. Production herds constituted the highest proportion of holdings in the largest strongly connected component.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{epidemiological research}} {{carried out to}} improve the control of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) epidemics. First, control measures and strategies are investigated in order to enable quick and adequate action upon CSFV detection. CSFV transmission experiments are described, {{as well as a}} mathematical model of CSFV transmission between herds, both used to assess the effectiveness of the E 2 subunit marker vaccines with respect to CSFV transmission. Quantification of the effectiveness was done with the basic reproduction ratio Ri (Rh), defined as the number of animals (herds) that is infected by one typical infectious animal (herd) in a completely susceptible population. The transmission experiments pointed out that Ri decreases to below the threshold value 1 as of three weeks after vaccination until at least six months after vaccination. Already one week after vaccination of a pig herd, virus entry will lead to only minor outbreaks. It appeared that the presence of maternal antibodies at the time of vaccination may reduce the antibody levels at later age, but these lower levels still keep Ri below 1. Because vertical transmission is not completely blocked by the vaccine, persistently infected piglets might be born on vaccinated herds. These herds cannot be clinically detected and might thus be a risk for further virus spread. Detection will be possible if some animals, e. g. the breeding sows, on those herds remain unvaccinated. Whether that would lead to an effective control strategy was tested in a mathematical model of CSFV transmission. The model was based on the Dutch CSFV epidemic of 1997 / 1998, with a moderately virulent virus strain in a pig dense area with relatively many <b>multiplier</b> <b>herds.</b> The model results point out that an effective control strategy (Rh < 1) requires a complete prohibition of transport of unvaccinated animals.

The objectives of this study were to estimate variances of additive, dominance and imprinting genetic effects and to evaluate predictions of genetic merit based on genomic data for average daily gain (DG) and backfat thickness (BF) in Danish Duroc pigs. MethodsCorrected phenotypes of 8113 genotyped pigs from breeding and <b>multiplier</b> <b>herds</b> were used. Four Bayesian mixture models that differed in the type of genetic effects included: (A) additive genetic effects, (AD) additive and dominance genetic effects, (AI) additive and imprinting genetic effects, and (ADI) additive, dominance and imprinting genetic effects were compared using Bayes factors. The ability of the models to predict genetic merit was compared with regard to prediction reliability and bias. ResultsBased on model ADI, narrow-sense heritabilities of 0. 18 and 0. 31 were estimated for DG and BF, respectively. Dominance and imprinting genetic effects accounted for 4. 0  to  4. 6 and 1. 3  to  1. 4  % of phenotypic variance, respectively, which were statistically significant. Across the four models, reliabilities of the predicted total genetic values (GTV, sum of all genetic effects) ranged from 16. 1 (AI) to 18. 4  % (AD) for DG and from 30. 1 (AI) to 31. 4  % (ADI) for BF. The least biased predictions of GTV were obtained with model AD, with regression coefficients of corrected phenotypes on GTV equal to 0. 824 (DG) and 0. 738 (BF). Reliabilities of genomic estimated breeding values (GBV, additive genetic effects) did not differ significantly among models for DG (between 16. 5 and 16. 7  %); however, for BF, model AD provided a significantly higher reliability (31. 3  %) than model A (30. 7  %). The least biased predictions of GBV were obtained with model AD with regression coefficients of 0. 872 for DG and 0. 764 for BF.

40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is a mucohemorrhagic colitis, classically seen in grower/finisher {{pigs and}} caused by infection with the anaerobic intestinal spirochete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. More recently, however, the newly described species Brachyspira hampsonii and Brachyspira suanatina {{have been identified}} as causing SD in North America and/or Europe. Furthermore, there have been occasions where strains of B. hyodysenteriae have been recovered from healthy pigs, including in <b>multiplier</b> <b>herds</b> with high health status. This study investigated whether cases of SD in Australia may be caused by the newly described species; how isolates of B. hyodysenteriae recovered from healthy herds compared to isolates from herds with disease; and how contemporary isolates compare to those recovered in previous decades, including in their plasmid gene content and antimicrobial resistance profiles. In total 1103 fecal and colon samples from pigs in 97 Australian herds were collected and tested. Of the agents of SD only B. hyodysenteriae was found, being present in 34 (35. 1 %) of the herds, including in 14 of 24 (58 %) herds that had been considered to be free of SD. Multilocus sequence typing applied to 96 isolates from 30 herds and to 53 Australian isolates dating from the 1980 s through the early 2000 s showed that they were diverse, distinct from those reported in other countries, and that the 2014 / 16 isolates generally were different from those from earlier decades. These findings provided evidence for ongoing evolution of B. hyodysenteriae strains in Australia. In seven of the 20 herds where multiple isolates were available, two to four different sequence types (STs) were identified. Isolates with the same STs also were found in some herds with epidemiological links. Analysis of a block of six plasmid virulence-associated genes showed a lack of consistency between their presence or absence and their origin from herds currently with or without disease; however, significantly fewer isolates from the 2000 s and from 2014 / 16 had this block of genes compared to isolates from the 1980 s and 1990 s. It is speculated that loss of these genes may have been responsible for the occurrence of milder disease occurring in recent years. In addition, fewer isolates from 2014 / 16 were susceptible to the antimicrobials lincomycin, {{and to a lesser extent}} tiamulin, than those from earlier Australian studies. Four distinct multi-drug resistant strains were identified in five herds, posing a threat to disease control...|$|R
40|$|The {{problems}} addressed are: (1) {{comparison of}} prevalences of Salmonella spp. in different herd {{types in the}} Danish pig population after implementation of the Danish Salmonella Control Program (DSCP), and (2) to make {{a reference to a}} study from 1993 / 1994 (pre-implementation) with a discussion of possible biases when diagnostic methods differ slightly. The objectives were to present the prevalences of Salmonella spp., Salmonella Typhimurium, and multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 in Danish pig herds in 1998. Further, to discuss how herd prevalences may be compared to a previous study. A bacteriological study in 1998 comprised: (a) a random sample of slaughter pig producing herds (N= 1962); (b) a random sample of farrow-to-grower (sow) herds (N= 305); and (c) all breeding and <b>multiplying</b> (genetic) <b>herds</b> (N= 366). A previous bacteriological study on Salmonella presence in 1993 / 1994 served {{as a model for the}} present study. The results of the study were that multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was detected in one herd producing slaughter pigs. The herd apparent prevalences (HAPs) of Salmonella spp. were 11. 7, 16. 7 and 11. 4 % in genetic, sow, and slaughter pig herds, respectively. The conclusion of the study was that prevalence of multiresistant S. Typhimurium DT 104 was low in the examined slaughter pig herds. The herd true prevalence (HTP) of Salmonella spp. in pigs had declined from before the start of the DSCP in 1993 / 1994 to 4 years later (1998).

40|$|Sheep Growing {{constituted}} New Mexico's leading {{industry for}} much of the territorial period and had been of major importance over the preceding two centuries, since the days of Spanish sovereignty. This work is a dedicated economic history of the industry during the territorial period, a time during which sheep sheep growing underwent a series of dramatic changes from the traditional Spanish practices of open-range grazing and large trail drives serving Mexican markets to capitalized sheep and wool production on managed lands, serving vastly larger American markets. The <b>herds</b> <b>multiplied</b> tremendously, while leadership and control of the industry shifted from a small cohort of wealthy, landed Hispanic families to well-connected and well-capitalized Anglo merchants and growers, recently arrived in the territory. This shift, how and why it came about, is the central theme of this work. It is shown to be largely the result of impersonal economic forces, as New Mexico was gradually absorbed, economically and socially, into the American mainstream. The role of capital was central.

50|$|The Cayuse {{were known}} for their bravery and as horsemen. They bred their ponies for speed and endurance, {{developing}} {{what is now called}} the Cayuse horse. No longer restricted to what they could carry or what their dogs could pull, they moved into new areas, traveling as far east as the Great Plains and as far west as California, to hunt, trade, fight, and capture slaves. Meanwhile, their <b>herds</b> <b>multiplied</b> rapidly, a combination of skillful breeding and periodic raids on other tribes. By the early 1800s, a Cayuse who owned only 15 to 20 horses was considered poor; wealthy families controlled 2,000 or more. Horses improved the range and effectiveness of war parties, making it possible for Cayuses to dominate their sedentary neighbors on the Columbia. They claimed ownership of The Dalles, the great fishery and trade emporium of the Columbia, forcing the weaker bands in that area to pay them tribute in the form of salmon and other goods. They frequently were in conflict with the Snake people and other smaller tribes.|$|R
5000|$|Pueblo Indians {{learned about}} horses by working for Spanish colonists. The Spanish {{attempted}} to keep knowledge of riding away from Native people, but nonetheless, they learned and some fled their servitude to their Spanish employers—and took horses with them. Some horses were obtained through trade {{in spite of}} prohibitions against it. Other horses escaped captivity for a feral existence and were captured by Native people. In all cases the horse was adopted into their culture and <b>herds</b> <b>multiplied.</b> By 1659, the Navajo from northwestern New Mexico were raiding the Spanish colonies to steal horses. By 1664, the Apache were trading captives from other tribes to the Spanish for horses. The real beginning of the horse culture of the plains began with the expulsion of the Spanish from New Mexico in 1680 when the victorious Pueblo people captured thousands of horses and other livestock. They traded many horses north to the Plains Indians. [...] In 1683 a Spanish expedition into Texas found horses among Native people. In 1690, a few horses were found by the Spanish among the Indians living {{at the mouth of}} the Colorado River of Texas and the Caddo of eastern Texas had a sizeable number.|$|R
40|$|Across {{an entire}} {{livestock}} sector, individual breeders, producers or breeding companies, make breeding decisions. In its broadest sense, nearly any decision {{made in a}} livestock-breeding program is equivalent to animal-genetic technological change. The sector-wide impact of animal-genetic technological change has traditionally been modelled without accounting for the physical, economic and social attributes of individual farmers and how these change over time. In contrast, a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) explicitly contains many individuals, which {{interact with each other}} to determine their collective welfare. An Agent-Based Model (ABM) is a generic simulation approach to represent a complex adaptive system. The participants in an ABM are termed agents. A livestock sector containing many farmers {{is an example of a}} CAS. A properly parameterised ABM would assign attributes and behaviours to agents in a population that can set goals, develop strategies and interact with their environment, including other agents. Agent-based modelling provides a framework for animal-genetic technological change to be simulated as a result of the attributes of and interactions between individual farmers. This approach is als well suited to predicting how emergent structures arise in a livestock sector such as the evolution of nucleus, <b>multiplier</b> and commercial <b>herds</b> over time. This new framework will enhance traditional animal breeding systems research, primarily through being able to evaluate sectoral or industry-level change and how it is influenced by the attributes and interactions of individuals...|$|R
60|$|But these {{means of}} traffic and travel soon ceased to suffice. Then the Ohio people {{felt the need}} of getting out with their {{increasing}} crops, their <b>multiplying</b> flocks and <b>herds,</b> and they made their need known to the nation, {{to which they were}} everywhere akin, and the nation answered through Congress by beginning, in 1806, the National Road, which was finished by 1838, from Baltimore as far as Indiana. This road first opened the East to Ohio; then in 1811 a steamboat made its appearance on the Beautiful River, and after that steam commanded all the Southern and Southwestern waters for us, {{as well as those of}} the inland seas on the North. Then, that all these waters might be united, the state began in 1825 to build a system of canals, from Cleveland to Portsmouth and from Toledo to Cincinnati. When these canals were completed, with their branches, they gave the people some nine hundred miles of navigable waters within their own borders. The main lines were built, not by companies for private profit as the railroads have since been built, but by the people for the people, and it may be said that the great prosperity of Ohio began with them. Wherever they ran they drained the swamps and made the land not only habitable but beautiful. They were dug by Ohio people, and the sixteen millions of dollars that they cost came back into the hands of the men who gladly taxed themselves for the outlay. The towns along their course grew, and new towns rose out of the forests and prairies.|$|R
