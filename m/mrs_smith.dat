5|$|Smith {{suffered}} a heart attack on 9 August 1961, at his home in Washington, D.C., and he died in the ambulance on the way to Walter Reed Army Hospital. Although entitled to a Special Full Honor Funeral, at the request of his widow, a simple joint service funeral was held, patterned after the one given to General Marshall in 1959. She selected a grave site for her husband in Section 7 of Arlington National Cemetery close to Marshall's grave. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> was buried next to him after her death in 1963.

Soon after, Wentworth overhears Anne talking with Captain Harville about the constancy of a woman's love, and writes her a letter declaring that he still cares for her. Anne quickly finds him and the two happily walk off down a street, arm in arm. That night at a party, Wentworth announces his intention to marry Anne, much to Mr. Elliot's consternation. The final scene shows Wentworth and Anne on a naval ship, happy to be together.|$|E
5|$|George Smith's sister Anne {{married and}} had a son named James Christian McGill (1880–1972). McGill was {{orphaned}} {{at a young age}} when his parents died in the mid-1880s during an unspecified epidemic and was subsequently raised, along with his infant sister Eleanor, by <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> and George Smith. Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and the reasoning behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Stefani showed {{interest}} in making film appearances and began auditioning for films such as Mr. & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith.</b> She made her acting debut playing Jean Harlow in Martin Scorsese's The Aviator in 2004. Scorsese, whose daughter was a No Doubt fan, showed reciprocal {{interest in}} casting Stefani after seeing her picture from a Marilyn Monroe-inspired photo shoot for Teen Vogue in 2003. To prepare for the role, Stefani read two biographies and watched 18 of Harlow's films. Shooting her part took four to five days, and Stefani had few lines. Stefani lent her voice to the title character of the 2004 video game Malice; before completion, however, the company opted not to use No Doubt band members' voices.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, Pitt starred {{opposite}} his wife, Jolie, in {{her third}} directorial effort, By the Sea, a romantic {{drama about a}} marriage in crisis, based on her screenplay. The film was their first collaboration since 2005's Mr. & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith.</b> Pitt's next role came with the biographical comedy-drama The Big Short, which he also produced. The film was a commercial and critical success. It went on to gross over $102 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, earning Pitt his third Academy Award nomination as producer. In 2016, Pitt starred in Robert Zemeckis's romantic thriller Allied, in which he plays a spy assassin {{who falls in love}} with a French spy (played by Marion Cotillard) during a mission to kill a German official in World War II. Later he starred in the Netflix satirical comedy War Machine.|$|E
5|$|Pitt {{featured}} in the David Fincher-directed, commercially successful thriller Seven (1995), in which he played a detective {{on the trail of}} a psychopathic serial killer. The role of a mental patient in the science fiction film 12 Monkeys earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination in the same category. He followed it with the role of Heinrich Harrer in the biopic Seven Years in Tibet (1997). Pitt reteamed with Fincher to star in the apocalyptic film Fight Club (1999) in a role that required him learn boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. A critical and commercial success, the film has since developed a cult status. Pitt portrayed Rusty Ryan in the commercially successful heist film series Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07). In 2002, he earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for his guest appearance in the sitcom Friends. Also that year, Pitt started a production company, Plan B Entertainment, whose first release was the epic war film Troy (2004), starring Pitt. He played an assassin opposite Angelina Jolie in the commercially successful action comedy Mr. & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> (2005).|$|E
5|$|Pitt first gained {{recognition}} as a cowboy hitchhiker in the road movie Thelma & Louise (1991). His first leading roles in big-budget productions came with the drama films A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994), and horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994). He gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film 12 Monkeys (both 1995), the latter earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination. Pitt starred in the cult film Fight Club (1999) and the heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007).

25|$|In April 1912, Helene married Felix Deutsch. Following the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Helene experienced {{the first of many}} miscarriages. In The Psychology of Women, Helene discussed the concept of spontaneous abortion and miscarriage as a result of psychological factors, with a critical factor involving the 'pregnant woman's unconscious rejection of an identification with her own mother.' Under the pseudonym of a patient named <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> Helene {{tells the story of a}} woman who has trouble bringing a baby to full term. Helene wrote that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> was the youngest child of a large family, where her mother's disappointment that she was not a boy was evident. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> however, took solace in the deep love of her father and older sister. When she married and wanted to have a child, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> had difficulty reconciling her desire for a child with her mother's rejection of her. When she was about to become a mother herself, Mrs. Smith's fear about identifying with her mother intensified. This fear came to fruition when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> gave birth to a still born child one month before full term.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{surviving}} synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World.

The scene shifts to the squalid home of the charwoman, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> who, ill in bed and unable to earn the rent money, is about to be evicted with her tiny daughter May. The mother faints from weakness, and May rushes for a doctor. She sees Seymour's sign in a window, and asks him to help her mother. Then the man shows his caliber. Because she has no money, he turns her away. Calhoun, the lawyer, meets May, learns of her plight, and, although poor, pays the overdue rent, and the family moved back in the house. But the privation she has suffered proved fatal to the mother and tiny May is left an orphan. On her death bed, <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> is found by Miss Seaton, who is visiting the poor quarters on charity work, and on the charwoman's passing, society girl adopts poor little May. The child becomes a happy member of the Seaton family {{and at the end of}} the month is a fast friend of the kind-hearted Julia. At the end of a month, too, Julia prepares to decide who shall be her life partner, as promised. But it is little May who really decides. At sight of Seymour, she recalls the physician who turned her away, and denounces him to his own and Miss Julia's face. May recognizes Calhoun as the friend in need, and tells Miss Julia so. The latter feels that Calhoun is a real man and would make a splendid husband, so it's a cinch that 'the best man wins.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During Pitt's divorce proceedings, his {{involvement}} with his Mr. & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> co-star Angelina Jolie attracted media attention. Jolie stated {{that there was no}} infidelity, and Pitt and Jolie stated that they [...] "fell in love" [...] on the set. In April 2005, one month after Aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing Pitt, Jolie and her son Maddox at a beach in Kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between Pitt and Jolie. During 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple [...] "Brangelina". On January 11, 2006, Jolie confirmed to People that she was pregnant with Pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. Pitt and Jolie announced their engagement in April 2012 after seven years together. They were married on August 23, 2014, in a private ceremony in Château Miraval, France. On September 19, 2016, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt, citing irreconcilable differences.|$|E
500|$|Paramount quickly began casting Lombard as {{a leading}} lady, {{primarily}} in drama films. Her profile increased when she married William Powell in 1931, but the couple divorced after two years. A turning point in Lombard's career came when she starred in Howard Hawks' pioneering screwball comedy Twentieth Century (1934). The actress found her niche in this genre, and continued to appear in films such as Hands Across the Table (1935) (forming a popular partnership with Fred MacMurray), My Man Godfrey (1936), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and Nothing Sacred (1937). At this time, Lombard married [...] "the King of Hollywood", Clark Gable, and the supercouple gained much attention from the media. Keen to win an Oscar, {{at the end of}} the decade, Lombard began to move towards more serious roles. Unsuccessful in this aim, she returned to comedy in Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. & <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> (1941) and Ernst Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (1942)—her final film role.|$|E

500|$|Pan Berman had {{received}} his first screen credit in 1925 as a nineteen-year-old assistant director on FBO's Midnight Molly. He departed RKO in December 1939 after policy clashes with studio president George J. Schaefer, handpicked {{the previous year}} by the Rockefellers and backed by Sarnoff. With Berman gone, Schaefer became in effect production chief, though other men—including {{the former head of}} the industry censorship board, Joseph I. Breen—nominally filled the role. Schaefer, announcing his philosophy with a new studio slogan, [...] "Quality Pictures at a Premium Price", was keen on signing up independent producers whose films RKO would distribute. In 1941, the studio landed one of the most prestigious independents in Hollywood when it arranged to handle Samuel Goldwyn's productions. The first two Goldwyn pictures released by the studio were highly successful: The Little Foxes, directed by William Wyler and starring Bette Davis, garnered four Oscar nominations, while the Howard Hawks–directed Ball of Fire at last brought Barbara Stanwyck a hit under the RKO banner. However, Schaefer agreed to terms so favorable to Goldwyn that it was next to impossible for the studio to make money off his films. David O. Selznick loaned out his leading contracted director for two RKO pictures in 1941: Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. and <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> was a modest success and Suspicion a more substantial one, with an Oscar-winning turn by Joan Fontaine.|$|E

Some of the Twilight Zone episodes parodied include [...] "A Kind of a Stopwatch", [...] "To Serve Man", [...] "A Small Talent for War", [...] "Living Doll", [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet", [...] "Little Girl Lost", and [...] "The Little People". The [...] "Bart's Nightmare" [...] segment of [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] parodies the episode [...] "It's a Good Life" [...] and is even presented in a format similar to an episode of The Twilight Zone. The Halloween episodes also regularly parody horror and thriller films such as The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, King Kong, Night of the Living Dead, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Fly, Psycho, Paranormal Activity, and Dead Calm. Robert Englund, who portrays Freddy Krueger in the Nightmare on Elm street franchise, had a cameo appearance in [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] as the character. Science fiction films have also occasionally been used as inspiration for segments, and in later episodes many of the segments were based more on science fiction than horror. Science fiction works parodied include The Omega Man, the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and Orson Welles's The War of the Worlds radio broadcast. In [...] "Treehouse of Horror", Edgar Allan Poe's poem [...] "The Raven" [...] is read by James Earl Jones while the parts are acted by various characters.

2500|$|The {{story of}} <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> is strikingly {{similar to that}} of Helene's, as if she, herself, were {{speaking}} through <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith.</b> Through the story of <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith,</b> Helene argues that a successful pregnancy is possible when there is a loving relationship between mother and daughter, which 'smoothly socializes daughters into becoming mothers themselves.' Mirroring the life of Helene, Mrs. Smith's problem is resolved during the next pregnancy when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> identifies with a pregnant friend, and particularly with the friend's mother. Helene wrote that the friend's mother was the opposite of Mrs. Smith's mother. [...] She was filled with maternal warmth for both <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> and her own daughter. This maternal love, shared with her friend, allowed <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> to become a mother. According to Helene, although a healthy relationship between mother and daughter was important for a healthy pregnancy, equally important was the ability to lean on a female friend who could act as a surrogate sister for the pregnant woman. This idea is furthered when <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> and her friend became pregnant again around the same time. This time, there was no anxiety or fear surrounding pregnancy, but when Mrs. Smith's friend moved away, she miscarried. The diagnosis, according to Helene, was that <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Smith</b> suffered from 'over-excitability of the uterus.' A successful pregnancy, therefore, could only be brought about by leaning on another woman.|$|E
