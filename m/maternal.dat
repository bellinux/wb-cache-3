5|$|A {{disparity}} in access to <b>maternal</b> care between {{rural and urban}} populations {{is one of the}} ramifications of a highly concentrated urban medical system. According to Government of India National Family Health Survey (NFHS II, 1998-1999) the <b>maternal</b> mortality in rural areas is approximately 132 percent the number of <b>maternal</b> mortality in urban areas.|$|E
5|$|A parent's {{internal}} working {{model that}} is operative in the attachment {{relationship with her}} infant can be accessed by examining the parent's mental representations. Recent {{research has demonstrated that}} the quality of <b>maternal</b> attributions as markers of <b>maternal</b> mental representations can be associated with particular forms of <b>maternal</b> psychopathology and can be altered in a relative short time-period by targeted psychotherapeutic intervention.|$|E
5|$|The lack of <b>maternal</b> health {{contributes}} to future economic disparities for {{mothers and their}} children. Poor <b>maternal</b> health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities. Therefore, national health programmes such as the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and the Family Welfare Programme have been created to address the <b>maternal</b> health care needs of women across India.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} <b>maternal</b> oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild <b>maternal</b> poisoning or following <b>maternal</b> recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E

5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. <b>Maternal</b> mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, <b>maternal</b> mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} <b>Maternal</b> Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, <b>maternal</b> health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these <b>maternal</b> deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
5|$|Kajol {{was born}} in Mumbai to the Mukherjee-Samarth film family of Bengali-Marathi descent. Her mother, Tanuja, is an actress, while her father Shomu Mukherjee was a film {{director}} and producer. Shomu died in 2008 after suffering cardiac arrest. Kajol's younger sister, Tanishaa Mukherjee is also an actress. Her <b>maternal</b> aunt was actress Nutan and her <b>maternal</b> grandmother, Shobhna Samarth, and great grandmother, Rattan Bai, were both involved in Hindi cinema. Her paternal uncles, Joy Mukherjee and Deb Mukherjee, are film producers, while her paternal and <b>maternal</b> grandfathers, Sashadhar Mukherjee and Kumarsen Samarth, were filmmakers. Kajol's cousins Rani Mukerji, Sharbani Mukherjee and Mohnish Behl are also Bollywood actors; whereas another cousin of hers, Ayan Mukerji is a director.|$|E
5|$|<b>Maternal</b> {{deprivation}} {{experiments on}} nonhuman primates have {{continued into the}} 21st century and remain controversial. Stephen Suomi, an early collaborator of Harlow, has continued to conduct <b>maternal</b> deprivation experiments on rhesus monkeys in his NIH laboratory and has been vigorously criticized by PETA, Members of Congress and others.|$|E
5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of <b>maternal</b> health. In the United States, the {{leading causes of}} <b>maternal</b> death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|Princess Alice was {{the mother}} of Tsaritsa Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia (wife of Tsar Nicholas II), <b>maternal</b> {{grandmother}} of Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, the last Viceroy of India, and <b>maternal</b> great-grandmother of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, consort of Queen Elizabeth II. Another daughter, Elisabeth, who married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, was, like the tsaritsa and her family, killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918.|$|E

5|$|The ringed caecilian (Siphonops annulatus) has {{developed}} a unique adaptation {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as <b>maternal</b> dermatophagy. The brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate. Meanwhile, they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the <b>maternal</b> cloaca.|$|E
5|$|The term <b>maternal</b> {{deprivation}} is a catch-phrase summarising {{the early}} work of psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby {{on the effects}} of separating infants and young children from their mother (or mother substitute) although the effect of loss of the mother on the developing child had been considered earlier by Freud and other theorists. Bowlby's work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospital and institutional care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organisation's report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe whilst he was head of the Department for Children and Parents at the Tavistock Clinic in London after World War II. The result was the monograph <b>Maternal</b> Care and Mental Health published in 1951, which sets out the <b>maternal</b> deprivation hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa {{lived with}} his <b>maternal</b> family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his <b>maternal</b> {{grandfather}} was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent {{the early years of}} his childhood. His <b>maternal</b> family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's <b>maternal</b> grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.|$|E
5|$|Watts {{was born}} 28 September 1968, in Shoreham, Kent, England. She is the {{daughter}} of Myfanwy ("Miv") Edwards (née Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume and set designer, and Peter Watts (1946–1976), a road manager and sound engineer who worked with Pink Floyd. Miv was born in England but lived in Australia between the ages of one and seven. Watts' <b>maternal</b> grandfather was Welsh and her <b>maternal</b> grandmother was Australian.|$|E

5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of the father. After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the <b>maternal</b> half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of <b>maternal</b> uncles of the father and then grandsons of <b>maternal</b> aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E
25|$|The four {{measures}} of <b>maternal</b> death are the <b>maternal</b> mortality ratio (MMR), <b>maternal</b> mortality rate, lifetime risk of <b>maternal</b> death and proportion of <b>maternal</b> deaths among deaths {{of women of}} reproductive years (PM).|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} aid policy, proportionally, aid given to improve <b>maternal</b> {{mortality}} rates has shrunken as other public health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, have become major international concerns. <b>Maternal</b> health aid contributions {{tend to be}} lumped together with newborn and child health, so {{it is difficult to}} assess how much aid is given directly to <b>maternal</b> health to help lower the rates of <b>maternal</b> mortality. Regardless, there has been progress in reducing <b>maternal</b> mortality rates internationally.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{important}} aspects of <b>maternal</b> sensitivity: dynamic process involving <b>maternal</b> abilities, reciprocal give-and-take with the infant, contingency on the infant's behavior, and quality of <b>maternal</b> behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{and local}} governments have taken {{political}} steps in reducing <b>maternal</b> deaths. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute studied <b>maternal</b> health systems in four apparently similar countries: Rwanda, Malawi, Niger, and Uganda. In comparison to the other three countries, Rwanda has an excellent recent record of improving <b>maternal</b> death rates. Based on their investigation of these varying country case studies, the researchers conclude that improving <b>maternal</b> health depends on three key factors: 1. reviewing all <b>maternal</b> health-related policies frequently {{to ensure that they}} are internally coherent; 2. enforcing standards on providers of <b>maternal</b> health services; 3. any local solutions to problems discovered should be promoted, not discouraged.|$|E
25|$|A {{study in}} Sweden {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} environmental factors on NMDs. The study indicated {{that there might be}} an impact of low or subnormal <b>maternal</b> BMI before and during pregnancy, <b>maternal</b> infection, such as rubella, and <b>maternal</b> smoking on fetal brain development, including neuronal migration. The roles of <b>maternal</b> BMI and congenital infections should be tested in future analytical studies.|$|E
25|$|Globally, {{preventable}} {{deaths from}} improperly performed procedures constitute 13% of <b>maternal</b> mortality, and 25% {{or more in}} some countries where <b>maternal</b> mortality from other causes is relatively low, making unsafe abortion the leading single cause of <b>maternal</b> mortality worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Two related {{qualitative}} {{concepts that}} are correlated with <b>maternal</b> sensitivity are mother–infant synchrony and <b>maternal</b> mind-mindedness.|$|E

25|$|The <b>maternal</b> {{deprivation}} hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, {{was enormously}} controversial. Ten {{years after the}} publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy. Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of <b>maternal</b> deprivation into lack of <b>maternal</b> care, distortion of <b>maternal</b> care and discontinuity of <b>maternal</b> care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the <b>maternal</b> deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued. As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research. Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.|$|E
25|$|The Kleihauer–Betke test or {{flow cytometry}} on a {{postnatal}} <b>maternal</b> blood sample can confirm that fetal blood has {{passed into the}} <b>maternal</b> circulation and {{can also be used}} to estimate the amount of fetal blood that has passed into the <b>maternal</b> circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Maternal</b> behavior: Female rats given {{oxytocin}} antagonists {{after giving}} birth do not exhibit typical <b>maternal</b> behavior. By contrast, virgin female sheep show <b>maternal</b> behavior toward foreign lambs upon cerebrospinal fluid infusion of oxytocin, which they would not do otherwise. Oxytocin {{is involved in the}} initiation of <b>maternal</b> behavior, not its maintenance; for example, it is higher in mothers after they interact with unfamiliar children rather than their own.|$|E
25|$|She was baptised on 14 May in the Church of Holmen in Copenhagen. The Princess's godparents were: King Christian X ({{paternal}} grandfather); Hereditary Prince Knud (paternal uncle); Prince Axel (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); King Gustaf V of Sweden (<b>maternal</b> great-grandfather); Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (<b>maternal</b> grandfather); Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten (her <b>maternal</b> uncle); Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (<b>maternal</b> grandmother's father).|$|E
25|$|Factors that {{increase}} <b>maternal</b> death can be direct or indirect. Generally, {{there is a}} distinction between a direct <b>maternal</b> death that {{is the result of}} a complication of the pregnancy, delivery, or management of the two, and an indirect <b>maternal</b> death, that is a pregnancy-related death in a patient with a preexisting or newly developed health problem unrelated to pregnancy. Fatalities during but unrelated to a pregnancy are termed accidental, incidental, or nonobstetrical <b>maternal</b> deaths.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>maternal</b> {{death rate}} {{averaged}} 9.1 <b>maternal</b> deaths per 100,000 live births {{during the years}} 19791986, but then rose rapidly to 14 per 100,000 in 2000 and 17.8 per 100,000 in 2009. In 2013 the rate was 18.5 deaths per 100,000 live births, with some 800 <b>maternal</b> deaths reported.|$|E
