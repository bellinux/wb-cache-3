5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t give himself a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E
25|$|What {{he has got}} to {{understand}} is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> to me.|$|E

Following the tour's completion the duo performed the title track on talk shows The View and The Colbert Report. For the Christmas Tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, Bennett and Gaga performed a rendition of [...] "Winter Wonderland". A few days later on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, they performed [...] "Cheek to Cheek" [...] and [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If I Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and Gaga singing solo on [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye".|$|E

500|$|... "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] is a jazz {{song that}} singer Ivie Anderson {{introduced}} with the Duke Ellington Band. The lyrics for the Ellington composition {{were written by}} Irving Mills. The same year, a rendition by the Mills Brothers rose to the charts. The song's title introduced the term [...] "swing" [...] into common usage and gave name to the swing era.|$|E
500|$|Bennett {{said that}} Gaga had written an {{original}} {{song for the}} album titled [...] "Paradise". It also contained solo performances along with the duets; Gaga later clarified that the album contained only standards. The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook including [...] "Anything Goes", a Porter song, [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] by Duke Ellington, [...] "Lush Life" [...] by Billy Strayhorn, and the title track by Berlin.|$|E
500|$|In the 1930s, swing jazz {{emerged as}} a {{dominant}} form in American music. Duke Ellington and his band members composed numerous swing era hits that have become standards: [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] (1932), [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] (1933) and [...] "Caravan" [...] (1936), among others. Other influential bandleaders of this period were Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway and Fletcher Henderson. Goodman's band became well-known from the radio show Let's Dance and in 1937 introduced a number of jazz standards to a wide audience in the first jazz concert performed in Carnegie Hall.|$|E

As of 2011, heroin addiction and homelessness are huge problems across the inner city of Dublin.|$|R

500|$|In June 2014, Gaga began {{promoting}} the album {{through a series}} of public appearances with and without Bennett, the first of them being at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in New York City. At the school, which was founded by Bennett and his wife Susan Crow, the pair performed as a duo and individually, and fielded questions from the audience. They concluded their engagement by watching a performance from the school's choir. Two days after her performance at the school, Gaga showed a new tattoo of a Miles Davis trumpet she had gotten earlier. The singer posted a picture to her Instagram account of her getting the tattoo with Newman, announcing his involvement on the album while proclaiming, [...] "It's jazz time, world". Gaga also performed with Bennett at the Montreal International Jazz Festival, and starred in a holiday commercial for retail company H, directed by Johan Renck and featuring [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If I Ain't Got That Swing)". The artists announced the news on Instagram. At the 2014 New York Fashion Week party, Gaga performed [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye", dedicating it to her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney.|$|E
500|$|Bennett and Gaga {{performed}} thirteen songs. The concert {{started with}} Bennett and Gaga appearing before {{the crowd and}} singing [...] "Anything Goes", then {{moving on to the}} title track, [...] "Cheek to Cheek". A costume change ensues, and Gaga and Bennett appear on stage to sing [...] "Nature Boy". Bennett continues with [...] "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?" [...] following which Gaga appears on stage in Menkes' red jumpsuit and a big wig to sing her solo rendition of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". Following a standing ovation, the duo come together to perform the Billy Strayhorn penned [...] "Firefly" [...] and Gaga disappears for a third costume change. She appears in Vogels' crown hat and a Valentino gown and together they sing [...] "I Won't Dance" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love", wearing Cavalli. Gaga stays on stage for solo rendition of [...] "Lush Life", followed by Bennett with his solo performance of [...] "Sophisticated Lady". After another costume change, the duo sing [...] "Let's Face the Music and Dance" [...] and [...] "But Beautiful". The final performance is aided by the full band and dancers, as they sing [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". After taking a bow, Bennett and Gaga disappear behind the curtains.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] in awards ceremonies and televised shows, the song was included on the set list for her tours The Beyoncé Experience and I Am... World Tour. John Aizlewood of Daily Mail described {{the performance of the}} song during The Beyoncé Experience as [...] "head-spinning". During Beyoncé's performance of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] at a concert in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the malfunction, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect... 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." [...] During the I Am... World Tour, Beyoncé did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] after her entrance on stage. During the revue I Am... Yours which {{was a part of the}} tour, Beyoncé performed a jazz medley of [...] "Déjà Vu", [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and continued with a full version of the first song. Concert performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] were included on her live albums The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007), [...] (2009) and I Am... World Tour (2010).|$|E

[...] Miss Palliser replied {{with a smile that}} she thought that to be true, and Mr. Spooner was not slow at perceiving that this afforded good {{encouragement}} to him in regard to that matter which was now weighing most heavily upon his mind.|$|R

2500|$|Bands such as The Boswell Sisters {{regularly}} employed scatting {{on their}} records, including the high complexity of scatting {{at the same}} time, in harmony. An example is their version of [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". Another famous scat singer is Scatman Crothers, who {{would go on to}} movie and television fame. British dance band trumpeter and vocalist Nat Gonella was a notable scat singer. Some authorities considered scat singing as lacking respectability, including BBC Radio, which did not permit scatting on air in the late 1930s.|$|E
2500|$|Western {{swing in}} its {{beginnings}} was just dance music. The term swing, meaning big band dance music, wasn't used {{until after the}} 1932 hit [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". Recording companies came up with several names before World War II trying to market it—hillbilly, old-time music, novelty hot dance, hot string band, and even Texas swing for music coming out of Texas and Louisiana. Most of the big Western dance bandleaders simply referred to themselves as Western bands and their music as Western dance music, many adamantly refusing the hillbilly label.|$|E

40|$|In {{an era of}} globalisation, {{it might}} be thought that {{the age of the}} {{nation-state}} is dead and that conflicts surrounding national identity will be of less and less importance in the twenty first century. However, it is argued here that concerns over national identity are by no <b>means</b> <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> of the past. Competing nationalist claims lead to conflicts which have significant repercussions for those living in such places and beyond. Using examples from the former Yugoslavia, it is argued that territory continues to be of huge significance and remains an integral component of the national imagination. Both generic ‘national’ landscapes and specific places carry with them huge symbolic meanings and form essential elements in ‘nationalising’ strategies...|$|R

2500|$|As the Depression worsened, the {{recording}} industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933. Ivie Anderson was hired as their featured vocalist in 1931. She is the vocalist on [...] "It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued {{to do in a}} cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain Ellington's public profile as his orchestra began to tour. The other records of this era include: [...] "Mood Indigo" [...] (1930), [...] "Sophisticated Lady" [...] (1933), [...] "Solitude" [...] (1934), and [...] "In a Sentimental Mood" [...] (1935) ...|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Buck Clayton shared {{some of his}} {{memories}} of the Dunbar. He recalled the Dunbar as “jumping” with loads {{of people trying to}} get a glimpse of the celebrities, and parties thrown by Duke Ellington and his guys with “chicks and champagne everywhere.” Clayton recalled an instance when Ellington and his orchestra came to Los Angeles shortly after the 1932 release of the song It Don't <b>Mean</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thing</b> (If It Ain't Got That Swing). Ellington’s band was in the Dunbar restaurant when the song came on the jukebox. It was the first time since leaving New York that they had heard their recording. Clayton described the band's response: “So much rhythm I've never heard, as guys were beating on the tables, instrument cases or anything else they could beat on with knives, forks, rolled-up newspapers or anything else they could find to make rhythm. [...] It was absolutely crazy.” ...|$|E

50|$|The {{mystery of}} Giggs Hill Green {{is that there}} is no hill. The Green has had several {{different}} spellings over the centuries.
