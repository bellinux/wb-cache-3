In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, riots broke out following the election of Snyder Rini as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1,000 Chinese residents homeless.

5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E

He established himself as a key member of the team that won the Premier League in 2006–07, their first title success in four years.

He has enjoyed continued success since then, and as of 2017, he is the only English player alongside Wayne Rooney to win the Premier League title, FA Cup, UEFA Champions League, League Cup, FA Community Shield, UEFA Europa League and FIFA Club World Cup. In winning the 2016 FA Cup, Carrick completed his collection of every domestic honour in the English game.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Earl {{became an}} active statesman, serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834. Along with Lord John Russell, {{he led the}} fight to pass the Reform Bill of 1832, <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twenty speeches, and is {{generally}} considered the architect of its victory. Despite his debts, in respect for his father, John managed to retain the massive book collection, and also continue to run the other Spencer houses at Wimbledon and Spencer House in London, {{as well as his}} farm in Wiseton and shooting retreat in Norfolk. He achieved this mainly by far less extravagant living, spending much of the year at Wiseton where the running costs were £1,200 compared with the £5,000 needed to run Althorp and pay the staff of 40 in the house. As a result, Althorp was largely abandoned during the late 1830s and early 1840s. John also leased out his lands and gardens and sold land in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, repaying all the debt by {{the time of his death}} in 1845, and beginning to run his properties at a profit. His son Frederick Spencer, 4th Earl Spencer, who owned Althorp from 1845 until his death in 1857, also retained the collection.|$|E

25|$|Hick {{ended up}} playing in four Tests, {{but he had}} a rather poor series overall, {{averaging}} 25, although his defiant 68 in a losing cause at Perth stuck in the memory and his 39 and 60 contributed significantly to England's 12-run win at Melbourne (even if Dean Headley's 6–60 was more remarked upon). In the ODIs against both Australia and Sri Lanka Hick did much better, <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500 runs – including a fine run of 108, 66*, 126* and 109 in successive innings – and being named England's Man of the Series.|$|E

Unable to play County Championship cricket until 1961 as he qualified for the county by residence, his appearances were in any case restricted in some seasons by {{his career as a}} schoolmaster. But even in those seasons when he was more regularly available, he often found himself a fringe first-team player, never <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 11 first-class appearances in any one season and managing a highest season aggregate of just 410 runs, which he achieved in 1967.|$|E

He reached his second test century in the morning session of the second day before being dismissed by Mohammad Ashraful. Jacob Oram also reached three figures, top-scoring with 117; however the rest of the batsmen did not make any major contribution with Daniel Vettori's 32 being the third highest score and only four players <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twenty.

25|$|Hick seemed set {{fair for}} another {{productive}} season in 1996, especially after making 215 for Worcestershire against the Indians in May, {{but it was}} not to be.

Back at Worcestershire, he scored unevenly: immediately after his being dropped by England he made 148 and 86 against Kent, but he then endured a run of ten innings in all cricket without <b>making</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 30, before hitting 54 and 106 against Gloucestershire in the penultimate Championship game of the season.|$|E
