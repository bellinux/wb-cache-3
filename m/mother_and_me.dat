6000|$|Hereupon my lord {{held out}} his hand to Mrs. Deuceace, and said, [...] "My dear, will you join your <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me?</b> We shall always, as I said, have a home for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} of them. In former days, I {{think you were}} told that my father's will {{provided}} for my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> for <b>me.</b> You {{know that we have}} enough to live on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I used to ride when I was a boy, before Tippoo {{came down}} and killed my father <b>and</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> brought <b>me</b> up here. Will my lord {{want me to take}} the horses across?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I won't be too gay on any account," [...] {{she would}} say to herself. [...] "It would be tempting Providence to hurl <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> down, and afflict us again as He used to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had {{too many}} kisses afore he started," [...] {{suggested}} Uncle Gutton, {{with his mouth}} full of cold roast pork and pickles. [...] "Wonderfully nourishing thing, kisses, eh? Look at <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> That's all we live on." ...|$|E

6000|$|THE GRAND DUCHESS. My poor Strammfest: {{you were}} not often enough at court to tire of it. You were mostly soldiering; and when you came home {{to have a new}} order pinned on your breast, your {{happiness}} came through looking at my father <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> at <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> adoring us. Was that not so? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What is {{the good}} of your <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> economizing and stinting {{ourselves}} {{to give you a}} University education, if it is not to be used for the honour and glory of God?" [...] his father repeated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think, Arthur, {{you will}} not want <b>Mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me</b> {{in the morning and}} we will keep away. It might set Mother {{thinking}} about Pet; she's a soft-hearted woman. She's best at the Cottage, and I'll stay there and keep her company.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How ever, indeed! Have you no pity on {{his poor}} <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me?</b> Fancy us holding him tight {{down in the}} carriage, and he raving between us, fit to drive {{everybody}} delirious. The very coachman went wrong, somehow, and we lost our way." ...|$|E

6000|$|Our unwilling guest behaved with tolerably good grace, and {{presently}} {{made his}} excuse to my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> <b>me,</b> promising immediately to send back Solivet to his friends.

6000|$|... "I am certain," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{have found}} out the true reason of your unwillingness to speak of this matter before my <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> before <b>me.</b> An unlucky {{accident}} has associated you in people's minds with Mr. Luker.

6000|$|... "Come <b>and</b> {{sit beside}} <b>me,</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> let <b>me</b> lay {{my head on}} your knee.

Give me your hand, mother; I would sleep now as in the days gone by." ...|$|R
