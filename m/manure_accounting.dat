40|$|This paper {{presents}} a spatially explicit method for making regional {{estimates of the}} potential for biogas production from crop residues and <b>manure,</b> <b>accounting</b> for key technical, biochemical, environmental and economic constraints. Methods for making such estimates are important as biofuels from agricultural residues are receiving increasing policy support from the EU and major biogas producers, such as Germany and Italy, in response to concerns over unintended negative environmental and social impacts of conventional biofuels. This analysis comprises a spatially explicit estimate of crop residue and manure production for the EU at 250 m resolution, and a biogas production model accounting for local constraints such as the sustainable removal of residues, transportation of substrates, and the substrates' biochemical suitability for anaerobic digestion. In our base scenario, the EU biogas production potential from crop residues and manure is about 0. 7 EJ/year, nearly double the current EU production of biogas from agricultural substrates, most of which does not come from residues or manure. An extensive sensitivity analysis of the model shows that the potential could easily be 50 % higher or lower, depending on the stringency of economic, technical and biochemical constraints. We find that the potential is particularly sensitive to constraints on the substrate mixtures' carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and dry matter concentration. Hence, the potential to produce biogas from crop residues and manure in the EU depends to large extent on the possibility to overcome the challenges associated with these substrates, either by complementing them with suitable co-substrates (e. g. household waste and energy crops), or through further development of biogas technology (e. g. pretreatment of substrates and recirculation of effluent) ...|$|E

The study was conducted over 1 year on an experimental farm. In the broiler house, emissions of N 2 O and CH 4 were measured using photo-acoustic infrared spectrometryand air flow rates were estimated using SF 6 as tracer gas. On the outdoor run, N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes were measured using static chambers. Spatial and temporal gap-filling methods were used to provide annual estimates of emissions. In the broiler house, CH 4 and N 2 O annual emissions from manure represented about 49 and 71 g CO 2 -equivalents (CO 2 -eq.) /kg live weight (LW), while non-biotic CO 2 emissions (heating) represented about 68 g CO 2 -eq. /kg LW, suggesting that <b>manure</b> <b>accounted</b> for about 65 % of total indoor CO 2 -eq. emissions.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the status and extent of soil contamination with trace elements to make sustainable management strategies for agricultural soils. The inputs of trace elements to agricultural soils via atmospheric deposition, livestock manures, fertilizers and agrochemicals, sewage irrigation and sewage sludge in China were analyzed and an annual inventory of trace element inputs was developed. The results showed that atmospheric deposition was responsible for 43 - 85 % of the total As, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb inputs, while livestock <b>manures</b> <b>accounted</b> for approximately 55 %, 69 % and 51 % of the total Cd, Cu and Zn inputs, respectively. Among the elements concerned, Cd was a top priority in agricultural soils in China, with an average input rate of 0. 004 mg/kg/yr in the plough layer (0 - 20 cm). Due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the sources, the inventory as well as the environmental risks of trace elements in soils varies on a regional scale. For example, sewage sludge and fertilizers (mainly organic and phosphate-based inorganic fertilizers) can also be the predominant sources of trace elements where these materials were excessively applied.

40|$|Given the {{important}} role of nitrogen input from livestock systems in terrestrial nutrient cycles and the atmospheric chemical composition, it is vital to have a robust estimation of the magnitude and spatiotemporal variation in manure nitrogen production and its application to cropland across the globe. In this study, we used the dataset from the Global Livestock Impact Mapping System (GLIMS) in conjunction with country-specific annual livestock populations to reconstruct the manure nitrogen production during 1860 – 2014.

40|$|A {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) was conducted to estimate whole-farm greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from beef production in western Canada. The aim {{was to determine the}} relative contributions of the cow-calf and feedlot components to these emissions, and to examine the proportion of whole-farm emissions attributable to enteric methane (CH 4). The simulated farm consisted of a beef production operation comprised of 120 cows, four bulls, and their progeny, with the progeny fattened in a feedlot. The farm also included cropland and native prairie pasture for grazing to supply the feed for the animals. The LCA was conducted over 8 Â years to fully account for the lifetime GHG emissions from the cows, bulls and progeny, as well as the beef marketed from cull cows, cull bulls, and progeny raised for market. The emissions were estimated using Holos, a whole-farm model developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Holos is an empirical model, with a yearly time-step, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology, modified for Canadian conditions and farm scale. The model considers all significant CH 4, N 2 O, and CO 2 emissions and removals on the farm, as well as emissions from manufacture of inputs (fertilizer, herbicides) and off-farm emissions of N 2 O derived from nitrogen applied on the farm. The LCA estimated the GHG intensity of beef production in this system at 22 Â kg CO 2 equivalent (kg carcass) - 1. Enteric CH 4 was the largest contributing source of GHG accounting for 63 % of total emissions. Nitrous oxide from soil and <b>manure</b> <b>accounted</b> for a further 27 % of the total emissions, while CH 4 emissions from manure and CO 2 energy emissions were minor contributors. Within the beef production cycle, the cow-calf system accounted for about 80 % of total GHG emissions and the feedlot system for only 20 %. About 84 % of enteric CH 4 was from the cow-calf herd, mostly from mature cows. It follows that mitigation practices to reduce GHG emissions from beef production should focus on reducing enteric CH 4 production from mature beef cows. However, mitigation approaches must also recognize that the cow-calf production system also has many ancillary environmental benefits, allowing use of grazing and forage lands that can preserve soil carbon reserves and provide other ecosystems services.

The similarity of identified ARGs with the closest protein in GenBank ranged from 26 % to 92 %, with more than 60 % of identified ARGs had low similarity less than 60 % at amino acid level.

S. natural gas (NG) consumption. Owing to the high global warming potential of methane, capturing and utilizing this methane source could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The extent of that reduction depends on several factors - most notably, {{how much of this}} manure-based methane can be captured, how much GHG is produced in the course of converting it to vehicular fuel, and how much GHG was produced by the fossil fuel it might displace. A life-cycle analysis was conducted to quantify these factors and, in so doing, assess the impact of converting methane from animal manure into renewable NG (RNG) and utilizing the gas in vehicles. Several manure-based RNG pathways were characterized in the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model, and their fuel-cycle energy use and GHG emissions were compared to petroleum-based pathways as well as to conventional fossil NG pathways. Results show that despite increased total energy use, both fossil fuel use and GHG emissions decline for most RNG pathways as compared with fossil NG and petroleum. However, GHG emissions for RNG pathways are highly dependent on the specifics of the reference case, {{as well as on the}} process energy emissions and methane conversion factors assumed for the RNG pathways. The most critical factors are the share of flared controllable CH{sub 4 } and the quantity of CH{sub 4 } lost during NG extraction in the reference case, the magnitude of N{sub 2 }O lost in the anaerobic digestion (AD) process and in AD residue, and the amount of carbon sequestered in AD residue.

However, environmental stewardship and animal welfare may have excitingly conflicting objectives. Examples include pasture-based dairy and beef cattle production where high-fiber diets increase methane emissions compared with grain feeding practices in confinement. Livestock account for 35 - 40 % of global anthropogenic emissions of methane, via enteric fermentation and <b>manure,</b> which together <b>account</b> for about 80 % of the agricultural emissions. Recent estimates indicate that the methane emissions from African cattle, goats, and sheep are likely to increase from their current level of about 7. 8 million tons of methane per year in 2000 to 11. 1 million tons per year by 2003, largely driven by increase in livestock numbers.

The aim of the paper is to find possible ways of preventing NO 3 -levels to rise in Croatian farming systems and their implications {{from the viewpoint of}} the manager. More specifically the purpose is to 1. Determine whether Croatian farmers exceed profit maximising levels of N-fertiliser use in maize cultivation and possible influence on NO 3 -N-levels. 2. To estimate the marginal abatement cost (MAC) at farm level of reducing NO 3 -N leaching through following economic instruments: a tax on optimal N-doses, a product tax and a Nfertiliser quota, all instruments corresponding to the same abatement level. Based on N-response experiments from field trials for maize N-response curves were derived. A sample of 20 family farms was used to calculate intensity, nutrient content in manure and the prices paid for N and obtained for maize. Profit maximising doses from the field trials were compared with nutrient use on farms. An effluent production function was estimated based on experiments with NO 3 -N contents in lysimeter water for the same treatments as in the N-response experiments. The results indicate that farmers use higher than optimal levels of N-fertilisers, if the technology and conditions of experimental fields could be applied on the farms and if <b>manure</b> is <b>accounted</b> for. Neglecting the N-content of the manure shows close to optimal nutrient levels. At profit maximising levels the NO 3 -N level is approximately 14 mg NO 3 -N/l (62 mg NO 3 /l) or clearly higher that the critical level stipulated by the nitrate directive (11. 3 mg NO 3 - N/l or 50 mg NO 3 /l). If the N-content in the manure is taken into account the estimated NO 3 -N/l level in groundwater is about twice higher than the critical level stipulated by the Nitrate Directive. Through any of the three instruments a 76 % NO 3 - leaching reduction could be obtained. However, it was concluded the quota has the lowest MAC (4. 08 ?/mg NO 3 -N/l or 0. 92 ?/mg NO 3 /l), followed by the N-fertiliser tax (16. 16 ?/mg NO 3 -N/l or 3. 65 ?/mg NO 3 /l) and the product tax in third place (41. 25 ?/mg NO 3 -N/l or 9. 32 ?/mg NO 3 /l).

In addition, methane emissions from enteric fermentation and <b>manure</b> management <b>accounted</b> for 32 % and 7 %, respectively of agriculture sector non –Co 2 emissions livestock sector will thus have large impacts on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels. The objective of this paper: 1) to investigate the particular role played by crop yield increases in the dynamics of livestock production systems; 2) to explore whether these dynamics could lead to sparing of not only cropland but also grassland; and 3) to quantify the implications for related GHG emissions. Crop yield increases since 1961 have spared 85 % of cropland expansion and avoided emissions of some 590 gigatons (Gt) Co 2 -eq in the crop sector, compared to an alternative scenario without productivity increases (Burney, Davis, and Lobell 2010). In a prospective analysis, Tilman et al. (2011) demonstrated that if the current trends of low intensification in developing regions were to continue, five times more additional cropland(1 billion ha) would be needed and three times more GHG emissions would be emitted by 2050 than improvements. However, neither of these studies considered the indirect effects of increases in crop productivity on the dynamics of the required for livestock production. Evenson and Rosegrant (2003) showed that without the improvements that took place in crop genetics between 1965 and 2000, food crop prices would have been 35 - 66 % higher. The price reductions generated by crop yield increases should, ceteris paribus, encourage farmers to replace some of the grass in ruminant rations with crops. This would lead to land sparing and related Co 2 emission reductions in regions where the feed productivity per unit of area is higher for cropland than for grassland. However, because of the multiple and complex relationships between crop, livestock and land-use, clear-cut conclusions about the direction and magnitude of change in land use and GHG emissions cannot be obtained without integrated economic modeling. In this study we implement the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM, which has been used extensively in the past: 1) to analyze the effects of biofuel policies on total GHG emissions balance (Havlik et al. 2011; Frank eta l. forthcoming; and Mosnier et al. 2012); 2) to assess the mitigation potential of reduced emissions from deforestation (Bottcher et al 2012); and 3) to investigate future global challenges in the sector in general...|$|R

Across the sample, policymakers favoured manure management strategies (n= 24), particularly anaerobic digestion which accounted for 21 % (n= 13) of all identified policies. Nutrition based mitigation strategies were also preferred (n= 17). Policies aimed at reducing sector size were largely ignored (n= 4). The results indicate that significant mitigation is unlikely as manure emissions are only a small portion of total dairy sector emissions. The study concludes that policymakers are selecting the less politically sensitive mitigation strategies at the cost of emission reduction...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} optional ways of preventing NO 3 -levels from rising within Croatian farming systems, and the implications from the viewpoint of the manager. More specifically, the purpose is to 1) Determine whether Croatian farmers exceed profit maximising levels of N-fertilizer use in maize cultivation, and its possible influence on NO 3 N-levels. 2) To estimate the marginal abatement cost (MAC), at the farm level, of reducing NO 3 N leaching through the following instruments: a tax on optimal N-doses, a product tax and an N-fertiliser quota and a requirement for all instruments to correspond to the same abatement level. Based on. N-response experiment from feld trial for maize N-response curves were estimated. A sample of 20 family farms was used for calculating intensity, nutrient content in manure, and the prices paid for N and obtained for maize. Profit maximising doses from the field trials were compared with the use of nutrients on farms. An effluent production function was estimated based on experiments with NO 3 N contents in lysimeter water for the same treatment levels as those in the N-response experiments. The results indicate that farmers use higher than optimal levels of N-fertilisers, if the <b>manure</b> is fully <b>accounted</b> for. In this case the estimated NO 3 N/ 1 level in groundwater is 162 - 192 % higher than the critical level stipulated by the Nitrate Directive. Neglecting the N-content in manure shows close to profit maximising nutrient levels. At this fertilising level the estimated NO 3 / 1 is approximately 62 mg NO 3 / 1 or clearly higher that the critical level stipulated by the nitrate directive (50 mg NO 3 / 1). Through any of the three instruments a 76 % NO 3 -leaching reduction could be obtained. It was concluded, however, that the quota has the lowest MAC (0. 92 euro/mg NO 3 / 1) followed by the N-fertiliser tax (3. 65 euro/mg NO 3 / 1), and the product tax comes in third place (9. 32 euro/mg NO 3 / 1). Management practices that may increase yield levels, and correspondingly NO 3 -leaching in the short and long run, were also identified. One way to achieve a quick improvement might be a system of cross compliance, stipulating a code of good agricultural practices.

40|$|The {{development}} {{towards a}} sustainable agriculture {{has been a}} main objective of organic agriculture from the beginning (IFOAM, 1978), and a declared objective of the newly applied EC-Regulation (1804 / 1999) on organic livestock production which provides a clear framework for livestock production. The leading idea {{is based on the}} voluntary self-restriction in the use of specific means of production with the objectives to produce food of high quality in an animal appropriate and environmentally friendly manner within a nearly complete nutrient farm organism (Sundrum, 1998). With regard to an environmentally friendly production, organic livestock farming is characterised by: 	- System-oriented approach, 	- Renunciation of mineral nitrogen, pesticides, growth promoters, and GMO’s, 	- Maximum total stocking density of 2 large animal units per ha, 	- Restrictions in the amount and quality of bought-in feedstuffs. In the following, consequences of the framework and the production method are discussed in relation to the environmental issue. System-oriented approach Livestock production forms an integral part of agricultural holdings practising organic farming. Different agricultural fields are interrelated into a ‘farm organism’ which is driven by a nearly complete innerfarm nutrient cycle. A strict separation into lines of production is inappropriate {{to the idea of a}} nutrient cycle. With regard to nutrient losses, level of reference is the farm as a single unit and not a specific level of process engineering as is commonly used in conventional production. For example, it would be inappropriate to assess the emission of nitrogen in relation to the average milk yield per cow without taking the whole farm that is among others nitrogen losses in relation to fodder growing and distribution of <b>manure</b> into <b>account.</b> Prevention strategy The general renunciation of mineral nitrogen, risk materials (like pesticides) and controversially discussed substances (like GMO’s) is part of a prevention strategy, leading to a comparable low input of substances, into the farm and to a minimized output. Reduction of pollution or energy consumption is reached by a systemic and casually related approach, while conventional strategies are often based on technical and management related measures (Kristensen and Halberg, 1997). To assess nutrient losses on the farm level, the most common methodologies involve using balance sheets of the whole farm. Calculations demonstrate that the systemic effect of organic agriculture in both cattle and pig production has great implication on the nutrient balance and the balance-surplus in relation to the product (Haas, 1995; Halberg et al., 1995; Martinson, 1998; Sundrum & Trangolao, 2000). There is reason for the assumption that the benefit of the system-related approach on minimising pollution are much more effective as compared to management-related factors, such as increasing animal performance per animal per year. For example, reducing nitrogen input of 100 kg N/ha is more than doubly efficient in relation to the balance surplus than increasing average milk yield for 1. 000 kg/cow and year (Mejs and Mandersloot, 1993). However, there is a high variability within organic farms in relation to their efforts and their nutrient efficiency. Dual strategy in relation to nitrogen In organic livestock production, feeding is primarily based on home-grown feedstuffs, including a high amount of legumes. As a consequence crude protein content in the diet often clearly exceeds the requirements of the animals and nitrogen in the manure is on a high level. In conventional production farmers are asked to reduce nitrogen in the diet in order to reduce nitrogen in the manure. In organic farming, a high level of crude protein in the diet is a very important nitrogen source for the innerfarm nutrient cycle. When trying to utilize this nitrogen source, organic farmers are encouraged simultaneously to minimize nitrogen emission from the manure. Due to the limited nitrogen resource, organic farmers have to find the balance within a dual strategy: increasing nitrogen in the manure and minimizing nitrogen emission form the manure. As nitrogen input in the organic farm is on a low level, organic farms are endowed with a credit in relation to nitrogen losses in the following production process. In the long run, the objective to increase productivity within the framework of organic agriculture goes along with improving management measures to minimize nitrogen emission. On the other hand, the increase of productivity from a high level as being realised in conventional production leads more or less to a higher efficacy of nitrogen turnover and a reduction in nitrogen losses per cow and milk yield (Kirchgessner et al., 1991). However, there is reason for the assumption that with reference to the conventional farm as a whole, nutrient efficacy will probably decrease due to a reduction in digestibility of feedstuffs and higher demands of bought-in concentrates. Those concentrates increase nutrient input in the farm and cause energy consumption especially due to transport. From these theoretical considerations the question arises whether the efforts to increase productivity will reach or even has already exceeded the marginal utility in relation to environmental effects. It can be concluded that both, a system oriented approach and a approach on the level of process engineering are needed to proceed in environmentally friendly production. Organic livestock production seems to be in the lead because production starts from a comparable low level of nutrient input. ...|$|R
