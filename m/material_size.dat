2500|$|Continuous {{conveyor}} belt fragmentation measurements in the comminution plant {{can provide an}} instantaneous tool for process control. [...] When planning the integration of fragmentation measurement instrumentation, position your camera monitoring station in a location where you can effect a process control change based upon the particle size information you receive.

50|$|Likewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a {{study of}} twelve Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers varying in design, pipe <b>material,</b> <b>size</b> and age, stated, “This study was {{performed}} because of concerns of potential microbial growth in the buried pipes of 'ground-coupled' air systems.

50|$|<b>Materials,</b> <b>size</b> and {{execution}} of the lamp varied slightly throughout the years and it received different names (Giso 5011 in 1936, Giso 5201 in 1939). The asymmetry of the design was mirrored in 1939 and from that date the lamp also had a push-button switch in its foot.|$|R
50|$|General and {{industrial}} heavy duty models {{are available for}} gyratory equipment, with wooden frames for general models aiming to save cost. Industrial heavy duty models are constructed with carbon steel or stainless steel. Screen capacities vary with model sizes over a huge range to satisfy individual application requirements such as <b>material</b> <b>size,</b> bulk density, moisture contamination, etc. Models consist up to seven decks with screenings up to 325 meshes, allowing it to perform accurate separations for the finest materials. This feature comes in handy in the powder processing industry where fine powders with relatively close sizes are involved. Screens openings for different decks are to be calculated accurately to ensure accurate separation.|$|E
50|$|Defect types include atom vacancies, adatoms, steps, and kinks which occur most {{frequently}} at surfaces due to finite <b>material</b> <b>size</b> causing crystal discontinuity. What {{all types of}} defects have in common, whether they be surface or bulk, is that they produce dangling bonds which have specific electron energy levels not {{similar to those of}} the bulk. This is because these states cannot be described with periodic Bloch waves due to the change in electron potential energy caused by the missing ion cores just outside the surface. Hence, these are localized states which one must solve the Schrödinger equation for separately such that electron energies can be properly described. The break in periodicity results in a decrease in conductivity due to defect scattering.|$|E
50|$|Also {{available}} is {{real time data}} reporting from any desired location within the comminution circuit. Continuous conveyor belt fragmentation measurements in the comminution plant can provide an instantaneous tool for process control.

The {{cross-section}} of a file can be flat, round, half-round, triangular, square, knife edge or of a more specialized shape. Steel files are made from high carbon steel (1.0 to 1.25% carbon) and may be through hardened or case hardened.|$|R
50|$|Grinding wheel wear is an {{important}} measured factor of grinding in the manufacturing process of engineered parts and tools. Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying {{the surface of a}} workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through conventional machining processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of grinding wheel wear can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the rate of wear of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate wear rate allows for more consistent <b>material</b> <b>size.</b> Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel wear rate which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|Formal {{research}} indicates that earth-air heat exchangers reduce building ventilation air pollution. Rabindra (2004) states, “The tunnel heat exchanger is found not to support the growth of bacteria and fungi; rather it is found to reduce the quantity of bacteria and fungi thus making the air safer for humans to inhale. It is therefore clear {{that the use of}} EAT Air Tunnel not only helps save the energy but also helps reduce the air pollution by reducing bacteria and fungi.” Likewise, Flueckiger (1999) in a study of twelve earth-air heat exchangers varying in design, pipe <b>material,</b> <b>size</b> and age, stated, “This study was performed because of concerns of potential microbial growth in the buried pipes of ground-coupled air systems. The results however demonstrate, that no harmful growth occurs and that the airborne concentrations of viable spores and bacteria, with few exceptions, even decreases after passage through the pipe-system”, and further stated, “Based on these investigations the operation of ground-coupled earth-to-air heat exchangers is acceptable as long as regular controls are undertaken and if appropriate cleaning facilities are available”.|$|E
50|$|The Kahr {{action is}} a Browning locked-breech design {{featuring}} a striker-operated firing pin with a passive firing pin safety, making it a true hammerless action. When the trigger is pulled, the trigger bar begins to rotate a double-lobed cocking cam. This cam simultaneously begins to draw the striker to the rear, compressing the spring behind it, while depressing and deactivating the firing pin block. At {{the end of the}} trigger's travel, the lobe contacting the striker slips off the striker and releases it; the other lobe has, by this point, completely depressed the firing pin block and permitted the striker to snap forward and strike the primer. This single piece takes the place of more complicated and fragile designs employed in other pistols. It is similar in principle, though very different in execution, to the action design of Glocks. It also allows the firing pin block to be located further {{to the rear of the}} slide and therefore further from possible contamination by combustion gases and powder fouling. For this innovation, Justin Moon was awarded one of the five patents he owns on the Kahr pistol design. This system is employed on all Kahr pistols, regardless of frame <b>material,</b> <b>size,</b> or caliber.|$|E
