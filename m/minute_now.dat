25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} norias in Hama suggests they were {{developed during the}} Byzantine era, although none of the norias in Hama today precede the Ayyubid period. However, a mosaic found at Apamea dating to 469 pictures a noria similar to those at Hama, suggesting they may have earlier origins. The surviving norias {{date back to the}} medieval Islamic period, when norias as large as 20 meters in diameter were built, with 120 water collection compartments and capable of raising more than 95 litres of water per <b>minute.</b> <b>Now</b> only 17 norias remain, unused.|$|E
25|$|The bitter {{rivalry between}} the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers {{has been going}} on since the 1970s. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best {{in the history of the}} NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys {{defeated}} the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final <b>minute</b> (<b>now</b> known as The Catch) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are second all time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The all-time series is tied with a record of 17–17–1.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to {{the video}} were mixed. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented it is [...] "more {{thematic}} and thought provoking than the videos for 'Baby Boy' and 'Naughty Girl'", Beyoncé's songs from her debut album, Dangerously in Love. Allhiphop's Eb Haynes described the video [...] "visually fresh" [...] and [...] "couture motivated". A news article published by Hindustan Times reported that a particular scene in the video is suggestive of oral sex. Natalie Y. Moore of In These Times magazine echoed the latter's commentary, writing that the video showcases Beyoncé [...] "strutting her sexuality", and that in Jay-Z's scenes it [...] "looks as if any <b>minute</b> <b>now</b> she'll give him fellatio". [...] The video later appeared {{on a list of}} Yahoo! Music News' Worst Videos of All Time, which pointed to the negative fan reaction and stated, [...] "It's probably the least horrific video listed ... but as far as Beyoncé videos go, it is [...] a stinker." ...|$|E
