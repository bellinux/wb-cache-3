2500|$|Most <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> {{vertebrae}} were compressed sideways, {{especially at}} the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck.</b> A crest (also termed ridge or keel) ran longitudinally along the side <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> vertebrae (a feature typical of elasmosaurids), visible from the third to the fifty-fifth vertebrae, at the hind part <b>of</b> the <b>neck.</b> This crest was positioned at the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the centrum in the front vertebrae, and at {{the upper half of}} the centrum from the 19th vertebra and onwards. The crest would have served to anchor the musculature <b>of</b> the <b>neck.</b> The centra differed in shape depending on the position of the vertebrae in the neck; that of the third vertebra was about {{as long as it was}} broad, but the [...] centra became longer than broad form the fourth vertebra and onwards. The centra became very elongated at the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck,</b> but became shorter again at the back <b>of</b> the <b>neck,</b> with the length and breadth being about equal at the 61th vertebra, and those of the hindmost vertbrae being broader than long. The articular surfaces of the vertebrae in the front <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> were broad oval, and moderately deepened, with rounded, thickened edges, with an excavation (or cavity) at the upper and lower sides. Further back in the front part <b>of</b> the <b>neck,</b> around the 25th, the lower edge of the articular facets became more concave, and the facet shaped like a quadrate with rounded edges. By the 63th vertebra, the articular facet was also quadratic in shape with rounded edges, whereas the centra of the hindmost vertebrae had a broad oval outline.|$|R

30|$|After the {{rearrangement}} of Cu atoms on the {{two sides}} of Ni tip, the thinnest point <b>of</b> Cu <b>neck</b> happens in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> Cu <b>neck,</b> not at the interface as shown in Fig. 5 a. From the stage <b>of</b> <b>necking</b> point formation to the breakage <b>of</b> <b>neck,</b> sawtooth-shaped load is mainly attributed to the shear processes on (111) plane. Displacement vectors of Cu atoms along (111) plane in Fig. 7 b reveal the process of shear behavior near the necking point (corresponding to T–U stage). When the accumulated energy at the necking point reaches to critical value, the homogeneous shear suddenly occurs along (111) slip plane. Shear process is accompanied by the sudden breakage of atomic bonds {{on the two}} sides <b>of</b> <b>necking</b> point (corresponding to load-jump in the load–depth curve) and the decrease of cross-sectional area. Shear slip processes in the necking point also evidently elongate the neck till the neck fracture completely.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the themes}} of Dionysus and Hephaistos are common in the Kleophon Painter’s works, {{one of the best}} {{examples}} of a mythological theme is a painting of Eos and Kephalos, {{in the collection of the}} Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It is an Attic Red Figure vase dating from 430 to 420 BCE, attributed to the Kleophon Painter by John Beazly. The painting is black from the top <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> down to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> with a tongue pattern interrupting the black and red in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck.</b> Below the tongue pattern is a three flower pattern wrapped around the <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the lekythos. The flower pattern extends from the tongue pattern at the thinnest part <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> down to the top of the shoulder. It has one handle (black with red on the inside) that extends the length <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> ending at the shoulder. Wrapped around the shoulder is a red meander pattern interrupted by a saltire pattern every fourth box. Underneath the shoulder is where the main decoration is located. It is a picture of the Titan Eos with her lover, Kephalos. Eos is, in Greek Mythology, the goddess of the dawn. Kephalos was her lover, she can be seen in other vase paintings holding Kephalos who is sometimes painted in the nude. In this painting, both figures are clothed. Eos is identified by her wings and flowing robes. Eos’ eyes are triangular and directed toward Kephalos. Kephalos’ eyes are slightly more circular but still triangular in appearance and face back toward Eos. Eos has many folds on her clothing which are rounded off at the bottom whereas Kleophon has almost no folds in his clothing.|$|R
30|$|In {{agreement}} with experimental results, sawtooth-shaped load characterizes {{the process of}} tip retraction. Two different fracture mechanisms are responsible for load-jump {{at different stages of}} fracture. Initial stage of fracture mainly occurs at the interface between Ni tip and Cu substrate. At this stage, fracture occurs by atomic rearrangement: some Cu atoms are attracted to fill in the vacancy sites of stepped surface of Ni tip while other Cu atoms fall back to the substrate. As neck elongate, fracture occurs in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> Cu <b>neck.</b> Homogeneous shear along one (111) plane over another is the dominant fracture mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The non-breeding colours are similar, but the {{intermediate}} is smaller, with neck length {{a little less}} than body length, a slightly domed head, and a shorter, thicker bill. The great egret has a noticeable kink near the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> its <b>neck,</b> and the top of its longer bill nearly aligns with the flat top of its head. Close up, great egret's gape line extends behind the eye, while {{the intermediate}}'s is less pointed and ends below the eye. The intermediate tends to stalk upright with neck extended forward. The great is more patient, often adopting a sideways-leaning [...] "one-eyed" [...] stance.|$|R
5000|$|Bends {{of one or}} two semitones are {{the most}} common, but skilled players may use bends from three semitones to as many as five or more semitones, as can be heard in the solo played by David Gilmour on the song [...] "Another Brick In the Wall Pt.2" [...] from Pink Floyd's album The Wall. In {{addition}} to the player's skill, the range of a pitch bend is limited to some extent by the type of guitar, material and stiffness of the strings, and area <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> where the bends are played. For example, steel strings bend further in pitch than nylon strings, thin strings further than thick strings, bends in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> further than bends near the nut, etc.|$|R

50|$|The {{eleventh}} or spinal {{accessory nerve}} {{corresponds to a}} line drawn from a point midway between {{the angle of the}} jaw and the mastoid process to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the posterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle and thence across the posterior triangle to the deep surface of the trapezius. The external jugular vein can usually be seen through the skin; it runs in a line drawn from the angle of the jaw to the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the clavicle, and close to it are some small lymphatic glands. The anterior jugular vein is smaller, and runs down about half an inch from the <b>middle</b> line <b>of</b> the <b>neck.</b> The clavicle or collar-bone forms the lower limit <b>of</b> the <b>neck,</b> and laterally the outward slope <b>of</b> the <b>neck</b> to the shoulder is caused by the trapezius muscle.|$|R
30|$|Figure 5 b is {{the atomic}} {{configuration}} when neck finally fractures at a tip–substrate distance of 3.5 nm. A {{large amount of}} Cu atoms are transferred to nickel tip. This {{is due to the}} fact that fracture occurs in the <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neck,</b> not at the interface of Ni tip and Cu substrate. Two holes and a cluster are both observed after neck fracture. It is worth noting that adhesive force leads not only to the damage of the surface of Cu substrate but also to permanent plastic deformation deep in Cu substrate. This kind of plastic deformation is not often observed in MD models.|$|R

25|$|The {{exact number}} of {{vertebrae}} is unknown due to several {{gaps in the}} holotype's spine. The sacrum consisted of 6 fused sacral vertebrae.

40|$|Introduction. Ligature {{strangulation}} {{represents a}} violent mechanical asphyxiation caused by tightening a loop around the victim’s neck, pulled either by an active or passive force. Mechanism {{of death is}} most often due to cerebral hypoxia caused by compression of blood vessels which feed the brain, {{but it can also}} occur either due to compression and closing the air passages or by stimulating the superior laryngeal nerve. Case Report. An 81 -year-old woman was found in her home lying across the couch with a bathrobe belt tied around her neck and a knot at the back side.

As she tripped along with mincing gait, she was speaking confidentially to herself, but when she saw Dite grinning, she seemed, first, afraid, and then sorry for herself, and then she tried to carry it off with a giggle, cocking her head impudently at him. Even then she looked childish, and a faded guilelessness, with many pretty airs and graces, still lingered about her, like innocent birds loath to be gone from the spot where their nest has been. When she had passed monotony again reigned, and Dite crossed to the smithy window, though none of the letters could be for him. He could read the addresses on six of them, but the seventh lay on its back, and every time he rose on his tip-toes to squint down at it, the spout pushed his bonnet over his eyes.|$|R
