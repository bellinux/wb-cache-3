50|$|As the small, {{independent}} motels {{relied on}} the visibility which came with a location {{on the main road}} of their era, business declined. By the 1990s, the 66 Motel was no longer taking overnight travellers and its much-photographed neon signage was deteriorating and no longer functional. The motel survived through <b>monthly</b> <b>rentals</b> as single room occupancy; the original Carty's Camp is still standing but in ruins.|$|R
500|$|In the 1920s, Brundage and {{his company}} became very active in {{constructing}} high-rise apartment buildings in Chicago. He used rapid construction methods, allowing clients to begin realizing income from their investments quickly—the Sheridan-Brompton Apartments (1924) overlooking Lincoln Park, were built in five months, allowing the start of $40,000 in <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> income, offsetting a monthly mortgage payment of $15,000. Often, the Brundage Company {{was involved in the}} ownership of the apartments: 3800 Sheridan Road (1927), a 17-story building costing $3,180,000, was owned by a company which had as its president and treasurer Chester Brundage, Avery's younger brother. It was constructed in eight months, through the Chicago winter, using an onsite concrete mixing plant. This temporary structure also provided office space for the construction. Another source of income for Brundage {{and his company}} was hotel construction, for which he was often paid in part with stock in the new facility. One president of an engineering firm specializing in large structures called Brundage's methods on the Shoreham Hotel [...] "progressive, snappy, [...] up-to-date" [...] and [...] "straightforward and honest".|$|E
2500|$|An {{unfinished}} building languished in {{the neighborhood}} from 2003 to 2009. [...] Originally planned as [...] "Jackson Courtyard Condominiums," [...] the mixed-use building at 1401 Jackson Street features transit oriented development characteristics such as ground-floor retail shop spaces and a dedicated bicycle parking room at street level. [...] For several years, the incomplete project sat partially finished, shrink-wrapped in white plastic sheeting, reminiscent of a condom, hence its local nickname: [...] "Trojan Tower." [...] In September 2008, the shrink-wrap was removed {{for the second time}} from the building. [...] In the summer of 2009, after years of extensive reconstruction work, the building finally received its certificate of occupancy and has been replanned for <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> apartments. [...] Its first residents began moving into the building in August 2009, a full six years after the original developer of the project broke ground.|$|E
60|$|As for Madrono Ranch, Naismith {{owned it}} and had set the price at fifty dollars an acre. That would be one {{thousand}} dollars, for there were twenty acres. As a farming investment, using old-fashioned methods, it was not worth it. As a business investment, yes; for {{the virtues of the}} valley were on the eve of being discovered by the outside world, and no better location for a summer home could be found. As a happiness investment in joy of beauty and climate, it was worth a thousand times the price asked. And he knew Naismith would allow time on most of the amount. Edmund's suggestion was that they take a two years' lease, with option to buy, the rent to apply to the purchase if they took it up. Naismith had done that once with a Swiss, who had paid a <b>monthly</b> <b>rental</b> of ten dollars. But the man's wife had died, and he had gone away.|$|E

3000|$|... [...]. As {{shown in}} (5), {{the price is}} defined as a {{function}} of the total occupied spectrum in the coverage area. This means that when a coverage area becomes congested, the spectrum resource will become scarce and higher price will be charged to gain more revenue. Therefore, the nondecreasing pricing function in (5) can avoid saturation in a wireless network[10]. Furthermore, b ω and η can be set according to specific applications or user preference. For example, the price base b can be the <b>monthly</b> <b>rentals</b> in telecommunication. Then b = 0 for the free access networks such as WiFi. For networks with fixed spectrum assignment, set ω = 0 so that network status is not taken into consideration. The parameter η is useful for random access networks, where the price rises fast with the increase of the occupied spectrum. In this article, for simplicity, set b = 0, ω = 1.0, and η = 1.0 for all networks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Indian mobile {{industry}} has witnessed a dramatic growth. Cheap mobile handsets, affordable airtime rates, low initial cost and affordable <b>monthly</b> <b>rentals</b> {{made it easy}} for anybody to go mobile. As per latest statistics India has around 160 million mobile subscribers. In India where the youth constitute majority of the population a war between the service providers is on to capture this market. Students contribute 50 % of youth population. The objective {{of this study is to}} find the opinion of the student who is already using any of the service provider and the satisfaction level of the service provided. Air Tel, Vodafone, Idea, Cell one are the four companies which are included in study. Primary source: A well structured questionnaire is prepared to know the respondents opinion about the service of their service provider. Secondary Source: Different web sites, company reports, research company’s reports (McKinsey, PWC, etc [...] .). The sample size taken for study is 200. Though the figures show Air Tel has major share in market, study has shown that among student community to which the study is conducted Vodafone has larger share than Air Tel. Reasons like Packages offered by Vodafone are attracting students, which makes it a have a larger share. Services and network of Air Tel is good compare to the other players in the market but it is VODAFONE which offers better packages...|$|R
40|$|Affordable {{rental housing}} is an {{important}} form of housing tenure in urban areas, providing opportunities and choice for households seeking housing. Since 2004, government has recognised this and has extended the choice of tenure options available to very low, low- and medium-income households, particularly in better-located parts of the urban environment (McCarthy, 2010). This {{has resulted in the}} development of government programmes to support the development and strengthening of the rental sector. This study is an attempt to examine the delivery of affordable rental housing in urban areas, with the focus on Johannesburg inner city, and to assess options currently provided by role players in this sector and the constraints that are faced in achieving successful delivery of this accommodation. The study looked at large private and public organisations involved in this market for a comparative analysis of challenges in the affordable rental housing market. Interviews were conducted with key people from the selected organisations in the Johannesburg inner city in order to draw from their experiences of the market. Constraints highlighted by the organisations are; the slow release of buildings for conversion and upgrading into units by the City of Johannesburg, high costs of utilities charged by the City of Johannesburg in the inner city and the <b>monthly</b> <b>rentals</b> defaulting by tenants. As a way forward, it is anticipated that the new Inner City Property Scheme will address the slow release of stock for conversion and upgrading into units. The study recommends that continuous research on affordable rental housing should be done in order to establish innovative ways of dealing with the challenges...|$|R

In 2005, Malaysian Chinese owned 69.4% of the business complexes, 71.9% of all commercial and industrial real estate, as well as 69.3% of all the hotels in Malaysia, reflecting Chinese control over the various business and commercial establishments around the nation.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the issue of}} convergence in the <b>monthly</b> returns, <b>rental</b> growth and yields for 10 market segments in the UK direct real estate market, using principal component analysis, over the period from 1987 to 2014. The principal component approach provides {{an assessment of the}} extent to which the variance of the market segments can be represented by a single common factor, explaining their long-run behaviour, and the degree of independence between the market segments. The results suggest that there is strong evidence of convergence over the entire sample period in relation to monthly returns and yields but less evidence of convergence in rental growth, which confirms the findings in previous studies in international securitised and direct markets markets. There is also an indication that convergence is period-specific and was particularly strong in the period of the Global Financial Crisis. The convergence in returns has crucial implications for investors as it leaves investors exposed to the same structural shocks and so magnifies the importance of volatility spillover effects, limits their ability to create well-diversified portfolios, and make it more difficult for fund managers to outperform the market...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAutomated {{external}} defibrillators (AEDs) {{have been}} rented in various places in Japan. When rental AEDs {{are placed in}} locations where the probability of sudden cardiac arrest is high and permanent placement of AEDs is difficult, the possibility of improving survival rates might increase. In this preliminary study, we investigated how, when, and where rental AEDs {{have been used in}} Japan to clarify their characteristics when used in actual situations and to facilitate better usage in the future. MethodsWe investigated the total number of AEDs rented, the duration of rental of each AED, the total number of AEDs rented <b>monthly,</b> the <b>rental</b> sites, the frequency and location of use, the number of defibrillations, and the time to defibrillation success for devices rented between January 2008 and December 2010 by a single company in Japan. ResultsThe number of AEDs rented annually was 590 at 391 sites in 2008, 767 at 465 sites in 2009, and 847 at 477 sites in 2010. More AEDs were rented during the summer. The devices were actually used on 17 individuals, of whom 2 individuals (at a beach and a marathon) underwent defibrillation, and 1 individual (at a marathon) survived. ConclusionRental AEDs can {{play an important role in}} emergency cases occurring during seasonal and temporary outdoor events. The provision of rental AEDs in locations where permanent AEDs would be unfeasible may offer a useful strategy for efficiently improving survival rates in the future...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Thomson {{was another}} of the first {{residents}} of the building. The epitome of the starving artist, he had been persuaded to quit the Grip Ltd art design agency, take up residence in the Studio Building, and devote his energies, full-time, to his art. MacCallum financially supported Thomson, who initially shared studio 1 with A. Y. Jackson, for the first twelve months. When Jackson left {{to work for the}} government documenting Canadians fighting World War I and Harris departed to be a gunnery instructor, Thomson moved in to share a studio with Franklin Carmichael. When Carmichael married and left a few months later Thomson, still commercially unsuccessful (he would never, in his lifetime, earn enough to make a living from painting alone) could not afford the $22 <b>monthly</b> studio <b>rental</b> fee. There was another factor: Thomson had never really enjoyed working in the city, felt that a studio was [...] "pretentious," [...] and wanted to work in an environment closer to his beloved wilderness settings. His obvious talent was a great inspiration to the other, older artists, and they were unwilling to see their friend move away. MacCallum spent $176 (a considerable sum in those days) to refurbish a workmen's shed {{on the east side of}} the building; it was there, for $1 a month, that Thomson spent his last winters. (Thomson would spend the summers in Algonquin Park as a ranger and fire-fighter and then decamp, during the winter, to Toronto and the Studio Building to work oil sketches made during the summer and fall into full canvases.) ...|$|R
