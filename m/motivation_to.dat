5|$|Benefits Street is a British {{documentary}} series broadcast on Channel 4. It was first aired on 6 January 2014, {{and ran for}} five episodes. The show was filmed by documenting the lives of several residents of James Turner Street, Winson Green, Birmingham, England, United Kingdom, where newspapers including the Daily Mail and The Guardian reported that 90% of the residents claim benefits. It shows benefits claimants committing crimes, including a demonstration of how to shoplift, and portrays {{a situation in which}} people are dependent on welfare payments and lack the <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> seek employment.|$|E

However, {{few studies have}} (a) used robust measurement methodologies to test {{the psychometric properties of}} instruments measuring <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> teach, (b) attempted to measure changes over time in preservice teachers’ <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> teach, or (c) attempted to assess the effects that relevant variables such as age or gender may have on temporal changes in <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> teach. This study sought to address these perceived deficits in the literature. Results indicate that the instrument developed in this study was reliable and valid across two waves of data collection, that preservice teachers’ <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> teach changed across the course of their first semester of teacher education, and that, in some cases, these changes were related to the age of preservice teachers...|$|R

50|$|Intrinsic motivations {{are broken}} down into two categories: enjoyment-based and {{community-based}} motivations. Enjoyment-based <b>motivations</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>motivations</b> related <b>to</b> the fun and enjoyment that contributors experience through their participation. These motivations include: skill variety, task identity, task autonomy, direct feedback from the job, and pastime. Community-based <b>motivations</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>motivations</b> related <b>to</b> community participation, and include community identification and social contact. In crowdsourced journalism, the motivation factors are intrinsic: the crowd is driven by a possibility to make social impact, contribute to social change and help their peers.|$|R

After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had the time or <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> build such a keep during this period.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{a service}} organisation's service {{recovery}} strategies using social media sites. Based on 347 mini-cases from the Twitter accounts {{of a sample}} of major airlines, we conducted qualitative analysis using grounded theory approach. We analysed {{the relationships between the}} three elements of service recovery including customers' <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> complain, service failure types and agent responses. This study offers service providers practical implications to design their recovery strategies. Identification of customers' <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> complain supports the role of social media sites as a complementary service recovery channel and more importantly, as the final defence of an organisation's service recovery system. The investigation on the relationship between customers' <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> complain and service failure types indicates that customers utilise social media sites no differently when different failure types occur. However, different failure types do trigger different sets of agent responses. Further, social media agents respond differently according <b>to</b> customers' <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> complain. service recovery strategy; social media sites; service operations; qualitative analysis...|$|R

Beornwulf's <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E

Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency.

5|$|Engaging in work or an {{assigned}} task {{can generate}} an effective distraction from a reward and enable {{a person to}} wait for a longer delay, as long as the reward is not being flaunted. Having the reward present during work (and easily accessible) creates a negative frustration—akin to teasing—rather than providing motivation. For example, a child who can see other children playing outside while finishing his/her homework will be less motivated to wait for his/her turn for recess. Another factor work and task engagement adds to the delay of gratification is that if the work is interesting and has some reinforcing quality inherent to it, then attention to the reward will reduce work productivity since it becomes a distraction to the work rather than a <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> finish it.|$|E
5|$|Even the Jäger {{battalion}} {{was divided}} {{in the same}} way that the rest of the country was: 450 mostly socialist Jägers remained stationed in Germany as they could have chosen the Red side in the conflict. The leaders of the White Guards faced a similar problem with drafting young men to the army in February 1918: 30,000 obvious supporters of the Finnish labor movement never showed up. It was also uncertain whether common troopers drafted from the small-sized and poor farms of central and northern Finland had strong enough <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> fight the Finnish Reds; the White's propaganda promoted a nationalist war against the Red, Bolshevist Russians, and belittled the significance of the Red Finns.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the commonalities and differences in manufacturers’ <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> servitise. Design/methodology/approach – UK study based on interviews with 40 managers in 25 companies in 12 sectors. Using the concept of product complexity, sectors were grouped using the Complex Products and Systems (CoPS) typology: non-complex products, complex products and systems. Findings – <b>Motivations</b> <b>to</b> servitise were categorised as competitive, demand based (i. e. derived from the customer) or economic. <b>Motivations</b> <b>to</b> servitise vary according to product complexity, although cost savings and improved service quality appear important demand-based motivations for all manufacturers. Non-complex product manufacturers also focus on services to help product differentiation. For CoPS manufacturers, both risk reduction and developing a new revenue stream were important motivations. For uniquely complex product manufacturers, stabilising revenue and increased profitability were strong motivations. For uniquely systems manufacturers, customers sought business transformation, whilst new service business models were also identified. Research limitations/implications – Using the CoPS typology, this study delineates <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> servitise by sector. The findings show varying <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> servitise as product complexity increases, although some motivational commonality existed across all groups. Manufacturers may have products of differing complexity within their portfolio. To overcome this limitation the unit of analysis was the strategic business unit. Practical implications – Managers can reflect on and benchmark their motivation for, and opportunities from, servitisation, by considering product complexity.

5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{concealed}} {{himself by}} the ladies' waiting {{room at the}} Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, from where Garfield was scheduled to depart. Most of Garfield's cabinet planned to accompany him {{at least part of}} the way. Blaine, who was to remain in Washington, came to the station to see him off. The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice, once in the back and once in the arm. The time was 9:30a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station, but was quickly captured. As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield, the assassin's <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting, causing rage against that faction.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions have {{compared}} Raiden and Solid Snake {{as to their}} experiences and ways of thinking. During the game's climax, Raiden stays handcuffed until his final fight against Solidus Snake; Snake escapes from his handcuffs to follow Revolver Ocelot, emphasizing Raiden's lack of freedom. Hideo Kojima compared Raiden and Snake with movie monsters King Kong and Godzilla, respectively; the former was taken from his home and his nature changed upon meeting Rosemary, whereas the latter will continue fighting against mankind's menaces. Defeating Solidus, Raiden is encouraged by Snake to trust himself and believe in his own choices. This is further addressed by the staff's <b>motivation</b> <b>to</b> make a new sequel to Metal Gear without Kojima.

We studied the saving {{behavior}} of a large cross- section of adults to investigate age differences in <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> save across adulthood. Our investigation revealed that both a future oriented mindset as well as adequate financial knowledge may be necessary for younger adults to engage in saving for their retirement. This {{finding is consistent with}} a theoretical account in which younger adults who have long time horizons prioritize preparatory goals and knowledge seeking. As time horizons shorten, <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> realize goals replace <b>motivations</b> <b>to</b> gather knowledge. Accordingly, future oriented attitudes were more directly associated with saving with advancing age, such that future oriented adults who were approaching retirement saved regardless of their level of financial knowledge. Our findings reveal a dynamic character of saving tendencies across adulthood and imply age differences in the psychological factors that motivate saving behavior...|$|R
