5|$|From her <b>medical</b> <b>findings,</b> Scully {{discovers that}} an alien virus {{is keeping the}} abductees alive long enough to cause a radical {{transformation}} to take place, {{similar to the one}} that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner—torn by his decision—decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life-support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner attempting to remove the support. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek {{in the parking lot of}} the FBI building, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car, and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground. Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life-support was incubating the virus and hastening it along, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off life-support, as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize.|$|E

40|$|Medical {{text mining}} has gained {{increasing}} interest in recent years.

The next module is the image feature extraction which is used to extracting the feature for exact match. and the last module which is query analyzer module that is report retrieval module will take user query as a input and will generate the exact match like target image with associated report for the user enter query. the overall evaluation test is good. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the risk factors which affect the consecutive onset of throwing shoulder injury of a collegiate baseball team, and to calculate regression formula which could predict the future onset. Prospective study. The subjects are 69 asymptomatic collegiate baseball players. We executed medical checkups and investigated who got throwing shoulder injury during this year. We did logistic regression analysis with the <b>medical</b> checkup <b>findings</b> and the data of the onset and found out the factors which significantly affected the onset. We also calculated Odds ratio of these factors and regression formula which predict the probability of the onset of throwing shoulder injury and evaluated the validity of regression model. 52 %(36 / 69 cases) of the players suffered throwing shoulder injury during this year. Among the <b>medical</b> checkup <b>findings</b> of asymptomatic phase, pitcher and catcher, past history of throwing shoulder injury, abnormality of scapula-humeral rhythm, heel-buttock distance were thought to be the risk factors which were near-related to the onset of throwing shoulder injury. We calculated regression formula using the <b>medical</b> checkup <b>findings</b> of asymptomatic phase and we could predict the onset of throwing shoulder injury with 82. 5 % accuracy. In order to prevent this injury, the method used in this study could be useful for field players to predict the onset of throwing shoulder injury...|$|R
