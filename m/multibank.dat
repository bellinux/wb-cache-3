40|$|As {{the number}} of {{instructions}} executed in parallel increases, superscalar processors will require higher bandwidth from data caches. Because of the very high cost of true multi-ported caches, alternative cache designs must be evaluated. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the data cache bandwidth requirements of high-degree superscalar processors, and investigate alternative solutions. The designs studied range from classic solutions like <b>multibanked</b> caches to more complex solutions recently proposed in the literature. The performance tradeoffs of these different cache designs are examined in details. Then, using a chip area cost model, all solutions are compared with respect to both cost and performance. While many cache designs seem capable of achieving high cache bandwidth, the best cost/performance tradeoff varies significantly depending on the dedicated area cost, ranging from <b>multibanked</b> cache designs to hybrid multi-banked/multi-ported caches or even true multi-ported caches [...] ...|$|R

Despite the lack of locality, we show how a cache can reduce the required memory capacity and limit the amount of expensive <b>multibanking.</b> Results of simulation experiments using contemporary routing tables show that the architecture scales well, at least up to 16 processors, and that the presence of a small on-chip cache increases throughput significantly, up to 65 % over an architecture with the same number of processors but without a cache, all while reducing the amount of required off-chip memory. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Several Chip-Multiprocessor designs today {{leverage}} tightly-coupled computing clusters as {{a building}} block. These clusters {{consist of a}} fairly large number N of simple cores, featuring fast communication through a shared <b>multibanked</b> L 1 data memory and ≈ 1 Instruction-Per-Cycle (IPC) per core. Thus, aggregated I-fetch bandwidth approaches f ∗ N, where f is the cluster clock frequency. An effective instruction cache architecture is key to support this I-fetch bandwidth. In this paper we compare two main architectures for instruction caching targeting tightly coupled CMP clusters: (i) private instruction caches per core and (ii) shared instruction cache per cluster. We developed a cycle-accurate model of the tightly coupled cluster with several configurable architectural parameters for exploration, plus a programming environment targeted at ef-ficient data-parallel computing. We conduct an in-depth study of the two architectural templates based {{on the use of}} both synthetic microbenchmarks and real program workloads.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} how to design a Store Buffer (STB) well suited to first-level <b>multibanked</b> data caches. Our goal is to forward data from {{in-flight}} stores to dependent loads with the latency of a cache bank. For that we propose a particular two-level STB design in which forwarding is done speculatively from a distributed first-level STB made of extremely small banks, while a centralized, second-level STB enforces correct store-load ordering a few cycles later. To that end we have identified several important design decisions: i) delaying allocation of first-level STB entries until stores execute, ii) deallocating first-level STB entries before stores commit, and iii) selecting a recovery policy well-matched to data forwarding misspeculations. Moreover, the two-level STB admits two enhancements that simplify the design leaving performance almost unchanged: i) removing the data forwarding capability from the second-level STB, and ii) not checking instruction age in first-level STB prior to forwarding data to loads. Following our guidelines and running SPECint- 2 K over an 8 -way out-of-order processor, a two-level STB (first level with four STB banks of 8 entries each) performs similarly to an ideal, single-level STB with 128 -entry banks working at the first-level cache latency. 1...|$|R

40|$|Java {{has been}} widely adopted {{as one of the}} {{software}} platforms for the seamless integration of diverse computing devices. Over the last year, there has been great momentum in adopting Java technology in devices such as cellphones, PDAs, and pagers where optimizing energy consumption is critical. Since, traditionally, the Java virtual machine (JVM), the cornerstone of Java technology, is tuned for performance, taking into account energy consumption requires reevaluation, and possibly redesign of the virtual machine. This motivates us to tune specific components of the virtual machine for a battery-operated architecture. As embedded JVMs are designed to run {{for long periods of time}} on limited-memory embedded systems, creating and managing Java objects is of critical importance. The garbage collector (GC) is an important part of the JVM responsible for the automatic reclamation of unused memory. This article shows that the GC is not only important for limited-memory systems but also for energy-constrained architectures. This article focuses on tuning the GC to reduce energy consumption in a <b>multibanked</b> memory architecture. Tuning the GC is important not because it consumes a sizeable portion of overall energy during execution, but because it influences the energy consumed in the memory during application execution. In particular, we present a GC-controlled leakage energy optimization techniqu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} how to design a Store Buffer (STB) well suited to first-level <b>multibanked</b> data caches. The goal is to forward data from {{in-flight}} stores into dependent loads within the latency of a cache bank. Taking into account the store lifetime in the processor pipeline and the data forwarding behavior, we propose a particular two-level STB design in which forwarding is done speculatively from a distributed first-level STB made of extremely small banks, whereas a centralized, second-level STB enforces correct store-load ordering. Besides, the two-level STB admits two simplifications that leave performance almost unchanged. Regarding the second-level STB, we suggest to remove its data forwarding capability, while for the first-level STB, it is possible to: 1) remove the instruction age checking and 2) compare only the less significant address bits. Experimentation covers both integer and floating point codes executing in dynamically scheduled processors. Following our guidelines and running SPEC- 2 K over an 8 -way processor, a two-level STB with four 8 -entry banks in the first level performs similar to an ideal, single-level STB with 128 -entry banks working at the first-level cache latency. Also, we show that the proposed two-level design is suitable for a memory-latency-tolerant processor. Index Terms—Cache memories, computer architecture, memory architecture, pipeline processing.

40|$|The {{application}} of the Basel 2 rules regarding credit risk management highlights the problem of constructing the ratings’ criteria, and, in particular, the credit risk assessment methodology used. The latter regards both that adopted in the scoring, if used in the bank, and the one supplied directly in the analyst’s judgment. The Italian financial actors have strongly debated {{the topic of the}} ratings’ application, with considerably opposing views, based more on the topic of credit rationing danger than the quality of customer relationships. In a country such as Italy, that has years of experience in <b>multibanking</b> and weak customer relationships, little or no {{attention has been paid to}} the quality of the data used for loan analysis. Above all, however, even less attention has been paid to the methodological approaches and the relative techniques adopted. In this paper the methodological soundness and the capability of highlighting/forecasting enterprise crises have been verified by making reference to two different analytical approaches. The first one is based on the instruments traditionally used by Italian banks (static analysis with the use of ratios) and the second one constructed on the methodology of cash flow analysis (dynamic analysis). The aim of the latter is to measure the evolution of an enterprise’s financial requirements. The two models have been verified using a sample of 480 enterprises, half of which were subjected to bankruptcy proceedings and the other half in bonis. The empirical research has been carried out using a typical company-minded approach, given that the analysis techniques for the appraisal of creditworthiness mainly adopt such a matrix. The present paper presents the initial findings which resulted from the use of statistical analysis tools, confirming other authors’ conclusions on the ratio analysis still dominant in the banking praxis, and showing its total unreliability. Although the use of dynamic models allows the measurement of the nature and causes of an enterprise’s financial requirements, it cannot determine with precision the reasons behind businesses’ financial troubles. In fact, the analysis has revealed very different enterprise behaviour on the eve of the crises, originating from motivations which cannot be defined according to pre-existing schemas. At the same time the Italian system quite often 2 neglects certain ratios which could provide extremely relevant information. First of all those regarding sector analysis and those referring to cash flow measures and determinants, in particular the operating income and the changes in net working capital. In general, the initial findings of the study have highlighted both the necessity for further efforts involving multivariate statistical analysis, as well as increased efforts in identifying the dynamic models, where the latter are used with the aim of delineating a trend and are not limited to static valuation. This conclusion once again confirms the necessity for lending banks to invest in the quality of relations and in the continuous monitoring of the aforesaid...|$|R

The He 219B wing was also to have had an increased span of 22.06 m (72.38 ft), for better high altitude performance. The Jumo 222 did not reach production status, with just under 300 examples built in at least three differing displacement sizes. Only a few test machines were ever fitted for the engines; some additional airframes were built with the enlarged wing.

50|$|The VD-4K, {{originally}} {{designated as}} the M-253K, was a development of the post-war VD-3TK (M-251K) engine. Like Nazi Germany's experimental Junkers Jumo 222 <b>multibank</b> wartime engine, but in a larger displacement figure — at nearly 59.5 litres — than any planned or tested development of the German powerplant, the VD-4K had six monobloc banks, each with four liquid-cooled cylinders. Three blow-down exhaust, also known as power-recovery, turbines were fitted between the cylinder banks, and a geared centrifugal supercharger and a turbocharger were fitted to the engine itself, which made the VD-4K a turbo-compound engine.|$|E
5000|$|Design {{work on the}} Jumo 222 {{started in}} 1937. The engine was {{configured}} with six inline cylinder banks spaced at equal angles around the crankcase, each bank having four cylinders. The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement — this was evident from a cross-sectional drawing of the original version, using a master connecting rod with five additional conrods pivoted from the master rod's crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial — but the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines. Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a [...] "nose-on" [...] view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60° equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the [...] "60°, 180° & 300°" [...] spaces) and intake ports (at the [...] "0°, 120° & 240°" [...] spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler [...] "plumbing" [...] from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers. The trio of exhaust header sets would have been most likely present {{at the bottom of}} an engine nacelle, and on the upper quarters to either side (appearing like the exhausts for many Allied [...] "upright" [...] V-style aviation engines) for the shortest possible exhaust outlet routing. The four-cylinder-long <b>multibank</b> design also engendered a shorter (by roughly 80 cm/31 in), larger cross-section cylindrical nacelle design somewhat like the Ju 88A used (and in comparison to them), which could still use an enlarged-diameter variety of annular radiator to cool the 222's cylinders and motor oil, and which for the Junkers Ju 288, intended to use pairs of the in-house <b>multibank</b> powerplants (spinning their propellers in opposing directions, like the He 177A), mounting each annular radiator directly ahead of a Jumo 222's <b>multibank</b> crankcase (as with the Jumo 211s used on the Ju 88A) and using hollow ducted spinners with each of its four-blade propellers, to pass the air rearwards into the annular radiators.|$|E
