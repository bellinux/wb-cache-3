5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. <b>Minutes</b> <b>later</b> <b>he</b> re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Bostwick scored in Stevenage's 2–1 {{pre-season}} victory at Dagenham & Redbridge on 30 July 2011. A week later, he started in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture, a 0–0 draw against Exeter City. Three days after the draw, on 9 August, Bostwick scored his first goal of the campaign in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Championship team Peterborough United, scoring with a 25-yard shot that took the match to extra-time. In Stevenage's next league fixture, a 1–1 draw away at Chesterfield, he was sent-off after receiving two yellow cards, resulting in a one-match suspension. Bostwick signed a two-year contract extension with the club on 26 August 2011.

Bostwick was also instrumental in the club's 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on 26 December, scoring one goal and assisting another. His goal restored Stevenage's two-goal cushion in the match on the hour mark, before he assisted Scott Laird from a well-worked free-kick routine ten <b>minutes</b> <b>later.</b> <b>He</b> beat his goal tally from the previous season when he scored his fourth goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 4–2 victory against Milton Keynes Dons at Broadhall Way on 24 January 2012, with Bostwick restoring parity in the first-half with a long-range strike. Bostwick also scored in a 2–2 draw against Huddersfield Town on 28 February 2012, heading in Joel Byrom's cross to half the deficit as Stevenage fought back to earn a point after being two goals down.

During his successful four seasons with the club, Bostwick made 207 appearances, scoring 22 goals.|$|E
