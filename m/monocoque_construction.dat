5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started {{developing a}} new generation of all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft. The French Dewoitine D.520 and Germany's Messerschmitt Bf 109, for example, were designed to take advantage of new techniques of <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> and the availability of new high-powered, liquid-cooled, in-line aero engines. They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} swept wing all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
25|$|An all <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> {{derivative}} of the Spitfire with, pop-up headlamps, named the Triumph Fury was proposed {{with a single}} prototype being built.|$|E

The chassis structure in semi <b>monocoque</b> chassis <b>construction</b> is different from the one in separated body. Commonly, the chassis frame in separated body is in the shape of perimeter, which forms like frame around the underneath edge of the vehicle, and the body of vehicle is put on the frame. While the chassis structure in semi <b>monocoque</b> chassis <b>construction</b> is constructed in such way that forms a unification which is supporting each other between the frame part and the platform of the vehicle's body...|$|R

25|$|The AMC AMX-GT is {{concept car}} {{developed}} by American Motors Corporation (AMC) for the 1968 show car circuit. The {{design of the}} grand touring-type rear-wheel drive pillarless coupe of <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> with two doors and a truncated rear end treatment was influenced by AMC stylist Richard A. Teague.|$|E
25|$|Built principally from GFRP the B12 uses <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> {{avoiding}} {{the use of}} a welded steel-tube core structure, maximising the volume available for crew accommodation and payloads such as research instrumentation. The cockpit seats two in tandem under large plexiglas canopies with the instructor seat, in the rear, set at a higher level to improve his forward view.|$|E
25|$|The first 13 {{examples}} {{appeared in}} spring 1946, and revealed their aeronautical background. In the first examples, one can recognize the typical aircraft technology. Attention to aerodynamics {{is evident in}} all the design, in particular on the tail. It {{was also one of}} the first vehicles to use <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> (where the body is an integral part of the chassis).|$|E
50|$|It {{was used}} as the {{covering}} for the de Havilland Mosquito a pioneer of wooden <b>monocoque</b> airframe <b>construction</b> in military aircraft, as well as in other aircraft, where it was tautened and stiffened with aircraft dope.|$|R
50|$|Self-supporting <b>monocoque</b> steel <b>construction</b> made of {{seamless}} {{square steel}} tubes, electrically welded. Exterior roof and side wall panels are of double galvanized steel, sealed to the skeleton {{with a combination}} of spot welding and gluing. Stainless steel wheelhousings and stepwells.|$|R
40|$|AbstractResults of {{systematic}} numerical studies are presented which suggest that suitable alternative wall constructions {{may lead to}} elastic load-carrying capacities of light-weight structures which significantly exceed those of conventional <b>monocoque</b> <b>constructions,</b> and that in certain cases this improvement may also {{be accompanied by a}} decrease in imperfection-sensitivity. Two kinds of wall modifications are considered: a hybrid wall construction where the skin of a light-weight structure is coated with a low-density material, and nonhomogeneous – in particular lattice and biaxially corrugated – wall constructions. The paper focuses on the elastic load-carrying behavior of shell- and plate-like structures, and structural efficiency is assessed {{on the basis of their}} bifurcation buckling resistance while other design criteria, such as e. g. stiffness and plasticity, are not taken into account...|$|R
25|$|The {{single side}} door, {{which had been}} {{introduced}} to around 6½ per cent of Mark B production vehicles after November 1951, became a standard fixture on the Mark C. Because the car's <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> depended principally upon its skin for rigidity, the size of door was severely limited and to overcome the resulting decrease in structural rigidity, vertical steel strengthening brackets were fitted either side and along the bottom edge of the door aperture.|$|E
25|$|The Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in Chittaranjan makes {{electric}} locomotives. The Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi makes diesel locomotives. The Integral Coach Factory in Perambur, Chennai makes integral coaches. These have a <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> and {{the floor}} is an integral unit with the undercarriage. The Rail Coach Factory in Kapurthala also makes coaches. The Rail Wheel Factory at Yelahanka, Bangalore and Rail Wheel Plant, Bela, Chhapra, Bihar manufactures wheels and axles, Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works, Patiala upgrade the WDM-2 Diesel loco from 2600hp to 3100hp. Some electric locomotives have been supplied by BHEL, Jhansi and Palakkad, and locomotive components are manufactured in several other plants around the country.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
5000|$|Heavier. Compared to a {{traditional}} diamond frame consisting of two near-triangles, open or step-through frame designs must be designed with thicker gauge tubing, the use of additional gusseting members, and/or <b>monocoque</b> frame <b>construction.</b> These structural elements may add weight or cost over {{a traditional}} diamond design.|$|R
50|$|The Darrian was {{a revival}} of the {{original}} Davrian in the old factory. The body was considerably modified and the car became mid-engined. Like the Davrian, the Darrian is built using a glass-fibre composite <b>monocoque</b> body <b>construction.</b> The engine was usually from a Ford, but the Rover V8 or Vauxhall 16-valve units were options.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the Classes 59 and 66 (solid girder underframe) the Class 60s have a <b>monocoque</b> {{stressed}} skin <b>construction</b> with diagonal trusses - with the external bodywork providing {{support for the}} internal components.|$|R
25|$|The Daimler Majestic DF316/7 and DF318/9 luxury saloon was {{launched}} by the Daimler Company of Coventry in July 1958 and was in production until 1962. Edward Turner had been appointed Chief Executive of BSA Automotive in 1957 and promised new products, this car was to carry his new V8 engine still under development. The six-cylinder, four-door saloon, with new three-speed Borg Warner automatic transmission, power steering and vacuum-servo assisted four-wheel disc brakes was mechanically up-to-date for its time, {{but it had a}} heavy coachbuilt body of outdated construction on a separate chassis which kept the car's mass well above more modern designs and made it difficult to manoeuvre, despite the modern steering. The styling was already becoming outdated when the car appeared and became increasingly dated as lighter cars with <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> appeared during the Majestic's production run.|$|E
2500|$|Crossover SUVs {{are derived}} from an {{automobile}} platform using a <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> with light off-road capability and lower ground clearance than SUVs. They may be styled similar to conventional [...] "off-roaders", or may be look similar to an estate car or station wagon.|$|E
2500|$|The era {{also saw}} the first use of <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> first seen in Eugene Ruchonnet's Aero-Cigare and notably used in the Deperdussin Monocoque of 1912, which won the Gordon Bennett race in both 1912 and 1913. [...] Another {{structurally}} advanced and influential (although unsuccessful) aircraft was the Antoinette Monobloc, {{which was the first}} monoplane to have a cantilever wing without any external bracing wires.|$|E
5000|$|From the 1920s General Motors {{and others}} started buying up {{streetcar}} systems across the United States {{with a view}} to replacing them with buses in {{what became known as the}} Great American Streetcar Scandal. This was accompanied by a continuing series of technical improvements: pneumatic [...] "balloon" [...] tires during the early 1920s, <b>monocoque</b> body <b>construction</b> in 1931, automatic transmission in 1936, diesel engines in 1936, 50+ passengers in 1948, and air suspension in 1953.|$|R

25|$|The Grand Cherokee thus {{became the}} first Chrysler-badged Jeep product. Development work for the new Jeep model {{continued}} and Chrysler's employees (after the 1987 buyout of AMC) were eager for a late-1980s release date; however, CEO Lee Iacocca was pushing for redesigned Chrysler minivans, thus delaying the Grand Cherokee's release until late-1992 as an Explorer competitor. Unlike the Explorer, the Grand Cherokee utilized <b>monocoque</b> (unibody) <b>construction,</b> whereas the Explorer was a derivative of the Ranger pickup with a separate body-on-frame.|$|R
2500|$|By the early-mid-1930s, de Havilland had a {{reputation}} for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer. The later DH.91 Albatross airliner pioneered the composite wood construction used for the Mosquito. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at [...] at , [...] faster than the Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing. The wooden <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time.|$|E
2500|$|The E-4 {{included}} numerous innovations, {{including its}} all-metal <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> onboard facilities such as lavatory, kitchen and radio communications, {{as well as}} its notable and sturdy monoplane load-bearing box-girder wing constructed of dural metal which formed both the wing's main girder and the structure of the wing itself. [...] Skinned with thin sheets of dural metal to give the aerofoil shape necessary for a wing, the girder section wing had fabric covered leading and trailing edges attached to it. This superb and innovative wing was robust and self-supporting.|$|E
2500|$|The Messerschmitt [...] Bf 109 is a German World War II fighter {{aircraft}} {{that was the}} backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War and was still in service {{at the dawn of the}} jet age at the end of World War II in 1945. It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction,</b> a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine.|$|E
5000|$|The new AMC cars {{incorporated}} numerous engineering solutions. Among {{these was}} curved side glass, {{one of the}} earliest popular-priced cars with this feature. Another engineering breakthrough was combining separate parts in the <b>monocoque</b> (unit <b>construction)</b> body into single stampings. One example was the [...] "uniside" [...] door surround that was made from a single stamping of steel. Not only did it replace 52 parts and reduce weight and assembly costs, it also increased structural rigidity and provided for better fitting of the doors.|$|R
25|$|The {{design has}} a <b>monocoque</b> (unibody) <b>construction</b> with four-wheel {{independent}} air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained off-road abilities while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|R
50|$|The Impuls concept {{consisted}} of a 2-seat FAR-23 certified aircraft, propelled by an engine in a pusher configuration. Other distinctive characteristics were the two tail booms and the large windows ensuring a broad view. Materials characterising the Impuls, were the in the beginning 1990s {{state of the art}} glass fibre composite used in wings, tail booms and outer fuselage shell. The inner fuselage however, still {{consisted of}} a load carrying steel inner frame as <b>monocoque</b> composite <b>constructions</b> were still very rare back in the ‘90’s.|$|R
2500|$|Crossover (or CUV): A loose {{marketing}} term {{to describe}} a vehicle that blends features of a SUV with features of a car — especially forgoing the body on frame construction of the SUV {{in favor of the}} [...] car's unibody or <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction.</b> Crossovers usually borrow drivetrains and other parts from traditional cars in the same manufacturer's line. Crossovers typically employ an FF layout or an FF-based four-wheel drive layout with a transverse engine, rather than an FR layout or an FR-based 4WD layout with a longitudinal engine as is typically used on traditional truck-based SUVs.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the roof panel. The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the {{contemporary}} Spitfire used all-metal <b>monocoque</b> <b>construction</b> and was thus both lighter and stronger, though less tolerant to bullet damage. With its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane remained {{in use in}} theatres of operations where reliability, easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance, typically in roles like ground attack. One of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the Hurricane and the Spitfire were also {{to be used as}} night fighters. The Hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night, and shot down several German aircraft on night raids. From early 1941 the Hurricane was also used as an [...] "intruder" [...] aircraft, patrolling German airfields in France at night to catch bombers taking off or landing.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{and wings}} are of <b>monocoque</b> stressed skin <b>construction.</b> The wings include plain flaps and differential ailerons and are stressed to +4.4 and -2.2 g. The wings are removable by withdrawing three bolts. The control surfaces {{are made from}} aluminum tubing, are fabric covered and actuated by pushrods.|$|R
2500|$|All Rebels {{came with}} a manual (with {{overdrive}} unit) or GM's four-speed Hydra-Matic automatic transmission, {{as well as other}} performance enhancements such as a dual exhaust system, heavy-duty suspension with Gabriel (brand) shock absorbers, and front sway bar. The Rebel was capable of 0 to 60mph (0-97 km/h) acceleration in just 7.5 seconds with its standard [...] carbureted engine. The car's light <b>monocoque</b> (unibody) <b>construction</b> afforded a power-to-weight ratio of about 13pounds per horsepower, a better ratio than other 1957 model year automobiles and a contrast to Volkswagen's 45.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{retained}} the [...] "Olympia" [...] name, originally applied in 1935 to the predecessor model {{in anticipation of}} the 1936 Olympic Games. The Olympia had been a defining model for Opel, featuring then revolutionary <b>monocoque</b> body <b>construction,</b> and intended to be produced in huge numbers {{at a time when the}} national economy was finally seen to be on a sustained upswing. Adding the name [...] "Rekord" [...] in 1953 built on the theme of sporting success, and reflected a spirit of optimism which the model's marketplace performance would justify.|$|R
