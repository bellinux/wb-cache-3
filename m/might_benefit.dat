5|$|Many {{believe that}} person <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and {{not based on}} good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who {{are not eligible for}} surgery. This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given in a short time period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E

Wide replacement of annual with perennial plants on agricultural landscapes could stabilize soils and reduce nitrate leaching {{to the point}} that the delivery of sediment and dissolved nitrogen to downstream landscapes could be reduced. Farmers in these areas may currently rely on these nutrient inputs. On the other hand, other water usage sectors <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from improved water quality.|$|E

This {{is based on the}} JUPITER trial that found that elevated CRP levels without hyperlipidemia benefited. Statins were selected because they have been proven to reduce levels of CRP. Studies comparing effect of various statins in hs-CRP revealed similar effects of different statins. A subsequent trial however failed to find that CRP was useful for determining statin benefit.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} pointed out that Paulson's plan could {{potentially}} have some conflicts of interest, since Paulson was a former CEO of Goldman Sachs, a firm that <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> largely from the plan. Economic columnists called for more scrutiny of his actions. Questions remain about Paulson's interest, despite having no direct financial interest in Goldman, since he had sold his entire stake in the firm prior to becoming Treasury Secretary, pursuant to ethics law.|$|E
25|$|Credit default swaps {{have also}} faced {{criticism}} that they {{contributed to a}} breakdown in negotiations during the 2009 General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization, because certain bondholders <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from the credit event of a GM bankruptcy due to their holding of CDSs.

25|$|A {{group of}} psychologists {{conducted}} a study to test the McGurk effect with Aphasia patients and speech reading. The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed {{the first part of}} the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from learning how to speech read (lip reading).|$|E
25|$|One of the {{mechanisms}} for compensation {{is impossible for}} this problem: mitigation <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> future generations {{at the expense of}} current generations, but {{there is no way that}} future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation. On the other hand, should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change, compensation to them would not be possible. Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations. If, for example, some countries were to benefit from future climate change but others lose out, there is no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers; similarly, if some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out, there would likewise be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers.|$|E
25|$|The Convention {{featured}} fierce debates, {{the arguments}} raged throughout Virginia {{in the press}} and they were widely reported nationally. Direct popular election of governor was supported by Whig Congressman John Minor Botts. He was opposed by Richmond Junta Democrat Richard L.T. Beale who argued against the natural equality of all men, and the “plundering propensities” of the multitude seeking a “majority of mere numbers”. Although for direct election of Governor, Henry A. Wise was more fearful of the eastern slave-holders loss of control in the General Assembly. He believed that “protection of slavery, not the liberalizing of Virginia’s Constitution, was the most significant business before the convention.” Albert G. Pendleton suggested that nearly 100,000 citizens of the western counties were disenfranchised by the 1830 Constitution, and that malapportionment led to the lack of internal improvements needed in west. Muscoe R.H. Garnett opposed expanding the franchise to prohibit internal improvements that <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> the western counties. James Barbour objected to extending the franchise to white westerners because support for outright emancipation had originated from there in the past. Even with proposals for freed slave expatriation to Africa, Barbour doubted any assurances from the west for the long run preservation of slavery.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{estimate}} the degree of import and consumer prices exchange rate pass-through for sukuk issuing OIC member countries. Exchange rate pass-through is estimated based on recursive vector autoregresion (VAR) model. Data are yearly covering the period 1970 - 2010 and are sourced from International Financial Statistics and SESRIC database. The findings indicate that import and consumer prices pass-through increases in the long horizon in the case of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Other countries reported low degree of both import and consumer prices pass-through with no discernible patterns. Policymakers and investors <b>might</b> <b>benefits</b> from the findings since pass-through estimates indicate inflation and exchange rate risk exposure particularly for intra-OIC cross-border sukuk issuance...|$|R

500|$|Spotswood had {{obtained}} from Howard valuable information on Teach's whereabouts, and {{he planned to}} send his forces {{across the border into}} North Carolina to capture him. [...] He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor—Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore. [...] He also wrote to the Lords of Trade, suggesting that the Crown <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> financially from Teach's capture. [...] Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away. [...] He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS Pearl and HMS Lyme to travel overland to Bath. [...] Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS Pearl was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea. [...] An extra incentive for Teach's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.|$|E
500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com {{said that with}} regard to issues of sexual {{orientation}} and homophobia, Babbit is preaching to the converted. Cynthia Fuchs, for NitrateOnline.com, agreed, stating that [...] "no one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film" [...] and that [...] "the audience who <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the point." [...] David Edelstein said that the one sidedness of the film creates a lack of dramatic tension and calls it lazy counterpropaganda. In contrast, LaSalle said that [...] "the picture manages to make a heartfelt statement about the difficulties of growing up gay" [...] and Timothy Shary said that the film openly challenges homophobia and offers support to teenaged gay viewers. Chris Holmlund said that the film shows that queer identity is multi-faceted, using as an example the scene where the ex-ex-gays tell Megan {{that there is no}} one way to be a lesbian.|$|E
500|$|Arriving in Britain in late July, he {{consulted}} with former Confederate agents there and arranged communication with his wife, then in Canada. Re-crossing the Atlantic, he was {{reunited with his}} wife and all of his children except Clifton in Toronto on September 13, 1865. The family spent the winter in Toronto, living first in a hotel and then in a rented house. There were quite a number of other Confederate exiles in the city. It was enough, according to Mrs. Breckinridge, [...] "to form quite a pleasant society among ourselves." [...] The family moved to Niagara in May. In August, doctors advised Breckinridge's wife that the climate of France <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> her ailing health. Cabell Breckinridge returned to the U.S. to engage in business ventures with his brother Clifton, and Mary, just 12 years old, was sent to live with relatives in New York. The remainder of the family journeyed to Europe, where the children attended school in Paris, Versailles, and Vevey, Switzerland. From mid-1866 to early 1868, Breckinridge toured Europe – including visits to Germany, Austria, Turkey, Greece, Syria, Egypt, and the Holy Land; because of her poor health, his wife remained in France until February 1868, when she joined him in Naples, Italy. During their tour of Italy, Breckinridge met with Pope Pius IX in Rome, and also visited Pompeii.|$|E

[...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what you think it is.

500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Governor Eden was {{certainly}} embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina, and Spotswood disavowed himself of {{any part of}} the seizure. [...] He defended his actions, writing to Lord Carteret, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he <b>might</b> <b>benefit</b> from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. [...] He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden [...] "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. [...] Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. [...] By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. [...] Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. [...] Eden doubtless shared the same view. [...] As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. [...] Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. [...] Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents. [...] This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. [...] Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses. [...] He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. [...] The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. [...] The board found Knight innocent of all charges. [...] He died later that year.|$|E
