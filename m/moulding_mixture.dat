Although, chemically bonded moulding materials have relatively good flexibility, their high temperature behaviour determines the dimensional accuracy, the stresses in the castings and can induce several casting defects, such as rattail, veining, etc. The phenomenon is based on two major effects: the thermal expansion of the unbonded foundry sands and the deformation of the sand mixtures. The main objective of the present work was to study {{the relationship between these}} two effects, and to improve the knowledge related to the thermo-mechanical interactions between the casting and the mould.

40|$|The {{phenolic}} urethane cold-box (PUCB) {{process was}} first introduced to the foundry industry in the late 1960 s. Since then, it {{has become one of}} the most popular methods to make foundry purpose sand moulds and cores, utilized in the manufacturing of aluminium and cast iron cast components. The factors to be considered, affecting the general performance of a PUCB <b>moulding</b> <b>mixture,</b> are the temperature of sand, the moisture content, the mixing conditions, etc. Moreover, there are variable production parameters such as binder level, to improve certain properties of the mould and/or the core based on their specific area of application. These are mainly mechanical properties such as tensile or splitting strength. They have significant influences on the behaviour of the moulding material and are usually tested at room temperature. Although the production phases of the PUCB system are refined to a high extent today, the effect of binder content on the quality of the mould/core and the final casting should be supported by new approaches also in thermal sciences, interpreted in high-temperature environment. In this work, different PUCB mixtures were produced to evaluate the effect of various binder levels on the thermophysical properties of sand cores. Thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis and a novel application of Fourier thermal analysis were used to study the decomposition processes of the PUCB mixture and to reveal the impact of binder level on the heat absorption (cooling) capacity of sand cores at temperatures relevant in the manufacturing of cast iron parts (1300  ±  10  °C) ...|$|E

40|$|Moulding sands {{containing}} {{sodium silicate}} (water-glass) {{belong to the}} group of porous mixture with low resistance to increased humidity. Thanks to hydrophilic properties of hardened or even overheated binder, possible is application of effective methods of hydrous reclamation consisting in its secondary hydration. For the same reason (hydrophilia of the binder), moulds and foundry cores made of high-silica moulding sands with sodium silicate are susceptible to the action of components of atmospheric air, including the contained steam. This paper presents results of a research on the effect of (relative) humidity on mechanical and technological properties of microwave-hardened <b>moulding</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Specimens of the moulding sand containing 1. 5 wt% of sodium water-glass with module 2. 5 were subjected, in a laboratory climatic chamber, to long-term action of steam contained in the chamber atmosphere. Concentration of water in atmospheric air was stabilized for 28 days (672 h) according to the relative humidity parameter that was ca. 40 %, 60 % and 80 % at constant temperature 20 °C. In three cycles of the examinations, the specimens were taken out from the chamber every 7 days (168 h) and their mechanical and technological parameters were determined. It was found on the grounds of laboratory measurements that moulds and cores hardened with microwaves are susceptible to action of atmospheric air and presence of water (as steam) intensifies action of the air components on glassy film of sodium silicate. Microwave-hardened moulding sands containing sodium silicate may be stored on a long-term basis in strictly determined atmospheric conditions only, at reduced humidity. In spite of a negative effect of steam contained in the air, the examined <b>moulding</b> <b>mixtures</b> maintain a part of their mechanical and technological properties, so the moulds and foundry cores stored in specified, controlled conditions could be still used in manufacture...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the research results of using an innovative method {{to reclaim the}} waste moulding sands containing water glass. Two of the examined processes are connected with "dry" or "wet" activation of inorganic binder in waste <b>moulding</b> sand <b>mixtures</b> physically hardened by microwave radiation. The sand mixtures consisting of high-silica sand and water-glass with average molar module 2. 5, were subjected to the following cyclical process: mixing the components, compacting, microwave heating, cooling-down, thermally loading the mould to 800 °C, cooling-down to ambient temperature, and knocking-out. After being knocked-out, the waste moulding sands were subjected to either dry or wet activation of the binder. To activate thermally treated inorganic binder, each of the examined processes employed the surface phenomenon usually associated to mechanical reclamation. The study also covered possible use of some elements of wet reclamation to rehydrate waste binder. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the two proposed methods of waste binder activation, selected strength and technological parameters were measured. After each subsequent processing cycle, the permeability, tensile strength and bending strength were determined. In addition, the surface of activated sand grains was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Analysis of the results indicates {{that it is possible to}} re-activate the used binder such as sodium silicate, and to stabilize the strength parameters in both activation processes. Permeability of the refreshed moulding sands strongly depends on the surface condition of high-silica grains. The wet activation process by wetting and buffering knocked-out moulding sands in closed humid environment makes it possible to reduce the content of refreshing additive in water-glass. The moulding sands cyclically prepared in both processes do not require the addition of fresh high-silica sand. The relatively high quality achieved in the refreshed moulding sands allows them to be reused for manufacture of next moulds. Thus, the two proposed methods for cyclically processing used moulding sands containing sodium silicate, subject to microwave hardening, are suitable for economic and ecological circulation <b>moulding</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R

Changes in chemical composition, specific surface and helium density of fly ash after the process of its wash cleaning and demagnetization were examined. The analysis of the data has proved that the process of wash cleaning considerably reduces the content of sodium and potassium. Calcium and magnesium are washed out, too. The wash cleaning process of fly ash reduces also its true density. This fact can be due to the washing out of illite as well as some fractions of haematite (the grains weakly bonded to the glassy phase). The process of demagnetization allows removing about 25. 7 % of the magnetic phase calculated in terms of Fe 2 O 3.

40|$|The most {{important}} advantage of foundry purpose moulding sand {{is that it}} can be reclaimed and reused through the casting manufacturing process. Supplying the foundry with a new source of material, sand reclamation brings along both environmental and economic advantages. Utilization of used sand can be considered as a common technological routine in the production of most types of chemically bound moulding materials. The epoxy-SO 2 process is prevalent in the processing of cast iron engine components worldwide. Based on its excellent properties, it is mainly suitable for producing internal sand cores with complex geometry. Even though reclaimed sand addition is an active and well-functioning feature in ferrous foundries, the scientific and thermophysical background of its effects on the casting process is yet to be explored. In this work, the thermal aspects of different reclaimed sand levels in the epoxy-SO 2 moulding system were examined. Thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis of the epoxy-SO 2 and reclaimed sand in focus were carried out to obtain basic understandings about their high-temperature behaviour. A state-of-the-art Fourier thermal analysis method presented in a recent paper was used at temperatures corresponding to actual cast iron production (1300  ±  10  °C), contrary to the previous tests at the typical temperature range of aluminium melt processing (660  ±  10  °C).

The developed method is based on a melt-processing technique and consists of injection <b>moulding</b> a <b>mixture</b> of starch based polymer and a chemical blowing agent (CBA). In the work reported here, a two stage approach is used. As a first step, the relationships between processing conditions and morphology (porosity and pore size) of the samples are studied and, subsequently, the dependence of mechanical properties on this morphology is investigated...|$|R
