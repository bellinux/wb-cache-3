50|$|Present {{value is}} the {{discounted}} sum of future cash flows: each future cash flow is multiplied by a carefully selected number less than one, before being added together. The multiplication factor {{accounts for the}} way the value of money is discounted over time. The time-based value of money captures the intuition that everyone would prefer to get paid {{sooner rather than later}} but would prefer to pay later rather than sooner. The <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> depend on the discount rate chosen (10% per year as an example) and the length of time before each cash flow occurs. For example, money received ten years from now must be discounted more than dollars received five years in the future.|$|E

When the system is flooded, the configurations with all LEU assemblies result in higher effective <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors.</b> For normal operating conditions, effective <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> for all configurations are below the presumed upper subcritical limit of 0. 95.

40|$|The {{public goods}} game {{is one of}} the most famous models for {{studying}} the evolution of cooperation in sizable groups. The <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> in this game can characterize the investment return from the public good, which may be variable depending on the interactive environment in realistic situations. Instead of using the same universal value, here we consider that the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> in each group is updated based on the differences between the local and global interactive environments in the spatial public goods game but meanwhile limited to within a certain range. We find that the adaptive and bounded investment returns and significantly promote cooperation. In particular, full cooperation can be achieved for high feedback strength when appropriate limitation is set for the investment return. Also, we show that the fraction of cooprators in the whole population can become larger if the lower and upper limits of the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> are increased. Furthermore, in comparison to the traditionally spatial public goods game where the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> in each group is identical and fixed, we find that cooperation can be better promoted if the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> is constrained to adjust between one and the group size in our model. Our results highlight the importance of the locally adaptive and bounded investment returns for the emergence and dominance of cooperative behavior in structured populations...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of cooperation {{under the assumption that}} the collective benefits of group membership can only be harvested if the fraction of cooperators within the group, i. e. their critical mass, exceeds a threshold value. Considering structured populations, we show that a moderate fraction of cooperators can prevail even at very low <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> if the critical mass is minimal. For larger <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors,</b> however, the level of cooperation is highest at an intermediate value of the critical mass. The latter is robust to variations of the group size and the interaction network topology. Applying the optimal critical mass threshold, we show that the fraction of cooperators in public goods games is significantly larger than in the traditional linear model, where the produced public good is proportional to the fraction of cooperators within the group.

40|$|The 252 Cf source-driven noise {{analysis}} (CSDNA) method is an experimental technique, developed by J. T.

In this work, a stochastic diffusion description was used to interpret the CSDNA experiment in an infinite, homogeneous medium in order {{to shed light on}} the practicality of this experimental procedure in determining the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor.</b> By defining such a benchmark problem, an exact solution is obtained for the subcritical <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> in which the locations of the 252 Cf source and neutron detectors are explicitly taken into account. The expression relating reactivity to the measured data was found to depend implicitly on k itself. Through a numerical analysis of this expression, certain limiting conditions were identified in which the expression for the reactivity became essentially independent of k, hence demonstrating some possibility for the viability of this technique.

40|$|Tool {{manufacturers}} {{are required to}} declare the vibration emission of their hand-held power tools in order to sell them within Europe. To enable comparison between different manufacturers, tests are carried out {{in accordance with the}} relevant test code (such as those defined in the ISO 8662 and EN 60745 series). These tests may be carried out in artificial circumstances which do not necessarily correctly predict the vibration emission that would be obtained in the workplace and often underestimate the magnitude of the vibration. In practice, tools are used with a range of inserted tools on different materials, resulting in a range of vibration emission values for a given tool. CEN Technical Report, CEN/TR 15350 provides <b>multiplication</b> <b>factors</b> to enable an estimate of the workplace vibration emission to be obtained from the manufacturers’ data. This paper compares the manufacturers’ declared vibration emission values with those measured for the public-domain OPERC HAVTEC database.

Dysmorphologists employ canthal measurements in evaluating the degree of hypertelorism. So intercanthal width and biocular breadth values are very important for clinicians, ophthalmologists, plastic and reconstructive surgeons. The reliability of estimation of intercanthal width from biocular breadth by using <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> is high. Objective: To make an attempt to determine the <b>multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> for estimation of intercanthal width. Materials and method: This is a cross sectional study conducted in the Anatomy department of Sir Salimullah Medical College, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2010 to June 2011. One hundred Bangladeshi 25 to 45 years old women were selected purposively for the study. Results: The mean±SD intercanthal width was 3. 456 ± 0. 3585 cm. <b>Multiplication</b> <b>factor</b> for measuring intercanthal width from biocular breadth (9. 348 ± 0. 7174 cm) was 0. 369 ± 0. 0232 cm.
