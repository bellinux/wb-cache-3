Among Georgia's public universities is the flagship research university, the University of Georgia, founded in 1785 as the country's oldest state-chartered university and {{the birthplace of the}} American system of public higher education. The University System of Georgia is the presiding body over public education in the state. The System includes 29 institutions of higher learning. The System is governed by the Georgia Board of Regents. Georgia’s workforce of more than 6.3 million is constantly refreshed by the growing number of people who <b>move</b> <b>here</b> along with the 90,000 graduates from the universities, colleges {{and technical}} colleges across the state, including the nationally-ranked University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University.|$|E
2500|$|The {{building}} of the house began in 1907 for Bryan Leesmith, {{a director of the}} chemical firm of Brunner Mond, the architect being C. E. Mallows. [...] Before it was completed, Leesmith had to sell the house and its ownership passed to Brunner Mond. [...] It was then leased to Richard Henry Prestwich, who was a director of Burberry’s. [...] Prestwich’s daughter, Irene, continued to rent the property after her father’s death in 1940. [...] Irene {{was a member of the}} campaign for Moral Re-Armament (MRA) and in 1940 she invited the organisation to <b>move</b> <b>here</b> to shelter from the war. [...] In November 1940 36incendiary bombs fell in the garden and one on the house. [...] During the war the gardens were used for growing produce which was taken to the local markets. [...] After the war Irene bought the house and grounds from Imperial Chemical Industries, the successors of Brunner Mond, and presented it to MRA, establishing the Tirley Garth Trust in order to preserve it. [...] Irene Prestwich died in 1974. [...] In 2002, as the house and grounds were surplus to the requirements of MRA, they were sold to Mersey Television.|$|E

Whilst the great bulk of the Portuguese people and their leaders are loyally co-operating with us, there is a strong party {{opposing}} us which would prefer even to see the French prevail. Of course you are aware of this. The heart and brain of all this is--as I gather the Principal Souza. Wellington has compelled his retirement from the Government. But if by doing so he has restricted the man's power for evil, he has certainly increased his will for evil and his activities.|$|E
60|$|I {{went out}} into the piazza. It was full of men, but where was the enthusiasm we had expected, the tumult, the shouts of joy? Was not the tyrant dead? But they stood there dismayed, confounded, like sheep.... And was not the tyrant dead? I saw partisans of Checco rushing through the crowd with cries of 'Death to all tyrants,' and 'Liberty, liberty!' but the people did not <b>move.</b> <b>Here</b> and there were men mounted on barrows, haranguing the people, {{throwing}} out words of fire, but the wind was still and they did not spread.... Some of the younger ones were talking excitedly, but the merchants kept calm, seeming afraid. They asked what was to happen now--what Checco would do? Some suggested that the town should be offered to the Pope; others talked of Lodovico Sforza and the vengeance he would bring from Milan.|$|E

'It is long since I have ridden this way, but thy boy's talk stirred me. See, Holy One--the Great Road which is the backbone of all Hind. For the most part it is shaded, as here, with four lines of trees; the middle road--all hard--takes the quick traffic. In the days before rail-carriages the Sahibs travelled up and down here in hundreds. Now there are only country-carts and such like. Left and right is the rougher road for the heavy carts--grain and cotton and timber, fodder, lime and hides. A man goes in safety here for at every few koss is a police-station. The police are thieves and extortioners (I myself would patrol it with cavalry--young recruits under a strong captain), but at least they do not suffer any rivals.

Her father died, nearly a year ago, and at her earnest request, as he said in his will, {{appointed}} us her guardians until she came of age, which will be in a few months now. As he had no near relations, he left the whole of his property to her; and having been in India in the days when, under Warren Hastings, there were good pickings to be obtained, it amounted to a handsome fortune. She said that she should come and live with us, at any rate until she became of age; and as that house of ours, though a comfortable place, was hardly the sort of house for an heiress, she herself proposed that we should take a larger house between us.|$|E
60|$|It {{might have}} been a short while or a long one, his mind was so filled with growing conjectures, but a time came when he felt cold. As he lay face down, only his back felt cold at first. He was {{grateful}} that he had not been thrown upon the rocks. The ground under him appeared soft, spongy, and gave somewhat as he breathed. He had really sunk down a little in this pile of soft earth. The day was not far off, as he could tell by the brightening of the gray. He began to suffer with the cold, and then slowly he seemed to freeze and grow numb. In an effort to roll over upon his back he discovered that his position, or his being bound, or the numbness of his muscles was responsible for the fact that he could not <b>move.</b> <b>Here</b> was a predicament. It began to look serious. What would a few hours of the powerful sun do to his uncovered skin? Somebody would trail and find him: still, he might not be found soon.|$|E

There is little Jack, who is {{no bigger than a}} boy of twelve, {{although}} he can shoot, and run, and play with the quarterstaff, or, if need be, with the bill, against the best man in the troop. I warrant me that if you show him the tent he will keep such sharp watch that no one shall enter or depart without his knowing where they go to. On a dark night {{he will be able to}} slip among the tents, and to <b>move</b> <b>here</b> and there without being seen. He can creep on his stomach without moving a leaf, and trust me the eyes of these French men-at-arms will look in vain for a glimpse of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty-five {{years ago}} I loved Rose Lawrence. The Lawrences lived {{where you are}} {{boarding}} now. There was just the father, a sickly man, and Rose, my [...] "Rose of joy," [...] as I called her, for I knew my Emerson pretty well even then. She was sweet and fair, like a white rose with {{just a hint of}} pink in its cup. We loved each other, but we couldn't marry then. My mother was an invalid, and one time, before I had learned to care for Rose, she, the mother, had asked me to promise her that I'd never marry as long as she lived. She didn't think then that she would live long, but she lived for twenty years, Master, and she held me to my promise all the time. Yes, it was hard"--for I had given an indignant exclamation--"but you see, Master, I had promised and I had to keep my word. Rose said I was right in doing it. She said she was willing to wait for me, but she didn't know, poor girl, how long the waiting was to be. Then her father's health failed completely, and the doctor ordered him to another climate. They went to California. That was a hard parting, Master. But we promised each other that we would be true, and we have been. I've never seen my Rose of joy since then, but I've had a letter from her every week. When the mother died, five years ago, I wanted to move to California and marry Rose. But she wrote that her father was so poorly she couldn't marry me yet. She has to wait on him every minute, and he's restless, and they <b>move</b> <b>here</b> and there--a hard life for my poor girl. So I had to take a new lease of patience, Master. One learns how to wait in twenty years. But I shall have her some day, God willing. Our love will be crowned yet. So I wait, Master, and try to keep my life and soul clean and wholesome and young for her.|$|E
6000|$|The Great Eastern hums {{with life}} through all its hundred rooms. Doors slam merrily, {{and all the}} nations of the earth run up and down the staircases. This alone is refreshing, because the passers bump you and ask you to stand aside. Fancy finding any place outside the Levée-room where Englishmen are crowded {{together}} to this extent! Fancy sitting down seventy strong to tâble d'hôte and with a deafening clatter of knives and forks! Fancy finding a real bar whence drinks may be obtained! and, joy of joys, fancy stepping out of the hotel into the arms of a live, white, helmeted, buttoned, truncheoned Bobby! What would happen if one spoke to this Bobby? Would he be offended? He is not offended. He is affable. He has to patrol the pavement in front of the Great Eastern and to see that the crowding carriages do not jam. Toward a presumably respectable white he behaves as a man and a brother. There is no arrogance, about him. And this is disappointing. Closer inspection shows that he is not a real Bobby after all. He is a Municipal Police Something and his uniform is not correct; at least if they have not changed the dress of the men at Home. But no matter. Later on we will inquire into the Calcutta Bobby, because he is a white man, and has to deal with some of the [...] "toughest" [...] folk that ever set out of malice aforethought to paint Job Charnock's city vermilion. You must not, you cannot cross Old Court House Street without looking carefully to see that you stand no chance of being run over. This is beautiful. There is a steady roar of traffic, cut every two minutes by the deep roll of the trams. The driving is eccentric, not to say bad, but there is the traffic--more than unsophisticated eyes have beheld for a certain number of years. It means business, it means money-making, it means crowded and hurrying life, and it gets into the blood and makes it <b>move.</b> <b>Here</b> be big shops with plate-glass fronts--all displaying the well-known names of firms that we savages only correspond with through the Parcels Post.[14] They are all here, as large as life, ready to supply anything you need if you only care to sign. Great is the fascination of being able to obtain a thing on the spot without having to write for a week and wait for a month, and then get something quite different. No wonder pretty ladies, who live anywhere within a reasonable distance, come down to do their shopping personally.|$|E
