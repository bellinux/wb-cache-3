5|$|A {{study in}} La Plata, Argentina shows the {{potential}} for planarians such as Girardia anceps, Mesostoma ehrenbergii, and Bothromesostoma evelinae to reduce populations of the <b>mosquito</b> species Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens.

40|$|Abstract. Melanization is {{an immune}} {{response}} of <b>mosquitoes</b> {{that could potentially}} limit Plasmodium development. That <b>mosquitoes</b> rarely melanize Plasmodium falciparum in natural populations might result from immuno-suppression by the parasite, as has been observed in Aedes aegypti <b>mosquitoes</b> infected by Plasmodium gallinaceum. We tested this possibility in Anopheles gambiae <b>mosquitoes</b> infected by P. falciparum by comparing the ability to melanize a Sephadex bead of infected <b>mosquitoes,</b> of <b>mosquitoes</b> that had fed on infectious blood without becoming infected, and of control <b>mosquitoes</b> fed on uninfected blood. Rather than being immuno-suppressed, infected <b>mosquitoes</b> tended to have a stronger melanization response than <b>mosquitoes</b> in which the infection failed and than control <b>mosquitoes,</b> possibly because of immune activation after previous exposure to invading parasites. This finding suggests that P. falciparum relies on immune evasion rather than immuno-suppression to avoid being melanized and confirms that natural malaria transmission systems differ from laboratory models of mosquito–Plasmodium interactions...|$|R
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes.

40|$|Abstract Background La Crosse virus (LACV) is a {{pathogenic}} arbovirus that is transovarially {{transmitted by}} Aedes triseriatus <b>mosquitoes</b> and overwinters in diapausing eggs.

Results To investigate this issue, we reared <b>mosquitoes</b> from field-collected eggs and assayed adults individually for LACV antigen, viral RNA by RT-PCR, and infectious virus.

5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the <b>mosquito</b> midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines induce antibodies in the human blood; when a <b>mosquito</b> takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the <b>mosquito.</b> Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own.

The seventh generation obtained from the infected parental <b>mosquitoes</b> showed that virus could persist in <b>mosquitoes</b> in successive generations through transovarial passage. The rate of vertical transmission initially increased in the few generations (F 1 -F 2), but in subsequent generations it {{was found to be}} steady.

Methods: JEV and WNV infection in Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus <b>mosquitoes</b> in the presence of BAGV was carried out by intrathoracic (IT) inoculation and oral feeding methods. <b>Mosquitoes</b> were infected with BAGV and WNV/JEV either simultaneously or in a phased manner, in which <b>mosquitoes</b> were infected with BAGV by IT inoculation followed by super-infection with JEV/WNV after eight days post-infection (PI). JEV and WNV yield on 7 [th] and 14 [th] day PI after super-infection was determined by 50 per cent tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) method. Results: In Cx. tritaeniorhynchus <b>mosquitoes,</b> prior infection with BAGV significantly reduced JEV and WNV replication while in Cx. quinquefasciatus, BAGV influence was only seen with WNV. Reduction in virus titre was observed in IT inoculated and oral fed <b>mosquitoes</b> irrespective of the infection mode.
