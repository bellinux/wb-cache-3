40|$|To achieve reduced {{training}} time and improved generalization with artificial neural networks (ANN, or NN), {{it is important}} to use a reduced complexity NN structure. A "problem" is defined by constraints among the variables describing it. If knowledge about these constraints could be obtained a priori, this could be used to reduce the complexity of the ANN before training it. Systems theory literature contains methods for determining and representing structural aspects of constrained data (these methods are herein called GSM, general systems method). The suggestion here is to use the GSM model of the given data as a pattern for <b>modularizing</b> a NN prior to training it. The present work assumes the GSM model for the given problem context has been determined (represented here in the form of Boolean functions of known decompositions). This means that certain information is available about constraint among the system variables, and is used to develop a <b>modularized</b> NN. The <b>modularized</b> NN and an equivalent general NN (full interconnect, feed-forward NN) are both trained on the same data. Various predictions are offered: 1) The general NN and the <b>modularized</b> NN will both learn the task, but the <b>modularized</b> NN will learn it faster. 2) If trained on an (appropriate) subset of possible inputs, the <b>modularized</b> NN will perform better generalization than the general NN. 3) If trained on a non-decomposable function of the same variables, the general NN will learn the task, but the <b>modularized</b> NN will not. All of these predictions are verified experimentally. Future work will explore more decomposition types and more general data types...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} about our {{findings}} {{when we tried}} to derive a modular version from a whole-program control-flow analysis (CFA), to be used inside a <b>modularized</b> version of our exception analysis: (1) Deriving a modular version from a whole-program monovariant (or contextinsensitive) CFA makes the resulting analysis polyvariant (or contextsensitive) at the module-level. (2) Hence the correctness of its <b>modularized</b> version cannot be proven in general with respect to the original CFA. (3) A convenient stepping-stone to prove the correctness of a <b>modularized</b> version (instead of proving it against the program semantics) is a wholeprogram CFA that is polyvariant at the module-level. Because CFA is a basis of almost all analyses for higher-order programs, our result {{can be seen as a}} general hint of using the module-variant whole-program analysis in order to ease the correctness proof for a <b>modularized</b> version. We think this is worthwhile to report because usually in practice we first design a whole-program analysis, prove its correctness against the program semantics, and then only after its cost-accuracy balance is assured we start designing its <b>modularized</b> version. Our work can also be seen as a formal investigation, for CFA, of the folklore that modularization improves the analysis accuracy...|$|R

Here we perform similarity comparison between corresponding module of query and database image.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{emergence}} of <b>modularized</b> curriculum {{in community college}} career and technical education (CTE) programs has received substantial attention over the last decade, with researchers suggesting {{that this type of}} curriculum redesign may assist with student retention and success. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe advisory committee member involvement in <b>modularizing</b> CTE programs. This study was undertaken for three reasons: (a) to address the limited research on the topic of advisory committee involvement in <b>modularizing</b> curriculum; (b) to respond to the increased momentum to expand working lifetime opportunities, in which modularization may play an integral part; and (c) to explore the suggestion that employers must take a leadership role in shaping the workforce and that this may be done effectively through work on an advisory committee. The research was designed as a quantitative descriptive study using survey methodology. The study focused on community college CTE advisory committee members in Oregon and Wisconsin who were identified as being engaged in developing career pathways. The primary research question asked respondents to describe their involvement in <b>modularizing</b> curriculum, and the secondary question asked them to specific the degree to which their involvement had occurred in the various aspects of <b>modularizing</b> curriculum. The key findings of this descriptive study suggest that responding CTE advisory committee members in Oregon and Wisconsin are aware of the concept of curriculum modularization but have little involvement in the actual process of breaking down associate degree programs into smaller certificates. This study also shows that these same advisory committee members endorse more than they assist with developing the various aspects of <b>modularizing</b> curriculum, such as defining skills sets for various jobs, developing courses for appropriate content, reordering courses in an existing program, adding or deleting courses, and developing measureable outcomes. Implications for practice from this study are: 1) provide more information and training to advisory committee members involved in <b>modularizing</b> curriculum in order to increase their level of understanding and thus strengthen their ability to participate effectively in reviewing and endorsing work already done by faculty, 2) provide advisory committee members with complete and detailed instructions regarding their work on the committee, and 3) develop a mandatory advisory committee orientation for all members to provide the needed information and training...|$|R
