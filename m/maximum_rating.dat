25|$|The 206L LongRanger is a {{stretched}} variant with {{seating for}} seven. The fuselage, stretched {{a total of}} , adds two rear-facing seats between {{the front and rear}} seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types. In 1981, a military version was released, the 206L TexasRanger. The original 206L used an Allison 250-C20B engine, and a series of model upgrades replaced this engine with more powerful versions; the 206L-1 used a 250-C28, and the 206L-3 and 206L-4 used the 250-C30P. In both applications, the 250-C30P is derated from 650hp for takeoff and 501hp continuous. The 206L-3 is transmission–limited to 435hp for take-off, and the 206L-4 is transmission-limited to 495hp. The derating of the C30P produces an advantage in hot-day and high-altitude operations as it can produce the rated horsepower at higher altitudes and temperatures where applications that use the <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> of the engine at sea level suffer accelerated performance deterioration with increases in temperature and altitude. The 206L-3 and L-4 have not been offered in a twin configuration under those model designations.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the BBFC and ESRB decisions, Rockstar decided to censor the game. Censoring took five main forms. The primary {{alteration}} was {{the addition of a}} blurring effect over executions; during an execution the screen turns red, and flashes black and white. The second alteration was the removal of all but two decapitations. Initially, several weapons in the game could decapitate enemies, but with the exception of two plot-important decapitations, all such executions were removed. Thirdly, the pliers executions were changed. Originally, a gruesome execution with a pliers involved ripping off the enemy's testicles, whilst a level 2 execution involved tearing open his throat. In the edited version, the pliers is used to beat the enemy over the head. The fourth change was the removal of innocent characters from certain levels. Originally, the game was structured {{in such a way that}} the player had the choice as to whether or not to kill these characters. If they didn't, they got the ending where Daniel defeats Leo, if they did, they got the alternate ending. The final change involved the rating system. Originally, the game had a rating system similar to the first game, whereby the player was rated based on speed and severity of execution types. To achieve a <b>maximum</b> <b>rating,</b> one had to perform a set number of gruesome executions in each level. This rating system was completely removed from the edited version.|$|E
500|$|David Quantick in The Word {{commented that}} [...] "musically, Seduction is awe-inspiring {{in the way}} the Maels {{perfectly}} meld their current style – intense, repetitive beats and melodies (there's even a bit of squelching techno here) and caustic, snappy lyrics – with the demands of an actual musical." [...] He called the album an [...] "amazing record", a [...] "commissioned piece that not only does what it's been asked to do, but transcends the brief and creates a genuinely exciting piece of music in its own right." [...] Andy Gill in The Independent gave The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman a <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> of five stars and included the record among his 20 albums of the year: [...] "Sharply scripted, with that sly, knowing touch so typical of Sparks, it's also scored with scrupulous intelligence, the arrangements drawing on a range of apt influences, from Kurt Weill to jazz, pop and rock, and the orchestrations ingeniously duplicitous, wistful and sinister, as the action dictates. It may well {{turn out to be the}} pinnacle of Sparks' career, and certainly has an ambition well beyond the usual remit of popular culture." ...|$|E
40|$|Additional {{evidence}} for two separable responses to auxin is presented. The average of 24 control experiments indicated lag times of 12. 4 and 35. 4 min, and <b>maximum</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 57 and 0. 54 mm hr− 1, {{for the first}} and second response, respectively. The auxin analog 4 -azido- 2 -chlorophenoxyacetic acid increased the lag time of the second response (but not the first), resulting in the temporal separation of the two responses. Plots of elongation rates against time, taken from the literature, allowed the characterization of the two responses in monocotyls and dicotyls.

40|$|Abstract — Scheduling {{algorithms}} in CDMA packet systems need {{to allocate}} codes and power based on channel state information and queue information. For finite queue sizes, the allocated rate {{should be less}} than or equal to the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> required to clear the whole queue. This ensures that resources are not under-utilized. Although queue size and head-of-the-line packet delays have been considered in existing scheduling methods, this <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint has not been explicitly enforced. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling algorithm incorporating the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint. The proposed algorithm performs better in terms of delay distribution and percentage of dropped packets compared to existing algorithms that do not directly enforce the <b>maximum</b> <b>rate</b> constraint.

500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Southern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of 90°E, are officially monitored by one or more tropical cyclone warning centres. These are run by the Fiji Meteorological Service, New Zealand's MetService, Indonesia's Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika, Papua New Guinea's National Weather Service, while three others are run by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

Once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds.

2500|$|Players {{are able}} to pick a script {{provided}} by the studio's writers or write their own, although automated scripts take long to write in game time, while user-written scripts take longer to write in real time. For pre-written scripts, the player hires a writer at the Scriptwriting Office to make one. Multiple writers can collaborate on a single script in order to write it quicker. A series of upgrades, which are unlocked by winning studio awards, will allow the player to build higher quality Scriptwriting Offices, which increase the <b>maximum</b> <b>rating</b> a script can garner (1 star to 4 stars). The ability to write one's own script is enabled after unlocking the Custom Scriptwriting Office, which is itself unlocked from winning an award. It is limited in terms of quality to what the highest scripting office can produce. Writing a custom script follows a storyboard-like suite. For each scene, the player chooses a set for the scene and then the action that will occur during the scene (for example: 'Living Room 1: Enter Scared'). The actors and their costumes can be chosen, extras assigned roles and mood, and lighting and weather settings altered. The process will cost money though, the price increasing for each scene. The player can choose to have the structure set out for them (e.g., Introduction, pursuit, conflict, resolution) or [...] "Freeform" [...] mode, {{where there are no}} guidelines.|$|E
