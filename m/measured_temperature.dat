25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the heater where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and <b>measured</b> <b>temperature.</b> Instead of controlling the heater directly, the outer PID controller sets a heater temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the heater using a thermocouple attached to the heater. The inner controller's error term is the difference between this heater temperature setpoint and the <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> of the heater. Its output controls the actual heater to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
25|$|The lowest <b>measured</b> <b>{{temperature}}</b> on the Zugspitze was −35.6°C on 14 February 1940. The highest temperature {{occurred on}} 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9°C. A squall on 12 June 1985 registered 335km/h, the highest measured wind {{speed on the}} Zugspitze. In April 1944 meteorologists recorded a snow depth of 8.3metres.|$|E
25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases the rate of heat transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E

25|$|Another {{assumption}} is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered. Recombination of hydrogen and oxygen within the calorimeter would also alter the heat distribution and invalidate the calibration.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, a debris {{field was}} {{discovered}} in orbit around this star using infrared observations by the Spitzer telescope. This debris {{is thought to be}} an asteroid belt. The <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> of the debris is 110K, which places it in an orbit between 4 and 6 AU from the star, or about the same distance where Jupiter orbits the Sun. This debris disk may have been created by the breakup of a single, 100km diameter planetesimal through a collision. The star system does not show any excess emission at 70 μm, indicating it does not have a cold outer dust disk.|$|E
25|$|The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), {{originally}} {{known as}} the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background(CMB) –the radiant heat remaining from the Big Bang. Headed by Professor Charles L. Bennett of Johns Hopkins University, the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Princeton University. The WMAP spacecraft was launched on June 30, 2001 from Florida. The WMAP mission succeeded the COBE space mission and was the second medium-class (MIDEX) spacecraft in the NASA Explorers program. In 2003, MAP was renamed WMAP in honor of cosmologist David Todd Wilkinson (1935–2002), {{who had been a}} member of the mission's science team. After 9 years of operations, WMAP was switched off in 2010, following the launch of the more advanced Planck spacecraft by ESA in 2009.|$|E

500|$|Silicate volcanism, {{involving}} basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions, {{was confirmed}} by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s and 2000s from temperature measurements of Io's numerous hot spots, locations where thermal emission is detected, and from spectral measurements of Io's dark material. Temperature measurements from Galileos Solid-State Imager (SSI) and Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) revealed numerous hot spots with high-temperature components ranging from at least [...] {{to a maximum of}} , like at the Pillan Patera eruption in 1997. Initial estimates {{during the course of the}} Galileo mission suggesting eruption temperatures approaching [...] have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to calculate the temperatures. Spectral observations of Io's dark material suggested the presence of orthopyroxenes, such as enstatite, magnesium-rich silicate minerals common in mafic and ultramafic basalt. This dark material is seen in volcanic pits, fresh lava flows, and pyroclastic deposits surrounding recent, explosive volcanic eruptions. Based on the <b>measured</b> <b>temperature</b> of the lava and the spectral measurements, some of the lava may be analogous to terrestrial komatiites. Compressional superheating, which could increase the temperature of magma during ascent to the surface during an eruption, may also be a factor in some of the higher temperature eruptions.|$|E
