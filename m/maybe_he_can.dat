500|$|Mills {{noted that}} consequentialism does not merely {{expect that the}} {{consequences}} to one entity is determined. It requires {{a review of the}} consequences to all. When Marty observes Judd's out-of-season shooting of a deer, he uses the incident to blackmail him to sell Shiloh to him. However, this places deer in the future in danger of Judd's hunting. Marty sadly reflects: [...] "By lettin' him get away with this, I'm putting other deer in danger. He kill this one out of season, he'll figure <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> kill some more. To save Shiloh, I'm making it harder for deer". In essence, he selects the [...] "domestic love over the grander principle".|$|E

"Le diplôme": David Gervais {{says that}} he doesn't only think about [...] "the diploma", {{he wants to know}} what you know how to do, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> arrange a little something, if you..., but, embarrassed about what he appears to say, adds it's not in that sense... not sexual.

2500|$|Four {{days after}} the six-week Dover trial concluded, all eight of the Dover school board members who were up for reelection were voted out of office. Televangelist Pat Robertson in turn told the {{citizens}} of Dover, [...] "If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city." [...] Robertson said if they have future problems in Dover, [...] "I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> help them." ...|$|E
50|$|Simon finds Roland in town. Simon tells Roland that Connor is {{involved}} with some rough people, namely Jason Cross. They've had dealings in the past, when Connor's father ran a business. Simon believes that Cross is a violent separatist, a man who believes that whites and Mexicans shouldn't mix. Simon says he's been after Cross for years, but nobody is {{willing to talk about}} him. Simon thinks <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> and Roland <b>can</b> help each other.|$|R
50|$|When {{the experts}} {{interview}} the contestants, the experts question Tab on her nerves, Ben on his relationship, Jon on humility, and Shirley on confidence. Lauri, {{who has seen}} past seasons on the show, is quietly confident; while Sly admits to confidence issues. Afiya is ignorant as to why she was nominated, while Aaron breaks down when talking to the experts. <b>He</b> admits that <b>maybe</b> if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> share his pain to the world, {{he will be able}} to recover. Since it is the end of the first episode, no one is leaving, and the lessons will begin in earnest.|$|R
60|$|If, on {{the other}} hand, you have omitted to seal it, that is your fault. In any case, the letter cannot go as it is. The {{continental}} official brings up the public {{on the principle of}} the nurse who sent the eldest girl to see what Tommy was doing and tell him he mustn't. Your friend, having wasted half an hour and mislaid his temper for the day, decides to leave this thing over and talk to the hotel porter about it. Next to the Burgomeister, the hotel porter is the most influential man in the continental town: <b>maybe</b> because <b>he</b> <b>can</b> swear in seven different languages. But even he is not omnipotent.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again {{sought to}} discard Coleman, {{asking him to}} report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. [...] Coleman refused and {{compiled}} a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. [...] Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. [...] Finley reportedly [...] "blew his top" [...] after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. [...] Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. [...] Coleman noted {{at the time that he}} was happy to escape Finley. [...] After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: [...] "He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. [...] How can he do that when he can't pitch himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I'd try to {{feel him}} out. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be fixed. Boys {{who want to}} be foresters can't be rich. Failing that--you say he's a kid who wants to hunt and shoot--get some one to take him up on the mountain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't give way," [...] he replied, huskily. [...] "Both {{you girls}} will need your nerve. Duane isn't badly hurt. But Floyd is--is dead. Listen. Let me tell it quick. There's been a fight. It--it was Lawson--it was Lawson's gun that shot Duane. Duane let me off. In fact, Ray, he saved me. I'm to divide my property--return {{so far as}} {{possible}} what I've stolen--leave Texas at once with Duane, under arrest. He says <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> get MacNelly, the ranger captain, to let me go. For your sake!" ...|$|E
5000|$|When an English ship appears, Crusoe is overjoyed. Two men {{arrive in}} a boat and are invited for dinner {{but it turns out}} that they are slave traders who want to capture both Crusoe and Friday. So the latter {{collaborate}} in killing the intruders when their violent motives are revealed, and the ship sails away, leaving the protagonists stranded as before. For a while, a kind of friendship develops between Crusoe and Friday. Friday thinks that <b>he</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>can</b> teach Crusoe his more relaxed way of living, and not to be controlled by [...] "thoughts of power, guilt and fear", which are very strong traits in Crusoe's personality.|$|R

50|$|Think {{it all the}} way through, and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky is a {{scrupulously}} moral picture. It {{tells the}} story of a man who has just about everything, thinks <b>he</b> <b>can</b> have it all, is given a means to have whatever he wants, and loses it because—well, <b>maybe</b> because <b>he</b> has a conscience. Or maybe not. Maybe just because life sucks. Or <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> only thinks it does. This is the kind of movie you don't want to analyze until you've seen it two times.|$|R
50|$|Maglione plays Nicole Brody, Moses' ex-wife {{who tells}} {{him about the}} first Concorde crash and that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> solve the mystery of who caused it.|$|E
50|$|God is {{tolerant}} and loving, but we can't keep sticking our {{finger in}} His eye forever. If they have future problems in Dover, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> help them.|$|E
5000|$|Jack and the Beanstalker: Jackson needs {{money or}} he's a dead man. The only thing mowing lawns got {{him was a}} handful of magic beans. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> find some money {{at the top of}} that giant beanstalk growing out of his yard. It's worth a shot.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 May 2015, it was {{announced}} that Tristan Gemmill had been cast as Tracy's ex Robert Preston. Robert (then played by Julian Kay) had previously been married to Tracy when Dawn Acton was playing the role. It {{was announced}} that Robert will return to Tracy's life in the summer when he turns up unexpectedly at the funeral of her mother Deirdre (Anne Kirkbride). With Tracy grieving following her mother's sudden death and also newly-single after splitting from Tony Stewart, she quickly seeks comfort by falling back into Robert's arms. However, if Tracy harbours any hopes for a full reunion with Robert, it won't be easy for her as he is still married to his second wife - something he has neglected to tell her. Played by former Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding, Robert's wife quickly joins him in Weatherfield to fight for her man. Asked what Robert likes about Tracy, Gemmill replied: [...] ""Now there's a question! I guess some people are attracted to broken people. I've got friends who have poor relationships by anyone's standards because they keep making the same mistake. Maybe Robert is {{one of those people who}} is attracted to danger, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>can</b> fix her. There's an element of thrill being with someone who's unpredictable." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “He’s really good,” Wright told Parrish. “Maybe I haven’t {{followed}} {{him as well}} because he’s from the Midwest, and <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> wouldn’t surprise anybody else. But he’s got great size, he {{puts it on the}} floor, he passes it, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> shoot it. <b>He’s</b> just a ballplayer.” When asked if he would be an NBA player, Wright answered [...] "yes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph, <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> {{sorry and}} <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> isn't," [...] muttered Stanley. [...] "I guess {{he ought to}} have a thrashing. Anyway, I am done with him," [...] and he flung back the coat Tom had offered him.|$|R

5000|$|A {{negative}} review {{came from}} Pitchfork, which wrote [...] "Leftfield techno vet Paul Mac seems stale working {{away from a}} club-oriented context, but it's Johns who seems out of his depth. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> write a three-chord rock song, but here he under-sings, over-emotes, and writes melodies that spiral off in insane directions before ending up nowhere".|$|E
50|$|Jonathan and Carnegie are {{aided by}} members of the Darkside's newspaper. There, Jonathan learns that his missing mother was a {{reporter}} for them, and disappeared around {{the same time as the}} infamous murder occurred. Jonathan is certain that the two events must be connected. If they can solve the latest crime, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> discover what has happened to his mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor fellow! <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> {{was afraid}} {{if he came}} towards the school he would be arrested. If he had a {{suitcase}} he couldn't have been just an ordinary tramp. <b>Maybe</b> <b>he</b> was some working man {{looking for a job}} and without the price of a night's lodging." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The more I {{think about}} it the more I realize that maybe God is not all {{powerful}} the way we believe Him to be. He is the God of the cross. Why didn't He answer the prayer of Jesus on the cross? It is a mystery. <b>Maybe</b> <b>He</b> is a weak God, Who sets limits to what <b>He</b> <b>can</b> do and will {{only be able to}} save us only through and by our will”.|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{pressure}} {{from home to}} do well at school and {{he may be a}} bit worried that he's not doing as well as they hope. The shadow of his father (however fictional the image is) and the pressure to be a man's man and a chip off the old block might cause trouble in the future. A point is going to be reached when Ian {{is going to have to}} assert himself as himself. He can't allow his father to live his life, by proxy, through him. Or, <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can...?</b> (page 56) ...|$|E
5000|$|Their EP Lost Ground {{tells the}} story of the beggar from [...] "Prophet in Plain Clothes" [...] in Travels, a {{homeless}} street performer whose song inspires the younger brother to stop running from his past and problems. Lost Ground reveals the Prophet's past, an African American World War II veteran that returns home only to find his service and sacrifice means nothing and is shunned for the color of his skin. Hopeless, he becomes an alcoholic train hopper and street performer, singing of his struggles in order to survive hoping that <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> change someone's life for the better.|$|E

5000|$|... "It's {{an amazing}} story, {{given the fact}} we got him out of an indy league. We thought <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> help us in Double-A season. We sorely underestimated what he was capable of, the numbers he put up are hard to believe." [...] Yankees Senior Vice President of Baseball Operations Mark Newman Between Class AA Trenton and Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Ramírez pitched [...] innings, in which he allowed 26 hits and 22 walks while {{striking}} out 102. He held opponents to a [...]135 batting average and allowed only five earned runs, good for a 0.79 ERA.

50|$|After he {{was called}} by Spider-Man to help the Avengers to battle Terminus, Alpha used his powers carelessly, causing many {{aircraft}} to shut down, risking {{the lives of the}} passengers and people in the ground. After the Avengers managed to rescue the various passengers, Spider-Man, his Aunt May and her husband Jay Jameson from Jameson's malfunctioning private jet, Peter decided that Alpha was too irresponsible to wield the powers he had. He used Terminus' energy lance to deflect Alpha's energy to build an engine which took a huge portion of Andy's power. Spider-Man tells Andy that he will return to his parents and he will be attending high school once more. His powers are still growing, and <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be a hero again, just not as Alpha.|$|E
