In this work, such an approach has been revised, by choosing a runaway reaction as design incidental scenario, and integrated with a suitable optimization procedure based on topological criteria. The new batchsize approach allows for computing a reactor fill level which is much more reasonable for industrial applications with respect to that one predicted by the older method, while the topological approach permits to identify the minimum dosing time capable of guaranteeing both reactor safety and high productivity.
