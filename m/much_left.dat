25|$|In 1691, Louvois {{instructed}} his marshals {{to destroy}} those towns which were {{to serve as}} winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river {{under the command of}} Marshal Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges at Philippsburg on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' residential town of Durlach and 1,200 cavalry men, 300 dragoons and 1,200 infantry men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not <b>much</b> <b>left</b> to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.|$|E

[...] The {{original}} release of The Marble Index included eight of 12 songs Nico recorded. [...] "Roses in the Snow", [...] "Nibelungen", [...] "Sagen die Gelehrten" [...] and [...] "Reve Reveiller" [...] were left off the album. The finished album was barely 30 minutes long, which [...] "was as much apparently as Frazier Mohawk, mixing and sequencing it, could stand without starting to feel suicidal".|$|E

500|$|In 1991, L.A.P.D. {{recorded}} {{their second}} album, Who's Laughing Now. Released on May 3, 1991, {{it was their}} first full-length studio album, and consisted of eleven tracks. After they recorded the album, the group's lead vocalist, Pete Capra, left L.A.P.D. {{and was replaced by}} someone affectionately known by other band members as Corey. Bassist Arvizu wrote: [...] "Pete [...] was always doing amphetamines and stuff. He pretty <b>much</b> <b>left</b> just because of his drug abuse. So Munky , David , and I had to start all over again." [...] The band later fired Corey after his behavior during an audition with producer Ross Robinson. While looking for a new singer, they heard Jonathan Davis singing for the alternative metal band Sexart. After the show, the remaining band members of L.A.P.D. asked him to join their band. Shortly after this, the band changed their name to Korn and added Brian Welch to the member line-up.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{developed}} by UK-based computer game company Zippo Games, headed by Ste and John Pickford; {{this was the first}} game Zippo developed for fellow UK-based video game company Rare. At the time, Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore64, AtariST, and Amiga in 1988. New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library, though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console. According to Ste Pickford: [...] "The NES seemed primitive by comparison, sub-Commodore64. But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers, which we appreciated, and we wanted to try to make games as good as that." [...] Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel; Pickford remarked: [...] "Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel, and pretty <b>much</b> <b>left</b> us to it." [...] Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{was five}} years old, in 1963, her mother, Madonna Ciccone, {{died of breast cancer}} at the age of30. Months before this, Madonna noticed changes in her mother's {{behavior}} and personality from the attentive homemaker she was, but did not understand the reasons. Mrs. Ciccone, at a loss to explain her dire medical condition, would often begin to cry when questioned by Madonna, at which point Madonna would respond by wrapping her arms around her mother tenderly. [...] "I remember feeling stronger than she was", Madonna recalled, [...] "I was so little and yet I felt like she was the child." [...] Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying. [...] "There was so <b>much</b> <b>left</b> unsaid, so many untangled and unresolved emotions, of remorse, guilt, loss, anger, confusion.... I saw my mother, looking very beautiful and lying as if she were asleep in an open casket. Then I noticed that my mother's mouth looked funny. It took me some time to realize that it had been sewn up. In that awful moment, I began to understand what I had lost forever. The final image of my mother, at once peaceful yet grotesque, haunts me today also." ...|$|E

500|$|The plan works {{but it is}} pyrrhic victory, as the GTVA {{loses the}} Colossus, their only match for Shivan juggernauts, in a diversionary {{engagement}} {{at the other end}} of the Capella system. With not <b>much</b> <b>left</b> to do but escort the remaining evacuation convoys to the Capella–Vega jump node while a second payload is sent to the jump node, the GTVA soon begins to detect activity from the system's star, which is being bombarded with an intense subspace field by numerous Sathanas-class ships. [...] This causes the star to goes supernova, destroying the fighting GTVA and Shivans in system. The player can choose to flee the scene when the warning is given or stay and die defending the remaining ships, which affects the ending slightly. [...] In the ending cutscene the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, delivers a speech about everything the Alliance has lost, speculating on the nature of the Shivans and why they destroyed the Capella star, and if the player decides to stay, a small tribute is paid to the player's heroic actions as Petrarch informs his wingmen of his sacrifice. The Admiral concludes by saying that the Alliance now has the means to recreate the Ancient subspace gate, implying that there's a chance the node to Earth can be restored and that this conflict didn't bring only sorrow, before signing off.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for someone who had a [...] "Paris Hilton quality" [...] to play Shannon, but she could not just be shallow, as the storyline would require more than that. A lot of women auditioned before the producers finally settled on Maggie Grace. She was written to be a bitch in the first season as the producers needed a character they could use to create opposition and conflict. The producers thought it would be interesting for there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. They {{came up with the idea}} for them to be unrelated stepsiblings, who have a romantic encounter, which became the twist for their backstory. When Boone is killed at the end of season one, it forces Shannon into a more adult existence on the Island. Grace noted Boone is [...] "the only person that ever really knew and loved Shannon, in spite of herself. Of course, losing him, especially with so <b>much</b> <b>left</b> unsaid and unresolved, will change her irrevocably." [...] This freed her up to develop her relationship with Sayid. Naveen Andrews, who plays Sayid, came up with the idea for Shannon and Sayid relationship. He thought, [...] "What would really shock Middle-America? What if Sayid was to have a relationship with a woman that looked like Miss America? The most unlikely pairing… to come completely from left field." [...] This pairing made Shannon [...] "less flighty... more of a person to be reckoned with." [...] According to Lost producer Carlton Cuse, [...] "The relationships [...] expect on the show are not necessarily the ones that we [...] necessarily are going to give you, but we want to try to find ways in which characters that you don't expect to kind of connect to one another to connect in ways that are kind of surprising." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} was {{simultaneously}} developing , limitations were set on which mutants {{could be used}} for cameo appearances in X-Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine. Gambit was considered for both the convoy scene being freed by Magneto and the Battle of Alcatraz along with the X-Men, but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and [...] "not be able to do him justice." [...] Kinberg reasoned, [...] "there just wasn't enough space", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that [...] "there wasn't <b>much</b> <b>left</b> to do with the character. It also felt like he might tread {{a little bit on the}} terrain of Beast, in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy." [...] Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in [...] The introdutory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X-Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a [...] "Days of Future Past"-inspired battle with a Sentinel. Another repurposed scene was Magneto attacking the convoy to free Mystique, Madrox and Juggernaut, which Penn had previously envisioned for X2.|$|E

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is <b>much</b> <b>left</b> for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E
