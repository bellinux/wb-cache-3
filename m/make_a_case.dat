5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy should <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure {{due to his}} affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2011, the US {{lawsuit against}} Scholastic was dismissed. The {{judge in the}} case stated {{that there was not}} enough {{similarity}} between the two books to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for plagiarism. In the UK courts, on 21 March 2011, Paul Allen, a trustee of the Jacobs estate, was ordered to pay as security to the court 65% of the costs faced by Bloomsbury and Rowling, amounting to over £1.5million, to avoid the claim being struck out. It was reported in The Bookseller that Paul Allen has appealed against paying this sum. As a condition of the appeal, he paid £50,000 to the court in May 2011. The claim was formally struck out in July 2011 after the deadline for Allen's initial payment was missed.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{had been}} a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and {{immediately}} after World War II, he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against New Zealand. However, he was sidelined by injury in 194647 and Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively. Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs {{in the next two}} Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for continued national selection, and he made 99. In the Tests against India during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. In any case, Brown had done enough to tour England with The Invincibles in 1948, his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.|$|E

5|$|Plantard then {{enlisted the}} aid of author Gérard de Sède {{to write a book}} based on his {{unpublished}} manuscript and forged parchments, alleging that Saunière had discovered a link to a hidden treasure. The 1967 book L'or de Rennes, ou La vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château ("The Gold of Rennes, or The Strange Life of Bérenger Saunière, Priest of Rennes-le-Château"), which was later published in paperback under the title Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Château ("The Accursed Treasure of Rennes-le-Château") in 1968, became a popular read in France. It included copies of the found parchments (the originals were, of course, never produced), though it did not provide the decoded hidden texts contained within them. One of the Latin texts in the parchments was copied from the Novum Testamentum, an attempted restoration of the Vulgate by John Wordsworth and Henry White. The other text was copied from the Codex Bezae. Based on the wording used, the versions of the Latin texts found in the parchments can be shown to have been copied from books first published in 1889 and 1895, which is problematic considering that de Sède's book was trying to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> that these documents were centuries old.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{found that}} the {{district}} lines were not justified {{as an attempt to}} remedy the effects of past discrimination, since {{there was no evidence of}} present discrimination other than racially polarized voting.

25|$|Canadian {{law allows}} inmates convicted {{of first-degree murder}} to apply for parole after serving a minimum of 25 years. Olson's second parole hearing, on July 18, 2006, was also denied.

Under Canadian law, Olson was then entitled to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for parole every two years.|$|E

Since the Court had found that Quon's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated, it therefore had to hold that the others' were not, either.|$|E

25|$|United States Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar often criticized Butterfield {{for being}} lax on {{aviation}} safety, allegations Butterfield strongly denied.

The Washington Post, quoting anonymous White House sources, said Butterfield's dismissal was not retaliation {{for his role in}} revealing the White House taping system, and allowed Butterfield to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for keeping his job with new White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people also}} <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> for {{different}} narrative forms being classified as storytelling {{in the contemporary}} world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional role-playing games, storytelling {{is done by the}} person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as sci-fi and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{officials}} who fell victim to Lü Yi's abuses of power were the general Zhu Ju, the Imperial Chancellor Gu Yong, and the commandery administrators Diao Jia (刁嘉) and Zheng Zhou (鄭胄). In Zhu Ju's case, which happened sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi falsely accused him of embezzling military funds when some funds designated for Zhu Ju's army went missing. Zhu Ju, unable to explain himself, suffered in silence. The finance officer in his army also died under torture during interrogation. Later, another inspector discovered the real culprit and cleared Zhu Ju's name. As for Gu Yong, Lü Yi initially prepared to <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> against him for incompetence and ask Sun Quan to remove him from office. However, after an official Xie Gong (謝厷) pointed out that Pan Jun, the Minister of Ceremonies, would most likely become the next Imperial Chancellor if Gu Yong were {{to be removed from}} office, Lü Yi immediately dropped the case against Gu Yong because he knew that Pan Jun resented him and would take action against him if he became Imperial Chancellor. In Diao Jia's case, Lü Yi falsely accused him of defaming the imperial court, resulting in an angry Sun Quan ordering Diao Jia's arrest. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, they all said they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Only Shi Yi said he did not, and he eventually managed to convince Sun Quan that Diao Jia was innocent. In Zheng Zhou's case, earlier on he had arrested and executed Lü Yi's retainer(s) for breaking the law, so Lü Yi bore a grudge against him and spoke ill of him in front of Sun Quan. Sun Quan, believing what Lü Yi said, turned furious and summoned Zheng Zhou to meet him. Pan Jun and Chen Biao spoke up for Zheng Zhou and succeeded in convincing Sun Quan to spare him.|$|E
