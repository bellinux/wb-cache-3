Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday services begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first service of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many service times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent services. Thus, it is the matins service of Great <b>Monday</b> <b>that</b> is on [...] "Palm Sunday" [...] evening in parish churches and often vespers is in the morning.|$|E

2500|$|The epoch of the Julian {{calendar}} {{was on the}} Saturday {{before the}} <b>Monday</b> <b>that</b> was the epoch of the Gregorian calendar. In other words, Gregorian [...] = Julian [...] The Revised Julian reform not only changed the leap rule but also made the epoch {{the same as that}} of the Gregorian calendar. This seems to have been carried out implicitly, and even scientific articles make no mention of it. Nevertheless, it is impossible to implement calendrical calculations and calendar date conversion software without appreciating this detail and taking the 2-day shift into account. If the original Julian calendar epoch is mistakenly used in such calculations then there is no way to reproduce the currently accepted dating of the Revised Julian calendar, which yields no difference between Gregorian and Revised Julian dates in the 21st century.|$|E

First of all, it is not certain, regardless of the number of observations, that the woman always walks by the market at 8am on Monday. In fact, Hume would even argue that we cannot claim it is [...] "more probable", since this still requires the assumption that the past predicts the future.|$|E

The killing sparked an outrage among Muslims in Asmara {{and a lot of people}} turned up the next day for his funeral to show their stand against the terrorist activities of the UP. A well organised funeral procession was arranged and attended by youth and Muslim dignitaries. The procession passed through three main streets before they reached the street where the UP Office was located.

There was open confrontation between both sides and many were killed and injured from both sides. The Police intervened by firing live ammunition, but the confrontations continued.
