Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds,</b> and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order for}} a {{contract}} to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds).</b> This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which {{is known as the}} [...] "mirror image rule". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met. If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted objectively {{from the perspective of a}} reasonable person, as determined in the early English case of Smith v Hughes [...] It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.|$|E

Since 2009, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) -supported Interreg Programme France (Channel) England Region has actively supported efforts by organisations in France and England to work ever more closely together, to share good practice and to devise new ways to support sustainable development in the Region.

5000|$|Historians {{trace the}} {{earliest}} surviving Jewish esoteric texts to Tannaic times. This [...] "Merkavah-Heichalot" [...] mysticism, {{referred to in}} Talmudic accounts, sought elevations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul using meditative methods, built around <b>the</b> Biblical Vision <b>of</b> Ezekiel and <b>the</b> Creation in Genesis. The distinctive conceptual features of later Kabbalah first emerged from the 11th century, though traditional Judaism predates the 13th century Zohar back to the Tannaim, and <b>the</b> preceding end <b>of</b> Biblical prophecy. <b>The</b> contemporary teacher <b>of</b> Kabbalah and Hasidic thought, Yitzchak Ginsburgh, describes <b>the</b> historical evolution <b>of</b> Kabbalah as <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> [...] "Wisdom" [...] and [...] "Prophecy":The numerical value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word Kabbalah (קבלה-"Received") in Hebrew is 137...and is <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> two very important words that relate to Kabbalah: Chochmah (חכמה-"Wisdom") equals 73 and Nevuah (נבואה-"Prophecy") equals 64. Kabbalah can therefore be understood as the union (or [...] "marriage") of wisdom and prophecy.Historically, Kabbalah developed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prophetic tradition that existed in Judaism up to the Second Temple period (beginning in the 4th century BCE). Though the prophetic spirit that had dwelt in the prophets continued to [...] "hover above" [...] (Sovev) the Jewish people, {{it was no longer}} manifest directly. Instead, <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> wisdom manifested <b>the</b> Divine in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oral Torah (the oral tradition), <b>the</b> body <b>of</b> Rabbinic knowledge that began developing in the second Temple period and continues to this day. <b>The</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>of</b> wisdom (<b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> intellect) and prophecy (the spirit which still remains) and their union is what produces and defines <b>the</b> essence <b>of</b> Kabbalah.In <b>the</b> Kabbalistic conceptual scheme, [...] "wisdom" [...] corresponds to <b>the</b> sefirah <b>of</b> wisdom, otherwise known as the [...] "Father" [...] principle (Partsuf of Abba) and [...] "prophecy" [...] corresponds to <b>the</b> sefirah <b>of</b> understanding or <b>the</b> [...] "Mother" [...] principle (Parsuf of Ima). Wisdom and understanding are described in the Zohar as [...] "two companions that never part". Thus, Kabbalah represents <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> wisdom and prophecy in the collective Jewish soul; whenever we study Kabbalah, <b>the</b> inner wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torah, we reveal this union.It is important to clarify that Kabbalah is not a separate discipline from <b>the</b> traditional study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torah, it is rather the Torah’s inner soul (nishmata de’orayta, in <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zohar and the Arizal).Often a union of two things is represented in Kabbalah as an acronym composed of their initial letters. In this case, [...] "wisdom" [...] in Hebrew starts with the letter chet; [...] "prophecy" [...] begins with the letter nun; so their acronym spells the Hebrew word [...] "chen", which means [...] "grace", in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> beauty. Grace in particular refers to symmetric beauty, i.e., <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> beauty that we perceive in symmetry. This observation ties in with the fact that <b>the</b> inner wisdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Torah, Kabbalah is referred to as [...] "Chochmat ha’Chen", which we would literally translate as <b>the</b> wisdom <b>of</b> chen. Chen here is an acronym for another two words: [...] "Concealed Wisdom" [...] (חכמה נסתרה). But, following our analysis here, Kabbalah is called chen because it is <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> wisdom and prophecy...|$|R

5000|$|For the acceptance, the {{essential}} requirement {{is that the}} parties had each from a subjective perspective engaged in conduct manifesting their assent.

This is unsatisfactory, as one party has no way to know another's undisclosed intentions.
