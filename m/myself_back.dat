25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> up / I put one foot in front of the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{was first}} dubbed [...] "Magic" [...] as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Everett High School, when he {{recorded}} a triple-double of 36points, 18rebounds and 16assists. After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports {{writer for the}} Lansing State Journal, gave him the moniker despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious. In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8points and16.8 rebounds per game, and took his team to an overtime victory in the state championship game. Johnson dedicated the championship victory to his best friend Reggie Chastine, {{who was killed in}} a car accident the previous summer. He gave Chastine much of the credit for his development as a basketball player and as a person, saying years later, [...] "I doubted <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> then." [...] Johnson and Chastine were almost always together, playing basketball or riding around in Chastine's car. Upon learning of Chastine's death, Magic ran from his home, crying uncontrollably. Johnson, who finished his high school career with two All-State selections, was considered at the time to be the best high school player ever to come out of Michigan and was also named to the 1977 McDonald's All-American team.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} his car, Martin felt the {{championship}} was an achievement {{that he was}} unable to secure: [...] "They tell me {{a lot of people are}} having trouble anyway, but we didn't need to throw that away," [...] He said he was unaware that Yeley intended to make a pit stop and, from his viewpoint, it allowed Kenseth to pass him while Yeley was coming from the centre of the track. Yeley said the pit stop was planned and signalled his intentions to Martin for over a mile. He felt Martin placed him in a position to hit the backstretch wall. Hamlin said the first-lap crash that he was involved in was part of auto racing, and stated it was problematic being involved in difficulties in the Chase for the Nextel Cup: [...] "We checked up and somebody else (Waltrip) didn't. I put <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> there in qualifying. We'll take our lumps and go on." [...] Seventh-place finisher Raines was happy to hold the first position for 28 laps saying it was [...] "extra special" [...] to lead a race at Charlotte. Tom Bowles of Frontstretch opined that had the caution flag not been displayed for the three safety vehicles on lap nine, it could have resulted in [...] "one of the most disastrous accidents in NASCAR history." ...|$|E
500|$|Maggie Roswell left The Simpsons {{in spring}} 1999 after a pay dispute with Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs The Simpsons. The dispute was not {{revealed}} to the press at first; Fox originally reported that she decided to quit only because {{she was tired of}} flying between Denver and Los Angeles for the recording sessions. It was then announced by Roswell that she had asked for a raise, not only because she was tired of the traveling, but because of the increasing cost of flight tickets. Roswell was paid $1,500 to $2,000 per episode during the three seasons before she left, and she asked Fox for a raise to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not even cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Maggie Roswell told The Denver Post that [...] "they offered me a $150 raise. I mean, that's lint in Fox's pocket. But Fox wanted to prove a point, I guess. I was flying <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> and forth from Denver to L.A. It was exhausting. I loved doing the show and they thought that I would come back. But now I'm busy doing other things." [...] She further added that [...] "I was part of the backbone of The Simpsons and I don't think the money I asked for was exorbitant. I wasn't asking for what other cast members make. I was just trying to recoup all the costs I had in travel. If they'd flown me in, I'd still be working." [...] At that point, the six main cast members of the show were paid [...] $125,000 per episode. As a result of Maggie Roswell's departure, the Maude Flanders character was killed off in the episode [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily". Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Maggie Roswell's other characters.|$|E
2500|$|... "Your {{post on the}} Islamo-fascist hanging/murder of the two gay men {{confirmed}} for me that {{my recent}} decision to join the U.S. military was correct. I have to stuff <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> in the closet – something I thought I left a decade ago – but our war on terror trumps my personal comfort at this point. Whenever {{my friends and family}} criticize – I'll show 'em that link." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't that," [...] replied Hanscom, somberly. [...] "The plain truth is, Jack, I've lost {{interest}} in the work. If Miss McLaren is cleared--and she will be--she'll go East, and I don't see <b>myself</b> going <b>back</b> alone into the hills." ...|$|R
60|$|I stood swaying {{backward}} and forward for a moment, sick and dizzy with {{the horror of}} it. My eyes grew dim, and a mist seemed to fill the room. Then I felt <b>myself</b> sink <b>back</b> into my lover's arms, and memory became a blank. I had fainted.|$|R
60|$|It's no good; I can't help <b>myself.</b> I've gone <b>back</b> to him. Don't trouble {{about me}} any more. It's quite hopeless and useless.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a report}} by {{forensic}} psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner, Fritzl's mother is described as unpredictable and abusive. Fritzl referred to himself as an [...] "alibi" [...] child, meaning that his mother only gave birth to him to prove {{that she was not}} barren and could produce children. Fritzl claims that his pathological behavior is innate. He admits that he planned to lock his daughter up during his prison stint for the earlier rape conviction so that he could contain and express his [...] "evil side". He said, [...] "I was born to rape, and I held <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> for a relatively long time. I could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter." [...] The forensic psychiatrist diagnosed Fritzl as having a [...] "severe combined personality disorder" [...] which included borderline, schizotypal, and schizoid personalities and a sexual disorder and recommended that Fritzl receive psychiatric care {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to London in 1946, Lee {{was offered}} his old job back at Beecham's, with a {{significant}} raise, but he turned them down as [...] "I couldn't think <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> into the office frame of mind." [...] The Armed Forces were sending veterans with an education in the Classics to teach at universities, but Lee felt his Latin was too rusty and didn't care for the strict curfews. Having lunch with his cousin Nicolò Carandini, now the Italian Ambassador to Britain, Lee was detailing his war wounds when Carandini said, [...] "Why don't you become an actor, Christopher?" [...] Lee liked the idea and after assuaging his mother's protests by pointing to the successful Carandini performers in Australia, which included his great-grandmother Marie Carandini, {{who had been a}} successful opera singer, he met Nicolò's friend Filippo Del Giudice, a lawyer-turned-film producer. The head of Two Cities Films, part of the Rank Organisation, Giudice, [...] "looked me up and down... concluded that I was just what the industry had been looking for". He was sent to see Josef Somlo for a contract, who immediately announced that he was [...] "much too tall to be an actor". Somlo sent him to see Rank's David Henley and Olive Dodds, who signed him on a seven-year contract.|$|E
2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you make}} me quite want to ship <b>back</b> <b>myself.</b> You make me quite feel as if American City {{would be the best}} place for us." ...|$|R
60|$|I was now immeasurably alarmed, for I {{considered}} the vision either as an omen of my death, or, worse, as the fore-runner {{of an attack}} of mania. I threw <b>myself</b> passionately <b>back</b> in my chair, and for some moments buried my face in my hands. When I uncovered my eyes, the apparition was no longer apparent.|$|R
6000|$|LESLIE. Gad, Brodie, you and I {{might go}} into partnership. I <b>back</b> <b>myself</b> to watch outside, and I {{suppose you could}} {{do the work of}} skill within? ...|$|R

60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} I forced <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> {{to my own}} affair.|$|E
60|$|She smiled, {{and kissed}} her hand, and fluttered out of the room. Charming; {{perfectly}} charming. And yet I was ungrateful enough to wish <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> in Germany again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. That {{kiss you}} gave me put life into me--gave me {{strength}} to get away. I swore to <b>myself</b> I'd come <b>back</b> and thank you, alive or dead." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had nothing}} left for it then but to trust {{secretly}} that conjecture might have hurried me {{too fast and}} too far, to sustain the oppressive hour by reminders of the distorting and discolouring magic of jealousy. After a short and vain struggle, I found <b>myself</b> brought <b>back</b> captive to the old rack of suspense, tied down and strained anew.|$|R
6000|$|... "'You needn't talk to me,' Jimmy {{said before}} I'd {{more than half}} spoken what was in my mind. 'After that jump of mine I'll <b>back</b> <b>myself</b> against the whole farm gang.' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{when at last}} I {{had worked}} <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> to a firm {{position}} I hesitated to ascend, since I could not know that Thurid was not still awaiting me above.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my own fault, {{for giving}} in to her. If I'd kept <b>myself</b> <b>back,</b> my liver wouldn't have broken inside me, and I shouldn't have been sick. And I knew--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said he--'the {{last day}} of the last year saw my finale at the Weights and Measures. I did not live long--officially--to enjoy my promotion. I almost wish <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I'll take it <b>back</b> <b>myself</b> then, and at {{the same}} time I'll tell Penelope what a regular fellow you are, and punch in the foreman's face for good luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} explain <b>myself</b> by going <b>back</b> to our unlucky {{meeting in the}} Gardens with that reverend gentleman who was so obliging as to follow us both back to my house.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{something}} {{like what we}} used to be taught in the nursery," [...] I thought to <b>myself,</b> looking <b>back</b> through the long years (about a hundred of them, since you ask the question), to the time when I was a little child. And here an idea came into my head, and I asked him [...] "Aren't you one of the Fairies that teach children to be good?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{said nothing}} for a while, trying to put down an {{agitation}} which was beginning to show itself {{in spite of her}} effort. As for me, I was almost wishing <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> in the sponginghouse.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Lord bless me!' cried Mr Meagles, {{rubbing his}} {{hands with a}} relish, 'it was an uncommonly {{pleasant}} thing being in quarantine, wasn't it? Do you know, I have often wished <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> again? We were a capital party.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{that day}} never came. Haley grew impatient, and said, 'If you don't pay what you owe me, I {{will take your}} house and lands, and sell them to pay <b>myself</b> <b>back</b> all the money I have lent to you.' ...|$|E
50|$|Colin {{dropped by}} some weeks later {{while on a}} trip to the UK. Laying down bass tracks. Following this Battle, Billy and <b>Myself</b> flew <b>back</b> to Evesham for guitars and vocals. It was a happy, emotional, {{exciting}} session with a huge sense of relief that the Dog could nailed something solid for the first attempt in years. It sounded in the zone sonically that the amazing production values of OOT created.|$|R
40|$|Lee Meriwether (Bureau of Labor Statistics, State of Missouri), Saint Louis, Missouri, USA, letter, 1890 September 30, to Hamlin Garland.

60|$|When poor Meg {{was dragged}} out, I held her fast, and tumbled out with her; {{but even as}} we fell, she was rent from me, and I think I must have been half-stunned.
