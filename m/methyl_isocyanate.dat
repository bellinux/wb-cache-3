5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of <b>methyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with <b>methyl</b> <b>isocyanate,</b> and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|Warren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, {{visits the}} plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two {{additional}} tanks for storage of <b>methyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> to increase {{the output of the}} plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter in the Paris Match, and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an Associated Press reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining <b>methyl</b> <b>isocyanate</b> as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert {{the people in the}} vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.|$|E

In PA- 6. 6 scission of the alkylamide bond (CH 2 CONH) also takes place, resulting in <b>methyl</b> and <b>isocyanate</b> chain ends which can further dimerize to carbodiimides with elimination of CO 2 or trimerize to isocyanurate structures. In the presence of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), flammability, as measured by oxygen index, decreases because APP induces intumescent behaviour. The chemical interaction between APP and PA- 6. 6 and PA- 6. 10 leads to chain scission of the polyamide, with formation of a primary amide group and a phosphate ester which thermally degrades to give a vinyl chain end. APP also catalyses the alkylamide bond scission in PA- 6. 6. The intumescent behaviour might be due to blowing of the thermally stable polyphosphoric acid layer {{on the surface of the}} material by the gases evolved by the degradation of the polyamides, which occurs at lower temperature in the presence of APP...|$|R
40|$|Zusammenfassung Die vorliegenden Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit den Synthesen und Charakterisierungen multifunktioneller, Arylamin-haltiger Polymere, welche sich als photorefraktive(PR) -Materialien eignen. Die Glastemperaturen (Tg) der angestrebten Materialien liegen deutlich über Raumtemperatur, um so den Pockels-Mechanismus zum Aufbau des PR-Effektes zu favorisieren. Hierzu sind zwei synthetische Konzepte, basierend auf Maleinimid-Methylvinylisocyanat-Reaktiv-Polymeren und Triphenylamin-haltigen Polymeren, entwickelt worden. Im Rahmen des Reaktiv-Polymer-Konzeptes konnten PR-Materialien mit den bisher größten Beugungs-Effizienzen sowie den schnellsten Ansprechzeiten für multifunktionelle hoch-Tg-Polymere dargestellt werden. Hierfür wurden Maleinimid-Methylvinylisocyanat-Reaktiv-Polymere synthetisiert welche an der Imid-Position über Spacer-Gruppen mit Carbazol-Einheiten funktionalisiert sind. Die Tg´s der Polymere konnten zwischen 60 °C und 194 °C eingestellt werden. Die Isocyanat-Gruppen wurden dann polymeranlog mit hydroxyalkyl-funktionalisierten Chromophoren umgesetzt. Die Kinetik des PR-Effektes dieser Materialien wird durch die Ladungsträger-Beweglichkeiten in den Proben bestimmt. Eine Steigerung der Farbstoff-Konzentrationen erhöht die PR-Leistungen der Materialien, behindert jedoch deren Kinetik. Das Triphenylamin-Polymer-Konzept {{verwendet}} Triphenylamine als Lochleiter. Hierfür wurden die radikalischen Polymerisations-Verhalten der Monomere p-Diphenylaminostyrol (DPAS) und erstmals p-Ditoluylaminostyrol (DTAS) untersucht. Die Monomere wurden durch spontane, freie und kontrollierte radikalische Verfahren polymerisiert. Mittels eines TEMPO-Derivates gelang der Aufbau von Block-Copolymeren. Poly-DPAS konnte, im Gegensatz zu Poly-DTAS, polymeranlog tricyanovinyliert werden. Dadurch lassen sich PDPAS-block-PTPAS-Copolymere selektiv im PDPAS-Block tricyanovinylieren. Diese Materialien weisen eine Tendenzen zur Mikro-Phasen-Separation auf. Die Strukturierung von PDPAS konnte durch Photo-Polymerisation mit einer Auflösung von wenigen mm demonstriert werden. Carbazol und Triphenylamin-haltige Materialien wurden mittels Cyclo-Voltametrie untersucht. Abstract This contribution {{deals with}} the syntheses and characterisation of multifunctional arylamine containing polymers, which have photorefractive (PR) properties. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the desired materials is situated above room temperature in order to favour the Pockels-effect for the build up of the PR-effect. Two synthetic concepts based on maleimid <b>methyl</b> vinyl <b>isocyanate</b> reactive polymers and triphenylamine containing polymers have been developed. With in {{the scope of the}} reactive polymer concept PR-materials with the highest diffraction efficiencies and the fastest response times for multifunctional high-Tg-materials could be realised. Therefore maleimid <b>methyl</b> vinyl <b>isocyanate</b> reactive polymers have been developed where the imide positions have been functionalised with carbazole moieties via spacer groups. The Tg 2 ̆ 7 s of the polymers have been tuned between 60 °C and 194 °C. Isocyanate groups have then been polymer analogously reacted with hydroxyalkyl functionalised chromophores. The kinetics of these PR-materials is determined by the charge mobility of the materials. Increasing the concentration of the chromophore contents increases the PR-effect but also decreases its kinetics. The triphenylamine polymer concept uses triphenylamines as hole conductors. Therefore the radical polymerisation behaviour of the monomers p-diphenylaminostyrene (DPAS) {{and for the first time}} p-ditoluylaminostyren (DTAS) have been investigated. The monomers could be polymerised under spontaneous, free and controlled radical conditions. Using TEMPO-derivatives block copolymers have been realised. Poly-DPAS could be polymer analogously tricyanovinylated in contrast to poly-DTAS. Because of that PDPAS-block-PDTAS copolymers could be selectively tricyanovinylated in the PDPAS block. Those materials show a mikrophase separation tendency. Structuring of PDPAS was demonstrated by photo polymerisation with a resolution of a few mm. Carbazol and triphenylamine containing materials have been analysed by cyclic voltametrie...|$|R

These boards were tested to fulfill the quality standards of the certifier organism “Engineering Wood Association” (APA), since presently they are not being reached. It compared Chilean native wood OSB with common OSB (50 % native and 50 % Pinus radiata wood) as a control. The effect of two densities (700 kg m- 3, 640 kg m- 3) and four combinations of adhesive (phenol formaldehyde, FF, in the faces and <b>methyl</b> di - <b>isocyanate,</b> MDI, in the core) over the physical and mechanical properties (concentrated static load, dry flexion, cycled humid flexion and linear expansion) was analyzed.
