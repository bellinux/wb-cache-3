Included in this range of Philips monitors are LTC 2009 (like this one), LTC 2012, LTC 2017 and LTC 2020 Series monochrome monitors. They offer high-performance images with a resolution of 900 TVL (TV-Lines), {{or in the case of}} the LTC 2017 monitor, 700 TVL, making them ideal for remote viewing and video applications.

An instrument which can real-time <b>monitor</b> <b>housing</b> deformation becomes particularly important. In this paper, taking the invented gravity pendulum tilting monitor for example, described its working principle and the characteristic of easy to use, accurate measurement and practical.

Mainly in the following three aspects: First of all, China is a large coal-producing country, according to statistics, China's coal output in 2011 was equivalent to 1. 956 billion tons of oil.

5000|$|In 1974, the <b>Monitor</b> <b>House</b> {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places because of its unusual architecture. [...] Only two or three <b>monitor</b> <b>houses,</b> {{featuring}} an elevated center, are known to exist in Ohio, and the one in St. Paris is architecturally the most well-preserved; consequently, it is considered historically significant statewide. [...] In contrast, a similar <b>monitor</b> <b>house</b> in Chillicothe, known as [...] "Tanglewood," [...] is only considered locally significant.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{inadequate}} local data for planning is chronic. The ex-pense {{of data collection}} forces many planning efforts to rely on decennial census data. However, county level housing data can be assembled an-nually at minimal cost. The Annual Housing Report for Kentucky has presented such data since 1979, in-cluding various household and hous-ing estimates. The data are derived directly from administrative records or from estimation models that in-corporate administrative data. Esti-mation models {{have been developed for}} households (by age of house-holder and type of household), me-dian family income, and mobile home shipments. No primary data collection is involved. Planners out-side Kentucky can use these models and similar data to <b>monitor</b> <b>housing</b> trends, conduct market analysis, and analyze housing affordability, short-ages, and production patterns...|$|E
40|$|In the new Elettra full energy injector, bunch charge {{measurements}} will {{be performed}} by different types of cur-rent transformers (CT), depending on their position (sin-gle pass or multi pass sections). In the single pass sec-tions (Linac and Transfer lines) {{a new type of}} current trans-former (in-flange CT by Bergoz) will be used. Main advan-tage of this device is a compact and reliable design; they are also specially suited in space critical application. For the booster ring a standard DC current transformer will be used to measure the DC component of the circulating beam current. The housing has been developed in house, includ-ing the magnetic shield and the ceramic gap in the vacuum chamber. Furthermore, calculations of the trapped modes in the current <b>monitor</b> <b>housing</b> are described. Longitudi-nal coupling impedance and loss factors for these resonant modes are estimated and we showed that dissipated power is not critical with ELETTRA booster parameters...|$|E
40|$|A cradle-to-grave {{environmental}} {{life cycle}} assessment (LCA) of a few poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) based composites has been performed and was compared to commodity petrochemical polymers. The end products studied are a cathode ray tube (CRT) <b>monitor</b> <b>housing</b> (conventionally produced from high-impact polystyrene, HIPS) and the internal panels of an average car (conventionally produced from glass-fibers-filled polypropylene, PP-GF). The environmental impact is evaluated {{on the basis of}} nonrenewable energy use (NREU) and global warming potential over a 100 years time horizon (GWP 100). Sugar cane bagasse (SCB) and nanoscaled organophilic montmorillonite (OMMT) are used as PHB fillers. The results obtained show that, despite the unsatisfying mechanical properties of PHB composites, {{depending on the type of}} filler and on the product, it is possible to reach lower environmental impacts than by use of conventional petrochemical polymers. These savings are mainly related to the PHB production process, while there are no improvements related to composites preparation. SCBbased composites seem to be environmentally superior to clay-based ones...|$|E
