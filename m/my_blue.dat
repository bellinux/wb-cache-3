25|$|Weir {{was born}} in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, to parents John and Patti Weir. He is of Norwegian heritage, and has a brother, Brian, who is four years younger. Weir was raised in Quarryville, Pennsylvania, a town in {{southern}} Lancaster County. As a child, he was a successful equestrian, competing with his pony, <b>My</b> <b>Blue</b> Shadow, an Arabian-Shetland cross.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he began}} skating at the {{relatively}} late age of 12, Weir progressed {{quickly through the}} ranks. He performed an Axel jump in his first week on ice skates. His parents {{could not afford to}} support both his figure skating and his equestrian pursuits, so Weir gave up his pony, <b>My</b> <b>Blue</b> Shadow, and turned his focus completely to figure skating. He competed in pair skating with Jodi Rudden on the juvenile and intermediate levels, but gave it up to concentrate on single skating.|$|E

500|$|Louis J. Sebille {{was born}} on November 21, 1915 in Harbor Beach, Michigan. He {{attended}} Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. After his graduation from the university in the 1930s he moved to Chicago, Illinois where {{he worked as a}} Master of Ceremonies in several Chicago nightclubs under the nickname [...] "Lou Reynolds." [...] He was described as [...] "a handsome glib master of ceremonies who used to wow the customers with his own parody of <b>My</b> <b>Blue</b> Heaven". Sebille married and his wife gave birth to a son in December 1949.|$|E
500|$|Robey {{was engaged}} to play the title role in the 1905 {{pantomime}} Queen of Hearts. The show was considered risqué by the theatrical press. In one scene Robey accidentally sat on his crown before bellowing [...] "Assistance! Methinks I have sat upon a hedgehog"; in another sketch, the comedian mused, [...] "Then there's Mrs Simkins, the swank! Many's the squeeze she's had of <b>my</b> <b>blue</b> bag on washing day." [...] Robey scored a further hit with the show the following year, in Birmingham, which Cotes describes as [...] "the most famous of all famous Birmingham Theatre Royal pantomimes". Robey incorporated [...] "The Dresser", a music hall sketch taken from his own repertoire, into the show. Over {{the next few years}} he continued to tour the music hall circuit both in London and the English provinces and recorded two songs, [...] "What Are You Looking at Me For?" [...] and [...] "The Mayor of Mudcumdyke", which were later released by the Gramophone and Typewriter Company.|$|E
500|$|While at Magdalen College, Wilde became {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements. He wore his hair long, openly scorned [...] "manly" [...] sports though he occasionally boxed, and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers, lilies, sunflowers, blue china and other objets d'art, once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly, [...] "I find it harder and harder every day to live up to <b>my</b> <b>blue</b> china." [...] The line quickly became famous, accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness. Some elements disdained the aesthetes, but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose. Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students, and dealt with them single-handedly, surprising critics. By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth, and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts. This attitude resulted in his being rusticated for one term, when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof. Mahaffy.|$|E

Swift performed [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] as the concert's penultimate performance. She dressed in a black, knee-length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a skull and cross bones across it, playing an acoustic guitar. Swift requested for the audience to raise their cell phones in order to simulate a sky filled with stars, when the song reached the lyrics [...] "He said the way <b>my</b> <b>blue</b> eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said that's a lie." [...] She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait's 2007 United States tour, and selected dates for Brad Paisley's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007. During mid-2007, Swift engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw's and Faith Hill's joint tour, Soul2Soul II Tour (2006–07), where she again performed [...] "Tim McGraw". Swift performed the song while she was again opening for Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008.|$|E
