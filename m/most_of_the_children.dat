5|$|The {{cutting of}} the first sod for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway was an {{altogether}} grander occasion. It took place on 20 July 1899, and was reported at great length in the Epworth Bells newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter {{of one of the}} Directors, after which a luncheon for {{a large number of people}} was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels.

More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal, where <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people. Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter.

There was an active market in human trafficking of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indian captivity.|$|E
5|$|The Knapps {{study in}} Monroe County, Indiana, found {{time-out}} and {{times to be}} {{by far the most}} prevalent terms in the 1970s. Variations included I've got times and time. Very few children reported the more traditional kings, queens or I've got kings X. The authors also reported that these terms were popular over many areas of the US and in American schools abroad. To be functional a truce term must be understood and honoured by <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> playing together. Time-out clearly derives from the use of intermissions in timed sports and apparently came into the language with the popularization of organized or timed sports and with the advent of such sports in elementary schools and on television. Historically the earliest reports for the use of time-out or time as a truce term were 1935 and 1936. However, {{only a small number of}} respondents reported anything other than time-out and its derivatives in use during the 1960s. The few alternatives included pax, safe, base or home-base and freeze with one small area of fins (Mount Vernon). The Knapps reported that time-out had, since the 1950s, supplanted kings ex as the most popular truce term.|$|E

50|$|Another {{aspect of}} {{individual}} education is child-led learning, {{which is called}} unschooling when it encompasses <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> experiences. Child-led learning means incorporating mathematically rich projects that stem from personal interests and passions. Educators who support child-led learning need to provide tasks that are open to interpretation, {{and be ready to}} improvise, rather than prepare lessons ahead of time. This modern approach often involves seizing opportunities for discovery, and learning as <b>the</b> <b>child's</b> curiosity demands. This departure from conventional structured learning leaves <b>the</b> <b>child</b> free to explore his/her innate desires and curiosities.
