5|$|After the {{overthrow}} of the Mongol Yuan dynasty by the Ming dynasty in 1368, <b>Manchuria</b> remained under control of the Mongols of the Northern Yuan dynasty based in Mongolia. Naghachu, a former Yuan official and a Uriankhai general of the Northern Yuan dynasty, won hegemony over the Mongol tribes in <b>Manchuria</b> (Liaoyang province of the former Yuan dynasty). He grew strong in the northeast, with forces large enough (numbering hundreds of thousands) to threaten invasion of the newly founded Ming dynasty in order to restore the Mongols to power in China. The Ming decided to defeat him instead of waiting for the Mongols to attack. In 1387 the Ming sent a military campaign to attack Naghachu, which concluded with the surrender of Naghachu and Ming conquest of <b>Manchuria.</b>|$|E
5|$|The early Ming {{court could}} not, and did not, aspire {{to the control}} imposed upon the Jurchens in <b>Manchuria</b> by the Mongols, yet it created a norm of {{organization}} that would ultimately serve as the principal vehicle for the relations with peoples along the northeast frontiers. By {{the end of the}} Hongwu reign, the essentials of a policy toward the Jurchens had taken shape. Most of the inhabitants of <b>Manchuria,</b> except for the wild Jurchens, were at peace with China. The Ming had created many guards (衛, wei) in <b>Manchuria,</b> but the creation of a guard did not necessarily imply political control. In 1409, the Ming dynasty under Yongle Emperor established the Nurgan Regional Military Commission {{on the banks of the}} Amur River, and Yishiha, a eunuch of Haixi Jurchen derivation, was ordered to lead an expedition to the mouth of the Amur to pacify the Wild Jurchens. After the death of Yongle Emperor, the Nurgan Regional Military Commission was abolished in 1435, and the Ming court ceased to have substantial activities there, although the guards continued to exist in <b>Manchuria.</b> By the late Ming period, Ming political presence in <b>Manchuria</b> had waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the Great Wall as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside the}} wall: China proper, <b>Manchuria,</b> and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of <b>Manchuria,</b> considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into <b>Manchuria</b> alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, the 395th Guards Heavy Self-Propelled Artillery Regiment was {{transferred}} to the Far East for the Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria.</b> Snetkov became its chief of intelligence and assistant chief of staff for intelligence, and ended the war with the rank of captain. Between 8 August and 3 September, the regiment fought in the Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria</b> attached to the 5th Army, and on 8 September he received a second Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, for providing crucial intelligence gained from reconnaissance to his unit.|$|E
5|$|At 04:00 on August 9 word reached Tokyo {{that the}} Soviet Union {{had broken the}} Neutrality Pact, {{declared}} war on Japan, and launched an invasion of <b>Manchuria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even though Lazar Kaganovich and Kalinin {{were both}} {{commissioned}} {{before the end}} of the war, they saw no action during the Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria</b> in 1945; in any event, Lazar Kaganovich was not fully completed until 29 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the Japanese Kwantung Army in <b>Manchuria</b> in August 1945 was the last {{military}} operation in which Soviet T-26s were used.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was reformed in the Far East in November 1944 and {{fought in the}} Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria</b> before being disbanded postwar in late 1945.|$|E
5|$|Too weak {{to resist}} Japan, China {{appealed to the}} League of Nations for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being {{condemned}} for its incursion into <b>Manchuria.</b> The two nations then fought several battles, in Shanghai, Rehe and Hebei, until the Tanggu Truce was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in <b>Manchuria,</b> and Chahar and Suiyuan. After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.|$|E
5|$|Two armies were {{dispatched}} {{against the}} Song. One army captured {{the provincial capital}} of Taiyuan, while the other besieged the Song capital of Kaifeng. The Jurchens withdrew when the Song promised to pay an annual indemnity. As the Song dynasty weakened, the Jin armies conducted a second siege against Kaifeng. The city was captured and looted, and the Song dynasty emperor, Emperor Qinzong, was imprisoned and taken north to <b>Manchuria</b> as a hostage. The remainder of the Song court retreated to southern China, beginning the Southern Song period of Chinese history. Two puppet governments, first the Da Chu dynasty and later the state of Qi, were established by the Jin as buffer states between the Song and <b>Manchuria.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Chief of the Intelligence Division, Matsui was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Chiang Kai-shek, who was attempting to end the civil war in China and unify the country under his leadership. Matsui hoped that Chiang would succeed and form a strong partnership with Japan to resist both Western influence in Asia and communism. However, Matsui's tenure in office was punctuated by a series of crises. Against Matsui's advice the Japanese government sent troops to the Chinese city of Jinan in 1928 to protect Japanese property and civilians, but they ended up clashing with the Chinese Army. Matsui headed to Jinan to help settle the affair, but while he was still there Japanese army officers assassinated Zhang Zuolin, the warlord leader of <b>Manchuria.</b> Matsui, who had been a supporter of Zhang, immediately left for <b>Manchuria</b> to find out what had happened. He demanded that the officers responsible for the assassination be punished.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty {{with senior}} commanders on the distant war fronts was anticipated. Three princes of the Imperial Family who held {{military}} commissions were dispatched on August 14 {{to deliver the}} news personally. Prince Tsuneyoshi Takeda went to Korea and <b>Manchuria,</b> Prince Yasuhiko Asaka to the China Expeditionary Army and China Fleet, and Prince Kan'in Haruhito to Shanghai, South China, Indo-China and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} any challenge to his legitimacy as emperor {{of a united}} China, Wanyan Liang ordered the execution of all male members of the Song and Liao royal families residing in Jin territory. The execution of 130 members of the two royal clans {{in the span of}} a few months proved unpopular, and the Khitans soon revolted in <b>Manchuria.</b> They refused to be drafted into the army, maintaining that conscription would leave the homeland of the Khitans unprotected from rival tribes on the steppes. Wanyan Liang rebuffed their demands. The Khitan rebels killed several Jurchen officials. The rebellion was fragmented, and there were separate plans either to spread the revolt further by operating from Shangjing, the former Liao capital, or to move the Khitan people from <b>Manchuria</b> to Central Asia, where the Kara-Khitan Khanate had formed after the demise of Liao. Wanyan Liang was forced to divert resources and men away from the war effort to suppress the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore an apron, a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes could still be observed among shamans from <b>Manchuria</b> and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} began re-forming from a {{cadre of}} rifle brigades on 22 November 1944 {{as part of the}} Far Eastern Front, commanded by Colonel Ivan Teplyakov. The division fought in the Sungari Offensive, part of the Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria,</b> which began on 9 August following the Soviet declaration of war on Japan after the American Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The division advanced as part of the 5th Separate Rifle Corps (an independent unit reporting directly to the front command) on the left of the 15th Army, with the objective of taking the towns of Raohe, Baoqing, and Boli in eastern Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state in <b>Manchuria</b> in northeast China. Attacking alongside the 172nd Tank Brigade, the division crossed the Amur River and captured Raohe and its fortified area from troops of the Japanese 135th Infantry Division on 10 August. The division and its parent corps then advanced southwest towards Baoqing, which was taken by the 172nd Brigade on 14 August. On 19 August, the corps linked up with troops of the 35th Army at Boli. After reaching Boli the corps' role in the fighting was effectively over, as Japanese resistance in <b>Manchuria</b> collapsed. The division was disbanded in late 1945 along with its corps in the Far Eastern Military District.|$|E
5|$|The {{modern times}} saw nations {{struggle}} for the control of rail routes: The Trans-Siberian Railway {{was intended to be}} used by the Russian government for control of <b>Manchuria</b> and later China; the German forces wanted to establish Berlin-Baghdad Railway in order to influence the Near East; and the Austrian government planned a route from Vienna to Salonika for control of the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of the last {{remaining}} emperor, Song China was eliminated, while Kublai Khan established the realm of the Yuan dynasty over China proper, Mongolia, <b>Manchuria,</b> Tibet, and Korea. For nearly a century to follow, the Chinese would live under a dynasty established by Mongols. However, a native Han Chinese dynasty would be established once more with the Ming dynasty in 1368.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Ueshiba {{was invited}} to teach {{at a number of}} {{military}} institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts instructor at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead. He also became a visiting instructor at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy after being challenged by (and defeating) General Makoto Miura, another student of Takeda Sōkaku's Daitō-ryū. Takeda himself met Ueshiba for the last time around 1935, while Ueshiba was teaching at the Osaka headquarters of the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Frustrated by the appearance of his teacher, who was openly critical of Ueshiba's martial arts and who appeared intent on taking over the classes there, Ueshiba left Osaka during the night, bowing to the residence in which Takeda was staying and thereafter avoiding all contact with him. Between 1940 and 1942 he made several visits to Manchukuo (Japanese occupied <b>Manchuria)</b> where he was the principal martial arts instructor at Kenkoku University. Whilst in <b>Manchuria,</b> he met and defeated the sumo wrestler Tenryū Saburō during a demonstration.|$|E
5|$|Han {{was born}} on 3 August 1900 in Hamhung, {{in the north of}} Korea. His father was a county magistrate. He {{graduated}} from middle school in 1919 and attended Nippon University in Tokyo from 1921 to 1924, studying sociology. He emigrated to <b>Manchuria</b> in 1925 but returned to Seoul in the south in 1927. In 1944, he returned to his native Hamhung. After the liberation of Korea he settled in Pyongyang.|$|E
5|$|In December 1932, Hu {{was briefly}} {{arrested by the}} German police after {{attending}} a protest against the Japanese invasion of <b>Manchuria.</b> Two months later, following the Nazi Machtergreifung, Adolf Hitler suppressed the German Communist Party and threw thousands of party members in jail. Hu Lanqi was arrested and imprisoned for three months. When the news reached China, Soong Ching-ling and the prominent writer Lu Xun formally petitioned the German consulate in Shanghai and secured her release. She was deported to France and moved to England soon afterward.|$|E
5|$|In June 1937, Abbe {{enlisted in}} the Imperial Japanese Army, and was {{subsequently}} posted to a garrison in <b>Manchuria.</b> He served there for four years, during which time {{he was unable to}} continue training in judo but was able to practise kendo. While abroad, he began formulating his Kyushindo philosophy. His tour of duty ended in 1941, and he returned to Kyoto, where he met and married his wife Keiko. Abbe did not remain a civilian for long, however, since Japan entered World War II near the end of that year.|$|E
5|$|In September 1931, Japan invaded <b>Manchuria.</b> On 25 February 1933, {{based on}} the report by the Lytton Commission, the League of Nations agreed that Japan's {{invasion}} had violated Chinese sovereignty. Refusing to accept the organization's judgment, Japan withdrew from the League of Nations the same day. Immediately following, Japan also withdrew from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, thus removing all restrictions on the number and size of her capital ships. Haruna was reactivated and assigned to the First Battleship Division on 20 May 1933.|$|E
5|$|In September 1931, Japanese army units {{invaded the}} Chinese {{province}} of <b>Manchuria,</b> transforming {{it into the}} puppet state of Manchukuo. In December 1932, Hiei was reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy's training squadron. On 25 February, the League of Nations ruled that Japan had violated Chinese sovereignty and international law in her invasion of <b>Manchuria.</b> Refusing to accept the League's judgment, the Empire of Japan withdrew from the League the same day. This also signaled its exit from the Washington and London Naval Treaties, which removed all restrictions on the Imperial Japanese Navy's construction of capital ships. From the end of May 1933 to 13 August, Hiei received upgrades that allowed her to perform regular duties for the Emperor, and she served as the Emperor's observation ship for the Imperial Naval Review three days later. From January to March 1934, her No. 4 turret and ammunition magazine were refitted. In November 1935, Hiei served as the Emperor's ship for his official visit to the Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures.|$|E
5|$|Muller's Asian {{trip was}} comprehensive. He visited British India and Ceylon, Burma, Malaysia and the Philippines and French Indochina, {{travelled}} extensively through the Dutch East Indies, and returned via Japan, Korea – {{where he had}} an audience with the last Korean emperor –, <b>Manchuria,</b> China, and Siberia. Muller's visit to Japan triggered a lively interest {{in this country and}} its economic development potential. Back in the Netherlands he presented his views on the country in several speeches, brochures, and articles, mainly {{under the auspices of the}} Comité Nederland-Japan (Dutch-Japanese Committee).|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} dominated Soviet decisions {{concerning the}} Far East. Chief among these was gaining unrestricted {{access to the}} Pacific Ocean. The year-round ice-free areas of the Soviet Pacific coastline—Vladivostok in particular—could be blockaded by air and sea from Sakhalin island and the Kurile Islands. Acquiring these territories, thus guaranteeing free access to the Soya Strait, was their primary objective. Secondary objectives were leases for the Chinese Eastern Railway, Southern <b>Manchuria</b> Railway, Dairen, and Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the Pacific Fleet in 1943. She {{was ordered to}} prepare for transfer to the Soviet Northern Fleet via the Northern Sea Route on 24 April 1943 and extensive preparations were made for the voyage. They included the installation of special propellers with removable blades and the strengthening of her hull to withstand ice pressure. The transfer was canceled without explanation on 1 June 1943, but the alterations remained in place until 1944. She remained inactive during the Soviet invasion of <b>Manchuria</b> in 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 156th Fighter Air Corps of the 4th Air Army was {{the next}} unit to receive the La-7 in October 1944. At one point during the month, they had {{fourteen}} aircraft simultaneously unserviceable with engine failures. By 1 January 1945 there were 398 La-7s in front-line service of which 107 were unserviceable. By 9 May 1945 this had increased to 967 aircraft, of which only 169 were unserviceable. For the invasion of Japanese <b>Manchuria,</b> 313 La-7s were assigned and only 28 of these were unserviceable on 9 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{submarine}} {{campaign and}} the mining of Japanese coastal waters had largely destroyed the Japanese merchant fleet. With few natural resources, Japan was dependent on raw materials, particularly oil, imported from <b>Manchuria</b> {{and other parts of}} the East Asian mainland, and from the conquered territory in the Dutch East Indies. The destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet, combined with the strategic bombing of Japanese industry, had wrecked Japan's war economy. Production of coal, iron, steel, rubber, and other vital supplies was only a fraction of that before the war.|$|E
5|$|The Jin–Song Wars were {{a series}} of armed {{conflicts}} conducted by the Jurchen Jin dynasty and the Song dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Jurchens were a Tungusic–speaking tribal confederation native to <b>Manchuria.</b> They overthrew the Khitan Liao dynasty in 1122 and declared {{the establishment of a}} new dynasty, the Jin. Diplomatic relations between the Jin and Song deteriorated, and the Jurchens first declared war on the Song dynasty in November 1125.|$|E
5|$|The Kuomintang (KMT) {{party in}} China {{launched}} a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon {{embroiled in a}} civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, used the Mukden Incident as a pretext to launch an invasion of <b>Manchuria</b> and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet-style {{regimes that}} {{arose in the}} Bloc not only {{reproduced}} Soviet command economies, but also adopted the brutal methods employed by Joseph Stalin and the Soviet secret police in order to suppress both real and potential opposition. In Asia, the Red Army had overrun <b>Manchuria</b> {{in the last month}} of the war, and it went on to occupy the large swathe of Korean territory located north of the 38th parallel.|$|E
5|$|The dating of the Heilongjiang hand-gun {{is based}} on battles in 1287 and 1288 that were fought near {{the site where the}} archaeologists {{discovered}} the hand-gun. The battles were part of Mongol prince Nayan's rebellion in <b>Manchuria</b> against Kublai Khan, the emperor of the Yuan dynasty. An account of the 1287 and 1288 battles is documented in the History of Yuan, which references the use of hand cannons.|$|E
5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in flying, and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career flying the F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered to fly in the Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and flying the F-86 Sabre. During a four-day time period in early 1953, Overton claimed five MiG-15 victories in MiG alley, certifying him as a flying ace. However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into <b>Manchuria</b> for his victories.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been}} found across the globe in North America, Europe, Africa, Japan, China, Mongolia, <b>Manchuria,</b> Madagascar, Argentina, and Antarctica, with fossilized teeth giving {{credence}} {{to the possibility that}} they inhabited Australia as well. They first appeared in the mid-Jurassic Period (late Bathonian stage, about 167 million years ago) and survived {{until the end of the}} Cretaceous (Maastrichtian stage, 66 ma), existing until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The presence of dromaeosaurids as early as the Middle Jurassic has been suggested by the discovery of isolated fossil teeth, though no dromaeosaurid body fossils {{have been found}} from this period.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to <b>Manchuria.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring <b>Manchuria.</b> She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an observation balloon to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
