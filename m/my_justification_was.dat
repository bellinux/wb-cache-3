My justification," [...] said Mrs. Gereth, sitting there warmly and, in the lucidity of her thought, which {{nevertheless}} hung back a little, dropping {{her eyes on the}} gravel--"my justification was all the past. <b>My</b> <b>justification</b> <b>was</b> the cruelty--" [...] But at this, with a short, sharp gesture, she checked herself. [...] "It's too good of me to talk--now." [...] She produced these sentences with a cold patience, as if addressing Fleda in the girl's virtual and actual character of Owen's representative. Our young lady crept to and fro before the bench, combating the sense that it was occupied by a judge, looking at her boot-toes, reminding herself in doing so of Mona, and lightly crunching the pebbles as she walked. She moved about because she was afraid, putting off from moment to moment the exercise of the courage she had been sure she possessed. That courage would all come to her if she could only be equally sure that what she should be called upon to do for Owen would be to suffer. She had wondered, while Mrs. Gereth spoke, how that lady would describe her justification. She had described it as if to be irreproachably fair, give her adversary the benefit of every doubt, and then dismiss the question forever. [...] "Of course," [...] Mrs. Gereth went on, [...] "if we didn't succeed in showing him at Poynton the ground we took, it's simply that he shuts his eyes. What I supposed was that you would have given him your opinion that if I was the woman so signally to assert myself, I'm also the woman to rest upon it imperturbably enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|Let me {{acknowledge}} with boundless pleasure the singularly {{generous and}} beautiful letter, signed by your great and dazzling array and reinforced by a correspondingly bright material gage, which reached {{me on my}} recent birthday, April 15th. It has moved me as brave gifts and benedictions can only do when they come as signal surprises. I seem {{to wake up to}} an air of breathing good will the full sweetness of which I had never yet tasted; though I ask myself now, as a second thought, how the large kindness and hospitality in which I have so long and so consciously lived among you could fail to act itself out according to its genial nature and by some inspired application. The perfect grace with which it has embraced the just-past occasion for its happy thought affects me, I ask you to believe, with an emotion too deep for stammering words. I was drawn to London long years ago as by the sense, felt from still earlier, of all the interest and association I should find here, and I now see how my faith was to sink deeper foundations than I could presume ever to measure--how <b>my</b> <b>justification</b> <b>was</b> both stoutly to grow and wisely to wait. It is so wonderful indeed to me as I count up your numerous and various, your dear and distinguished friendly names, taking in all they recall and represent, that I permit myself to feel at once highly successful and extremely proud. I had never in the least understood that I was the one or signified that I was the other, but you have made a great difference. You tell me together, making one rich tone of your many voices, almost the whole story of my social experience, which I have reached the right point for living over again, with all manner of old times and places renewed, old wonderments and pleasures reappeased and recaptured--so that there is scarce one of your ranged company but makes good the particular connection, quickens the excellent relation, lights some happy train and flushes with some individual colour. I pay you my very best respects while I receive from your two hundred and fifty pair of hands, and more, the admirable, the inestimable bowl, and while I engage to sit, with every accommodation to the so markedly indicated [...] "one of you," [...] my illustrious friend Sargent. With every accommodation, I say, but with this one condition that you yourselves, in your strength and goodness, remain guardians of the result of his labour--even as I remain all faithfully and gratefully yours, ...|$|E

60|$|I {{should not}} venture thus to speak {{strongly}} if <b>my</b> <b>justification</b> <b>were</b> {{not to be}} found in the simplest and most obvious facts,--if it needed more than an appeal to the most notorious truths to justify my assertion, that the improvement of natural knowledge, whatever direction it has taken, and however low the aims of those who may have commenced it--has not only conferred practical benefits on men, but, in so doing, has effected a revolution in their conceptions of the universe and of themselves, and has profoundly altered their modes of thinking and their views of right and wrong. I say that natural knowledge, seeking to satisfy natural wants, has found the ideas which can alone still spiritual cravings. I say that natural knowledge, in desiring to ascertain the laws of comfort, has been driven to discover those of conduct, and to lay the foundations of a new morality.|$|R

[...] "Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."

40|$|When I {{say that}} my belief that p is fallible or fallibly justified, do I mean to say only that my belief or <b>my</b> <b>justification</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, or do I mean to say more than this? This {{question}} is useful for navigating the literature on fallibilism in contemporary epistemology. Most epistemologists agree that certainty is a rare commodity, {{and that we are}} error-prone in some sense. They also agree that neither of these things is incompatible with knowledge. But there exists no consensus amongst epistemologists regarding what we mean, or ought to mean, when we describe ourselves as fallible. This dissertation considers some of the myriad things that are, or may be, at stake here. I begin by defending an uncertainty account of fallibility. I then propose an answer to the question: is fallible knowledge possible? This question invites us to consider the reasons for thinking that the concept of knowledge is incompatible with fallibility. For example, what link is there (if any) between the motivations for infallibilism and internalism? How we answer these questions, I contend, depends upon our attitude towards epistemic circularity. I will argue, in effect, that there is no middle path between the traditional Scylla of dogmatism and Charybdis of scepticism. My argument for this is ultimately based on the intuitive incompatibility of knowledge and epistemic circularity. I formulate and defend this argument. Along the way I also weigh the merits of other arguments against different types of fallibilism...|$|R

60|$|How shall I {{appear before}} you again after so long an interval? It seems that now I ought rather {{to begin with}} an apology for writing, than for not having written during a space of almost twelve months. I have blamed myself not a little; yet {{not so much as}} I should have done had I not known that the main cause of my silence has been the affection I feel for you; on which account it is not so easy to me to write upon trifling or daily occurrences to you as it would be to write to another whom I loved less. Accordingly these have not had power to tempt me to take up the pen; and in the mean while, from my more {{intimate}} concerns I have abstained, partly because I do not, in many cases, myself like to see the reflection of them upon paper, and still more because it is my wish at all times, when I think of the state in which your health and spirits may happen to be, that my letter should be wholly free from melancholy, and breathe nothing but cheerfulness and pleasure.

40|$|This paper {{shows an}} {{alternative}} {{way in which}} compatriot partiality could be justified {{within the framework of}} global distributive justice. Philosophers who argue that compatriot partiality is similar to racial partiality capture something correct about compatriot partiality. However, the analogy should not lead us to comprehensively reject compatriot partiality. We can justify compatriot partiality on the same grounds that liberation movements and affirmative action have been justified. Hence, given cosmopolitan demands of justice, special consideration for the economic well-being of your nation as a whole is justified if and only if the country it identifies is an oppressed developing nation in an unjust global order. This <b>justification</b> <b>is</b> incomplete. We also need to say why Person A, qua national of Country A, is justified in helping her compatriots in Country A over similarly or slightly more oppressed non-compatriots in Country B. I argue that Person A’s partiality towards her compatriots admits further vindication because it is part of an oppressed group’s project of self-emancipation, which is preferable to paternalistic emancipation. Finally, I identify three benefits in <b>my</b> <b>justification</b> for compatriot partiality. First, I do not offer a blanket justification for all forms of compatriot partiality. Partiality between members of oppressed groups is only a temporary effective measure designed to level an unlevel playing field. Second, because history attests that sovereign republics could arise as a collective response to colonial oppression, justifying compatriot partiality on the grounds that I have identified is conducive to the development of sovereignty and even democracy in poor countries, thereby avoiding problems of infringement that many humanitarian poverty alleviation efforts encounter. Finally, <b>my</b> <b>justification</b> for compatriot partiality complies with the implicit cosmopolitan commitment to the realizability of global justice theories.

40|$|One {{important}} distinction {{in the debate}} over epistemic <b>justification</b> <b>is</b> the one between propositional and doxastic justification. Roughly, while doxastic <b>justification</b> <b>is</b> a property of beliefs, propositional <b>justification</b> <b>is</b> a property of propositions.

According to the opposing view, the direction of explanation needs to be reversed, and doxastic <b>justification</b> should <b>be</b> seen as primary.

40|$|Shareholder wealth {{maximization}} (SWM) is {{the notion}} that the immediate operating goal of a corporation is and should be to maximize return on equity capital (Windsor, 2010). This notion is as controversial among the general population as it is common to those working in business. This presents us with a problem: most people think SWM is a blatantly bad idea from the viewpoint of ethics. If managers ought to maximize shareholder wealth at all times than how can other legitimate interests be taken into account? Given the moral suspicion of SWM, it stands in need of a moral <b>justification.</b> <b>My</b> question <b>is</b> whether SWM, or other variations of a profit principle which has shareholders as its main beneficiaries, can be justified ethically. In order to evaluate this, I will go over three approaches that attempt to justify SWM or alternative formulations of it, and one approach which denies profit motives altogether. I will argue that the approaches considered here either miss the mark of business ethics, or only partially hit it. I will then suggest an alternative way of looking at business ethics, on which profit motives like SWM seem to lose some of their value...|$|R
