25|$|Techniques {{other than}} card {{counting}} can swing {{the advantage of}} casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques {{are based on the}} value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by Edward O. Thorp. One technique, mainly applicable in <b>multi-deck</b> games, involves tracking groups of cards (also known as slugs, clumps, or packs) during the play of the shoe, following them through the shuffle, and then playing and betting accordingly when those cards come into play from the new shoe. Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.|$|E

50|$|In <b>multi-deck</b> games, {{the first}} of {{identical}} cards to be played (say two queens of clubs) wins the trick. In a more complicated variant, identical cards cancel each other, leading to the possibility (if the number of players is even) of an entire trick being canceled out.|$|E
50|$|Most {{artillery}} fuzes are nose fuzes. However, base fuzes {{have been}} used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells.

A four level <b>multi-deck</b> car park is located near Village Cinemas in Knox O-Zone along with open air street parking scattered throughout the complex. An overflow car park is located at the very east of the centre behind the four level <b>multi-deck</b> car park, with an extended overflow grass area adjacent to this car park.|$|E

50|$|Revere Point Count {{was highly}} {{popular in the}} early days of {{counting}} and is still considered a benchmark strategy. His book only gave the single deck version. He sold the <b>multi-deck</b> version and it is still sold decades later by relatives. He also sold high level strategies referred to as Revere Advanced Point Count (RAPC.) These are now generally considered obsolete due to unnecessary complexity - although they are still valid and in use today.|$|E
5000|$|In medieval shipbuilding, a ship of war {{was usually}} {{equipped}} with a tall, <b>multi-deck</b> castle-like structure in {{the bow of the}} ship. It served as a platform for archers to shoot down on enemy ships, or as a defensive stronghold if the ship were boarded. A similar but usually much larger structure, called the aftcastle, was at the aft end of the ship, often stretching {{all the way from the}} main mast to the stern.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{shipbuilding}} makes considerable use of prefabricated sections. Entire <b>multi-deck</b> {{segments of}} the hull or superstructure will be built elsewhere in the yard, transported to the building dock or slipway, then lifted into place. This is known as [...] "block construction". The most modern shipyards pre-install equipment, pipes, electrical cables, and any other components within the blocks, to minimize the effort needed to assemble or install components deep within the hull once it is welded together.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, {{a lawsuit}} {{initiated}} by Ken Uston prohibited the Atlantic City casinos from barring card counters but allowed the casinos to establish new blackjack rules making {{it much more}} difficult to attain an advantage in the <b>multi-deck</b> shoe game, except for players willing to play to the long-term. Since most of Patterson's clients and book readers are recreational, short-term players, he published a special report advising them of the potential impact of these new rules on their blackjack play.|$|E
50|$|Many {{cruise ships}} and cruiseferries built by Aker Finnyards and its {{predecessor}} Kvaerner Masa-Yards have a wide, <b>multi-deck</b> promenade {{running along the}} center-line of the ship {{through most of the}} superstructure, also referred to as a horizontal atrium. This allows the majority of cabins on the upper decks to have a window, either to the port or starboard side or to the promenade. This design was first used in the cruiseferries M/S Silja Serenade and M/S Silja Symphony, built in 1990 and 1991, respectively.|$|E
50|$|A {{compliant}} piled tower design, it is 609.9 metres (2,001 ft) high, and {{was arguably}} the tallest free-standing {{structure in the}} world, until surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in 2010, although this claim is disputed since only 75 metres of the platform are above water. The <b>multi-deck</b> topsides are 64 metres by 43 metres by 18.3 metres high and hold 21 well slots, and the entire structure weighs around 43,000 tons. Around 8,000 m3 (50,000 barrels) of oil and 2,000,000 m3 (70 million cubic feet) of natural gas are extracted daily by the platform.|$|E
50|$|After {{completion}} of the $193 million in previous investment, the State Government committed a further $185.5 million to improve and upgrade facilities at FMC. Construction currently underway includes a new rehabilitation centre (with 55 rehabilitation beds, new gyms and a hydrotherapy pool), Southern Adelaide Palliative Services will relocate to Level 5 of the new rehabilitation building (with shared spaces and a large rooftop garden), a new 1780 space <b>multi-deck</b> car park (1220 more spaces than before the redevelopment commenced), a dedicated orthogeriatric service and a new centre for the Older Persons’ Mental Health Service.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008, {{after serving}} for Royal Caribbean International for 20 years, Sovereign of the Seas was {{transferred}} to the fleet of Pullmantur Cruises, a Royal Caribbean Cruises LTD subsidiary, and renamed MS Sovereign. Sovereign set sail on its first voyage with Pullmantur Cruises on March 23, 2009. Similar to other ships in the same class, Sovereign has a <b>multi-deck</b> atrium lobby called the Centrum, and a top-deck, funnel-mounted Viking Crown Lounge with panoramic views of the sea. The ship features 9 bars, 5 restaurants, 4 pools, spa, casino, and many other amenities.|$|E
50|$|In February 2017, it was {{announced}} that as part of the Andrews State Government's crossings removal project, Cheltenham station will be redeveloped into a rail trench - as to negate the rail crossings at Charman and Park roads. The trench, at 1.26 km in length, will be at least 30 metres wide; this will facilitate the re-reinstatement of the station's third track (platform 1; currently in-use as a dock) into a duplication of the 'to Frankston' track. Road bridges will be constructed over the rail-line for both Charman and Park roads. Furthermore, a <b>multi-deck</b> car-park will be built within the station's existing car-park.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to 1961 in Las Vegas casinos, all {{blackjack}} {{was being}} dealt {{from a single}} deck. John Scarne proposed to the Nevada Gaming Control Board that a state ruling be enacted such that Blackjack must be dealt from a shoe (Scarne's invention). While no such ruling was ever passed, most Nevada casinos now deal from a <b>multi-deck</b> shoe. [...] As gaming advisor to the Havana Hilton, Scarne also introduced the shoe to Puerto Rico and Cuba. The device is so named because the earliest versions of it resembled a woman's high-heel shoe, and was often painted red or black in color.|$|E

5000|$|The Viking Crown Lounge is a {{signature}} design element of most Royal Caribbean International cruise ship. The lounge, originally {{built around a}} stack of the ship, is generally the highest guest-accessible area on board. Early versions of the lounge built on the Song of Norway, Nordic Prince, and Sun Viking were difficult to reach via narrow stairs, but on newer ships such as the Legend of the Seas, Splendour of the Seas, Grandeur of the Seas, Enchantment of the Seas, Rhapsody of the Seas and Vision of the Seas the lounge is accessible via elevators in the Centrum (a soaring <b>multi-deck</b> atrium), mid-ship stair access, as well as outside staircases.|$|E
