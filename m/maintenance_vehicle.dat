Seatbelts were subsequently made compulsory equipment on all coaches and minibuses, more than 20 years after they had been compulsory on cars. It has been compulsory for passengers to wear seatbelts on coaches and minibuses since 2006.|$|E

25|$|Academic Row {{is known}} to be the central {{pedestrian}} concourse and <b>maintenance</b> <b>vehicle</b> highway in the campus that borders along a series of buildings. Beginning south at Administration Drive, the pathway is covered by mature trees on either side. Friendly squirrels are a common sight near the University Center where students tend to feed them waffle fries from Chick-fil-A. Academic Row is bordered by the Administration Building, the Retriever Activities Center, Janet and Walter Sondheim Hall, Sherman Hall (Previously named Academic IV), University Center, Math and Psychology Building, Biological Sciences Building, and the Meyerhoff Chemistry Building. At the northern end, the walkway is intersected by Schwartz Breezeway leading to the Commons, the university's student union. Academic Row terminates at the Albin O. Kuhn Library & Gallery, where multiple paths radiate across Erickson Field towards the Commons, the Physics and Public Policy Buildings, West Hills, Hillside, and Terrace Apartments, as well as additional dormitories.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 September 2006, a Transrapid train {{collided}} with a <b>maintenance</b> <b>vehicle</b> at [...] on the test track in Lathen. The <b>maintenance</b> <b>vehicle</b> destroyed {{the first section of}} the train, then lifted off the track to complete two full rotations before landing in a pile of pre-exploded debris. This was the first major accident involving a Transrapid train. The news media reported 23 fatalities and that several people were severely injured, these being the first fatalities on any maglev. The accident was caused by human error with the first train being allowed to leave the station before the <b>maintenance</b> <b>vehicle</b> had moved off the track. This situation could be avoided in a production environment by installing an automatic collision avoidance system.|$|E
