40|$|Abstract. Observed {{data sets}} {{containing}} values {{above or below}} the analytical threshold of measuring equipment {{are referred to as}} censored. Such data are frequently encountered in quality and quantity monitoring applications of water, soil, and air samples. Most of the previous literature on the statistical analysis of censored data relates to the problems of moment, parameter, and quantile estimation methods. Such estimation methods usually assume an underlying probability distribution. Few goodness-of-fit methods exist for censored data. We introduce L <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> for the evaluation of the goodness of fit of alternative distributional hypotheses for left-censored data. Experiments with artificial censored data sets document the conditions under which L <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> should be useful. Our approach, like Hosking’s [1995] approach for right censoring, derived L <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> for left-censored observations from partial probability-weighted moments. 1...|$|R

The first drawing shows the beam with the applied forces and displacement constraints. The second drawing is the loading diagram with the reaction values given without the calculations shown or {{what most people}} call a free body diagram. The third drawing is the shear force diagram and the fourth drawing is the bending <b>moment</b> <b>diagram.</b> For the bending <b>moment</b> <b>diagram</b> the normal sign convention was used. Below the <b>moment</b> <b>diagram</b> are the stepwise functions for the shear force and bending moment with the functions expanded to show the effects of each load on the shear and bending functions.|$|E

50|$|Shear and bending <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> are {{analytical}} tools used {{in conjunction}} with structural analysis to help perform structural design by determining the value of shear force and bending moment at a given point of a structural element such as a beam. These diagrams can be used to easily determine the type, size, and material of a member in a structure so that a given set of loads can be supported without structural failure. Another application of shear and <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> is that the deflection of a beam can be easily determined using either the moment area method or the conjugate beam method.|$|R

50|$|Macaulay's {{notation}} {{is commonly}} used in the static analysis of bending moments of a beam. This is useful because shear forces applied on a member render the shear and <b>moment</b> <b>diagram</b> discontinuous. Macaulay's notation also provides an easy way of integrating these discontinuous curves to give bending moments, angular deflection, and so on. For engineering purposes, angle brackets are often used to denote the use of Macaulay's method.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to note {{the relationship between the two}} diagrams. The <b>moment</b> <b>diagram</b> is a visual representation of the area under the shear force diagram. That is, the moment is the integral of the shear force. If the shear force is constant over an interval, the moment equation will be in terms of x (linear). If the shear force is linear over an interval, the moment equation will be quadratic (parabolic).|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{tabulate}} the influence values {{with respect to}} some point A on the structure, a unit load must be placed at various points along the structure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behaviour}} of R. C. members externally strengthened with steel angles and battens subjected to axial force and bending moment is analysed. A fibre model was utilised {{to predict the}} moment–curvature diagrams of the strengthened members {{on the basis of}} stress–strain curves of the constituent materials (confined concrete, steel bars and angles) recently derived by the author. The stress–strain curves utilised for compressed concrete were able {{to take into account the}} confinement effects induced by longitudinal (bars and steel angles) and transverse (stirrups and battens) steel reinforcements. Constitutive laws in compression for confined concrete and steel bars and angles were utilised for a preliminary calibration of the compressive response of axially loaded columns strengthened with steel cages. Therefore axial force and bending <b>moment</b> <b>diagrams</b> and <b>moment</b> curvature <b>diagrams</b> were derived and verified against experimental data available in the literature. Finally, a parametric analysis showing the influence of the main parameters governing the problems (angle and strip geometry and mechanical properties of constituent material) was carried out, mainly referring to moment axial force domains, <b>moment</b> curvature <b>diagrams.</b> The analysis showed the effectiveness of this reinforcing technique in improving both the strength and the ductility of R.
