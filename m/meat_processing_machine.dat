40|$|Comparative {{investigations}} {{were carried}} out in two <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> plants {{in order to determine}} the effect of disinfection on contact surfaces prior to and after the procedure on the basis of the total number of mesophilic microorganisms. It was found out that during production, the surfaces of most <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> <b>machines</b> in the plant manufacturing freshly cooked and dried sausages from red and white meat were more contaminated than those in the plant manufacturing dry sausages from red meat. In both enterprises, the total number of mesophilic organisms was higher on the surface of me-chanical <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> units than on the surface of thermal processing, drying and storage equip-ment, whereas the contamination of hands of cutter operators was almost identical. After the sanita-tion, mesophilic microflora was reduced to amounts, many times lower than normatively allowed. The effect of disinfection was more pronounced in the plant manufacturing freshly cooked and dried sau-sages from red and white meat, where the contamination of operational surfaces with mesophilic or-ganisms was higher. In both plants, the effect of disinfection was higher with regard to the equipment with initially more contaminated and smoother surfaces.

50|$|The Mill Iron Site, {{located in}} Carter County, Montana and {{discovered}} in 1979, is a site {{belonging to the}} Goshen Complex. The site was excavated from 1984 to 1988.

This <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> bed is thought to be a <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> site rather than a kill site because it was a stack (4.5 meters in diameter) of single bison bones and other organized carcass parts. A large goshen point found in this <b>meat</b> <b>processing</b> bed is thought to have been used for ritual offerings rather than a weapon to kill animals. This is because of the carefully rounded tip, when typically a sharp point is made instead. Many other lithic blades were discovered in the Mill Iron Site in addition to the goshen points.|$|R
