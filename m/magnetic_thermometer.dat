This makes them appealing at temperatures well below 0. 1 Kelvin {{in the operating}} range of many space-flight detectors. We have built and tested a <b>magnetic</b> <b>thermometer</b> which is deposited directly onto a substrate. This device, which uses the temperature dependence of iron-doped palladium s magnetic susceptibility, includes self-shielding deposited coils surrounding a sputtered palladium layer. It is read out using a SQUID to achieve high resolution. Its small size and very good heat-sinking should eventually make it useful for the temperature control of space flight detector arrays, in particular those already using SQUID readouts.

40|$|Abstract. The SRD 1000 device {{supports}} 9 reference temperatures on the PLTS- 2000 using superconductive {{to normal}} transitions of various metals. The evaluation of prototypes by several European metrological institutes {{showed that the}} SRD 1000 concept is convenient and reliable for transferring the scale. Currently a pilot production series is being developed with improved quality for the superconductive transitions of W, Be, Zn and Cd compared to the prototypes. To achieve this we apply better techniques for preparing the metals and add EMI filters to the electrical leads of the devices. We report on technological improvements and present results of calibrations of the devices on the PLTS- 2000. For interpolation between the reference points the sensor will be provided with an internal <b>magnetic</b> <b>thermometer...</b>|$|E

40|$|Interest in the {{critical}} dynamics of superfluid He in microgravity conditions has motivated {{the development of new}} high resolution thermometry technology for use in space experiments near 2 K. The current material commonly used as the temperature sensing element for high resolution thermometers (HRTs) is copper ammonium bromide (Cu(NH{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }Br{sub 4 } 2 H{sub 2 }O) or CAB, which undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at 1. 8 K. HRTs made from CAB have demonstrated low drift (< 10 fK/s) and a temperature resolution of 0. 1 nK. Unfortunately, paramagnetic salts such as CAB are difficult to prepare and handle, corrosive to most metals, and become dehydrated if kept under vacuum conditions at room temperature. We have developed a <b>magnetic</b> <b>thermometer</b> using dilute magnetic alloys of Mn or Fe dissolved in a pure Pd matrix. These metallic thermometers are easy to fabricate, chemically inert, and mechanically robust. Unlike salts, they may be directly soldered to the stage to be measured. Also, the Curie temperature can be varied by changing the concentration of Fe or Mn, making them available for use in a wide temperature range. Susceptibility measurements, as well as preliminary noise and drift measurements, show them to have sub-nK resolution with a drift of less than 10 {sup {minus} 13 } K/s...|$|E

MPTs operate in similar fashion to metallic magnetic calorimeters (MMCs), except that a superconducting sensor takes the place of a paramagnetic sensor and it is the temperature dependence of the superconductor's diamagnetic response that provides the temperature sensitivity. We present a description of the design and performance of our prototype thin-film MPTs with MoAu bilayer sensors, which have demonstrated an energy resolution of approx 2 eV FWHM at 1. 5 keY and 4. 3 eV FWHM at 5. 9 keY...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution x-ray {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} tool for studying the evolving universe. The grating spectrometers on the XMM and Chandra satellites started a new era in x-ray astronomy, but there remains a need for instrumentation that can provide higher spectral resolution with high throughput in the Fe-K band (around 6 keV) and can enable imaging spectroscopy of extended sources, such as supernova remnants and galaxy clusters. The instrumentation needed is a broad-band imaging spectrometer - basically an x-ray camera that can distinguish tens of thousands of x-ray colors. The potential benefits to astrophysics of using a low-temperature calorimeter to determine the energy of an incident x-ray photon via measurement of a small change in temperature was first articulated by S. H. Moseley over two decades ago. In the time since, technological progress has been steady, though full realization in an orbiting x-ray telescope is still awaited. A low-temperature calorimeter can be characterized by the type of thermometer it uses, and three types presently dominate the field. The first two types are temperature-sensitive resistors - semiconductors in the metal-insulator transition and superconductors operated in the superconducting-normal transition. The third type uses a paramagnetic thermometer. These types can be considered the three generations of x-ray calorimeters; by now each has demonstrated a resolving power of 2000 at 6 keV, but only a semiconductor calorimeter system has been developed to spaceflight readiness. The Soft X-ray Spectrometer on Astro-H, expected to launch in 2013, will use an array of silicon thermistors with I-IgTe x-ray absorbers that will operate at 50 mK. Both the semiconductor and superconductor calorimeters have been implemented in small arrays, kilo-pixel arrays of the superconducting calorimeters are just now being produced, and it is anticipated that much larger arrays will require the non-dissipative advantage of <b>magnetic</b> <b>thermometers...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} performance {{of a series of}} fast, precise current sensing noise thermometers. The thermometers have been fabricated with a range of resistances from 1. 290 Ω down to 0. 2 mΩ. This results in either a thermometer that has been optimised for speed, taking advantage of the improvements in superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) noise and bandwidth, or a thermometer optimised for ultra-low temperature measurement, minimising the system noise temperature. By using a single temperature calibration point, we show that noise thermometers can be used for accurate measurements over a wide range of temperatures below 4 K. Comparisons with a melting curve thermometer, a calibrated germanium thermometer and a pulsed platinum nuclear <b>magnetic</b> resonance <b>thermometer</b> are presented.

40|$|Using {{ultraviolet}} photon pulses, we have probed the internal {{behavior of a}} molybdenum-gold <b>Magnetic</b> Penetration <b>Thermometer</b> (MPT) that we designed for x-ray microcalorimetry. In this low-temperature detector, the diamagnetic response of a superconducting MoAu bilayer is used to sense temperature changes in response to absorbed photons. We have previously described an approximate model that explains the high responsivity of the detector to temperature changes {{as a consequence of}} a Meissner transition of the molybdenum-gold film in the magnetic field applied by the superconducting circuit used to bias the detector. We compare measurements of MPT heat capacity and thermal conductance, derived from UV photon pulse data, to our model predictions for the thermodynamic properties of the sensor and for the electron cooling obtained by quasiparticle recombination. Our data on electron cooling power is also relevant to the operation of other superconducting detectors, such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors...|$|R
40|$|The signal {{transmission}} module of a <b>magnetic</b> nanoparticle <b>thermometer</b> (MNPT) {{was established in}} this study to analyze the error sources introduced during the signal flow in the hardware system. The underlying error sources that significantly affected the precision of the MNPT were determined through mathematical modeling and simulation. A transfer module path with the minimum error in the hardware system was then proposed through {{the analysis of the}} variations of the system error caused by the significant error sources when the signal flew through the {{signal transmission}} module. In addition, a system parameter, named the signal-to-AC bias ratio (i. e., the ratio between the signal and AC bias), was identified as a direct determinant of the precision of the measured temperature. The temperature error was below 0. 1 K when the signal-to-AC bias ratio was higher than 80 dB, and other system errors were not considered. The temperature error was below 0. 1 K in the experiments with a commercial magnetic fluid (Sample SOR- 10, Ocean Nanotechnology, Springdale, AR, USA) when the hardware system of the MNPT was designed with the aforementioned method...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} <b>magnetic</b> penetration <b>thermometers</b> (MPTs) for applications in X-ray astronomy. These non-dissipative devices consist of an X-ray absorber in good thermal contact to a {{superconducting thin film}} with a transition temperature around T= 100 mK. A microfabricated superconducting planar inductor underneath is used to store a persistent current and couple the superconductor's diamagnetic response to a readout SQUID. The strong temperature dependence of the diamagnetic response make these devices suitable for highly sensitive macroscopic thermometers {{that are capable of}} achieving very high energy resolution. We present results achieved with MPTs consisting of MoAu bilayer sensors attached to overhanging square 250 micron by 250 micron gold absorbers that have demonstrated an energy resolution of delta E_FWHM= 2. 3 eV at an X-ray energy of 5. 9 keV. A similar device has shown delta E_FWHM= 2. 0 eV at 1. 5 keV. Under certain conditions and for specific device geometries, the temperature responsivity of the MPTs can vary on long timescales degrading the spectral performance.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{measurements}} of the detected signal pulses in a molybdenum-gold <b>Magnetic</b> Penetration <b>Thermometer</b> (MPT) in response to absorption {{of one or more}} 3 eV photons. We designed and used this MPT sensor for x-ray microcalorimetry. In this device, the diamagnetic response of a superconducting MoAu bilayer is used to sense temperature changes in response to absorbed photons, and responsivity is enhanced by a Meissner transition in which the magnetic flux penetrating the sensor changes rapidly to minimize free energy in a mixed superconducting normal state. We have previously reported on use of our MPT to study a thermal phonon energy loss to the substrate when absorbing x-rays. We now describe results of extracting heat capacity C and thermal conductance G values from pulse height and decay time of MPT pulses generated by 3 eV photons. The variation in C and G at temperatures near the Meissner transition temperature (set by an internal magnetic bias field) allow us to probe the behavior in superconducting normal mixed state of the condensation energy and the electron cooling power resulting from quasi-particle recombination and phonon emission. The information gained on electron cooling power is also relevant to the operation of other superconducting detectors, such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} high-resolution soft x-ray microcalorimeters using <b>magnetic</b> penetration <b>thermometers</b> (MPTs) in {{an array of}} pixels covering a total of 2 square centimeters to have a resolving power of 300 at energies around 300 eV. This performance is desirable for studying the soft x-ray background from the warm hot intergalactic medium. MPT devices have small sensor heat capacity and high responsivities, which makes them excellent detector technology for attempting to attain sub-eV resolution. We are investigating the feasibility of pixels with absorbers that are 625 x 625 square micrometers, up to 1 x 1 square millimeters in area and 0. 35 micrometer thick and thinner. Our tests have shown that suspended gold absorbers 0. 35 micrometers thick (RRR = 6. 7) are feasible to fabricate. We modeled the thermal diffusion from such thin gold over the size of a 625 x 625 square micrometer absorber, and conclude that the effect of the thermalization on the resolution of a 300 eV photon is an additional approximately 0. 2 eV FWHM of broadening. We discuss the thermal effects of small absorber attachment sterns on solid substrate, as well as considerations for multiplexed readout. We will present the progress we have made towards building and testing this soft x-ray detector...|$|R
40|$|We {{have made}} high {{resolution}} x-ray microcalorimeters using superconducting MoAu bilayers and Nb meander coils. The temperature sensor is a <b>Magnetic</b> Penetration <b>Thermometer</b> (MPT). Operation {{is similar to}} metallic magnetic calorimeters, but instead of the magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic alloy, we use the diamagnetic response of the superconducting MoAu to sense temperature changes in an x-ray absorber. Flux-temperature responsivtty can be large for small sensor heat capacity, with enough dynamic range for applications. We find models of observed flux-temperature curves require several effects to explain flux penetration or expulsion in the microscopic devices. The superconductor is non-local, with large coherence length and weak pinning of flux. At lowest temperatures, behavior is dominated by screening currents that vary {{as a result of}} the temperature dependence of the magnetic penetration depth, modified by the effect of the nonuniformity of the applied field occurring on a scale comparable to the coherence length. In the temperature regime where responslvity is greatest, spadal variations in the order parameter become important: both local variations as flux enters/leaves the film and an intermediate state is formed, and globally as changing stability of the electrical circuit creates a Meissner transition and flux is expelled/penetrates to minimize free energy...|$|R

40|$|Nanostructured samples {{serve as}} a {{playground}} of solid state physics due to their vast diversity of applications. In addition to various fabrication recipes and measurement methods, the temperature at which these experiments are performed {{plays a crucial role}} because thermal excitations can conceal the underlying physics. Thus advancing to lower temperatures in solid state systems might shed light on presently unknown physical phenomena, as e. g. new topological states of matter. We present a novel type of refrigerator using adiabatic nuclear demagnetization with the goal of reaching sub-millikelvin electron temperatures in nanostructured samples. The nuclear stage consists of electronically separated Cu plates, each of which is part of a measurement lead. Before connecting to the nuclear stage, each lead is strongly filtered and then thermalized to the mixing chamber of the dilution refrigerator. This thesis presents measurements on two of these systems: the first operated in a standard, "wet" cryostat and the second on a "dry" pulse tube refrigerator. Both nuclear stages cool below 300 microkelvin with heat leaks in the order of a few nanowatts per mol of copper. We perform electronic transport measurements on various nanostructured samples. For the wet system, we extract electron temperatures around 5 - 7 mK after replacing the sample holder material and including an additional filtering stage. These measurements are highly sensitive to noise of the experimental setup and to the electrostatic environment of the devices, e. g. wafer-intrinsic charge noise. In yet another experiment on a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, we observe a quantization of the longitudinal resistance Rxx which arises from a density gradient across the wafer. As for the dry system, we attach a home-built <b>magnetic</b> field fluctuation <b>thermometer</b> to the nuclear stage. While calibrated at 4 K, it shows good agreement with various other thermometers down to 5 mK, with the lowest temperature being 700 microkelvin.
