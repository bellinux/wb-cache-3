40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the challenges of prototyping a reference application on System S, a distributed stream processing middleware under development at IBM Research. With {{a large number of}} stream PEs (Processing Elements) implementing various stream analytic algorithms, running on a large-scale, distributed cluster of nodes, and collaboratively digesting several multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with vastly differing rates, prototyping a reference application on System S faces many challenges. Specifically, we focus on our experience in prototyping DAC (Disaster Assistance Claim monitoring), a reference application dealing with multi-modal stream analytic and monitoring. We describe three critical challenges: (1) How do we generate correlated, multi-modal <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> for DAC? (2) How do we design and implement a comprehensive stream application, like DAC, from many divergent stream analytic PEs? (3) How do we deploy DAC in light of <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> with extremely different rates? We report our experience in addressing these challenges, including modeling a disaster claim processing center to generate correlated <b>source</b> <b>streams,</b> constructing the PE flow graph, utilizing programming supports from System S, adopting parallelism, and exploiting resource-adaptive computation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Streaming erasure codes encode a <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> to {{guarantee}} that each source packet is recovered within a fixed delay at the receiver over a burst-erasure channel. This paper introduces diversity embedded streaming erasure codes (DE-SCo), that provide a flexible tradeoff between the channel quality and receiver delay. When the channel conditions are good, the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is recovered with a low delay, whereas when the channel conditions are poor the <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is still recovered, albeit with a larger delay. Information theoretic analysis of the underlying burst-erasure broadcast channel reveals that DE-SCo achieve the minimum possible delay for the weaker user, without sacrificing {{the performance of the}} stronger user. A larger class of multicast streaming erasure codes (MU-SCo) that achieve optimal tradeoff between rate, delay and erasure-burst length is also constructed. I...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} about multiple-F 0 {{tracking}} and {{the estimation of}} the number of harmonic <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> in music sound signals. A <b>source</b> <b>stream</b> is understood as generated from a note played by a musical instrument. A note is described by a hidden Markov model (HMM) having two states: the attack state and the sustain state. It is proposed to first perform the tracking of F 0 candidates using a high-order hidden Markov model, based on a forward-backward dynamic programming scheme. The propagated weights are calculated in the forward tracking stage, followed by an iterative tracking of the most likely trajectories in the backward tracking stage. Then, the estimation of the underlying <b>source</b> <b>streams</b> is carried out by means of iteratively pruning the candidate trajectories in a maximum likelihood manner. The proposed system is evaluated by a specially constructed polyphonic music database. Compared with the frame-based estimation systems, the tracking mechanism improves significantly the accuracy rate. 1...|$|R

40|$|We discuss ultra-high energy (UHE) {{cosmic rays}} (CR) from <b>minor</b> <b>sources</b> and their {{possible}} {{contribution to the}} extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray emission. As an illustration of <b>minor</b> <b>sources</b> we consider possible specific type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which supermassive black hole {{is surrounded by a}} super strong magnetic field of 10 ^(10) - 10 ^(11) Gs. In this model we have calculated CR energy spectra at the Earth and intensity of cascade quanta produced by CRs in extragalactic space. Proceeding from numerical results and the data by Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array it is shown that these AGNs make a negligible contribution to the UHECR flux at the Earth. However CRs from the AGNs produce significant gamma-ray flux as compared to extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray emission measured by Fermi LAT. We conclude that UHECRs from <b>minor</b> <b>sources</b> can contribute noticeably to extragalactic gamma-ray emission. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, report at ICPPA- 2017, Mosco...|$|R
