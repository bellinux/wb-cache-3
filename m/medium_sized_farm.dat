40|$|Department of Agricultural Economics Working Paper No. AEWP 2007 - 07 We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} perceived economic pressures on the ethical attitudes of farmers. We hypothesize that {{an increase in the}} economic pressures a farmer faces could result in that farmer being more tolerant of unethical conduct than farmers not experiencing economic pressures. To test this hypothesis, we use data from a survey of 3, 000 Missouri farmers with farm sales in excess of $ 10, 000 in 2005 in which farmers were asked how acceptable they considered various unethical or questionable farming practices. The survey also contained questions designed to measure perceived economic pressures. We find evidence that economic pressures result in a greater willingness of farmers to tolerate unethical conduct, particularly in the case of actions that have the potential of causing harm or that are influenced by law or contract. We also find that the more frequently a farmer reports observing an unethical action, the more acceptable he is of it. This project was funded by USDA National Research Initiative Agricultural Prosperity for Small and <b>Medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>Farm</b> Program, grant number 2005 - 35618 - 15672.

40|$|Dairy {{production}} and Marketing was studied on 168 dairy farms consisting of 85 cross breed (40 <b>medium</b> <b>sizes</b> and 45 small sizes) and 83 local breed (30 <b>medium</b> <b>sizes</b> and 53 small <b>sizes)</b> cows owning <b>farms</b> in Mekelle town. Cobb-Douglas production, cost-benefit (C: B) and break-even ratios {{were employed to}} assess resource use efficiency and profitability and financial efficiency of cross and local breed dairy farms. The regression coefficients with respect to concentrate for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed <b>farms</b> are positive and significant at 10 % level. The coefficient of dry fodder for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross breed and local breed are positive and significant at 10 % level. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed <b>farms,</b> the coefficient for dry fodder is positive and significant at 5 % level and labor is positive and significant at 5 % level {{in the case of}} small size cross breed. For small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed <b>farms,</b> the coefficient for miscellaneous are positive and significant at 10 % level. There is difference between the present and optimum levels of inputs. The optimum levels of inputs with respect to concentrate are 30. 21 quintal and 24. 82 quintals for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> cross breed <b>farms,</b> respectively. For dry fodder, the optimum is 32. 70 quintals and 12. 84 quintal for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> cross and local breed farms, respectively. where as, 8. 88 quintals for small <b>size</b> local breed <b>farms.</b> Green fodder, the optimum level is 10. 88 quintals for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> local breed <b>farms.</b> The optimum level for labor is 403. 12 man day for small <b>size</b> cross breed <b>farms.</b> For miscellaneous cost the optimum levels are 228. 54 Birr and 336. 47 Birr for <b>medium</b> and small <b>size</b> local bred <b>farms,</b> respectively. The C:B results indicated that cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 02) than local breed farms (1. 0 : 2. 18). Both medium and small categories of cross breed farms were profitable (1. 0 : 3. 45 and 1. 0 : 2. 74, respectively). In local breed <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> were profitable (1. 0 : 2. 19). The ratio of break-even milk output from the actual milk production for cross breed and local breed cows owning farms needed 13 % of the actual milk {{production and}} 18 % additional milk production over the actual milk production to cover fixed cost, respectively. Cross breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> needed 8 % and 11 % milk output and local breed small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> requires additional 31 % and 14 % over the actual milk production. In conclusion, dairy cow's owner should be advised to use the optimum levels inputs and replace their indigenous cow with cross breed cow.

40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} the poultry egg farms after the outbreak of avian influenza in 2006 in the north central part of Nigeria. Seventeen poultry (17) farms were purposefully sampled for the study. The net farm income model, simple descriptive statistics and data envelopment analysis were used as analytical tools. The result shows that the poultry farms are making profits after the losses obtained due to the outbreak of avian influenza (AVI). The revenue from eggs and spent layers constitutes 52. 3 % and 47. 7 % of the total revenue respectively. The <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> are however making higher profits and are more technically efficient than the small <b>size</b> poultry <b>farms.</b> The technical efficiency scores for the small scale farms range from 0. 23 - 1 with a mean of 0. 51, while that for the <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> range from 0. 38 - 1 with a mean of 0. 73. The major constraints affecting poultry egg production include; fluctuations in egg production and high cost of feeds as well as vaccines. The study concluded that the performance of poultry egg farms in Nigeria can be enhanced through improvements in technical efficiency or an increase in scale of operation. The provision of subsidies to poultry farmers by the government was however recommended to ease the high production cost...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, {{three types of}} dairy feeding systems were practiced: {{zero-grazing}}/stall feeding (79.6  %), zero- and partial-grazing (7.4  %) and full time-grazing (11.1  %). The dairy animals are managed indoors and farmers used cut-and-carry feeding systems. Most farmers in large <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> (31.5  %) practiced zero-grazing as compared to small <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> (20.4  %) and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> (27.8  %) (P >  0.05). However, high proportion of farmers in the small <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> (11.1  %) practiced free-grazing. This {{could be due to}} lack of capital to purchase and feed concentrate feeds. In agreement with the current findings, 72  % of the smallholder dairy farmers in Dire Dawa town practiced zero-grazing system (Mureda and Zeleke 2008). In this study, majority of the farmers practiced dairy farming in the family residential compounds. The adoption of zero-grazing by majority of the respondents addresses the problem of access to land for feed production.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between maize productivity and plot size in Zambia. It offers a unique empirical approach. First, it focuses on maize, which is the major crop on small and <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> in Zambia, but also accounts for the endogenous determination {{of the size of}} the plot devoted to maize. Previous studies have used total <b>farm</b> <b>size</b> or harvested area. Second, it corrects for selectivity in maize cultivation. Third, it controls for differences in land quality and weather conditions across districts. Finally, it offers a structural interpretation of the above framework by modeling farm decisions as a sequential, two-stage process, in which land is first allocated to the different crops based on the information set of the farmers at the time of planting, and the yield is affected by subsequent application of inputs, the quantities of which may depend on additional information that is revealed after planting.

Data come from a survey of 1, 396 coffee farmers held in 2004 in eight major producer states in Mexico and complemented with information from the National Coffee Census. We apply regression models that control for selection bias and endogeneity to identify driving forces as well as the economic effects of co-operative membership. Co-operatives are typically joined by older male farmers, on <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms,</b> who have access to electricity and are located at higher altitudes and in larger municipalities. Private land ownership reduces the probability of co-operative membership.

40|$|Climate and {{socio-economic}} {{change will}} affect the land use and the economic viability of Dutch dairy farms. Explorations of future scenarios, which include different drivers and impacts, are needed to perform ex-ante policy assessment. This study uses a bio-economic farm model to assess impacts of climate and socio-economic change on dairy farms in a sandy area in the Netherlands. Farm data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network provided information on the current production levels and available farm resources. First, the farm plans of individual farms were optimized in the current situation to benchmark farms and assess the current scope for improvement. Secondly, simulations for two scenarios were included: a Global Economy with 2. °C global temperature rise (GE/W+) and a Regional Community with 1. °C global temperature rise (RC/G). The impacts of climate change, extreme events, juridical change (including abolishment of milk quota), technological change and price changes were evaluated in separate model runs within the predefined scenarios. We found that farms can increase profit both by intensification and land expansion; the latter especially for <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> (less than 70 cows). Climate change including the effect of increased occurrence of extreme events may negatively affect farm gross margin in the GE/W+ scenario. Lower gross margins are compensated for by the effects of technology and price changes. In contrast with the GE/W+ scenario, climate change has positive impacts on farm profit in RC/G, but less favourable farm input-output price ratios have a negative effect. Technological change is needed to compensate for revenue losses due to higher input prices. In both GE/W+ and RC/G scenarios, dairy farms increase production {{and the use of}} artificial fertilizer. <b>Medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> have more options to increase profit than the large farms: they benefit more from the abolishment of the milk quota and better adapt to negative and positive impacts of climate change. While the exact impact of different drivers will always remain uncertain, this study showed that changes in prices, technology and markets have a relatively larger impact than climate change, even when extreme events are taken into account. By using whole farm plans as activities that can be selected, the model is grounded in observations, and it was shown that half of the farms are gross margin maximizers as assumed in the model. The model therefore indicates 'what could happen if', and gives insights in drivers and impacts of dairy farming in the region. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{aimed to}} present the {{investigation}} of the use of photovoltaic cells based devices for solar light measurements and analysis in order to forecast the pace of growth of plants and to estimate the appropriate timing of harvest culture. It is based on the continuous data measurements by a microcontroller based circuitry of a solar module used for supplying a multi-functional wireless sensor for agriculture. The solar module consists of two monocrystalline solar cells (c-Si) flat design, highly transparent and having UV stable front encapsulation. The data is not only a simple day and night information, but a measurement of the solar radiation. The device is able to measure the environment temperature as well, therefore the data is useful for evaluation of the photoperiodism, but the correlation between solar radiation and temperature is also possible. The data is transmitted to a host controller able to store and process higher volume information.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 This study {{sought to}} better {{understand}} the voluntary adoption of water quality improving practices by agricultural producers in Northern Malheur County, Oregon. The Reasoned Action Approach/Theory of Planned Behavior was used as a theoretical framework to identify barriers and incentives to adoption. Study findings suggest that producers primarily consider practical characteristics of practices when making adoption decisions. Some of these concerns include the relative advantage of the practice (derived from the anticipated financial gain or loss, conservation and water quality benefits from adopting a practice), the compatibility of a practice with existing farm operations, the ease or difficulty of implementing a practice, and the ability to observe the success of a practice prior to adoption. These factors vary widely across individual farms because of the diversity in farming practices and heterogeneous operations. Producer age and lack of agency over decision making emerged as barriers to adoption and provide promising areas for future adoption studies. Recommendations are provided for enhanced education and outreach programs and incentive systems that are better suited for the diverse and segmented needs of producers operating small to <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

40|$|Two {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to determine the distribution and Characteristics of the local (baladi) chickens of Saudi Arabia. The results of the two surveys provided evidence that: 1. Local chickens exhibit large variations in body shape, feather color, comb type and shank color. They are small in size. 2. Most of the large baladi project (> 1000 layers) were found in Makkah, Jedda and Madina. <b>Medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> (250 - 600 hens) were found in Qasim, Madina, Makkah, Durma and Qatif. Smaller <b>size</b> <b>farms</b> (< 250 hens) were found in Makkah, Qasim and Hofuf. 3. Twenty three % of the large baladi projects were Poultry producers raising chicks as {{the main source of}} their income. 4. Eighty % of the small projects raise the baladi chickens along with other animals. 5. Average flock size of the large farms was 3479 birds. 6. Average marketing age of the birds were 14. 6 weeks. 7. Baladi hens lay their 1 st egg at 22. 76 week of age and continue laying for 78. 9 weeks producing 170 eggs. 8. Nine % of the large projects` owners found that New Castle disease (ND) was the most frequent occurring disease. All chickens owners vaccinate their birds against ND while 33 % vaccinate against Fowl pox. 9. About 80 % of small farms owners are making use of the broodiness phenomena to hatch eggs while only 8 % use small incubators for that purpose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Using the {{technique}} of “panels ” farms were drawn as representatives from three regions of Brazil: {{the first was a}} <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farm</b> representing the grain production area of Northern Rio Grande do Sul State; the second, a large farm from the grain and livestock production area of Mato Grosso State; the third, a very large farm from the Amazonian livestock production area of Pará State. The long-term cost of production was estimated and the yearly average net income was evaluated for each typical farm. An “emergy ” evaluation table, prepared according to procedures described by Odum (1996), was used to estimate each farm process of incorporating energy into its production as a way to evaluate the sustainability of the farms systems. A four quadrant reference system, based on the average measurements for each vector – environmental accounting and net farm income – allowed the plotting of the three farms on the designed quadrants. The null hypothesis indicates that sustainable farms must be plotted on the southwest and on the northeast quadrants. The presence of farms on either of the two non-expected quadrants, the northwest and the southeast, poses long term problems of sustainability and indicates that new development policies are required...|$|R
40|$|Raising the {{incomes of}} {{agricultural}} households {{is central to}} reducing poverty in Uganda. In {{many areas of the}} country agriculture has encroached into marginal or fragile lands, leaving little room for the expansion of agricultural lands (Kraybill, Bashaasha, and Betz 2009). Additionally, soil degradation has become a barrier to agricultural productivity (Pender et al. 2004), especially in the Eastern region of the country. Farmers now look for alternatives that will increase output without further depleting soil fertility or expanding into fragile lands. Agricultural extension is the primary government mechanism through which developing country governments attempt to improve the knowledge and methods that farmers use to increase output; However, many extension programs throughout Sub-Saharan Africa have the reputation of being largely ineffective (Dejene 1989; Gautam 2000). This study estimates an agricultural production function for 3 <b>farm</b> <b>sizes</b> to determine whether agricultural extension has differential effects on <b>farms</b> of different <b>size.</b> Extension is found to have a positive and significant relationship with the value of output produced for small and large farms, but has not significant relationship with the value of output for <b>medium</b> <b>size</b> <b>farms.</b> This result has distinct policy implications for the design and implementation of agricultural extension programs in Uganda and other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} in Thane district of Maharashtra to study socio-psychological {{profile of the}} Ma-hatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) beneficiaries. Many research studies revealed that the profile of beneficiaries was having great contribution in the extent of participation of beneficiaries in the develop-ment programmes. This study revealed that majority of the MGNREGA beneficiaries was young aged, females, illiterate, belonged to joint family, <b>medium</b> family <b>size,</b> <b>farming</b> as their occupation, small farmers, medium income group, medium social participation, medium level of aspiration and medium level of awareness. The strategy suggested to increase their participation in MGNREGA were culturally appropriate and acceptable...|$|R
40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Benchmarking is an important management tool enabling the comparison of actual financial data on a similar basis. Currently there is little data available on the actual costs of farming to organic standards. Limited financial or incomplete management information tends to lead to poor decision taking. The objective of the exercise is to identify the practices, which lead to enhanced financial performance, either low costs of production or high levels of profitability. The identification of these most profitable practices enables informed decisions to be made about the way the farming business needs to change. The main problem areas include the collection of detailed information broken down into the required cost centres. The allocation of costs between enterprises on small and <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> is often difficult. Obtaining either a large enough sample of farms, if the farming system is different, or a sufficient number of farms with a similar farming system is essential. Analysis is normally undertaken on a cost of production basis as this allows for better comparison between units of a different size. Finance costs are normally excluded, but depreciation charges are included to reflect the level of investment in the business. A realistic value of family labour needs to be included to allow for the production of a Comparable Farm Profit (CFP) ...|$|R
40|$|Records on {{the farm}} {{business}} obtained from 233 herds of hogs in Humboldt County {{during the period from}} 1922 to 1925 showed that the hogs on these farms provided a means of marketing about half the corn raised and provided between 35 and 40 percent of the total farm income. On the <b>medium</b> <b>sized</b> <b>farms</b> in this county between 15 and 20 brood sows were kept per farm. The number seldom ran over 20, because on a one-family farm it was limited to the number one man could look after at farrowing time. One hundred fifty-nine detailed records were obtained on the hog enterprise. These showed a wide range each year in costs and profits. The hog producer’s problem is to obtain the largest net return from his resources. This involves caring for his breeding herd so as to obtain thrifty pigs at the lowest cost per pig at weaning and, second, obtaining the most economical gains on the fattening pigs. The high costs of pigs weaned were usually associated with inadequate rations, poor care of the breeding herd and preventable losses after farrowing. It was found that where litters farrowed one additional strong pig, the number weaned was increased by six-tenths pig per litter on an average, while more than the average number of weak pigs farrowed meant smaller than average litters weaned...|$|R
