5|$|Regardless of the masing molecule, {{there are}} a few {{requirements}} that must be met for a strong <b>maser</b> source to exist. One requirement is a radio continuum background source to provide the radiation amplified by the <b>maser,</b> as all <b>maser</b> transitions take place at radio wavelengths. The masing molecule must have a pumping mechanism to create the population inversion, and sufficient density and path length for significant amplification to take place. These combine to constrain when and where megamaser emission for a given molecule will take place. The specific conditions for each molecule known to produce megamasers are different, as exemplified by {{the fact that there is}} no known galaxy that hosts both of the two most common megamaser species, hydroxyl and water. As such, the different molecules with known megamasers will be addressed individually.|$|E
5|$|Water <b>maser</b> {{emission}} {{is observed}} primarily at 22GHz, {{due to a}} transition between rotational energy levels in the water molecule. The upper state is at an energy corresponding to 643 kelvins about the ground state, and populating this upper <b>maser</b> level requires number densities of molecular hydrogen of order 108 cm−3 or greater and temperatures of at least 300 kelvins. The water molecule comes into thermal equilibrium at molecular hydrogen number densities of roughly 1011 cm−3, so this places an upper limit on the number density in a water masing region. Water masers emission has been successfully modelled by masers occurring behind shock waves propagating through dense regions in the interstellar medium. These shocks produce the high number densities and temperatures (relative to typical conditions in the interstellar medium) required for <b>maser</b> emission, and are successful in explaining observed masers.|$|E

50|$|In the Milky Way, •OH <b>masers</b> {{are found}} in stellar <b>masers</b> (evolved stars), {{interstellar}} <b>masers</b> (regions of massive star formation), or in the interface between supernova remnants and molecular material. Interstellar •OH <b>masers</b> are often observed from molecular material surrounding ultracompact H II regions (UC H II). But there are <b>masers</b> associated with very young stars {{that have yet to}} create UC H II regions. This class of •OH <b>masers</b> appears to form near the edges of very dense material, place where H2O <b>masers</b> form, and where total densities drop rapidly and UV radiation form young stars can dissociate the H2O molecules. So, observations of •OH <b>masers</b> in these regions, can be an important way to probe the distribution of the important H2O molecule in interstellar shocks at high spatial resolutions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract It is {{recognized}} that the interstellar methanol- 107 GHz <b>masers</b> and OH- 4. 765 GHz <b>masers</b> towards Class II sources are associated {{with each other and}} coexist towards ultracompact HII regions. Therefore we suggest a new pumping mechanism – methanol <b>masers</b> without population inversion. It can explain the formation of 107 GHz methanol <b>masers,</b> with the 4. 765 GHz OH <b>masers</b> acting as a driving coherent microwave field. It is argued that this mechanism is compatible with the astronomical conditions. Key words: H II regions — <b>masers</b> — radiation mechanisms: non-thermal — ISM: molecules — line: formation...|$|R
5|$|The {{observed}} {{relationship between}} the luminosity of the hydroxyl line and the far infrared suggests that hydroxyl megamasers are radiatively pumped. Initial VLBI measurements of nearby hydroxyl megamasers seemed to present {{a problem with this}} model for compact emission components of hydroxyl megamasers, as they required a very high fraction of infrared photons to be absorbed by hydroxyl and lead to a <b>maser</b> photon being emitted, making collisional excitation a more plausible pumping mechanism. However, a model of <b>maser</b> emission with a clumpy masing medium appear to be able to reproduce the observed properties of compact and diffuse hydroxyl emission. A recent detailed treatment finds that photons with a wavelength of 53 micrometres are the primary pump for main line <b>maser</b> emission, and applies to all hydroxyl masers. In order to provide enough photons at this wavelength, the interstellar dust that reprocesses stellar radiation to infrared wavelengths must have a temperature of at least 45 kelvins. Recent observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm this basic picture, but there are still some discrepancies between details of the model and observations of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies such as the required dust opacity for megamaser emission.|$|E
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water <b>maser</b> spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the <b>maser</b> spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the <b>maser</b> may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure of the Hubble constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

5|$|The {{magnetosphere}} of Jupiter {{is responsible}} for intense episodes of radio emission from the planet's polar regions. Volcanic activity on Jupiter's moon Io (see below) injects gas into Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing a torus of particles about the planet. As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates Alfvén waves that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a cyclotron <b>maser</b> mechanism, and {{the energy is transmitted}} out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth intersects this cone, the radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the solar radio output.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of these emissions {{are thought to be}} produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron <b>Maser</b> Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce {{back and forth between the}} poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk. The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1GW.|$|E

5|$|A few {{hydroxyl}} megamasers, including Arp 220, {{have been}} observed with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), which allows sources to be studied at higher angular resolution. VLBI observations indicate that hydroxyl megamaser emission is composed of two components, one diffuse and one compact. The diffuse component displays gains of less than a factor of one and linewidths of order hundreds of kilometers per second. These characteristics {{are similar to those}} seen with single dish observations of hydroxyl megamasers that are unable to resolve individual masing components. The compact components have high gains, ranging from tens to hundreds,high ratios of flux at 1667MHz to flux at 1665MHz, and linewidths are of order a few kilometers per second. These general features have been explained by a narrow circumnuclear ring of material from which the diffuse emission arises, and individual masing clouds with sizes of order one parsec that give rise to the compact emission. The hydroxyl masers observed in the Milky Way more closely resemble the compact hydroxyl megamaser components. There are, however, some regions of extended galactic <b>maser</b> emission from other molecules that resemble the diffuse component of hydroxyl megamasers.|$|E
