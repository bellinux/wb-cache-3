30|$|It can be {{observed}} from Figure  8 and Table  7 that the front part of the front <b>mount</b> <b>frame</b> has a maximum deformation of 0.82  mm, mainly {{because there are no}} rubber blocks. The stress in the front mount is mainly distributed in the six bolt holes and two sides of the vertical part of the metal frame, and the bolt hole of the horizontal part has a maximum stress of 82.017  MPa. Compared with the left and right mounts, the front mount has larger deformation and stress, and is more easily damaged during use, and hence, it is necessary to improve the reliability of the front mount.|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Acquisition and Guidance Unit for the Gemini {{project a}} light-weight, 50 cm flat mirror has been {{designed}} at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Mechanics in Jena as a subcontractor of the Carl Zeiss Jena company. A light-weight design of the mirror and its mount was essential since the total mass of the whole assembly including the positioning system was limited to 50 kg while interferometric quality of the mirror surface was required for arbitrary orientation. The overall surface error was below 54 nm r. m. s. while 27 nm was achieved in the central part. The mirror was fabricated from low-expansion glass ceramics to avoid thermally induced deformations. By milling pockets into its rear surface the mass of the mirror was reduced by 70 %. The mirror is mounted kinematically via six solid-state hinges to three steel levers. The levers are connected to the <b>mount</b> <b>frame</b> at their centers via ball-and-sphere joints. This arrangement determines the position of the mirror uniquely while it allows for the thermal expansion of the <b>mount</b> <b>frame.</b> The position of the mirror as well as its tilt around an axis perpendicular to the optical one may be controlled a precision of 20 µm and 3 arcsec, respectively. The tilt axis is driven directly by two high-torque motors. To avoid an excessive power consumption of the motors the torque of the mirror had to be compensated for by a counterweight mechanism. The mirror may be deployed into the optical path using spindle driven linear rails...|$|E

[8, 9] established the 12 -DOF model of the mounting system using the ADAMS software, and researched its vibration isolation performance. Refs. [10 – 12] utilized the multi-objective topology optimization to modify {{the structure of the}} mounting system, considering the static and dynamic loads of the system. Shangguan et al. [13, 14] established the 13 -DOF dynamic model, which includes 6 DOFs of the powertrain, 3 DOFs of the body, and 4 DOFs of the unsprung mass. Considering the vibration and left ear noise as the objective function, parameter matching and optimization of the mounting system were carried out to achieve better vibration isolation performance. In addition, he also investigated the effect of different damage parameters on the prediction of fatigue life of rubber isolators. Angrosch et al. [15] investigated the dynamic performance of hydraulic mounting systems, considering engine torque and road excitation comprehensively. Zhen et al. [16] established 1 -DOF and 3 -DOF models, considering the influence of the stiffness ratio of the <b>mount</b> <b>frame</b> on the vibration isolation material. To ensure that the natural frequency of the system is lower than the first-order harmonic frequency of the engine excitation, the stiffness of the <b>mount</b> <b>frame</b> should be 1 – 10 times that of the vibration isolation material. Wang et al. [17] considered the generalized force transmissibility (GFT) and sum of GFT integrals as the vibration isolation index, and proposed an optimization approach for powertrain mounting systems.|$|E

The problem associated with harnessing solar power mainly comes from the cost and efficiency of the photovoltaic (P-V) panels. This work proffers a solution to this problem by combining the effect of colours and lenses based on the principle of white light spectrum and its behavior with lenses. A 0. 9 m by 0. 3 m mono-crystalline solar panel with a manufacturer specification of 18 % efficiency, 50 W maximum output power, 18 V maximum voltage output & 2. 77 A maximum current output was used for experiments in combination with a sheet of convex lens, glass panes dyed with various colours of the light spectrum, a battery operated portable multimeter, a meter rule, and a <b>mount</b> <b>frame.</b> Experiments were conducted for different time schedules for three days of assumed equal intensity.

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} {{conducted}} at the Swedish Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) on the department of mobile command center with supervised by ÅF. FMV Mobile Command centers main task is to integrate communication systems into Swedish Armed Forces (FM) vehicle systems. FMV has conducted a new radio system that will be integrated in FM. In communications systems various interfaces as mounting interface and connections interface frequent occurs. A mounting interface is an interface were the radio is mounted into a <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> or matching, connection interface is the cables and contacts or interfaces similar. During the procurement of the new radio system no requirements were written in the specification that it should fit in the existing mounting interface called <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> 42 / 48. Nor did the connection interfaces stated requirements in detail. The problem formulation of this thesis reads; How {{is it possible for}} FMV to work with integration of the new communications system in FM vehicles to create the best conditions, inside the boundaries that is given for this thesis? To get an understanding how integration can be better in FMV, questions were formulated from FMV, which are underlying the further work. A good foundation for the analysis are made from the feasibility on how a specification is written in FM, which laws that would have an effect for public authority and which methods and manuals that is available to aid. Interviews are then conducted with staff from FMV and with co-workers on the concept plant in Enköping, a lot of the tryouts of the new communication systems are done. Four different mounting system concepts on how the integrations can be done are evaluated and analyzed to get to a standing point. The conclusion from the analyze of the <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> concepts is that an updated version of the existing <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> could be the best. With the addition that the new acquired <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> also should have the potential to mount older radio systems. A <b>mounting</b> <b>frame</b> adjusts for the new radio system {{at the same time as}} the older fits. In this conclusion recommendations are presented on what FMV could work on to achieve better conditions for the integrations of communications systems. Conclusions that the start of a project is the most important factor, for the whole project to be made. The importance of the knowledge of a change late in a project is much more expensive than early in a project and the project participants have easier to get a clear picture if it is a good startup of a project. To find a common connection interface for the radio systems was not seen as a solution. Instead it is proposed to work with standards where it is possible and detail specifications where it is needed. ISRN UTH...|$|R
