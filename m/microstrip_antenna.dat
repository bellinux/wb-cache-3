50|$|The {{half-wave}} rectangular <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> has {{a virtual}} shorting plane along its center. This may {{be replaced with}} a physical shorting plane to create a quarter-wavelength <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna.</b> This is sometimes called a half-patch. The antenna only has a single radiation edge (equivalent slot) which lowers the directivity/gain of the antenna. The impedance bandwidth is slightly lower than a half-wavelength full patch as the coupling between radiating edges has been eliminated.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} employed <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> is a rectangular patch {{which looks like}} a truncated microstrip transmission line. It is approximately of one-half wavelength long. When air is used as the dielectric substrate, the length of the rectangular <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> is approximately one-half of a free-space wavelength. As the antenna is loaded with a dielectric as its substrate, the length of the antenna decreases as the relative dielectric constant of the substrate increases. The resonant length of the antenna is slightly shorter because of the extended electric [...] "fringing fields" [...] which increase the electrical length of the antenna slightly. An early model of the <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> is a section of microstrip transmission line with equivalent loads on either end to represent the radiation loss.|$|E

50|$|The {{dielectric}} {{loading of}} a <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> affects both its radiation pattern and impedance bandwidth. As the dielectric constant of the substrate increases, the antenna bandwidth decreases {{which increases the}} Q factor of the antenna and therefore decreases the impedance bandwidth. This relationship did not immediately follow when using the transmission line model of the antenna, but is apparent when using the cavity model which {{was introduced in the}} late 1970s by Lo et al. The radiation from a rectangular <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> may be understood as a pair of equivalent slots. These slots act as an array and have the highest directivity when the antenna has an air dielectric and decreases as the antenna is loaded by material with increasing relative dielectric constant.|$|E

5000|$|A {{patch antenna}} (also {{known as a}} {{rectangular}} <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna)</b> {{is a type of}} radio antenna with a low profile, which can be mounted on a flat surface. It consists of a flat rectangular sheet or [...] "patch" [...] of metal, mounted over a larger sheet of metal called a ground plane. They are the original type of <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> described by Howell in 1972; the two metal sheets together form a resonant piece of microstrip transmission line with a length of approximately one-half wavelength of the radio waves. The radiation mechanism arises from discontinuities at each truncated edge of the microstrip transmission line. The radiation at the edges causes the antenna to act slightly larger electrically than its physical dimensions, so in order for the antenna to be resonant, a length of microstrip transmission line slightly shorter than one-half a wavelength at the frequency is used.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> is the patch antenna. Antennas using patches as {{constitutive}} elements in an array are also possible. A patch antenna is a narrowband, wide-beam antenna fabricated by etching the antenna element pattern in metal trace bonded to an insulating dielectric substrate, such as a printed circuit board, with a continuous metal layer bonded to {{the opposite side of the}} substrate which forms a ground plane. Common <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> shapes are square, rectangular, circular and elliptical, but any continuous shape is possible. Some patch antennas do not use a dielectric substrate and instead are made of a metal patch mounted above a ground plane using dielectric spacers; the resulting structure is less rugged but has a wider bandwidth. Because such antennas have a very low profile, are mechanically rugged and can be shaped to conform to the curving skin of a vehicle, they are often mounted on the exterior of aircraft and spacecraft, or are incorporated into mobile radio communications devices.|$|E

Together with the eigenvalues and their deduced indicators, the CMs provide deep physical insights into the radiation mechanisms of <b>microstrip</b> <b>antennas.</b> Numerical results are presented to confirm CM formulation’s effectiveness and accuracy in determining the resonant frequencies, radiating mode currents, and modal fields of <b>microstrip</b> <b>antennas.</b> As opposed to the very popular CM formulation for conducting bodies, comparative studies are presented to show the quite different modal analysis results by considering the multilayered media...|$|R

Lower gain and excitation of surface waves are disadvantages of <b>microstrip</b> <b>antennas.</b> The propagation of surface waves can be efficiently suppressed if the conventional substrate is replaced by an electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) substrate. <b>Microstrip</b> <b>antennas</b> on EBG substrates have been presented in an open literature for several years.

5000|$|In telecommunication, a <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> (also {{known as}} a printed antenna) usually means an antenna {{fabricated}} using microstrip techniques on {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB). [...] They are mostly used at microwave frequencies. An individual <b>microstrip</b> <b>antenna</b> consists of a patch of metal foil of various shapes (a patch antenna) on the surface of a PCB, with a metal foil ground plane {{on the other side of}} the board. Most microstrip antennas consist of multiple patches in a two-dimensional array. The antenna is usually connected to the transmitter or receiver through foil microstrip transmission lines. The radio frequency current is applied (or in receiving antennas the received signal is produced) between the antenna and ground plane. Microstrip antennas have become very popular in recent decades due to their thin planar profile which can be incorporated into the surfaces of consumer products, aircraft and missiles; their ease of fabrication using printed circuit techniques; the ease of integrating the antenna on the same board with the rest of the circuit, and the possibility of adding active devices such as microwave integrated circuits to the antenna itself to make active antennas.|$|E

5000|$|Higher-gain {{omnidirectional}} antennas {{can also}} be built. [...] "Higher gain" [...] in this case means that the antenna radiates less energy at higher and lower elevation angles and more in the horizontal directions. High-gain omnidirectional antennas are generally realized using collinear dipole arrays. These consist of multiple half-wave dipoles mounted collinearly (in a line), fed in phase. The coaxial collinear (COCO) antenna uses transposed coaxial sections to produce in-phase half-wavelength radiators. A Franklin Array uses short U-shaped half-wavelength sections whose radiation cancels in the far-field to bring each half-wavelength dipole section into equal phase. Another type is the Omnidirectional <b>Microstrip</b> <b>Antenna</b> (OMA).|$|E

Whereas multiband PIFAs exhibit two resonant modes, which operate by sharing the same available antenna volume, the FICA structure is synthesised in order to sustain three resonant modes that better reuse the volume. The implementation of volume reuse allows spreading of the reactive electromagnetic energy associated with each resonant mode across the entire antenna volume. This results in FICA modes exhibiting a lower Q factor and a wider fractional bandwidth than the corresponding PIFA modes.|$|E
