Switched-mode supplies with protection circuits may briefly turn on but then shut down when no load has been detected.

Comparing the configurations of the semifluxon, we find an energy barrier similar to the Peierls-Nabarro barrier. We calculate numerically the <b>minimum</b> bias <b>current</b> density to overcome this barrier which {{is a function of}} the lattice spacing. It is found that the <b>minimum</b> bias <b>current</b> is the critical current for the existence of static lattice semifluxons. For bias current density above the minimum value, the semifluxon changes the polarity and releases 2 π fluxons. An analytical approximation to the critical current as a function of the lattice spacing is presented...|$|R
