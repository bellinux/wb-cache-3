5|$|Financial {{problems}} with the defense budget in 1964 prevented the substantial sums required from being allocated. Continuing financial short-falls prevented the proposed effort from getting off the ground. This, {{as well as a}} serious accident in 1969 which caused a partial <b>meltdown</b> in the small Lucens pilot reactor, strengthened opposition against the Swiss nuclear program.|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{following}} question: how can a group of rational, and often very sophisticated, financial actors cause financial <b>meltdowns,</b> in the regular course of business? There is no doubt much {{we still need to}} learn about irrational financial <b>meltdowns,</b> but more likely than not, cognitive shortcomings only make matters worse: they exacerbate the type of behavior that can lead even super-rational actors to cause financial <b>meltdowns...</b>|$|R

50|$|With nuclear <b>meltdowns</b> in Chernobyl and Fukushima, {{nuclear power}} {{presents}} a constant danger {{and is more}} unlikely to be a popular alternative source. The costs of maintaining nuclear facilities, the potential risk of <b>meltdowns,</b> {{and the cost of}} cleaning up <b>meltdowns</b> are cited as reasons behind the movement away from the use of nuclear energy. In some countries nuclear power plants cannot compete with fossil fuels currently due to the latter's lower price and availability. Nuclear power plants also face competition from the increasing renewable energy subsidies.|$|R

5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He {{has no idea what}} to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear <b>meltdown</b> even though there was no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye (1995) is {{the seventeenth}} spy {{film in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions, {{and the first to}} star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite against London to cause a global financial <b>meltdown.</b>|$|E

5|$|GoldenEye 007 is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Rare {{and based on}} the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. It was released for the Nintendo 64 video game console in August 1997. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial <b>meltdown.</b> The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete in different types of deathmatch games.|$|E
5|$|On April 27, 2004, Patti Smith {{released}} Trampin' {{which included}} several songs about motherhood, partly {{in tribute to}} Smith's mother, who had died two years before.

Smith curated the <b>Meltdown</b> festival in London on June 25, 2005, the penultimate event being the first live performance of Horses in its entirety. Guitarist Tom Verlaine took Oliver Ray's place. This live performance was released {{later in the year}} as Horses/Horses.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{once again}} {{put up the}} only points for the offense in another humiliating blowout, this time a 45-14 loss to the Detroit Lions. Sanchez played {{relatively}} well, avoiding a 3-and-out on the first drive with a 5-yard scramble and managing {{to tie the game}} 7-7 with a touchdown pass to Brent Celek, but a defensive <b>meltdown</b> and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless, and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0-2 record as starter. Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which translated into a passer rating of 116.1.|$|E

5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core <b>meltdown</b> in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E
5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear reactor safety standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear <b>meltdown</b> would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E
5|$|Chell and GLaDOS {{return to}} the modern {{chambers}} and face Wheatley, who is driven by GLaDOS's software to test them against a series of traps, which Chell escapes. In their final confrontation, Chell attaches three corrupted personality cores (Nolan North) to Wheatley, allowing a second core transfer to restore GLaDOS to control. However, Wheatley blows up the button needed to activate the transfer. With the facility exploding around them due to the impending <b>meltdown</b> of its reactor core, the roof collapses revealing the night sky, whereupon Chell places a portal on the moon overhead. The vacuum of space pulls her and Wheatley through the other portal still inside the chamber, and GLaDOS reasserts her control. GLaDOS retrieves Chell, who falls unconscious, and Wheatley is left in space with a corrupt personality core orbiting him.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} <b>meltdown</b> {{was accompanied}} by increasing political tension. Anti-Chinese riots occurred in Situbondo (1996), Tasikmalaya (1996), Banjarmasin (1997), and Makassar (1997); while violent ethnic clashes broke out between the Dayak and Madurese settlers in Central Kalimantan in 1997. Golkar won the rigged 1997 MPR elections and in March 1998, Suharto was voted unanimously to another five-year term. He appointed his protégé BJ Habibie as vice-president while stacking the cabinet with his own family and business associates (his daughter Tutut became Minister of Social Affairs). The appointments and the government's unrealistic 1998 budget created further currency instability, rumours and panic led to a run on stores and pushed up prices. The Government increased the fuel prices further by 70% on May 1998, which triggered another wave of riots in Medan.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{building}} an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area {{was a significant}} issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic nuclear <b>meltdown</b> blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even {{in the event of}} a runaway reaction. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction. The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind fission products that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total neutron flux.|$|E

Inez's ex-husband Marvin offers him a dilapidated food truck, and Carl reluctantly accepts.
