5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial tensions and conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's <b>Medallion,</b> the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem. It is a bronze <b>medallion</b> said to contain a dark deity who brought chaos to the world 800 years before and caused all the world but Tellius to be engulfed by the sea. To prevent the dark god being freed, war must be prevented in Tellius.|$|E

40|$|The multiple-spiral <b>medallions</b> are {{beautiful}} decorations {{situated in the}} proximity of the small copies of the Mandelbrot set. They are composed by an infinity of babies Mandelbrot sets that have external arguments with known structure. In this paper we study the coupling patterns of the external arguments of the baby Mandelbrot sets in multiple-spiral <b>medallions,</b> that is, how these external arguments are grouped in pairs. Based on our experimental data, we obtain that the canonical nonspiral <b>medallions</b> have a nested pairs pattern, the canonical single-spiral <b>medallions</b> have an adjacent pairs pattern, and we conjecture that the canonical double, triple, quadruplespiral <b>medallions</b> have a 1 -nested/adjacent pairs pattern.
