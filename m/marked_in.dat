5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are <b>marked</b> <b>in</b> their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies.

Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
