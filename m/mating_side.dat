50|$|A model mate {{is a type}} of pure mate checkmating {{position}} in chess in which not only is the checkmated king and all vacant squares in its field attacked only once, and squares in the kings field occupied by friendly units are not also attacked by the <b>mating</b> <b>side</b> (unless such a unit is necessarily pinned to the king), but all units of the <b>mating</b> <b>side</b> (with the possible exception of the king and pawns) participate actively in forming the mating net.|$|E
50|$|If all {{units of}} the <b>mating</b> <b>side,</b> with the {{possible}} exception of the king and pawns, are involved in a pure mate, then it is a model mate; if all units of both colours are involved in a pure mate, then it is an ideal mate.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Monday {{looked at}} the speaker as if the {{intended}} consolation had failed of its effect, and the captain began to suspect that he should find a difficult subject for his new ministrations. By way of gaining time, he thrust an elbow into the <b>mate's</b> <b>side</b> as a hint that it was now his turn to offer something.|$|R
60|$|Gurney and Dick Barnes {{immediately}} {{sided with}} Glynn also, but Jim Scroggles and Nikel Sling, and, {{to the surprise}} of every one, Markham, the second <b>mate,</b> <b>sided</b> with the steward. As the opposing parties glanced at each other, Glynn observed that, although his side was superior in numbers, some {{of the largest and most}} powerful men of the crew were among his opponents, and he felt that a conflict between such men must inevitably be serious. Matters had almost come to a crisis when Dr Hopley and the captain approached the scene of action. The latter saw at a glance the state of affairs, and stepping up to the steward, ordered him at once into the hut.|$|R

50|$|A pure mate is a checkmating {{position}} in chess {{in which the}} mated king and all vacant squares in its field are attacked only once, and squares in the king's field occupied by friendly units are not also attacked by the <b>mating</b> <b>side</b> (unless such a unit is necessarily pinned to the king to avoid it interposing to block the check or capturing of mating unit).|$|E
40|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, mates in the non-traditional side-by-side {{position or}} the front-to-front (ventroventral) position. Because neither the male nor the female {{can see their}} genitals during mating, their bodies must be geometrically aligned for males to successfully deliver their sperm into the female’s vagina. In this study, a conservative estimate of the random probability of mating success was calculated {{in the same way}} as one would calculate the random probability of a dart hitting the center of a target. One would determine the area of the bull’s-eye relative to the area of the entire target. To determine the probability of the male’s penis randomly hitting the female’s vaginal area, we calculated the area of the vagina relative to the female’s frontal area and estimated that the probability of random mating success for dolphins was ~ 1. 6 % or fewer than 2 chances out of a hundred. Several adaptations for increasing mating success have evolved including the male’s prehensile (grasping) penis which allows him to penetrate the female from any angle whether they are <b>mating</b> <b>side</b> by side or front to front...|$|E

60|$|Tarzan {{increased}} his speed then until he fairly {{flew through the}} forest, nor was it long before he came upon the tribe. He saw them before they saw him, for of all the jungle creatures, none passed more quietly than Tarzan of the Apes.

Not for long would she feed thus in loneliness, thought Tarzan, as with a bound he landed amongst them.|$|R
5000|$|Jenynsia is a genus of {{freshwater}} fishes {{in the family}} Anablepidae.

40|$|Devices {{that look}} and {{function}} much like conventional zippers on clothing {{have been proposed}} as connectors for flexible electronic circuits. Heretofore, flexible electronic circuits have commonly included rigid connectors like those of conventional rigid electronic circuits. The proposed zipper connectors would {{make it possible to}} connect and disconnect flexible circuits quickly and easily. Moreover, the flexibility of zipper connectors would make them more (relative to rigid connectors) compatible with flexible circuits, so that the advantages of flexible circuitry could be realized more fully. Like a conventional zipper, a zipper according to the proposal would include teeth anchored on flexible tapes, a slider with a loosely attached clasp, a box {{at one end of the}} rows of mating teeth, and stops at the opposite ends. The tapes would be made of a plastic or other dielectric material. On each of the two <b>mating</b> <b>sides</b> of the zipper, metal teeth would alternate with dielectric (plastic) teeth, there being two metal teeth for each plastic one. When the zipper was closed, each metal tooth from one side would be in mechanical and electrical contact with a designated metal tooth from the other <b>side,</b> and these <b>mating</b> metal teeth would be electrically insulated from the next pair of mating metal teeth by an intervening plastic tooth. The metal teeth would be soldered or crimped to copper tabs. Wires or other conductors connected to electronic circuits would be soldered or crimped to the ends of the tabs opposite the teeth...|$|R
50|$|In chess, {{an ideal}} mate is a checkmate {{position}} {{that is a}} special form of model mate. While in a model mate, each piece on the <b>mating</b> player's <b>side</b> (possibly excluding the king and pawns depending on context) participates in the mate, an ideal mate involves all {{the pieces of the}} mated player's as well, typically by blocking the mated king's field of movement so that it cannot escape. As in a model mate, an ideal mate also involves the mating pieces attacking the vacant squares around the mated king's exactly once, and not attacking the mated player's other pieces occupying the king's field of movement.|$|R
5000|$|Four-eyed {{fish are}} livebearers. Along with their sister genus Jenynsia they <b>mate</b> on one <b>side</b> only, right-"handed" [...] males with left-"handed" [...] females and vice versa.

60|$|The minutes were as centuries, {{until the}} bow paid {{off and the}} Elsinore, turned tail before it, righted to an even keel. Immediately this was {{accomplished}} Captain West had her brought back upon the wind. And immediately, thereupon, the big foresail went adrift from its gaskets. The shock, or succession of shocks, to the ship, from the tremendous buffeting that followed, was fearful. It seemed she was being racked to pieces. Master and <b>mate</b> were <b>side</b> by side when this happened, and the expressions on their faces typified them. In neither face was apprehension. Mr. Pike's face bore a sour sneer for the worthless sailors who had botched the job. Captain West's face was serenely considerative.|$|R

40|$|Electro-microfluidics is {{experiencing}} explosive growth in new product developments. There are many commercial applications for electro-microfluidic {{devices such as}} chemical sensors, biological sensors, and drop ejectors for both printing and chemical analysis. The number of silicon surface micromachined electro-microfluidic products is likely to increase. Manufacturing efficiency and integration of microfluidics with electronics will become important. Surface micromachined microfluidic devices are manufactured with the same tools as IC's (integrated circuits) and their fabrication {{can be incorporated into}} the IC fabrication process. In order to realize applications for devices must be developed. An Electro-Microfluidic Dual In-line Package (EMDIP{trademark}) was developed surface micromachined electro-microfluidic devices, a practical method for getting fluid into these to be a standard solution that allows for both the electrical and the fluidic connections needed to operate a great variety of electro-microfluidic devices. The EMDIP{trademark} includes a fan-out manifold that, on one <b>side,</b> <b>mates</b> directly with the 200 micron diameter Bosch etched holes found on the device, and, on the other <b>side,</b> <b>mates</b> to lager 1 mm diameter holes. To minimize cost the EMDIP{trademark} can be injection molded in a great variety of thermoplastics which also serve to optimize fluid compatibility. The EMDIP{trademark} plugs directly into a fluidic printed wiring board using a standard dual in-line package pattern for the electrical connections and having a grid of multiple 1 mm diameter fluidic connections to mate to the underside of the EMDIP{trademark}...|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day Dick Shand was sick, repentant, and idle. On the third, he {{returned}} to his work,--working however, with difficulty. After that, he fairly recovered himself, and the two Cambridge men went on resolutely at their hole. They soon found how hard it was not to go astray without their instructed <b>mate.</b> The <b>sides</b> of the shaft became crooked and uneven, and the windlass sometimes could not be made to work. But still they persevered, and went on by themselves for an entire week without a sign of gold. During this time various fruitless expeditions were made by both the men in search of Maggott. He was still at the same drinking-shop, but could not be induced to leave it. At last they found him with the incipient horrors of delirium tremens, and yet they could not get him away. The man who kept the place was quite used to delirium tremens, and thought nothing about it. When Caldigate tried a high moral tone everybody around him laughed at him.|$|R

60|$|There was {{a pretty}} country {{simplicity}} in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion. I believe {{he knew it was}} his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe; nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have involved the loss of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice. At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate. I was thinking something of the same; took the <b>mate</b> upon one <b>side,</b> arranged with him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers.|$|R
40|$|The fiddler crab, Uca beebei, {{lives in}} {{individually}} defended burrows, in mixed-sex colonies on intertidal mud flats. Avian predation is common, especially of crabs unable to escape into burrows. Mating pairs form in two ways. Females either mate {{on the surface}} at their burrow entrance ('surface mating') or leave their own burrow and sequentially enter and leave ('sample') courting males' burrows, before staying in one to mate underground ('burrow mating'). We tested whether perceived predation risk affects the relative frequency of these mating modes. We first observed mating under natural levels of predation during one biweekly, semi-lunar cycle. We then experimentally increased the perceived predation risk by attracting grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) to each half of the study site in two successive biweekly cycles. In each experimental cycle, crabs were {{significantly less likely to}} <b>mate</b> on the <b>side</b> with more birds. Moreover, on the side with elevated predation risk, the number of females leaving burrows to sample was greatly reduced relative to the number of females that surface-mated. Males waved less and built fewer mud pillars, which attract females, when birds were present. We discuss several plausible proximate explanations for these results and the effect of changes in predation regime on sexual selection...|$|R
5000|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of five years. They {{experience}} sexual swelling, which involves the genitals becoming pink or reddened. [...] At one site, matings largely take place between February and November, while births occur between March and May. Copulations tend to last for half a minute. [...] The male will grab the female by the ankles or torso and mount her from behind. Both sexes will encourage mating, but they are not always successful. [...] When soliciting, both sexes will make pouted faces. In addition, males will sometimes vocalize and females will present their backsides and shake their head from <b>side</b> to <b>side.</b> <b>Mating</b> pairs are sometimes harassed by subadults. Proboscis monkeys may also engage in mounting with no reproductive purpose, such as playful and same-sex mounting, and females will attempt to initiate copulation even after they have conceived. Gestation usually last 166-200 days or slightly more. Females tend to give birth at night or in the early morning. The mothers then eat the placenta and lick their infants clean. The young begin to eat solid foods at six weeks and are weaned at seven months old. The nose of a young male grows slowly until reaching adulthood. The mother will allow other members of her group to hold her infant. When a resident male in a one-male group is replaced, the infants are at risk of infanticide.|$|R
60|$|So there went on {{a battle}} between them. She knew she never fully had him. Some part, big and vital in him, she had no hold over; nor did she ever try to get it, or even to realise what it was. And he knew {{in some way that}} she held herself still as Mrs. Dawes. She did not love Dawes, never had loved him; but she {{believed}} he loved her, at least depended on her. She felt a certain surety about him that she never felt with Paul Morel. Her passion for the young man had filled her soul, given her a certain satisfaction, eased her of her self-mistrust, her doubt. Whatever else she was, she was inwardly assured. It was almost as if she had gained HERSELF, and stood now distinct and complete. She had received her confirmation; but she never believed that her life belonged to Paul Morel, nor his to her. They would separate in the end, and {{the rest of her life}} would be an ache after him. But at any rate, she knew now, she was sure of herself. And the same could almost be said of him. Together they had received the baptism of life, each through the other; but now their missions were separate. Where he wanted to go she could not come with him. They would have to part sooner or later. Even if they married, and were faithful to each other, still he would have to leave her, go on alone, and she would only have to attend to him when he came home. But it was not possible. Each wanted a <b>mate</b> to go <b>side</b> by side with.|$|R
40|$|Reptile {{populations are}} {{suffering}} substantial global losses and roads {{are identified as}} one of the leading threats to their persistence. Currently, efforts to mitigate this threat are being implemented with various levels of success. I studied the effectiveness of exclusion structures (i. e., fencing) at preventing reptiles from gaining access to the road, and reducing road mortality. I also examined if population connectivity structures (i. e., ecopassages) were effective at reducing habitat and population fragmentation and allowing individuals to access habitats, resources, and <b>mates</b> on both <b>sides</b> of a major road (4 lane highway). I found that the fence was ineffective at preventing reptiles from gaining access to the road; however, reptiles were observed using the ecopassages to cross the road. Behavioural trials testing painted turtles’ (Chrysemys picta) willingness to use an ecopassage demonstrated that refusal was twice more likely than use of an ecopassage. I also examined the potential for roads to pose a physiological threat to roadside populations of reptiles by examining corticosterone (CORT), a stress hormone linked to negative health effects in cases of elevated levels over the long-term. To assess if individuals living near a major road had higher CORT levels than individuals from a less impacted population, I developed a novel means of measuring CORT from painted turtle claws in partnership with Dr. Gabriela Mastromonaco (Toronto Zoo). With long-term CORT levels considered as a proxy for chronic physiological stress, I did not find evidence that populations near roads had altered stress levels. However, this seminal study will provide the framework for further examination of more species, including species-at-risk, and a better understanding of effects of anthropogenic environments on wildlife health. As road ecologists strive to expand our understanding of the threats roads pose to reptiles, it is important that this field spans multiple disciplines, so that we can both understand the direct and indirect threats that roads cause and develop effective mitigation that preserves biodiversity within our anthropogenic landscape.
