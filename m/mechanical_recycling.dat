30|$|PET flakes can be {{reprocessed}} into fibers by {{the melt}} extrusion system. Currently, {{there are two}} methods {{for the production of}} recycled PET fibers from <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling.</b> One is the more common method where PET flakes are extruded directly into fibers, and the other is the conversion method where PET flakes are reprocessed into granules or pellets and then melt extruded into fibers. Compared with chemical recycling, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> of PET has many advantages, such as the relative simplicity of the process, low investment cost, utilization of readily available equipment, flexibility of feedstock supply, and little negative environmental effect. However, <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> can degrade the printability or dyeability of the final product because of the cyclic and linear oligomers generated (Dulio et al. 1995). The yellowing of mechanically recycled PET is also a significant problem because of the intramolecular cross-linking and oxidation reactions (Edge et al. 1996). Above all, the major disadvantage of <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> is the reduction of the molecular weight or intrinsic viscosity, by thermal and hydrolytic degradation. Both the academic and industrial fields have explored methods for maintaining the molecular weight or intrinsic viscosity during the <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> process of postconsumer PET.|$|E
40|$|The {{recycling}} of packaging waste {{is an important}} part of the EU circular economy package, with a political focus on raising the recycling targets for post-consumer plastic packaging waste (PPW). The {{recycling of}} PPW involves at least three steps; collection, sorting and <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling.</b> In contrast to the first two steps, <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> is poorly documented, as it is considered a free market activity. In order to provide a complete chain description the <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> yields were determined. The recovery of mass was determined for the main plastic sorting products from both major collection systems: separate collection (SC) and mechanical recovery (MR) from municipal solid waste. This technical assessment was conducted with a laboratory set-up for a standard <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> process. This analysis showed that there is a substantial sample-to-sample variation in polymeric composition between similar feedstocks and this variation is also observed in recovered masses. Next, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> of polyethylene feedstocks was studied more in depth. Six PE feedstocks with a gradual increasing level of complexity (from only transparent PE bottle bodies to the complete PE sorting product according to DKR 329), were prepared and mechanical recycled with the laboratory set-up. Since the polymeric composition of both the six feedstocks and the six floating milled goods were known, the net PE recycling yield could be calculated. The net PE yields are close to 100 % for such a standard recycling process. Additionally, the compositional analysis revealed that contaminants are only partially removed by the standard <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> process...|$|E

The effects of triticale content, the presence of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (PP-g-MA) as coupling agent and of calcium oxide (CaO) as reactive additive on biocomposite properties are discussed. Biocomposites were prepared by twin-screw extrusion process and injection molding. The compounded biocomposites were characterized in terms of morphology, rheology, thermal and <b>mechanical</b> properties, <b>recycling</b> behavior and fire resistance. The morphological observation shows that a good dispersion of triticale straw in PP can be achieved during the compounding step for all the formulations. Biocomposite viscosity and mechanical properties were increased when triticale straw content increased up to 40 vol%. Mechanical properties were further improved {{in the presence of}} PP-g-MA and CaO. The reactive additive, CaO, provides superior strength, modulus as well as fire resistance, and upgrades the triticale straw classification from regular filler to reinforcement category. All biocomposites formulated exhibit a good recycling ability. The results demonstrate that triticale straw acts as a good reinforcement and has a great potential in thermoplastic composites field if the processing technique and formulation are appropriate.

The heterogeneity of the PET waste is the main issue for <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> because the complexity and contamination of the PET waste {{makes it difficult to}} recycle mechanically. The decline in the product quality is also the main disadvantage of <b>mechanical</b> <b>recycling</b> because the heat of fusion causes photo-oxidation, and mechanical stress results from the inverse reaction.

30|$|Upflow {{anaerobic}} {{sludge blanket}} (UASB) reactors {{have been widely}} used for the treatment of industrial wastewater (Tóth et al. 2011). This reactor has been successfully applied for high-rate anaerobic wastewater treatment. The success of UASB depends on the formation of active and able granules (Fang et al. 1994). These granules consist of self-immobilized, compact form of aggregate of organisms and lead to an effective retention of organisms in the reactor (Akunna and Clark 2000). The advantages of UASB reactor are independence from <b>mechanical</b> mixing, <b>recycling</b> of sludge biomass and ability to cope up with perturbances caused by the high loading rate. UASB reactor is effective in the treatment of industrial wastewater in psychrophile conditions. Some researchers have utilized a hybrid UASB reactor for the treatment of chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater (Oktem et al. 2007). In 2009, hybrid UASB reactor was reported to treat bulk drug industrial wastewater utilizing thermophilic strain (Sreekanth et al. (2009). Tóth et al (2011) studied the performance of a laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor for treatment of a chemical synthesis-based pharmaceutical wastewater, under different operating conditions. The key feature of the UASB process that allows the use of high volumetric COD loadings as compared to other anaerobic processes is the development of a dense granulated sludge, characterized by the wastewater characterstics.|$|R
