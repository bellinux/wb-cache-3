The importance of these effects varies between the different metal ions due to changes in the separation of the metal ion atomic states. Furthermore, the change in the metal-water repulsion when a second water is added also changes the relative importance of the different metal asymptotes.

The conventional replica techniques based on resin or elastomer positive dies, have some limitations due to the instability of the sample die in the scanning electron microscope (S. E.

Therefore, a new replica technique has been developed using a low viscosity impression material that is subsequently copperplated and poured with synthetic plaster. This offers a stable <b>metal</b> <b>positive</b> die suitable for direct examination in the S. E. M. without prior gold evaporation. Higher magnifications (greater than 7500) are easily obtained without the danger of artifacts.

Studies investigating the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes have often reached different conclusions, probably because insufficient {{attention has been paid to}} some aspects including (1) which biodiversity measure (e. g., species number, species identity or trait) better explains ecosystem functioning, (2) the mechanisms underpinning biodiversity effects, and (3) how can environmental context modulates biodiversity effects. Here, we investigated how species number (one to three species) and traits of aquatic fungal decomposers (by replacement of a functional type from an unpolluted site by another from a metal-polluted site) affect fungal production (biomass acumulation) and plant litter decomposition in the presence and absence of metal stress. To examine the putative mechanisms that explain biodiversity effects, we determined the contribution of each fungal species to the total biomass produced in multicultures by real-time PCR. In the absence of <b>metal,</b> <b>positive</b> diversity effects were observed for fungal production and leaf decomposition as a result of species complementarity. Metal stress decreased diversity effects on leaf decomposition in assemblages containing the functional type from the unpolluted site, probably due to competitive interactions between fungi. However, dominance effect maintained positive diversity effects under metal stress in assemblages containing the functional type from the metal-polluted site. These findings emphasize the importance of intraspecific diversity in modulating diversity effects under metal stress, providing evidence that trait-based diversity measures should be incorporated when examining biodiversity effects.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The nephrotoxicities of the {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotics tobramycin (TBM) and netilmicin (NTM) {{were studied}} in rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) {{to determine the}} usefulness of salmonids as a sensitive animal mode for investigating the nephrotoxic potential of these agents. Logit analysis revealed that 8 - 12 day i. p. LD 50 's in rainbow trout for TBM and NTM were 53 mg/kg ± 1 mg/kg and 55 mg/kg ± 1 mg/kg respectively (95 % c. i.); a no effect dose in rats. Kidney sections from treated animals showed moderate to severe dose-dependent proximal tubular necrosis in both groups, suggesting death of the trout {{as a consequence of}} renal failure. NTM caused a greater incidence of glomerular lesions than did TBM. Kidney sections taken one month after a single injection of TBM showed active proximal tubular necrosis suggesting a high binding affinity of these agents for renal tissue. Investigations with transected, catheterized trout given single i. p. injections of 15 or 30 mg/kg TBM or NTM revealed that the earliest and most sensitive indicators of nephrotoxicity were decreases in glomerular filtration rate and proximal tubule secretory ability. This was measured by a decreased clearance of ³H methoxyinulin and ¹⁴C PAH, as compared to saline controls. This was followed by decreased urine flow, and increased urine osmolality and proteinuria. Renal function indices showed the greatest difference from controls at 30 hrs., while histology showed the greatest damage between days 5 and 7. Susceptibility to nephrotoxicity may reflect the individual's ability to effectively compensate for the drug induced drop in renal function. Injection i. v. of the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>positive</b> control cisplatin caused lethality (16. 7 %) at 2 mg/kg, an approximate human therapeutic dose.

With soft bases the central metal atom is made a softer Lewis acid, because the <b>metal’s</b> <b>positive</b> charge is reduced by delocalization of electron density from the ligand into the ligand-metal bond.

Significant differences between the holo- and apoproteins are confined to the region where the metals are bound. These differences include a reorganization and disordering of the loop, consisting of residues 7 - 25, that contains all of the direct metal ligands of the protein.

However, the chemical constituents and pollution sources underlying these associations remain unclear. We conducted a cohort panel study involving 97 elderly subjects living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Airway and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured weekly over 12 weeks and included, exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde (EBC MDA), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Exposures included 7 -day personal nitrogen oxides (NOx), daily criteria-pollutant data, five-day average particulate matter (PM) measured in three size-fractions and characterized by chemical components including transition metals, and in vitro PM oxidative potential (dithiothreitol and macrophage reactive oxygen species). Associations between biomarkers and pollutants were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models. We found significant positive associations of airway oxidative stress and inflammation with traffic-related air pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition <b>metals.</b> <b>Positive</b> but nonsignificant associations were observed with PM oxidative potential. The strongest associations were observed among PM variables in the ultrafine range (PM < 0. 18 µm). It was estimated that an interquartile increase in 5 -day average ultrafine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was associated with a 6. 3 % (95 % CI: 1. 1 %, 11. 6 %) increase in EBC MDA and 6. 7 % (95 % CI: 3. 4 %, 10. 2 %) increase in FeNO. In addition, positive but nonsignificant associations were observed between oxLDL and traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition metals while plasma IL- 6 was positively associated with 1 -day average traffic-related pollutants.
