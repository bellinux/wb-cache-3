50|$|Under the Haldane Reforms of the Army of 1908, the Territorial Force {{was formed}} and {{organised}} into 14 regional divisions, each with area brigades and local battalions. The divisions {{were intended to}} be replicas of the regular army divisions of approximately 18,000 men on mobilisation including infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineer, <b>medical,</b> <b>supply</b> and signal <b>units.</b> The Northumbrian Division was typical, consisting of three infantry brigades, the 'Northumberland', 'York and Durham' and 'Durham Light Infantry (DLI)' Brigades. Each brigade was composed of four infantry battalions, descendants of the local Volunteer corps. In 1907 Lieutenant General Robert Baden-Powell was appointed to command the division; he held command from April 1908 to 1910.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1958, Kearsarge was fitted out as an antisubmarine warfare support carrier and {{reclassified}} CVS-33.

Her planes landed parties of <b>medical</b> and <b>supply</b> <b>units,</b> while her crew and air group donated clothing and money to the distressed people. After participating in SEATO exercises and 7th Fleet operations, she cleared Yokosuka on 3 March 1960 for her homeward voyage. Three days later in stormy waters 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) off Wake Island, four Russians were rescued after drifting 49 days in disabled landing craft. They were flown back to their country after Kearsarge arrived in Alameda, California on 15 March; and the carrier received thanks from the Soviet Union for this gesture.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedManaging {{the distribution of}} <b>medical</b> <b>supplies</b> to clinical <b>units</b> within a hospital is {{a key component of}} a hospital’s administrative costs. In an attempt to control costs, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) installed a two-bin kanban system across multiple departments. In this thesis, we analyze the effectiveness of the kanban system from two viewpoints: organizational benefits—defined as the process of organizing the supply-chain into the two-bin kanban system—and inventory benefit—defined as the effects of staging the resupply in a two-bin fashion. We analyze two years of data, across twelve departments, comprising almost 375, 000 items ordered. The results show significant organizational benefits to the hospital overall, and a steady-state in inventory costs. The data did not show consistent results across individual departments, with departments experiencing increases, decreases, and steady-states for both benefits. Additionally, we note that there is further room for WRNMMC to exploit the kanban system's ability to optimize inventory sizes via the two-bin kanban process. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
