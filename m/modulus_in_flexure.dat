Composites containing w = 20 and 30 % rice hulls (RH), as well as composites {{with a certain amount of}} PP matrix substituted with a coupling agent, were prepared by extrusion and compression moulding. The composites’ mechanical properties were investigated through tensile and fracture tests at low and high strain rate, using the concept of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Introduction of rice hulls in the PP matrix resulted in a decreased stress at peak, together with increase of composites tensile modulus (EPP = 1013 MPa, EPP/RH (ζ = 0. 70 : 0. 30) = 1690 MPa) and <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> Introduction of w = 5 % PP-g-MA caused 6 % and 12 % improvement in the composite tensile strength, respectively for the PP composites with w = 20 and 30 % rice hulls. <b>Modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> for the composite PP/RH/CA (ζ = 0. 65 : 0. 30 : 0. 05) reached Ef = 1646 MPa, which was an improvement of 52 % when compared to pure polypropylene.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of concrete are usually evaluated from compressive strength test results. Extensive literature, codes and regulations recommend {{the prediction of}} mechanical properties such as splitting and flexural tensile strength using the compressive strength of cylindrical specimens. These expressions are not related {{with the type of}} concrete and, generally, are only a function of the cylindrical compressive strength. It is the objective of this research work to investigate the validity of the existing relationships for enhanced performance concrete, obtained by replacing cement with fly ash for up to 60 % in weight. The experimental program investigated the effect of replacing cement with fly ash on the mechanical properties, i. e. compressive strength, splitting-tensile strength and flexural-tensile behaviour. Results obtained show that, in most cases, a good linear correlation exists between the evaluated mechanical properties, i. e. splitting-tensile strength, flexural-tensile strength and elasticity <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>flexure,</b> and the square root of compressive strength. This further indicates that an increase in the compressive strength produces a less pronounced increase of the tensile strength...|$|E

40|$|The stress–strain {{characteristic}} of concrete developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> {{is one of}} the essential parameters for the ultimate flexural strength design of reinforced concrete (RC) members. Currently, the stress–strain curve of concrete developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> is obtained by scaling down the uniaxial stress–strain curve. In current RC design codes, it is represented by an equivalent rectangular concrete stress block depending solely on the concrete strength. By comparing the theoretical strength evaluated for the stress block with the measured strength, the authors found that current codes underestimate the actual flexural strength of RC beams and columns by 9 % and 19 %, respectively. Since the underestimation is different for beams and columns, which are subjected to different strain gradients at ultimate, it is suggested that the maximum concrete stresses developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> should depend also on strain gradient. The effects of strain gradient on the concrete stress developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> were investigated <b>in</b> this work by testing RC columns under concentric and eccentric axial loads or horizontal loads. The concrete stress–strain curves of the eccentrically/horizontally loaded specimens were derived by modifying those of concentrically loaded counterparts based on axial force and moment equilibriums. The results indicate that the maximum concrete stress developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> depends significantly on strain gradient. Formulas were developed to correlate the maximum and equivalent concrete stresses developed <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> to the strain gradient.

40|$|Abstract. The {{intrinsic}} {{advantages of}} strengthening the steel-based structures {{by the use}} of fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) material have not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, a succinct overview of recent studies made to enhance the strength of steel beams using FRP laminates is presented. The results presented and dis-cussed in this paper were obtained by closely studying the behaviour of steel beams strengthened with carbon FRP material. An attempt is made to succinctly sum-marise the findings for two different types of strengthening of the steel beams using carbon FRP laminates. The first type of beams focuses on enhancing the strength of steel <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> while the second focuses on increasing the shear strength of the beams. Three beams were designed so as to cause them to fail <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> Of the beams studied, two were strengthened using carbon FRP strips attached to the tension flange. One of the beams was tested to facilitate comparison of their behaviour to the two beams which are strengthened <b>in</b> <b>flexure.</b> Three other beams were designed such that they failed predominantly in shear. Of these three, two were strengthened with carbon FRP strips attached to the webs while the third beam was used as a control beam for the purpose of drawing comparisons. Pre-liminary results revealed a noticeable increase in the strength for both the flexure strengthened beams and the beams strengthened in shear. The observed increase in shear strength of the beams was 26 % while the increase in strength for the beams tested <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> was 15 %. This study convincingly shows that it is possi-ble to strengthen steel beams using carbon FRP laminates <b>in</b> both <b>flexure</b> and <b>in</b> shear...|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{behavior}} of plain concrete is customary {{assumed to be}} linear, and the stiffness modulus is approached by {{the value of the}} initial tangent stiffness <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> compression. However, even two decades ago the contrary was proven by the experimental results on plain concrete in direct tension. The stress-strain {{behavior of}} concrete in tension was demonstrated to be highly non-linear, even at very low stress levels. One of the major difficulties in obtaining an accurate tensile stiffness response is to achieve a uniform tensile stress in the section, without creating stress concentrations at any point along the section. These stress disparities will lead to micro crack initiation and falsely recorded responses. A non-linear Finite Element Model (FEM) based on the anisotropic material approach, was developed to produce the load-displacement response of a concrete beam loaded with a two point loading system. The load-displacement curves and stress-strain curves were validated to laboratory tested specimens having identical material properties.

The thesis investigates the faults and omissions of existing work and judges today's requirements thereby constructing a framework with which today's and future standards <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing can be based. The draft standard presented in this thesis covers the three major testing methods for determining the biaxial flexural strength (modulus of rupture) of engineering ceramics. The ring-on-ring, ball-on-ring, and 4 -Ball test fixtures were all adopted as standard, since it is known that each of these systems is suited for a particular application and each has different advantages and disadvantages. The three major biaxial test methods prescribed in this draft standard have been devised so that more consistent and accurate test results can be obtained. However, the uncertainty of measurement <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing always exists and needs to be estimated. The estimation of uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>flexure</b> testing <b>in</b> this study is based on the methodology provided in the ISO Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement. The results of the estimation showed that the uncertainty in measurement for the biaxial flexure test standard proposed in this thesis is very low compared to the inherent variability of the strength of ceramic materials. It was also found that the applied load, thickness of the disc plate, and random effects are the three major components contributing to the overall uncertainty. The total uncertainty of measurement <b>in</b> biaxial <b>flexure</b> testing can be significantly minimised by the reduction of the uncertainty contributed from these components, especially from random effects...|$|R
