5|$|Several Omphalotus {{species with}} similar bioluminescent {{properties}} occur worldwide, {{all of which}} are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O.japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. A 2004 molecular study shows the ghost fungus to be <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> related to the western jack o'lantern mushroom (O.olivascens), which is abundant in Southern and Central California. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> resemble this species.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, WASP-43b had an orbital period of {{approximately}} 0.8 days (19.2 hours), the second-shortest orbit ever detected, surpassed only by WASP-19b. In addition, at {{the time of}} discovery, WASP-43b was the <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> orbiting Hot Jupiter known, a phenomenon that can most likely be explained by its host star's low mass.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion may be <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> related to S.nicholsi. Like the diminutive S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species may be <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> related to O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further {{north and south}} in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually nothing is known of its biology.|$|E
5|$|In chronological order, {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft {{powered by the}} Merlin to enter service were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane, and Supermarine Spitfire.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of North American Armillaria species based on {{analysis of}} amplified fragment length polymorphism data suggests that A.gallica is <b>most</b> <b>closely</b> related to A.sinapina, A. cepistipes, and A. calvescens.
