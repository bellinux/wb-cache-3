25|$|Beginners often <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of not {{relaxing}} the arm {{during the}} recovery and {{of moving the}} hand too high and {{too far away from}} the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often forget to use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E
25|$|A scrum may {{be formed}} if a team commits a minor {{infringement}} or play {{needs to be}} restarted.It consists of the eight forwards from both teams binding together in three rows with the two front rows bound and pushing against each other. The two props (loosehead and tighthead) {{either side of the}} hooker form the front row. The second row consists of two locks and the two flankers, while the number 8 is the third row (back row). If an infringement occurs the team that did not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> is awarded the scrum. Infringements that result in a scrum are: knocking or passing the ball forward, a player being accidentally offside, a player being in front of the kicker during a kick-off or drop-out, delay (one minute) in taking a kick from a mark or taking a shot at goal from a penalty, or if a player incorrectly taps the ball at a penalty or free kick.|$|E

500|$|Danny Peary {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about A View to a Kill but was generally complimentary: [...] "Despite what reviewers automatically reported, [...] looks trimmer and more energetic than {{in some of the}} previous efforts... I wish Bond had a few more of his famous gadgets on hand, but his actions scenes are exciting and some of the stunt work is spectacular. Walken's the first Bond villain who is not so much an evil person as a crazed neurotic. I find him more memorable than some of the more recent Bond foes... Unfortunately, the filmmakers – who ruined villain Jaws by making him a nice guy in Moonraker – <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of switching May Day at the end from Bond's nemesis to his accomplice, depriving us of a slam-bang fight to the finish between the two (I suppose gentleman Bond isn't allowed to kill women, even a monster like May Day)... lacks the flamboyance of earlier Bond films, and has a terrible slapstick chase sequence in San Francisco, but overall it's fast-paced, fairly enjoyable, and a worthy entry in the series.".|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the character, Blizzard's Geoff Goodman said they crafted Doomfist as an [...] "ode {{to the fighting}} genre", both in his skill kit and in concept art. Though Blizzard tried to keep all of his attacks as melee, they found, as they had with Genji, that Doomfist needed some type of ranged attack to make him playable; an early attack had been a phantom punch {{that would have been}} launched from his fist. Doomfist had also be considered as a Tank class, but Blizzard did not want to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> again of having a high-health character with powerful attacks as they had initially with Roadhog at the game's introduction. At one point during development, Doomfist {{would have been able to}} pick up enemies and use them as human shields or to throw them, but Blizzard dropped this as he was not supposed to be a wrestler or luchador, according to Goodman. They also dropped an ability for him to grab pieces of the ground and throw them. His ultimate ability was originally designed for Orisa, the character introduced prior to Doomfist.|$|E

500|$|When Arnold Johnson (a {{friend of}} Topping and Yankees general manager George Weiss) became {{the owner of}} the Kansas City Athletics in 1955, his new team made many {{transactions}} with the Yankees. From 1956 to 1960, the Athletics traded many young players to the Yankees for cash and aging veterans. The trades strengthened the Yankees' roster, but brought criticism from rival clubs. Before their 1960 season, the Yankees made one such trade with the Athletics in which they acquired outfielder Roger Maris. In his first Yankees season, Maris led the league in slugging percentage, RBIs, and extra base hits, finished second with 39 home runs, and won the AL MVP Award. The 1960 Yankees won the AL pennant for the 10th time in 12 years under Stengel, and outscored the Pirates 55–27 in the seven World Series games. However, the team lost four of them, falling short of a Series championship after Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run in the final game, ending a contest that Appel called [...] "one of the most memorable in baseball history." [...] The season turned out to be Stengel's last as Yankees manager; he indicated that his age {{played a role in the}} team's decision, saying, [...] "I'll never <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of being seventy again." ...|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "it's a little {{surprising}} that the just-released clip for Beyoncé's 'Video Phone' has nary a flame or fish-eye shot (there are, of course, plenty of outlandish costumes). However, don't <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of thinking this video is by any means straightforward— it's plenty WTF! [...] It's definitely not the Gaga we're used to seeing, but her appearance isn't exactly run-of-the-mill, either. And neither is this video, for that matter. Especially not when you're watching Beyoncé snap her gum and shake her hips and grope an AK-47 while the screen pops from electric green to Kool-Aid red." [...] Jocelyn Vena of the same publication noted, [...] "The clip is charged with energy, and the cynics out there might wonder if putting two sizzling divas in a room together created any kind of rivalry." [...] Jim Farber from New York's Daily News compared Knowles' look to that of pin-up model Bettie Page, and said [...] "The clip for 'Video Phone' [...] doesn't offer {{much in the way}} of chemistry or even interaction between the two divas. [...] clip seems about as innovative as a rotary dial up." [...] Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone commented that the video was an [...] "almost seizure-inducing parade of cinematic homages and wardrobe changes." [...] He also compared Knowles' look to Page, as well as Katy Perry and rapper M.I.A. The Daily Mail gave a positive review of the video, calling it avant-garde and naughty.|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. The violence is not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{provides}} voices for Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Dr. Hibbert, Lenny Leonard, Otto Mann, Rainier Wolfcastle, Scratchy, Kang, Dr. Marvin Monroe, Judge Snyder {{and many}} others. He has described {{all of his}} regular characters' voices as [...] "easy to slip into. [...] I wouldn't do them if they weren't easy." [...] Shearer modeled Mr. Burns's voice on the two actors Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer says that Burns {{is the most difficult}} character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He describes Burns as his favorite character, saying he [...] "like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of diluting it. Never adulterate your evil." [...] Shearer is also the voice of Burns' assistant Smithers, and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. In the episode [...] "Bart's Inner Child", Harry Shearer said [...] "wow" [...] in the voice of Otto, which was then used when Otto was seen jumping on a trampoline. Ned Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but because Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] for him, Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Dr. Marvin Monroe's voice was based on psychiatrist David Viscott. Monroe has been retired since the seventh season because voicing the character strained Shearer's throat.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some reviewers disliked Bond's clown costume, gorilla outfit and Tarzan yell during a jungle chase. James Berardinelli {{claimed that the}} movie was long and confusing, and strongly criticised Steven Berkoff's performance, describing it as [...] "offensively bad" [...] and the worst performance of any Bond villain. By contrast, the elegance of the film locations in India, and the stunts on aircraft and the train were appreciated. Jeffrey Westhoff at Rotten Tomatoes praised Roger Moore as being [...] "". Neal Gabler and Jeffrey Lyons at the TV-show Sneak Previews praised the film and said [...] "Octopussy delivers" [...] and [...] "The nice thing about Octopussy is that it's going back-to-basics, less gadgets, more hand-to-hand combat. It's more of an adventure movie in a more traditional sense and I like it for that". Danny Peary wrote that Octopussy [...] "has slow spots, little humour, and villains who aren’t nearly of the calibre of Dr. No, Goldfinger, or Blofeld. Also, the filmmakers <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> of demeaning Bond by having him swing through the trees and emitting a Tarzan cry and having him hide in a gorilla suit and later disguise himself as a clown (who all the kids at the circus laugh at). It’s as if they’re trying {{to remind us that}} everything is tongue-in-cheek, but that makes little sense, for the film is much more serious than typical Bond outings – in fact, it recalls the tone of From Russia with Love." [...] Entertainment Weekly chose Octopussy as the third worst Bond film, while Norman Wilner of MSN chose it as the eighth worst, and IGN chose it as the seventh worst. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 42% rating.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), who {{is worried}} {{that he will not}} be able to meet the 8% {{quarterly}} sales growth figures that Robert California (James Spader) asked for by about $800, starts to think of creative ways to sell more paper. During a conference room meeting, he proposes that everyone in the office buy paper to alleviate some of the burden, but no one is willing. He then decides to ask Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to make a rounding mistake in the books, but Oscar tells Andy that he does not have time to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>mistake</b> because he is leaving for a trivia contest in a bar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He tells Andy that the prize is $1,000 and his team is determined to win it. Andy, encouraged by Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), decides to take the entire office to Philadelphia in an attempt to win the money and make up the sales growth difference. At the bar, which turns out to be a gay bar called the Liberty Well, Andy divides the office into three teams: the A-Team consisting of Jim, Darryl, Andy, and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), the B-Team consisting of Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton), and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad), and the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team consisting of Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery). Oscar refuses to join Andy and stays on his original team. Initially, the Dunder Mifflin A-Team does well until they soon falter. However, much to Andy's surprise, the [...] "Just For Fun" [...] team (calling themselves The Einsteins) ends up doing much better than expected because of the group's trivial knowledge on a variety of issues. Humorously, the team misses the answers to a handful of common questions, including one about their namesake. They make it to the final round against Oscar's team and eventually win thanks to Kevin's correct answers. However, the Just for Fun team's luck runs out when they later get demolished while trying to win another bar's even more lucrative trivia contest.|$|E
