5|$|In 1750 as {{a result}} of the Treaty of Madrid seven {{missions}} in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native Guaraní tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the Guarani War. In Europe, where the Jesuits were under attack, they were accused of supporting the rebellion and perceived as defending the native peoples. In 1758, the Jesuits were accused of a conspiracy to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair. All <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Jesus were evicted from Portuguese territories in 1759, and from French territories in 1764. In 1766 Jesuits were accused of causing Esquilache Riots in Madrid; consequently in February 1767, Charles III of Spain signed a royal decree with expulsion orders for all <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Jesus in Spanish territories.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H.

5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the Society's {{membership}} {{had dropped to}} a few dozen, and {{under the control of}} a new warden it invited Knight to return to the group in order to help promote it. Knight agreed, leaving his own lodge to publish two works by Fortune based on her material in the Society's archive, and authoring a biography of her. The 1990s saw a number of pioneering biographical studies of Fortune, including Alan Richardson's in 1991 and Janine Chapman's in 1993. Richardson's book relied heavily on the recollections of Christine Hartley, while the publication of Fielding and Carr was based upon the authors' interactions with older <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> However, in 2007 Graf noted that Fortune had yet to receive much scholarly attention.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Greenup {{continued}} {{to practice law}} in Fayette County and pursued various other interests. He was {{a founding member of}} the Danville Political Club and in 1787, he joined the Kentucky Society for Promoting Useful Knowledge. Future Kentucky Governors Isaac Shelby and James Garrard, as well as future Supreme Court justice Thomas Todd were also <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society.</b> In 1789, he helped organize the Kentucky Manufacturing Society. Later, he was appointed to the Kentucky River Company, a group dedicated to improving infrastructure on the Kentucky River.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University {{was founded}} by former Jesuits in the {{tradition}} of Ignatius of Loyola; it {{is a member of the}} Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though seven Jesuits serve on the thirty-six member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance. Catholic spaces at the university fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Washington, such as Dahlgren Chapel, the university's principal Catholic place of worship. Fifty-two <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Jesus live on campus, and are employed by Georgetown mostly as professors or administrators. Jesuit Heritage Week has been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.|$|E

5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society,</b> would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
5|$|She bequeathed most of {{her money}} to her Society. During Fortune's lifetime, some of the Fraternity members had {{expressed}} concerns {{with regard to the}} organisation becoming a personality cult revolving around her, and so following her death they did not encourage an interest in her biography. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> have alleged that her successor destroyed {{most of her}} diaries, correspondences, and photographs. However, a number of her books would be published posthumously, among them The Cosmic Doctrine, which appeared in 1949, and her novel Moon Magic, published in 1956.|$|E
5|$|The {{society is}} governed by its Council, which is chaired by the Society's President, {{according}} {{to a set of}} statutes and standing orders. The members of Council and the President are elected from and by its Fellows, the basic <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society,</b> who are themselves elected by existing Fellows. As of 2016, there are about 1,600 fellows, allowed to use the postnominal title FRS (Fellow of the Royal Society), with up to 52 new fellows appointed each year. There are also royal fellows, honorary fellows and foreign members, the last of which are allowed to use the postnominal title ForMemRS (Foreign Member of the Royal Society).

5|$|Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Miami is a {{separate}} non-profit organization operated by the Archdiocese of Miami. It {{is part of a}} national network of organizations that are operated in each U.S. diocese. This organization claims to be the largest nongovernmental provider of services to the needy in South Florida. It began in 1931 during the Great Depression with four Miami-area pastors and lay <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Saint Vincent de Paul. It employs over 600 staff and operates on an annual budget of over $38 million. In 2006, it served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. Some of these services include transitional housing, homeless shelters, elderly day care, child day care, addiction recovery, HIV/AIDS programs, family and school counseling, meals for the elderly and various immigrant and refugee help programs among others.|$|E
5|$|Concerned for the {{education}} of his children, Captain Rowan moved the family to Bardstown, Kentucky in 1790. There, John Rowan began his education under Dr. James Priestly at Salem Academy. Salem Academy was, at the time, considered one of the best educational institutions in the west. Among Rowan's classmates at the Academy were future U.S. Attorney General Felix Grundy, future U.S. Senator John Pope, future U.S. District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss, and future Kentucky state senator John Allen. Rowan and Grundy were members of a debating society called the Bardstown Pleiades which may have been an outgrowth of Salem Academy. Other notable <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> included future Florida Governor William Pope Duval, future U.S. Postmaster General and Kentucky Governor Charles A. Wickliffe, and future Kentucky Senator Benjamin Hardin.|$|E
5|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the Holy Name Society of Mt. St. Peter Church {{has been working}} to inspire love, honor, and reverence for the holy name of Jesus Christ. The society also works to promote respect for the Catholic Church, loyalty to Mt. St. Peter Parish, and a life filled with good spiritual values that can be carried {{throughout}} family, education, and work. The Holy Name Society is strictly for Catholic men and was begun by Monsignor Fusco, who started the group in hopes of uniting men of the parish through service to others. <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> host a Mass and breakfast on the Sunday prior to Palm Sunday every year and an annual Golf Outing during the summer. Money raised at this these two events is donated to the parish to help aid in the costs of parish projects.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Sharif Hussein, {{trying to}} garner {{support for his}} planned {{uprising}} against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly with other <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society,</b> including Quwatli, {{in the house of}} Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al-Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was charged by the al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture and humiliation. Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of that experience, however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition.|$|E
5|$|In July 1782, Scott was {{exchanged}} for Lord Rawdon, ending his parole. Washington {{informed him that}} he was back on active duty and ordered him to assist General Peter Muhlenberg's recruiting efforts in Virginia, then to report to General Nathanael Greene. Greene wrote {{that he did not have}} a command for Scott, however, and requested that he remain with Muhlenberg in Virginia. The few troops he was able to recruit were sent to a depot at Winchester, Virginia. When the preliminary articles of peace between the United States and Great Britain were signed in March 1783, recruiting stopped altogether. Scott was brevetted to major general on September 30, 1783, just prior to his discharge from the Continental Army. Following the war, he became one of the founding <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of the Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry {{the body and the}} phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a dictionary, and a series of articles on Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Paez (1564–1622), a Spanish Jesuit at {{the court}} of Susenyos I, {{translated}} portions of the chronicles of Ethiopian emperors stretching back to the reign of Amda Seyon I in the 14th century AD, {{as well as the}} reign of king Kaleb of Axum in the 6th century AD. Some of these fragments were preserved in the Historia de Ethiopia by the Portuguese Jesuit Manuel de Almeida (1580–1646), but Paez's original manuscript was largely rewritten to remove polemical passages against the rival Dominican Order. Paez also translated a chapter from an Ethiopian hagiography that covered the life and works of the 13th-century ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela. The Historia de Ethiopia, which arrived in Goa, India, by the end of 1624, was not published in Europe until the modern era and only remained in circulation among <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> of Jesus in Portuguese India, although Almeida's map of Ethiopia was published by Baltasar Teles in 1660. In his treatise A Voyage to Abyssinia, the Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jerónimo Lobo (1595–1678) described Abyssinia and its denizens, indicating that the native inhabitants were of two distinct physical types: the Abyssinians proper, who were narrow-featured, near olive-skinned, and had long hair which they wore in various styles, and the Soudans, who were platyrrhine (i.e. flat-nosed), black-skinned, and had woolly hair. Following the abdication of Susenyos I, his son and successor Fasilides (r. 1632–1667) had the Jesuits expelled from Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, {{the first thing he}} does is sing about the birth of the gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society</b> while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E
