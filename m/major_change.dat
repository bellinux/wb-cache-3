5|$|Beyond minor improvements, MD410 in Montgomery County has {{remained}} {{in much the}} same state since 1950. The only <b>major</b> <b>change</b> was the highway being split onto a one-way pair of streets in Bethesda in 1988. The Prince George's County section has seen more substantial changes over the intervening decades. The first <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in alignment occurred in 1956, when MD410 was completed on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway between Ager Road just east of MD212 and MD500 at what is now Adelphi Road. The state highway was subsequently extended east over what was previously MD403, known as Colesville Road, to US1 in Riverdale.|$|E
5|$|The other <b>major</b> <b>change</b> to {{the station}} under BR was the gradual {{development}} of services to the new Gatwick Airport railway station after its opening on 28 May 1958. A dedicated rail-air terminal opened on 1 May 1962, designed by Clive Pascall.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the {{development}} process of Perl 5 occurred with Perl 5.11; {{the development}} community has switched to a monthly release cycle of development releases, with a yearly schedule of stable releases.

5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in the {{training}} programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|A <b>major</b> <b>change</b> {{was made}} in the way overfulfillment was rewarded. Progressive piece-rates, where rates {{increased}} as outputs grew, were ended, and workers were paid a one-off bonus upon overachieving a quota. Where bonus rates were retained for each percentage of overfulfillment, they were capped. For example, in engineering, bonuses could not exceed 20 percent of their normal earnings.|$|E
5|$|F-16A/B: The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initial {{production}} variants. These variants {{include the}} Block 1, 5, 10 and 20 versions.

5|$|In 1989, NeXT {{struck a}} deal for former Compaq {{reseller}} Businessland to sell NeXT computers in select markets nationwide. Selling through a retailer was a <b>major</b> <b>change</b> from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions. Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12months.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first <b>major</b> <b>change</b> to these types was the {{introduction}} of steam power for propulsion. While paddle steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2017, the Devils {{revealed}} {{their new}} uniforms for the 2017–18 season.

5|$|The first <b>major</b> <b>change</b> to US-412 {{occurred}} on November 4, 1991, when US-412 was rerouted onto the newly built Cherokee Turnpike. US-412 Scenic, which was later redesignated US-412 Alternate, was established along the old highway, allowing the highway system {{to retain a}} free alternate to the new toll road. US-412 was extended west on May 5, 1993; like its initial extension into Oklahoma, this new portion of US-412 followed existing highways: US-56, US-64, US-270, and SH-3.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>major</b> <b>change</b> under Tkach's tenure was the WCG's {{doctrine}} on healing. Previously {{the church}} taught that true believers were healed by faith in God {{and not by}} doctors. Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question. Once Tkach was satisfied {{with the results of}} the study, he officially softened the church's teaching on the matter, encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer.|$|E

5|$|The {{ingredients}} of Mediterranean cuisine are {{to an extent}} {{different from those of}} the cuisine of Northern Europe, with olive oil instead of butter, wine instead of beer. The list of available ingredients has changed over the centuries. One <b>major</b> <b>change</b> was the introduction of many foods by the Arabs to Portugal, Spain and Sicily in the Middle Ages. Those foods included aubergines, spinach, sugar cane, rice, apricots and citrus fruits, creating the distinctive culinary tradition of Al-Andalus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>major</b> <b>change</b> in {{agriculture}} in Kerala {{occurred in the}} 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E
5|$|The next <b>major</b> <b>change</b> to SH-34 {{occurred}} in 1954. On November 1 of that year, the highway was realigned {{to follow a}} new road extending north of Woodward, intersecting US-64 east of Buffalo, and following existing highways north to the state line. This would put SH-34 on its present-day route north of Woodward. SH-50 would remain concurrent with SH-34 north of US-64 until November 9, 1964.|$|E

SH-34 remained in place; the two highways were concurrent from northwest of Eldorado to the Red River bridge, where they both ended. On January 5, 1987, the redundant section of SH-34 was removed, truncating it to its current southern terminus.|$|E
