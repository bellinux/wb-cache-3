40|$|GC II Agar with IsoVitaleX ™ Enrichment is {{used for}} {{antimicrobial}} disc diffusion susceptibility testing of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Because of the growing problem of resistance of gonococci to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued, in 1987, policy guidelines for the detection, management and control of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. 1 The medium recommended for the disc diffusion method of antimicrobial susceptibility testing was GC agar base with a defined supplement, such as IsoVitaleX Enrichment. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) also recommends the use of GC Agar with a defined supplement (equivalent to IsoVitaleX Enrichment) for antimicrobial disc diffusion susceptibility testing of N. gonorrhoeae. 2, 3 PRINCIPLES OF THE PROCEDURE GC II Agar Base contains casein and <b>meat</b> <b>peptones</b> as sources of nutrients, phosphate buffer to control pH and corn starch to neutralize toxic fatty acids that may {{be present in the}} agar.

30|$|Yeast extract-peptone (YP) is the {{conventional}} growth media used for fungi species, in producing {{a range of}} bio products, such as succinic acid (Vlysidis et al. 2009), microbial oil (Saenge et al. 2011) and valuable metabolic products (Chatzifragkou et al. 2011). Yeast extract is made through autolysis (European Association for Specialty Yeast Products 2016), where grown yeast is heated to 45 – 55  °C. During this stage, yeasts proteins are denatured by endogenous digestive enzymes and allowed to mix with the aqueous solution. Finally the solution is purified and converted to a paste or concentrated liquid. Yeast extract is enriched with proteins, amino acids, vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 6, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid and biotin) and minerals (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and zinc) from the original yeast. Peptones are a widely used nitrogen source for microbial media. Most peptones are made by incubating milk or meat with trypsin, pepsin or other proteolytic enzymes, to digest proteins into amino acids, peptides and polypeptides, but sometimes also by cooking milk or meat in acid. There exist a variety of peptones, such as plant-based peptones (made using potatoes, soybeans and wheat), <b>meat</b> <b>peptones</b> (made from a porcine, bovine or poultry origin), casein peptone (made from animal sources) and gelatin peptone (made by boiling collagen, isolated from animal skin, bones and tissues, and subsequent pancreatic digestion) (Gray et al. 2008). However, it is expensive to use YPD media in large quantities industrially. Thus, development of a novel cost effective media to support yeast growth will be favourable for many applications in industrial scale.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} component of an in vitro production process for baculovirus biopesticides is a growth medium that is efficacious, robust, and inexpensive. An in-house low-cost serum-free medium, VPM 3, {{has been shown to}} be very promising in supporting Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HaSNPV) production in H. zea insect cell suspension cultures, for use as a biopesticide against the Heliothine pest complex. However, VPM 3 is composed of a significant number of undefined components, including five different protein hydrolysates, which introduce a challenging lot-to-lot variability to the production process. In this study, an intensive statistical optimization routine was employed to reduce the number of protein hydrolysates in VPM 3 medium. Nearly 300 runs (including replicates) were conducted with great efficiency by using 50 mL TubeSpin (R) bioreactors to propagate insect cell suspension cultures. Fractional factorial experiments were first used to determine the most important of the five default protein hydrolysates, and to screen for seven potential substitutes for the default <b>meat</b> <b>peptone,</b> Primatone RL. Validation studies informed by the screening tests showed that promising alternative media could be formulated based on just two protein hydrolysates, in particular the YST-AMP (Yeast Extract and Amyl <b>Meat</b> <b>Peptone)</b> and YST-POT (Yeast Extract and Lucratone Potato Peptone) combinations. The YST-AMP (meat-based) and YST-POT (meat-free) variants of VPM 3 were optimized using response surface methodology, and were shown to be just as good as the default VPM 3 and the commercial Sf- 900 II media in supporting baculovirus yields, hence providing a means toward a more reproducible and scalable production process for HaSNPV biopesticides.

A bacterial strain isolated from the Western Ghats forest soil of Wayanad, Kerala, India was identified as P. elgii by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. P. elgii recorded significant board spectrum activity against all human and plant pathogenic microorganism tested except Candida albicans. It has been well known that even minor variations in the fermentation medium may impact not only the quantity of desired bioactive metabolites but also the general metabolic profile of the producing microorganisms.

40|$|AbstractGlucagon like peptide- 1 is an insulinotropic hormone {{released}} from intestinal L-cells {{in response to}} food ingestion. Here, we investigated mechanisms underlying the sensing of peptones by primary small intestinal L-cells. Meat, casein and vegetable-derived peptones (5 mg/ml), the L-amino acids Phe, Trp, Gln and Ala (20 mM each), and the dipeptide glycine-sarcosine (20 mM) stimulated GLP- 1 secretion from primary cultures prepared from the small intestine. Further mechanistic studies were performed with <b>meat</b> <b>peptone,</b> and revealed the elevation of intracellular calcium in L-cells. Inhibition of the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and Q-type voltage gated calcium channels (VGCC) significantly attenuated peptone-stimulated GLP- 1 release and reduced intracellular Ca 2 + responses.

A reduced content of heterotrophic microorganisms was detected in comparison with background samples. In a number of samples, we also discovered an increased content of hydrocarbon-oxidizing and methylotrophic microorganisms, including obligate ones, which suggest the methane entering the upper layers of the soil.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>meat</b> <b>peptone</b> type I (Sigma) {{on the growth}} of Escherichia coli cells under hyperosmotic stress has been investigated. Peptone is a complex mixture of {{peptides}} with a small content of free amino acids, which resembles nutrients found in natural environments. Our data showed that peptone enhances the growth of E. coli cells in high-osmolarity medium to levels higher than those achieved with the main compatible solute in bacteria, glycine betaine. The mechanism of osmoprotection by peptone comprises the uptake and accumulation of the compatible solute, proline. The main role of the peptides contained in peptone is the provision of nutrients rather than the intracellular accumulation of osmolytes. In contrast to Listeria monocytogenes (M. R. Amezaga, I. Davidson, D. McLaggan, A. Verheul, T. Abee, and I. R. Booth, Microbiology 141 : 41 – 49, 1995), E. coli does not accumulate exogenous peptides for osmoprotection and peptides containing proline do not lead to the accumulation of proline as a compatible solute. In late-logarithmic-phase cultures of E. coli growing at high osmolarity plus peptone, proline becomes the limiting factor for growth, and the intracellular pools of proline are not maintained. This {{is a consequence of}} the low concentration of free proline in peptone, the catabolism of proline by E. coli, and the inability of E. coli to utilize proline-containing peptides as a source of compatible solutes. Our data highlight the role that natural components in food such as peptides play in undermining food preservation regimes, such as high osmolarity, and also that the specific mechanisms of osmoprotection by these compounds differ according to the organism...|$|R

To evaluate the potential use of this lactobacilli strain as probiotics, studies on the effect of gastric juice, pH and bile salts were conducted. Cell tolerancey to acidity and bile salt are important factor that affect the probiotics to remain and exert their potential functionalities in a host. L. salivarius showed higher resistant to SGJ with cell viability of 22. 9 %, 38. 8 %, 63 % and 65 % at pH 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

However, due to concerns expressed by animal rights groups, environmental sustainability, religious beliefs in South Asia and concerns over transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), especially the bovine form (BSE), vegetable peptones have become an increasingly important alternative. This thesis describes studies of the comparative performance between vegetable peptone (VP) -based and conventional <b>meat</b> <b>peptone</b> (MP) -based culture media, using Salmonella as an analyte and poultry products as food matrices. Productivity and recovery of three strains of Salmonella, in vegetative or injured state, were determined in pre-enrichment broth (buffered peptone water) and selective enrichment broths (Rappaport-Vassiliadis Soy broth, Muller Kauffmann Tetrathionate novobiocin broth), {{as well as on}} a range of plating media (XLD, Hektoen Enteric, Bismuth Sulphite and Brilliant green agars), from two commercial manufacturers, one supplying VP-based media (Himedia) and the other supplying MP-based culture media (Oxoid). No statistical differences in growth (P < 0. 05) were observed between both brands of liquid and solid culture media for all Salmonella strains. The performance of peptones was also evaluated in five plating media formulated in the laboratory from all the same individual ingredients except peptone, as the solitary variable ingredient. No significant difference (P < 0. 05) in performance was observed. Studies were also conducted using naturally and artificially contaminated chicken samples (n = 100), to compare semi-quantitatively the performance of the media for detection of Salmonella from high background matrices, using the ecometric technique, as well as to determine the incidence of Salmonella. Absolute growth indices (AGls) calculated from ecometric streaking on both brands of plating media - XLD, Hektoen Enteric, Bismuth Sulphite and Brilliant Green agars - showed no significant difference in productivity for Salmonella, or specificity, in terms of background micro flora. The overall results of this study underline that VP-based media have equal specificity, productivity and perform similarly to MP-based media.

Figure  3 c shows that higher inoculum concentrations (10 and 20  % v/v) did not correspondingly increase the bioflocculant production. Rather, a slight decrease was observed. Small inoculum size prolongs the lag phase, while a large inoculum causes excessive overlapping of niches of the strain, thus restraining bioflocculant production (Salehizadeh and Shojaosadati 2001). As shown in Fig.  3 d, B. marisflavi NA 8 could efficiently produce bioflocculant using POME hydrolysate without having to add nitrogen. Yeast extract could provide a positive attribute for the process than the control and other supplementation. On the other hand, addition of <b>meat</b> extract, <b>peptone</b> and urea slightly reduced the bioflocculant production as evidenced by a lower flocculating activity. This indicated that POME by itself was enriched with proteins sufficient for microbial growth.

40|$|A novel coccoid-shaped, hyperthermophilic, {{heterotrophic}} {{member of}} the archaea was isolated from a shallow marine hydrothermal system at Vulcano Island, Italy. The isolate grew between 56 and 90 degrees C with an optimum around 85 degrees C. The pH range for growth was 6. 5 to 10. 5, with an optimum around 9. 0. Polysulfide and elemental sulfur were reduced to H 2 S. Sulfur stimulated the growth rate. The isolate fermented yeast extract, <b>peptone,</b> <b>meat</b> extract, tryptone, and casein. Isovalerate, isobutyrate, propionate, acetate, CO 2, NH 3, and H 2 S (in the presence of S degrees) were detected as end products. Growth was not inhibited by H 2. Based on DNA-DNA hybridization and 16 S rRNA partial sequences, the new isolate represents a new species of Thermococcus, which we named Thermococcus alcaliphilus.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, paper disc agar {{diffusion}} method {{was used to}} evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the isolated flavonoid glycosides. The bacteria used were S. aureus (gram positive) and E. coli (gram negative). Nutrient agar was used to cultivate the organism. It comprises of <b>peptone,</b> <b>meat</b> extract, beef extract, and sodium chloride which were properly mixed and heated briefly in the streamer. A 2 % agar was added and dissolved by heating. This medium was used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Beef infusion, casein acid hydrolysate, starch, and aqueous agar were used. All the above ingredients were mixed in distilled water and dissolved by heating. The mixture was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 minutes. The selected stains were subcultured in nutrient broth and these cultivated organisms were used for seeding. The standard drugs used were penicillin and norfloxacin.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} initial pH on POME {{fermentation}} was studied by varying the pH at 1 unit interval from 3.0 to 10.0. The POME was {{adjusted to the}} desired pH using 5  M H 2 SO 4 or NaOH prior to inoculation. The cultures were incubated at 37  °C with an agitation rate of 150  rpm for 24  h. The effect of temperature on bioflocculant production was studied by varying the temperature as 30, 34, 37 and 40  °C. The POME sample was incubated at the optimum pH obtained. Likewise, inoculum volumes of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20  % (v/v) {{in proportion to the}} fermentation volume were used for bioflocculant production. Other conditions were kept constant. The effect of nitrogen source on POME fermentation was studied using seven different nitrogen sources, i.e. yeast extract (YE), <b>meat</b> extract (ME), <b>peptone,</b> ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl), ammonium sulphate (NH 4) 2 SO 4, glutamic acid and urea at 1  % (w/v), respectively.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An {{immunomodulator}} bioproduct {{is prepared}} in a batch bioprocess with a modified bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bioprocess is performed in 100 L Bioengineering bioreactor with 42 L cultivation medium made of <b>peptone,</b> <b>meat</b> extract and sodium chloride. The optimal bioprocess parameters were determined: temperature – 37 0 C, agitation speed- 300 rpm, aeration rate – 40 L/min, pressure – 0. 5 bar, Dow Corning Antifoam M-max. 4 % {{of the medium}} volume, duration- 6 hours. This kind of bioprocesses are appreciated as difficult to control because their dynamic behavior is highly nonlinear and time varying. The aim of the paper is to present (by comparison) different models based on experimental data. The analysis criteria were modeling error and convergence rate. The estimated values and the modeling analysis were done by using the Table Curve 2 D. The preliminary conclusions indicate Andrews’s model with a maximum specific growth rate of the bacterium {{in the range of}} 0. 8 h- 1.

40|$|Complex organic mediums have {{generally}} been considered necessary {{for the production of}} high yields of streptomycin by Streptomyces griseus (Waksman, Schatz, and Reilly, 1946). Quantities of streptomycin approaching 1 gram per liter have been reported from the growth of mutant strains on such mediums (Stanley, 1947). This represents a conversion of 5 to 10 per cent of the organic constituents of the medium to streptomycin. Few {{attempts have been made to}} define conditions regulating the conversion or to study the mechanism of strepto-mycin formation. Dulaney and Perlman (1947) have reported observations of the biochemical activities of S. griseus under conditions favorable for streptomycin production. Two stages of activity in a glucose <b>peptone</b> <b>meat</b> extract medium were described. During the growth phase, the production of mycelium was accompanied by a reduction in the soluble constituents of the medium (N, C, P), fermentation of the available carbohydrate, a high oxygen demand, and little production of streptomycin. During the autolytic phase, the mycelium weight decrease...|$|R
40|$|From {{a shallow}} marine {{hydrothermal}} system at Vulcano (Italy), a new hyperthermophilic {{member of the}} Archaea was isolated. The cells are coccoid - shaped and possess up to five flagella. They grow between 56 degrees and 93 degrees C (optimum 85 degrees C) and pH 5. 0 - 9. 5 (optimum 9. 0). The organism is strictly anaerobic and grows heterotrophically on defined amino acids and complex organic substrates such as casamino acids, yeast extract, <b>peptone,</b> <b>meat</b> extract, tryptone, and casein. Polysulfide and elemental sulfur are reduced to H 2 S. In the absence of polysulfide or elemental sulfur, the isolate grows at a significantly reduced rate. Growth is not influenced {{by the presence of}} H 2. DNA- DNA hybridization and 16 S rRNA partial sequences indicated that the new isolate belongs to the genus Thermococcus, and represents a new species, Thermococcus acidaminovorans.
