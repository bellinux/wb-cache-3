The data were sampled in the Sylt-Roemoe bight, a semi-enclosed lagoon in the North-Frisian Wadden Sea at the border between Germany and Denmark. The total sampling periods were from April 1996 to October 1996 and during April 1997. Out of these, four periods (three in 1996 and one in 1997) of three weeks lengths were selected and further processed for the PROMISE project. They include significant wind events with wind speeds above 15 m/s. The observational data encompass SPM measurements and all hydrographical and meteorological parameters significant for the SPM transport. Used devices were <b>moored</b> <b>piles</b> with probe packages, moored Acoustical Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP), a wave rider buoy and a vertical multiprobe profiler plus an ADCP from a cruising vessel. In addition, boundary data from other observations and model calculations were added. (orig.)

40|$|Introduction The {{daily life}} of {{inhabitants}} of Hagonoy, the Philippines, {{is affected by}} tidal and fluvial floods. Ground subsidence is {{the main cause of}} a worsening trend of these floods. Excessive uncontrolled groundwater subtraction creates a ground level decrease up to 5 cm per year. In combination with yearly six to nine typhoons raging over the country, this leads to unliveable conditions. In order to contribute to the improvement of living conditions of the inhabitants, a modular amphibious structure is designed to keep buildings above the water level. Part I -Background In order to design a suitable amphibious foundation for Hagonoy, a research is done into modular, circular building concepts. Hereby a desired translation of the Dutch building concept of Finch Buildings into a Filipino concept can be made. In combination with criteria concluded from research into floating behaviour of structures and from an analysis of the location, a number of criteria is listed, on which the design of the floating modules and the connections is based. Part II – Structural design By analysing and rating several floating construction types and connection types, a concept design for a modular prefabricated amphibious foundation is made. Timber frame, filled with recycled 200 L barrels is the basis for a flexible building concept. Three scenarios in which the foundation must give a proper structural performance, are outlined. Due to change in water depth, the structure must be able to function in a dry, a just-floating and a floating position. Since this foundation must be able to carry varying configurations of buildings, multiple load cases can occur. The most unfavourable load cases occur during typhoons, due to high wind pressure and high and long wind generated waves. By creating a parametric visualization and calculation model, a first insight in dimensions, and width and length of the amphibious foundation is determined. This concept design for both foundation modules and connections between modules is elaborated more in detail. A timber structure of 1, 20 m x 2, 40 m holds eight 200 L barrels in place. Due to brackish water, the timber structural elements must be protected against shipworm attack. In a brief research several possible solutions are described, of which wrapping structural elements with coir is determined to function best, according to previously stated criteria. In this design, barrels can be replaced in case of damages. Prefabricated foundation modules can be connected by a combination of a U-shaped bottom connection, and a relative fast fixable upper connection. By this connection a rigid wide body can be built in order to provide stability for all scenarios. Two case-studies, one being a foundation with a single building and the second being a foundation with a configuration of eight buildings, are tested by means of SCIA Engineer. For the foundation with a single building in floating position, deflections are too high due to extreme wind-generated wave loads. By increasing the width and length, deflections decreases. The largest bending moments and shear forces occur when the foundation with a configuration of eight buildings touches the soil on one side, due to a large heeling moment. These occurring bending moments and shear forces form an input for optimization of both the foundation module and the connection. In order to reduce the demand for groundwater, and thereby to contribute to reduce of ground subsidence, a design is made for making use of rainwater, and store it in the foundation. In addition waste water can be cleaned by integrated helophyte filters. Bamboo <b>mooring</b> <b>piles</b> create horizontal stability. By replanting bamboo, poles can be replaced over years. Part III - Conclusions A design for a prefabricated modular amphibious structure that is applicable in and adjusted to a flood and typhoon prone area, such as Hagonoy is delivered. Concluded from theory of floating behaviour and a rough cost estimation, a foundation for a single building is not recommended. In order to start building the pilot version, knowledge of actual behaviour of wind generated waves, optimization in the field of structural behaviour and costs are recommended.

40|$|Home is {{considered}} {{an essential element of}} human life – a person’s physical and mental health – consequently, it is a main factor which may indirectly affect the survival of the human species. Regardless of race, gender and area of residence, each person is striving to have a home, offering them a shelter from other people, adverse weather conditions, and ultimately allows them to live according to their own principles, without limitation or condemnation of others. Home {{is the only one who}} knows our weaknesses as well as our strengths, but yet still offers us protection and security. People around the world create their homes in different ways, influenced by their culture, lifestyle, living area and ultimately, the building materials available. Consequently, a home for Native American Indians and Nomads maybe a simple tent, whereas, Bolivian Indians build their shelters from swamp reed. Inuit people use snow blocks for building igloos or snow houses and, around 4500 BC, on Ljubljana <b>Moor</b> lived <b>pile</b> dwellers, who were forced by the marshes and lakes, to construct their houses on pile dwellings. Now a days, people in developed countries construct their homes differently. Abandonment of traditional ways of living has contributed to changes of human interests and consequently the shape or form of homes. People have invented new technologies and materials for constructions of homes. Thusly the process of construction became easier and, more especially, faster, which, for today’s population, overloaded with various activities, proves as a great advantage. Unfortunately, the modern way of construction is, for majority of population, financially less viable, moreover, for some people unfeasible. Home, today is most commonly a house or apartment, whether existing or new build. When considering the works themselves, construction no longer presents a major project, whereas the financial aspect is getting more and more concerning, especially with young people and families who want their independence. Hence, the market is full of different providers of prefabricated and classical constructions, each of which presents its quality and has its own price range. Therefore, there are many choices and options, which allow individuals to build their homes according to their wishes and needs. Sometimes, the variety of options is can be too wide, causing a dilemma when it comes to making such decisions. In my thesis, I will focus on shaping homes at an early stage, when deciding between living in apartment or house. As well as deciding between purchasing, new build or renovating an old house. There will also be an emphasis on house construction. The focus will be on solving the housing problems of young people and young families. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceExisting coastal {{observatories}} in European {{waters are}} composed of platforms such as <b>moored</b> buoys, <b>piles,</b> profiling systems, gliders, ';ferryboxes' and automated systems on board of ships of opportunity. JERICO project strives to integrate existing infrastructures and provides a platform for the identification and dissemination of best practices for the design, implementation, operation and maintenance of observing systems and the dissemination of data. In order to reach these objectives several kinds of actions are undertaken, amongst which the offer of Trans-National Access (TNA) {{to a number of}} coastal observatories and calibration facilities for international research and technology development. This presentation will give a short overview of the selected TNA proposals and a focus will be drawn on some of the TNA results. Calibrating sensors regularly is the prime requirement for getting reliable data from coastal observatories and ensuring their long-term relevance as viable providers of information on the marine environment. The calibration facilities at the HCMR complex in Crete hosted users for calibration experiments. The first one was accessed by a HCMR team to improve their experience in calibrating high-quality oceanographic temperature sensors using primary ITS- 90 reference standards. The experiment involved full calibrations of two SBE 35 thermometers from Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. owned by the HCMR that will be used as reference sensors for temperature measurements in their calibration laboratory in Crete. Gliders make oceanographic measurements traditionally collected by research vessels or moored instruments, but {{at a fraction of the}} costs. The GESEBB glider Mission started in July 2013, in the southeastern Bay of Biscay. The objective of the mission is sampling the characteristics of a mesoscale eddy that appears in the southeastern Bay of Biscay, during spring and summer. The origin of this structure is associated with the strength and extension of a winter warm flow on the cantabrian slope. Since this eddy is retained in the study area during months, it is expected that during Jul. -Aug. 2013 it will be close to the position observed in the previous figures Fixed platforms allow long term -sensor testing and -measurements. The presented experiment is led by CNRS/OBS-VLFR and consists in the implementation of automatic Dissolved Oxygen (DO) measurements in the mooring operated by CNR/ISMAR in the Corsica Channel (Ligurian Sea). The deployment began in Nov. 2012 and lasted for twelve months. The final purpose of the research is to integrate the DO concentration in the long term time series data in the Ligurian basin to track and evaluate the water mass variability and to estimate the time lag between the eastern and the western part of the Ligurian Sea. The development of high-quality and comprehensive coastal observing systems has only recently moved forward, principally at national and regional level. In this overall context, the JERICO project aims at creating a solid and transparent organization towards an operational service for the continuous and sustainable delivery of high quality environmental data and information products related to the marine environment in European coastal and shelf seas. It promotes joint research initiatives and standardisation as illustrated by TNA experiments...|$|R
40|$|Introduction This {{graduation}} {{project has}} been initiated to research the technical feasibility of floating bridges. The {{project has been}} done in co-operation with the FDN engineering company and Delft technical university. A design is made of a continuous pontoon floating bridge, which connects a mainland to an island. Floating bridges can be constructed where conventional bridges are impractical (under the conditions that are described in section 1. 4. 2). The buoyancy forces support the bridge in the vertical direction and the mooring system in the horizontal direction. The project contains also a survey of the most known floating bridges in the world. Problem definition Which design limitations and structural parameters can ensure stability of the continuous pontoon floating bridge under wind and wave load? Research The objective of this thesis is to understand the response of the continuous pontoon floating bridges under wind-wave load and traffic load that is described in the euro code which enables us to optimize the structural design procedure. That can be accomplished by studying the influence of the pontoon dimensions and the pontoon connector rotational rigidity on the global stability of the bridge. Determination the principles of response reduction and converting the displacement into internal forces are a relevant part of this thesis as well as the mitigating of the local environmental loads to be redistributed along larger parts of the bridge. The scope of the graduation project is very wide. It contains an overview of floating bridges; its hydrodynamic behaviour will be defined and due to the limited period of time will be not analyzed. The hydrostatic behaviour and analysis of continuous pontoon floating bridges will be researched as a multi-body slender structure with flexible connections. Also the conceptual design of the pontoons and the connections and the shape effects were researched. Detailed design calculations for the case study are included in this thesis. Results Environmental loads are the main loading on the floating bridge. Because of the random form of the sea wave forces and the wind force, it is difficult to expect the precise value and direction of loading on the bridge. The environmental loads twist the bridge and excite it in the horizontal and in the vertical direction. When it is possible to construct a sliding <b>pile</b> <b>mooring</b> system to introduce the wind and wave load in the horizontal direction, the floating bridge will have a satisfactory stability. The efficiency of the mooring cable is lower than the sliding pile due to the relatively large compliance range. That is valid also for the vertical displacement; the bridge response will be introduced by the bridge flexural rigidity, the bridge mass, the water spring, the water damping and the pontoon connector stiffness when discrete pontoons are used. The linear theory is applied to determine the sea wave load. The hydro-static and the hydro-dynamic analysis of a multi-body slender structure consisting of rigidly or flexibly connected elements will be made [...] The design procedure of the mooring cables of the offshore structure is applied to design the mooring system. Conclusions and recommendations The connection stiffness of the pontoon has a large influence on the bridge response. The ratio connection stiffness over pontoon stiffness is very important for the bridge structural behaviour. When this ratio is smaller than 10 - 8 the bridge behaves as rigid bodies connected by hinges. When this ratio is larger than 10 - 3 the bridge behaves as a continuous elastic beam. The largest deflections, moments, and shear forces occur in the ends of the bridge. Additional supports, masses, or dampers at these ends can reduce these moments and forces strongly. Embedment steel crossheads are used to introduce the large mooring line forces without damaging the concrete walls of the pontoons. Further optimization of the pontoon length is recommended. Fatigue of the prestressing steel and the concrete are shown to be critical and need to be further investigated. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
