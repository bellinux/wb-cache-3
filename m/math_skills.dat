40|$|According to {{the social}} {{cognitive}} theory, self-efficacy is a determinant of the choices made, effort expended, and persistence {{in the face of}} a task. Math self-efficacy has been demonstrated to be a predictor of problem solving over divergent kinds of self-evaluation including self-concept. Self-efficacy beliefs mediate the effect of other factors of mathematical performance such as prior experience, problem solving ability and perceived usefulness. High self-efficacy leads to greater levels of confidence when faced with similar tasks in the future. The current project consists of one completed study. The hypothesis states that math exposure through structured play would be effective in raising math self-efficacy beliefs, improving accuracy of reported math self-efficacy, and increasing immediately recorded <b>math</b> <b>skill.</b> In an effort to increase reported self-efficacy beliefs in children, and to increase the accuracy of their reported predictions and skill, the research used a pretest-posttest control group design. The manipulated variable was game exposure. The presence or absence of game exposure had a statistically significant effect on how accurately participants predicted their own ability to do math problems. It was found that participants had higher reported self-efficacy and greater <b>math</b> <b>skill</b> when the hypothesized treatment was present. Further investigation of these variables suggest <b>math</b> <b>skill</b> and reported <b>math</b> efficacy have a positive correlational relationship; participants reporting with a greater math efficacy in the posttest, also demonstrate a greater skill at answering the problems. All results supported the hypothesis and the Increasing Math Self-Efficacy in Children theory of self-efficacy as defined by Bandura (1986 & 1997).

What Are The Advantages of Collaboration? One popular reason why people believe groups should be more effective, flexible and innovative at problem solving is the assumption that each group member brings to the task a slightly different set of task-relevant knowledge and skills. Through discussion, the knowledge and skills of each member can become available for all, giving each member a larger pool of ideas to draw from. Especially if members possess different backgrounds, group problem solving will give people a greater opportunity for novel associations, strategies and operations. Exposure to diverse viewpoints may increase both the quantity and quality of idea generation in a group context (Hoffman, Harburg & Maier...|$|R
