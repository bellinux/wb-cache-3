50|$|The {{issue of}} neglect of Bowen's cemeteries has persisted into {{the recent history}} of the site. In March 1993 the Bowen Shire Council {{publicly}} noted that while the Flemington Road Cemetery contained a number of headstones, it was poorly maintained due the expense and isolation of the cemetery. Furthermore, the council suggested relocating the headstones in the Flemington Road Cemetery to the John Street Cemetery in order to facilitate <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearance</b> at the site.

40|$|<b>Mechanical</b> <b>clearance</b> is a {{critical}} parameter of the head/disk interface (HDI) for sliders flying in close proximity in hard disk drives.

Voltage pulsing is used to add an additional force component to the complex head/disk interface equilibrium. The applied force is attractive in character and therefore reduces the mechanical spacing between the slider and the disk. If the magnitude of the applied voltage is changed, a slight contact between the slider and the disk can be realized. Simultaneous measurement of the induced slider displacement using a laser vibrometer allows the quantification of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearance.</b> The effect of disk roughness and microwaviness on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearance</b> was investigated.

The software tools development began with a detailed MATLAB/Simulink model of the motion base which was used primarily for safety loads prediction, design of the closed loop compensator {{and development of the}} motion base safety systems 1. A Simulink model of the digital control law, from which a portion of the embedded code is directly generated, was later added to this model to form a closed loop system model. Concurrently, software that runs on a PC was created to display and record motion base parameters. It includes a user interface for controlling time history displays, strip chart displays, data storage, and initializing of function generators used during motion base testing. Finally, a software tool was developed for kinematic analysis and prediction of <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearances</b> for the motion system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experiments and statistical analysis of the performance of manual demining in Afghanistan. Results of probing tests under ideal sandbox conditions are also reported. The results show that probing is unreliable at target depths of more than 7 cm under ideal conditions. While this result has been reported in anecdotal evidence there are few reports of systematic trials to confirm this. Prodding to excavate metal fragments is reliable and much faster than many early reports suggest: a typical average time to recover a 25 mm square, 3 mm thick buried fragment in hard ground is 45 - 55 seconds. Statistical analysis matches the experimental data well. Models derived from a large number of minefield clearance records from the Mine Action Centre for Afghanistan suggest that the time needed to detect, locate, mark and excavate each fragment is approximately 1. 8 minutes. These results suggest that <b>mechanical</b> vegetation <b>clearance</b> is essential to achieve significant productivity gains from using advanced technology detectors in countries with significant vegetation cover. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{concerns}} {{the design and}} optimization of a rotary actuator of which the rotor {{is attached to a}} linear actuator inside a two degree-of-freedom zφ-module, which is part of a pick-and-place robot. The rotary actuator provides ± 180 ° rotation, while the linear actuator offers a z-motion of ± 5 mm. In the paper, the optimal combinations of magnet poles and coils are determined for this slotless actuator with concentrated windings. Based on this analysis, the rotary actuator is optimized using a multi-physical framework, which contains a coupled electromagnetic, mechanical and thermal model. Because the rotation angle is limited, both a moving-coil design with a double <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearance</b> and a moving-magnet design with a single <b>mechanical</b> <b>clearance</b> have been investigated and compared. Additionally, the influence of the edge effects of the magnets on the performance of the rotary actuator has been investigated with both 3 D FEM simulations and measurements. I...|$|E

40|$|Mucociliary {{clearance}} {{and retention}} of monodisperse aerosols of radiolabelled polystyrene particles of both 3. 3 microns and 5 microns diameter were investigated in four healthy calves and two sick calves. The effect of the mucolytic agent bromhexine was also assessed at two dosage levels. There were significant differences (P less than 0. 05) in clearance rate constant between calves, but similar patterns of clearance for each calf. These characteristics of <b>mechanical</b> lung <b>clearance</b> did not vary over a two month period. Values of clearance rate constant and percentage retention varied significantly (P less than 0. 001) between the two different particle sizes, 5 microns particles giving faster clearance and lower retention of particles than 3. 3 microns particles. Bromhexine at the recommended dose of 1. 6 mg/kg 0. 75 caused a significant (P less than 0. 05) increase in clearance rate in both healthy and sick calves, but affected percentage retention only in sick calves. This study illustrates the variation in mucociliary clearance rates shown by individuals and also underlines the importance of particle size in aerosols used for studies of pulmonary deposition and clearance.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed recently that offer different views {{on the role of}} airway surface liquid (ASL) in lung defense. The “compositional” hypothesis predicts that ASL [NaCl] is kept low (< 50 mM) by passive forces to permit antimicrobial factors to act as a chemical defense. The “volume” hypothesis predicts that ASL volume (height) is regulated isotonically by active ion transport to maintain efficient <b>mechanical</b> mucus <b>clearance</b> as the primary form of lung defense. To compare these hypotheses, we searched for roles for: (1) passive forces (surface tension, ciliary tip capillarity, Donnan, and nonionic osmolytes) in the regulation of ASL composition; and (2) active ion transport in ASL volume regulation. In primary human tracheobronchial cultures, we found no evidence that a low [NaCl] ASL could be produced by passive forces, or that nonionic osmolytes contributed substantially to ASL osmolality. Instead, we found that active ion transport regulated ASL volume (height), and that feedback existed between the ASL and airway epithelia to govern the rate of ion transport and volume absorption. The mucus layer acted as a “reservoir” to buffer periciliary liquid layer height (7 μm) at a level optimal for mucus transport by donating or accepting liquid to or from the periciliary liquid layer, respectively. These data favor the active ion transport/volume model hypothesis to describe ASL physiology...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPatients with COPD usually {{experience}} mucus hypersecretion as {{a result}} of airway inflammation and response to noxious stimuli. These in turn lead to worsening airway resistance, impaired airflow, increased work of breathing, dyspnoea and exercise intolerance. Mucus hypersecretion may also lead to increased exacerbations and poor health related quality of life (HRQL). Institution based pulmonary rehabilitation programs incorporating airway clearance techniques have been shown to improve HRQL, reduce dyspnoea and improve exercise tolerance but are often difficult to provide due to restricted accessibility and resource implications. This review examines the current evidence base and best clinical practice in the area of airway <b>clearance.</b> <b>Mechanical</b> devices such as the flutter valves, positive end expiratory pressure and high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) may be able to provide the benefits of improved airway clearance in the patient’s home potentially with reduced demands on healthcare resources...|$|R

These expressions can be computed by numerical iteration. The septum-shape field turns out to be opposite in sign to the other three, making possible a criterion which creates a minimal stray field for a given magnetic induction.

30|$|Aspiration of {{respiratory}} secretions is a frequently needed procedure in intubated subjects, which is performed whenever respiratory secretions accumulate. The conventional method consists of inserting a sterile catheter through the endotracheal tube or tracheostomy cannula {{connected to a}} negative pressure port into the trachea until resistance is met [1]. Its effect is therefore limited to the trachea and carina and efficacy is reduced {{in the presence of}} dense secretions. Frequent complications include traumatic lesions to the mucosa, poor tolerance [2], and pain [3], as well as, mostly transient, respiratory and hemodynamic adverse events [4, 5]. Airway clearance devices providing mechanically assisted cough or mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE), in contrast to manually assisted cough, are being used to facilitate aspiration of tracheobronchial secretions. They simulate the physiological cough mechanism by applying positive pressure to the airway followed by an abrupt decrease to a negative pressure [6]. Experience with non-invasive secretion clearance with MIE has accumulated in non-critically ill patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMD), both chronic ventilator-dependent [7 – 9] and spontaneously breathing subjects [8, 10], hospitalized or at home [11]. The specific indication for the use of a <b>mechanical</b> airway <b>clearance</b> device is the lack of effective cough in spite {{of respiratory}} physiotherapy, with the aim to reduce the risk for atelectasis and respiratory tract infection. The usual interface is a face mask, although the intended use of the devices also includes patients with endotracheal intubation [6, 12].|$|R
