5|$|It is {{possible}} to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low, or it <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force.|$|E
5|$|Parts to be {{injection}} moulded <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> carefully designed {{to facilitate the}} moulding process; the material used for the part, the desired shape and features of the part, the material of the mould, and {{the properties of the}} moulding machine must all be taken into account. The versatility of injection moulding is facilitated by this breadth of design considerations and possibilities.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, {{and the two}} chat in a hot tub. While {{reaching}} for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can still save Finn by using his wish, but reveals that his wish <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> specific, as Prismo's wishes {{have a tendency to}} have a monkey's paw—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grants the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the alternate reality, but Jake does.|$|E

5|$|High thorium {{concentrations}} {{are needed}} in nuclear applications; particularly, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture cross-sections <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low (for example, gadolinium concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective complexation of Th4+ is used. For example, following alkaline digestion {{and the removal of}} phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with tributyl phosphate in kerosene.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{energy flux}} from Vega has been {{precisely}} measured against standard light sources. At 5480Å, the flux is 3,650Jy with an error margin of 2%. The visual spectrum of Vega {{is dominated by}} absorption lines of hydrogen; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n=2 principal quantum number. The lines of other elements are relatively weak, with the strongest being ionized magnesium, iron, and chromium. The X-ray emission from Vega is very low, demonstrating that the corona for this star <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> weak or non-existent. However, as the pole of Vega is facing Earth and a polar coronal hole may be present, confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X-rays detected from Vega (or the region very close to Vega) may be difficult as most of any coronal X-rays would not be emitted {{along the line of}} sight.|$|E

5|$|The {{virtue of}} {{electronic}} realizations like the Kibble balance {{is that the}} definition and dissemination of the kilogram {{would no longer be}} dependent upon the stability of kilogram prototypes, which <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> carefully handled and stored. It would free physicists from the need to rely on assumptions about the stability of those prototypes. Instead, hand-tuned, close-approximation mass standards would simply be weighed and documented as being equal to one kilogram plus an offset value. With the Kibble balance, while the kilogram would be delineated in electrical and gravity terms, all of which are traceable to invariants of nature; it would be defined {{in a manner that is}} directly traceable to just three fundamental constants of nature. The Planck constant defines the kilogram in terms of the second and the metre. By fixing the Planck constant, the definition of the kilogram would depend only on the definitions of the second and the metre. The definition of the second depends on a single defined physical constant: the ground state hyperfine splitting frequency of the caesium 133 atom Δν(133Cs)hfs. The metre depends on the second and on an additional defined physical constant: the speed of light c. If the kilogram is redefined in this manner, mass artifacts—physical objects calibrated in a Kibble balance, including the IPK—would no longer be part of the definition, but would instead become transfer standards.|$|E

50|$|The {{action of}} igniting the arc at a {{controlled}} time, each cycle, allows the ignitron {{to dispense with}} the auxiliary anode and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves. However, a disadvantage is that the ignition electrode <b>must</b> <b>be</b> positioned <b>very</b> accurately, just barely touching {{the surface of the}} mercury pool, which means that ignitrons <b>must</b> <b>be</b> installed <b>very</b> accurately within a few degrees of an upright position.|$|R

25|$|Small {{errors in}} floating-point {{arithmetic}} can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations {{an enormous number}} of times.

These algorithms <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as Iterative refinement, if they are to work well.|$|E
25|$|A large {{cardinal}} is {{a cardinal}} number {{with an extra}} property. Many such properties are studied, including inaccessible cardinals, measurable cardinals, and many more.

25|$|Separators have to {{physically}} {{separate the two}} electrodes to prevent a short circuit by direct contact. It can be very thin (a few hundredths of a millimeter) and <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> porous to the conducting ions to minimize ESR. Furthermore, separators must be chemically inert to protect the electrolyte's stability and conductivity. Inexpensive components use open capacitor papers. More sophisticated designs use nonwoven porous polymeric films like polyacrylonitrile or Kapton, woven glass fibers or porous woven ceramic fibres.|$|E
25|$|Fire {{may cause}} changes in soil {{nutrients}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms, including oxidation, volatilization, erosion, and leaching by water. Temperatures <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> high, however, to cause a significant loss of nutrients, which are often replaced by organic matter left behind in the fire. Also, the minerals which were formerly part of slowly decaying plant matter become more soluble and available in the ash. Charcoal is able to counteract some nutrient and water loss because of its absorptive properties.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another problem}} is {{bringing}} the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill's liquids.

The processing of the krill <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.|$|E
