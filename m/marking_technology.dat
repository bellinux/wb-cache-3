Our method {{is designed to be}} mainly used for low resolution ink jet marking machines to produce both gray tone and color images. The main problem with digital halftoning is pink noise caused by the human eye's visual transfer function. To compensate for this the random dot patterns used are optimized to contain more blue than pink noise. Several such dot pattern generator threshold matrices have been created automatically by using genetic algorithm optimization, a non-deterministic global optimization method imitating natural evolution and genetics. A hybrid of genetic algorithm with a search method based on local backtracking was developed together with several fitness functions evaluating dot patterns for rectangular grids. By modifying the fitness function, a family of dot generators results, each with its particular statistical features. Several versions of genetic algorithms, backtracking and fitness functions were tested to find a reasonable combination. The generated threshold matrices have been tested by simulating a set of test images using the Khoros image processing system. Even though the work was focused on developing low resolution <b>marking</b> <b>technology,</b> the resulting family of dot generators can be applied also in other halftoning application areas including high resolution printing technology...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 1, the {{electrophotographic}} (EP) {{process is}} widely used in imaging systems such as laser printers and office copiers. In the EP process, laser scanner jitter is a common artifact that mainly appears along the scan direction due to the condition of polygon facets. Prior studies have not focused on the periodic characteristic of laser scanner jitter {{in terms of the}} modeling and analysis. This chapter addresses the periodic characteristic of laser scanner jitter in the mathematical model. In the Fourier domain, we derive an analytic expression for laser scanner jitter in general, and extend the expression assuming a sinusoidal displacement. This leads to a simple closed-form expression in terms of Bessel functions of the first kind. We further examine the relationship between the continuous-space halftone image and the periodic laser scanner jitter. The simulation results show that our proposed mathematical model predicts the phenomenon of laser scanner jitter effectively, when compared to the characterization using a test pattern, which consists of a flat field with 25 % dot coverage However, there is some mismatches between the analytical spectrum and spectrum of the processed scanned test target. We improve experimental results by directly estimating the displacement instead of assuming a sinusoidal displacement. This gives a better prediction of the phenomenon of laser scanner jitter. ^ In Chapter 2, we describe a segmentation-based object map correction algorithm, which can be integrated in a new imaging pipeline for laser electrophotographic (EP) printers. This new imaging pipeline incorporates the idea of object-oriented halftoning, which applies different halftone screens to different regions of the page, to improve the overall print quality. In particular, smooth areas are halftoned with a low-frequency screen to provide more stable printing; whereas detail areas are halftoned with a high-frequency screen, since this will better reproduce the object detail. In this case, the object detail also serves to mask any print defects that arise from the use of a high frequency screen. These regions are defined by the initial object map, which is translated from the page description language (PDL). However, the information of object type obtained from the PDL may be incorrect. Some smooth areas may be labeled as raster causing them to be halftoned with a high frequency screen, rather than being labeled as vector, which would result in them being rendered with a low frequency screen. To correct the misclassification, we propose an object map correction algorithm that combines information from the incorrect object map with information obtained by segmentation of the continuous-tone RGB rasterized page image. Finally, the rendered image can be halftoned by the object-oriented halftoning approach, based on the corrected object map. Preliminary experimental results indicate the benefits of our algorithm combined with the new imaging pipeline, in terms of correction of misclassification errors. ^ In Chapter 3, we describe a study to understand image graininess. With the emergence of the high-end digital printing technologies, it is of interest to analyze the nature and causes of image graininess {{in order to understand the}} factors that prevent high-end digital presses from achieving the same print quality as commercial offset presses. We want to understand how image graininess relates to the halftoning technology and <b>marking</b> <b>technology.</b> This chapter provides three different approaches to understand image graininess. First, we perform a Fourier-based analysis of regular and irregular periodic, clustered-dot halftone textures. With high-end digital printing technology, irregular screens can be considered since they can achieve a better approximation to the screen sets used for commercial offset presses. This is due to the fact that the elements of the periodicity matrix of an irregular screen are rational numbers, rather than integers, which would be the case for a regular screen. From the analytical results, we show that irregular halftone textures generate new frequency components near the spectrum origin; and these frequency components are low enough to be visible to the human viewer. However, regular halftone textures do not have these frequency components. In addition, we provide a metric to measure the nonuniformity of a given halftone texture. The metric indicates that the nonuniformity of irregular halftone textures is higher than the nonuniformity of regular halftone textures. Furthermore, a method to visualize the nonuniformity of given halftone textures is described. The analysis shows that irregular halftone textures are grainier than regular halftone textures. Second, we analyze the regular and irregular periodic, clustered-dot halftone textures by calculating three spatial statistics. First, the disparity between lattice points generated by the periodicity matrix, and centroids of dot clusters are considered. Next, the area of dot clusters in regular and irregular halftone textures is considered. Third, the compactness of dot clusters in the regular and irregular halftone textures is calculated. The disparity of between centroids of irregular dot clusters and lattices points generated by the irregular screen is larger than the disparity of between centroids of regular dot clusters and lattices points generated by the regular screen. Irregular halftone textures have higher variance in the histogram of dot-cluster area. In addition, the compactness measurement shows that irregular dot clusters are less compact than regular dot clusters. But, a clustered-dot halftone algorithm wants to produce clustered-dot as compact as possible. Lastly, we exam the current <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> by printing the same halftone pattern on different substrates, glossy and polyester media. The experimental results show that the current <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> provides better print quality on glossy media than on polyester media. With above three different approaches, we conclude that the current halftoning technology introduces image graininess in the spatial domain because of the non-integer elements in the periodicity matrix of the irregular screen and the finite addressability of the marking engine. In addition, the geometric characteristics of irregular dot clusters is more irregular than the geometric characteristics of regular dot clusters. Finally, the <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> provides inconsistency of print quality between substrates. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Spatial {{patterns}} of spawning and early dispersal {{have important implications}} for the population dynamics of stream-dwelling salmonids, but the limitations of <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> have made it difficult to measure these processes in wild populations. We used microsatellite DNA markers and sibship and parentage analyses to follow the dispersal, spatial distribution, and distribution of reproductive success in a small, isolated western Virginia population of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis at 4, 16, and 28 months after fry emergence. For the 2004 year-class (high-recruitment cohort), we identified 180 full-sibling families representing individual spawning events. Offspring were unevenly distributed across families, with 16 % of the families accounting for 50 % of the offspring and 53 % of the families being represented by fewer than three individuals. However, a large proportion of adults had some successful reproduction. Spatial and family size distributions at 4 months after emergence were similar between the 2004 and 2006 (low-recruitment) year-classes in spite of a threefold difference in abundance. The spatial locations of full sibs were closely associated, indicating limited dispersal in the first 4 months postemergence. The spatial locations of assigned parents were correlated with the locations of their offspring. For the 2004 cohort, sibling dispersal substantially increased after the 4 -month sample, but neither fish length, family size (number of individuals), nor fish density was related to dispersal distance at any postemergence time interval.

40|$|Pavement <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> is a {{continually}} evolving subject. There {{are numerous}} types of {{materials used in}} the field today, including (but not limited to) paint, epoxy, tape, and thermoplastic. Each material has {{its own set of}} unique characteristics related to durability, retro reflectivity, installation cost, and life-cycle cost. The Iowa Highway Research Board was interested in investigating the possibility of developing an ongoing program to evaluate the various products used in pavement marking. This potential program would maintain a database of performance and cost information to assist state and local agencies in determining which materials and placement methods are most appropriate for their use. The Center for Transportation Research and Education at Iowa State University has completed Phase I of this research: to identify the current practice and experiences from around the United States to recommend a further course of action for the State of Iowa. There has been a significant amount of research completed in the last several years. Research from Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Ohio, and Alaska all had some common findings: white markings are more retro reflective than yellow markings; paint is by-and-large the least expensive material; paint tends to degrade faster than other materials; thermoplastic and tapes had higher retro reflective characteristics. Perhaps the most significant program going on in the area of pavement markings is the National Transportation Product Evaluation Program (NTPEP). This is an ongoing research program jointly conducted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and its member states. Field and lab tests on numerous types of pavement marking materials are being conducted at sites representing four climatological areas. These results are published periodically for use by any jurisdiction interested in pavement marking materials performance. At this time, it is recommended that the State of Iowa not embark on a test deck evaluation program. Instead, close attention should be paid to the ongoing evaluations of the NTPEP program. Materials that fare well on the NTPEP test de cks should be considered for further field studies in Iowa...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} a mechatronic system, designed and {{developed for the}} forest industry, to trace logs from forest to sawmill. The research is {{a key part of}} a large research project launched by the EU in 2006 called the Indisputable Key project. Wood waste during harvesting, transportation and refinement is a major concern for the wood industry worldwide. Some raw materials are not suited for specific end products, and acknowledging this late in the wood value chain is cost inefficient. Pinpointing specific raw material suitable for a particular end product could increase quality, reduce waste and environmental impact; to accomplish this, traceability is essential. To trace the raw material of a final wood product to its origin, marking and reading of the different specimens must occur at each refining stage in the wood value chain. The traceability chain can be divided into three main stages: forest to sawmill, inside the sawmill, and from sawmill to second manufacturer. The research presented here covers {{the first part of the}} wood value chain, namely, forest to sawmill. In Scandinavian countries, logs are cut to length in the forest using a harvester machine. To trace logs, a unique identity code needs to be associated with each log at harvesting time in the forest and detected before further processing at the sawmill. Earlier research using RFID transponders as code carriers have been functionally verified but too costly. Although the cost of RFID transponders is declining, alternative methods are considered a necessity. This constitutes the main driver behind this thesis. The thesis presents a promising alternative log marking method comprising a harvester saw-integrated log code printer and a sawmill code detection system. An identity code in the form of a standard matrix code is applied via the harvester saw bar during cutting. A prototype has been designed and realized and the results point towards a both time and cost efficient solution. The code detection system, to be placed in one or more locations at the sawmill, is based on vision technology and image processing to detect the applied log codes. Both log code marking and reading systems communicate with an ICT system which maintains the traceability database. A major advantage of the system is that both marking and reading is performed without any time-loss and hence do not disturb the high pace production flow in todays forestry. Also, the item cost of each code mark is very low, compared to e. g. a transponder. The <b>marking</b> <b>technology</b> is patent pending. A field test was performed in December 2009 in northern Sweden. A test batch of 320 logs was marked and read. Two code structures (i. e., matrix and barcode) were applied, where 210 barcoded logs were used to demonstrate log traceability between forest and sawmill. This result indicates that this technology has potential. The prototype is not intended for commercial use, but serves merely to demonstrate the potential of the method; further research is needed to improve its functionality. QC 2011051...|$|E
