5000|$|<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>container</b> {{ships are}} {{specifically}} designed to carry containerised unit loads where each container has its individual <b>refrigerated</b> unit. These <b>containers</b> are nearly always twenty-foot equivalent units (often called TEU) that are the size of [...] "standard" [...] cargo containers that are loaded and unloaded at container terminals and aboard container ships. These ships differ from conventional container ships in their design, power generation, and electrical distribution equipment. They need provisions made for powering each container's cooling system. Because of their ease of loading and unloading cargo many container ships are now being built or redesigned to carry <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R

In this way, the distribution of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> {{does not have to be}} undertaken one by one, but it was delivered one by one in order to big customers. Regarding the cost of the distribution process, we need to choose the distribution route more carefully, plan the distribution order in advance, pack the goods according to the different requirements of temperature, and also consider the length of the route and attach importance to the reputation of the enterprise.|$|R

50|$|Refrigerated cargo is a {{key part}} of the income for some {{shipping}} companies. On multi-purpose ships, <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> are mostly carried above deck, as they have to be checked for proper operation. Also, a major part of the refrigeration system (such as a compressor) may fail, which would have to be replaced or unplugged quickly in the event of a fire. Modern container vessels stow the reefer containers in cellguides with adjacent inspection walkways that enable reefer containers to be carried in the holds as well as on the deck. Modern <b>refrigerated</b> <b>container</b> vessels are designed to incorporate a water-cooling system for containers stowed under deck. This does not replace the refrigeration system but facilitates cooling down of the external machinery. Containers stowed on the exposed upper deck are air-cooled, while those under deck are water-cooled. The water cooling design allows capacity loads of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> under deck as it enables the dissipation of the high amount of heat they generate. This system draws fresh water from the ship's water supply, which in turn transfers the heat through heat exchangers to the abundantly available sea water.|$|R
5000|$|Refrigerated cargo units - Container {{vessels are}} {{equipped}} with power source for specific places to plug in the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> known as [...] "reefers", hence, the reefer containers places are known and are usually the first type of containers to consider in the stowage plan.|$|R

The difference between the official and estimated numbers is because Maersk calculates the capacity of a container ship by weight (in this case, 14 tons/container), i.e. 11,000+ containers, of which 1,000 can be <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|R

50|$|A major use of {{refrigerated}} cargo hold type ships was for the transportation of bananas and frozen meat, {{but most of these}} ships have been partly replaced by <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> that have a refrigeration system attached to the rear end of the container. While on a ship these containers are plugged into an electrical outlet (typically 440 VAC) that ties into the ship's power generation. <b>Refrigerated</b> <b>container</b> ships are not limited by the number of refrigeration containers they can carry, unlike other container ships which may be limited in their number of refrigeration outlets or have insufficient generator capacity. Each reefer container unit is typically designed with a stand-alone electrical circuit and has its own breaker switch that allows it to be connected and disconnected as required. In principle each individual unit could be repaired while the ship was still underway.|$|R
