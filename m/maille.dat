5|$|The Battle of Orbetello, {{also known}} as the Battle of Isola del Giglio, was a major naval {{engagement}} of the Franco-Spanish War of 1635. It was fought on 14 June 1646 off the Spanish-ruled town of Orbetello, on the coast of Tuscany, Italy, between a French fleet led by Admiral Armand de <b>Maillé,</b> Marquis of Brézé, and a Spanish fleet commanded by Miguel de Noronha, 4th Count of Linhares sent to break the blockade of Orbetello and relieve the town, besieged since 12 May by a French army under the command of Prince Thomas of Savoy. The Battle of Orbetello was tactically very unusual, since it was fought by sailing ships towed by galleys in a light breeze.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the siege}} reached Spain, Philip IV gave orders to {{assemble}} a relief fleet. Second-hand goods were purchased in the Netherlands and extraordinary levies were carried out across the country. The command of the expedition was entrusted to the Portuguese loyalist Miguel de Noronha, Count of Linhares, who was Captain General of the Galleys of the Mediterranean, and therefore supreme commander of the Spanish naval forces of this sea. He received orders to sail to Orbetello in command of 22 men-of-war of the Silver fleet and the Dunkirk squadron; the later providing 8 frigates. At least 3,300 soldiers were brought aboard these ships for the relief. Linhares' second in command was Admiral General Francisco Díaz de Pimienta, who displeased by his always secondary role, had recently resigned, claiming ill health. While Pimienta would {{be in charge of}} the sailing ships, Linhares would do so with the galleys. Once at sea, the Spanish fleet was joined off the Sardinian Cape Carbonara by 18 galleys from the squadrons of Naples, Sardinia, Genoa, and Sicily, which drove up its strength to 22 galleons and frigates and 30 galleys. Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé, Admiral de <b>Maille</b> Brézé, in the meantime, could be reinforced by the divisions of Montade and Saint-Tropez, and was able to oppose Linhares and Pimienta with 24 sailing ships and 20 galleys.|$|E

25|$|Eoghan Dubhdara Ó <b>Máille,</b> {{her father}} {{and his family were}} based in Clew Bay, County Mayo. He was lord of the Ó <b>Máille</b> dynasty and ruler of Umall, descended from <b>Maille</b> mac Conall. The Uí Mháille (O'Malleys) were one of the {{seafaring}} families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the Mac Uilliam Íochtair branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo (the Bourkes (De Burca) were originally Anglo-Norman but by her lifetime completely Gaelicised. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a Ní Mháille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called Dónal na Píopa, the son of her father.|$|E
25|$|Westport {{originates}} {{and gets}} its name, in Irish, from a 16th-century castle--Cathair na Mart (meaning: The Stone Fort of the Beeves or The City of The Fairs)--and surrounding settlement, {{belonging to the}} powerful local seafaring Ó <b>Máille</b> Clan, who controlled the Clew Bay area, then known as Umaill.|$|E
25|$|Ní Mháille {{was married}} in 1546 to Dónal an Chogaidh Ó Flaithbheartaigh, tánaiste or {{heir to the}} Ó Flaithbheartaigh (O'Flaherty) title, {{which would have been}} a good {{political}} match for the daughter of the Ó <b>Máille</b> chieftain.

25|$|The Strategikon {{states the}} Huns {{typically}} used <b>maille,</b> swords, bows, and lances, {{and that most}} Hunnic warriors were armed with both the bow and lance and used them interchangeably as needed. It also states the Huns used quilted linen, wool, or sometimes iron barding for their horses and also wore quilted coifs and kaftans. This assessment is largely corroborated by archaeological finds of Hun military equipment, such as the Volnikovka and Brut Burials.|$|E
25|$|The Prince's lifelong {{resentment of}} his forced {{marriage}} to a social inferior persisted, and found unchivalrous expression in a bitter letter, his last to the king, in which he begged that his wife never be released from her exile to the countryside. Nonetheless, Claire-Clémence de <b>Maillé</b> had brought the Prince of Condé a dowry of 600,000 livres, the manors of Ansac, Mouy, Cambronne, Plessis-Billebault, Galissonnière and Brézé, and, on one occasion, liberation from the King's dungeon.|$|E
25|$|The small {{community}} felt it wiser {{to be closer}} to Fournet, their spiritual guide, and decided to relocate to <b>Maillé.</b> They needed a home which would both accommodate the community and provide a place for their work. For this, they were able to acquire the local chateau. There the community was joined by Anne Bannier. In February 1807, the five members of the community professed religious vows, establishing the new congregation of the Daughters of the Cross.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, {{a former}} servant came {{by the house}} and covertly informed them that a refractory priest would be presiding at a secret Mass at a farm in Marsyllis, about ten miles (15km) away. This was the Abbé Andrew Fournet, the underground pastor of <b>Maillé,</b> who would give Bichier a new direction in her life, answering her longings. The following week she set out at night on a donkey, led by the same former servant, {{to take part in}} the service. After a journey of three hours, they arrived at the site. After the Mass, Fournet began to hear the confessions of the people. As Bichier approached him, the peasants gave way to her, an aristocrat. Fournet challenged Bichier over her presumption and she let him hear the confessions of the entire congregation, going last just as the sun was rising.|$|E
25|$|On 7 December, Anti-Treaty IRA gunmen shot two TDs, Sean Hales and Pádraic Ó <b>Máille,</b> in Dublin as {{they were}} on their way to the Dáil. Hales was killed and O'Máille was badly wounded. After an {{emergency}} cabinet meeting, the Free State government decided on the retaliatory executions of four prominent Republicans (one from each province). Accordingly, on 8 December 1922, the day after Hales' killing, four members of the IRA Army Executive, who had been in jail since the first week of the war - Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey - were executed in revenge. O'Connor and Mellows particularly were revered heroes of the War of Independence. This was arguably an unlawful act, as the four Republicans had been captured before the Dáil passed the legislation authorising executions. Later on the same day the Dáil debated the executions and retrospectively approved them by a vote of 39-14. One of the poignant aspects of the incident was that O'Connor and Kevin O'Higgins were formerly close friends, and O'Connor had been best man at O'Higgins' wedding just a few months previously. Historian Michael Hopkinson reports that Richard Mulcahy had pressed for the executions and that Kevin O'Higgins was the last member of cabinet to give his consent.|$|E

2500|$|Westport is {{designated}} as a heritage town and is unusual in Ireland {{in that it is}} one of only a few planned towns in the country. The design of the town is attributed to James Wyatt, an English architect. He also completed Westport House, the stately home of the Marquess of Sligo and designed its dining room. Westport House had originally been built by Richard Cassels, the German architect, in the 1730s, near the site of the original Ó <b>Máille</b> Castle. The most notable feature of James Wyatt's town plan is the tree-lined boulevard, the Mall, built on the Carrowbeg River. [...] Since the late 20th century, Westport has greatly expanded with several new estates. Some of the most populous estates are: Springfield, the Carrowbeg Estate, Horkans Hill, Cedar Park, Fairways, Knockranny Village and Sharkey Hill.|$|E

[...] The medieval quilted gambeson, aketon and arming doublet were garments worn under or instead of armor of <b>maille</b> or plate armor. [...] These developed into the later quilted doublet worn as part of fashionable European male clothing from the fourteenth to seventeenth century.

Local folklore had it that as a young girl Ní Mháille wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname [...] "Gráinne Mhaol" [...] ( [...] ; from maol meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile.

But Mandat returns not; Petion is gone: much hangs wavering in the invisible Balance.

[...] For it is his Majesty, gone down with old Marshal <b>Maille</b> to review the troops; and the nearest companies of them answer so. Her Majesty bursts into a stream of tears. Yet on stepping from the cabinet her eyes are dry and calm, her look is even cheerful. 'The Austrian lip, and the aquiline nose, fuller than usual, gave to her countenance,' says Peltier, (in Toulongeon, ii. 241.)
