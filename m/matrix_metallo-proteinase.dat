In addition to the risk imposed by the disease itself, pharmacological treatment adds also a sizable risk, especially if certain classes of antidiabetic drugs are employed. Animal evidence indicates that dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors have anti-atherosclerotic effects, yet clinical data are scarcely available. Design We plan to prospectively investigate the effects of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibition with vildagliptin {{on a number of}} atherothrombotic markers and adipokines in patients with proven atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes.

This study investigated the role of extracellular <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> inducer (EMMPRIN) in brain oedema. METHODS: The monofilament puncture model was used to induce subarachnoid haemorrhage. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into five groups (n = 20 per group) : sham-operated, sacrificed immediately after surgery (sham group); sacrificed 12, 24 or 72 h after subarachnoid haemorrhage induction (SAH- 12, SAH- 24 and SAH- 72 groups, respectively); treated with EMMPRIN inhibitor immediately after subarachnoid haemorrhage, sacrificed at 24 h (SAH-inhibition group). Mean brain water content, and EMMPRIN mRNA and protein levels, were determined. RESULTS: Compared with the sham group, mean brain water content, EMMPRIN mRNA and protein levels in the SAH- 12, SAH- 24 and SAH- 72 groups increased rapidly and significantly (maximal at 24 h). EMMPRIN inhibition significantly reduced mean brain water content and EMMPRIN mRNA and protein levels in the SAH-inhibition group, compared with the SAH- 24 group. CONCLUSIONS: EMMPRIN upregulation may be important in the formation of brain oedema; inhibition of EMMPRIN activity may provide a potential approach to reduce oedema after subarachnoid haemorrhage...|$|E

It has been hypothesized that calci-potriol counteracts glucocorticoid-induced skin atrophy which is associated with changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). To elucidate the combined effects of calcipotriol and betamethasone on key ECM components, a compara-tive study to the respective mono-treatments was carried out. The effect on collagen I synthesis, <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> (MMP) secretion, and hyaluronic acid (HA) production was investigated in primary human fibroblast and keratinocyte cultures {{as well as in}} a human skin explant model. We show that calcipotriol counteracts betamethasone-induced suppression of collagen I synthesis. Similarly, calcipotriol and betamethasone have opposing effects on MMP expression in both fibroblasts and kerati-nocytes. Moreover, calcipotriol is able to restore beta-methasone-impaired HA synthesis in keratinocytes and prevent betamethasone-induced epidermal thinning in minipigs upon treatment with the calcipotriol/betametha-sone gel.

The cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction provides not only structural and mechanical support but also important biological signaling during tissue remodeling.

In the heart, TNC appears in several important steps of embryonic development such as the initial differentiation of cardiomyocytes or coronary vasculo/angiogenesis, {{but it is not}} detected in a normal adult myocardium. However, TNC is found to re-express after myocardial injury and may regulate cellular behavior during tissue remodeling by modulating the attachment of cardiomyocytes to connective tissue, by enhancing migration and differentiation of myofibroblasts, and by inducing <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinases.</b> TNC also interacts with other ECM molecules and may modulate progression of fibrosis.

Because several NC 1 COOH-terminal domains of other chains from basement membrane collagens were reported to exhibit antitumor activity, we decided to {{study the effects of}} the NC 1 (XIX) collagen domain on tumor progression using an experimental in vivo model of mouse melanoma. We observed a 70 % reduction in tumor volume in NC 1 (XIX) -treated mice compared with the corresponding controls. Histologic examination of the tumors showed a strong decrease in tumor vascularization in treated mice. In vitro, NC 1 (XIX) inhibited the migrating capacity of tumor cells and their capacity to invade Matrigel. It also inhibited the capacity of human microvascular endothelial cells to form pseudo-tubes in Matrigel. This effect was accompanied by a strong inhibition of membrane type- 1 <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> (matrix metalloproteinase- 14) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression.

Previous work used a <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> (MMP- 2 and 9) -cleavable sequence in the ACPP to target contrast agents for tumor imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery. To improve specificity and sensitivity for MMP- 2, an integrin avb 3 -binding domain, cyclic-RGD, was covalently {{linked to the}} ACPP. This co-targeting strategy relies on the interaction of MMP- 2 with integrin avb 3, which are known to associate via the hemopexin domain of MMP- 2. In U 87 MG glioblastoma cells in culture, dual targeting greatly improved ACPP uptake compared with either MMP or integrinavb 3 targeting alone. In vivo, dual-targetedACPP treatment resulted in tumor contrast of 7. 8 1. 6, a 10 -fold higher tumor fluorescence compared with the negative control peptide, and increased probe penetration into the core of MDA-MB- 231 tumors. This platform also significantly improved efficacy of the chemother-apeutic monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) in both MDA-MB- 231 orthotopic human and syngeneic Py 230 murine breast tumors.

Embryonic expression of 72 kDa and 92 kDa matrix metalloproteinases, as well as interleukin 1 α, was also investigated. METHODS: Uterine matrix metalloproteinases were detected using gelatin substrate gel electrophoresis (zymography) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction methodology was used to detect and quantitate different mRNA species in the mouse uterus and blastocyst. RESULTS: Collagenase, 72 kDa, and 92 kDa matrix metalloproteinases are developmentally regulated during the peri-implantation period of pregnancy, but membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase appears to be expressed constitutively. Matrix metalloproteinase mRNA levels have been quantitated and confirm the observed developmental expression patterns.

Here we present a crystallographic determination of the collagen type I supermolecular structure, where the molecular conformation of each collagen segment found within the naturally occurring crystallographic unit cell has been defined (P 1, a ≈ 40. 0 Å, b ≈ 27. 0 Å, c ≈ 678 Å, α ≈ 89. 2 °, β ≈ 94. 6 °, γ ≈ 105. 6 °; reflections: 414, overlapping, 232, and nonoverlapping, 182; resolution, 5. 16 Å axial and 11. 1 Å equatorial).

Limited evidence supports {{a role for}} progesterone in the induction of collagenolytic activity in the periovulatory follicle of primate and nonprimate species. This {{study was designed to}} elucidate the pattern of expression and progesterone regulation of mRNAs for the <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinases</b> (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) in ma-caque granulosa cells during controlled ovarian stimulation cy-cles before (0 h) and after (up to 36 h) administration of an ovulatory hCG bolus. Levels of mRNAs for interstitial collage-nase, gelatinase A, matrilysin, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 increased (p, 0. 05) within 12 h of hCG, while gelatinase B mRNA increased later, by 36 h after hCG. Administration of a 3 b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor (Trilostane [TRL]) during hCG treat-ment decreased (p, 0. 05) mRNA levels for interstitial colla-genase, gelatinase B, matrilysin, TIMP- 1, and TIMP- 2. Progestin (R 5020) replacement during hCG 1 TRL treatment returned in-terstitial collagenase and TIMP- 1 mRNAs to control levels. These data suggest that one action of progesterone, and possibly other steroids, in the cascade of events leading to ovulation and lu-teinization of the primate follicle is to regulate the expression of specific ovarian proteases and protease inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGlaucoma, {{the most}} common cause of {{irreversible}} blindness, is a neuropathy commonly initiated by pathological ocular hypertension due to unknown mechanisms of trabecular meshwork degeneration. Current antiglaucoma therapy does not target the causal trabecular pathology, which may explain why treatment failure is often observed. Here we show that the chemokine CXCL 12, its truncated form SDF- 1 (5 - 67), and the receptors CXCR 4 and CXCR 3 are expressed in human glaucomatous trabecular tissue and a human trabecular cell line. SDF- 1 (5 - 67) is produced under the control of <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinases,</b> TNF-α, and TGF-β 2, factors known to be involved in glaucoma. CXCL 12 protects in vitro trabecular cells from apoptotic death via CXCR 4 whereas SDF- 1 (5 - 67) induces apoptosis through CXCR 3 and caspase activation. Ocular administration of SDF- 1 (5 - 67) in the rat increases intraocular pressure. In contrast, administration of a selective CXCR 3 antagonist in a rat model of ocular hypertension decreases intraocular pressure, prevents retinal neurodegeneration, and preserves visual function. The protective effect of CXCR 3 antagonism is related to restoration of the trabecular function. These data demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage of CXCL 12 is involved in trabecular pathophysiology, and that local administration of a selective CXCR 3 antagonist may be a beneficial therapeutic strategy for treating ocular hypertension and subsequent retinal degeneration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Polysaccharides {{extracted}} from the Phellinus linteus (PL) mushroom are known to possess anti-tumor effects. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-tumor properties of PL remain to be explored. Experiments were carried out to unravel the anticancer effects of PL. Methods The anti-cancer effects of PL were examined in SW 480 colon cancer cells by evaluating cell proliferation, invasion and <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> (MMP) activity. The anti-angiogenic effects of PL were examined by assessing human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and capillary tube formation. The in vivo effect of PL was evaluated in an athymic nude mouse SW 480 tumor engraft model. Results PL (125 - 1000 μg/mL) significantly inhibited cell proliferation and decreased β-catenin expression in SW 480 cells. Expression of cyclin D 1, one of the downstream-regulated genes of β-catenin, and T-cell factor/lymphocyte enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) transcription activity were also significantly reduced by PL treatment. PL inhibited in vitro invasion and motility {{as well as the}} activity of MMP- 9. In addition, PL treatment inhibited HUVEC proliferation and capillary tube formation. Tumor growth of SW 480 cells implanted into nude mice was significantly decreased as a consequence of PL treatment, and tumor tissues from treated animals showed an increase in the apoptotic index and a decrease in β-catenin expression. Moreover, the proliferation index and microvessel density were significantly decreased. Conclusions These data suggest that PL suppresses tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis through the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in certain colon cancer cells. </p...|$|E
40|$|Parenteral {{administration}} of interferon (IFN) -b {{is one of}} the currently approved therapies for multiple scler-osis. One characteristic of this disease is the increased production of gelatinase B, also called <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> (MMP) 9. Gelatinase B is capable of destroy-ing the blood±brain barrier, and of cleaving myelin basic protein into immunodominant and encephalito-genic fragments, thus playing a functional role and being a therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis. Here we demonstrate that gelatinase B proteolytically cleaves IFN-b, kills its activity, and hence counteracts this cyto-kine as an antiviral and immunotherapeutic agent. This proteolysis is more pronounced with IFN-b- 1 b than with IFN-b- 1 a. Furthermore, the tetracycline mino-cycline, which has a known blocking effect in experi-mental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an in vivo model of acute in¯ammation in multiple sclerosis, and other MMP inhibitors prevent the in vitro degradation of IFN-b by gelatinase B. These data provide a novel mechanism and rationale for the inhibition of gelatinase B in diseases in which IFN-b has a bene®cial effect. The combination of gelatinase B inhibitors with better and lower pharmacological formulations of IFN-b may reduce the side-effects of treatment with IFN-b, and is therefore proposed for multiple sclerosis therapy and the immunotherapy of viral infections.

40|$|For {{clinical}} {{application of}} tissue engineering strategies, {{the use of}} animal-derived serum in culture medium is not recommended, because it can evoke immune responses in patients. We previously observed that human platelet-lysate (PL) is favourable for cell expansion, but generates weaker tissue as compared to culture in foetal bovine serum (FBS). We investigated if human serum (HS) is a better human supplement to increase tissue strength. Cells were isolated from venous grafts of 10 patients and expanded in media supplemented with PL or HS, to determine proliferation rates and expression of genes related to collagen production and maturation. Zymography {{was used to assess}} protease expression. Collagen contraction assays were used as a two-dimensional (2 D) model for matrix contraction. As a prove of principle, 3 D tissue culture and tensile testing was performed for two patients, to determine tissue strength. Cell proliferation was lower in HS-supplemented medium than in PL medium. The HS cells produced less active <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinase</b> 2 (MMP 2) and showed increased matrix contraction as indicated by gel contraction assays and 3 D-tissue culture. Tensile testing showed increased strength for tissues cultured in HS when compared to PL. This effect was more pronounced if cells were sequentially cultured in PL, followed by tissue culture in HS. These data suggest that sequential use of PL and HS as substitutes for FBS in culture medium for cardiovascular tissue engineering results in improved cell proliferation and tissue mechanical properties, as compared to use of PL or HS apart...|$|E
40|$|P- 5 m, an octapeptide {{derived from}} domain 5 of HKa, was {{initially}} found to inhibit the invasion and migration of melanoma cells. The high metastatic potential of melanoma cells was prevented by the HGK motif in the P- 5 m peptide in vitro {{and in an}} experimental lung metastasis model, suggesting that P- 5 m may {{play an important role}} in the regulation of tumor metastasis. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of P- 5 m on tumor metastasis of human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HCCLM 3) in vitro and in vivo in a nude mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and detect the mechanisms involved in P- 5 m-induced anti-metastasis. By gelatin zymography, <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinases</b> 2 (MMP- 2) activity in HCCLM 3 was dramatically diminished by P- 5 m peptide. In addition, the migration and metastasis of HCCLM 3 cells was also inhibited by the peptide in vitro. In an orthotopic model of HCC in nude mice, P- 5 m treatment effectively reduced the lung metastasis as well as the expression of MMP- 2 in the tumor tissues. Overall, these observations indicate an important role for P- 5 m peptide in HCC invasion and metastasis, at least partially through modulation MMP- 2 expression. These data suggests that P- 5 m may have therapeutic potential in metastatic human hepatocarcinoma...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the role of <b>matrix</b> <b>metallo-proteinases</b> (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury induced by hyperoxia. Twenty-three pigs were exposed in sealed cages tow 80 % oxygen (for 24 – 120 h) or room air. Correlation between MMP- 2 /MMP- 9 activity, measured by gelatin zymo-graphy in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the histological findings and pathological parameters were examined in detail. Sources of these MMPs in the hyperoxic lung were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The histological progression of acute lung injury in this model ranged from the early exudative to the early proliferative phase of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). MMP- 2 and- 9 activities were elevated under prolonged hyperoxic exposure. MMP- 9 activity correlated significantly with the oxygen tension in arterial blood/inspiratory oxygen fraction, the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, and the number of neutrophils in BALF, whereas MMP- 2 activity did not correlate at all with these factors. MMP- 9 activity correlated more closely with the pathological findings of DAD than did MMP- 2 activity. Strong MMP- 9 expression was observed in neutrophils, alveolar macrophages as well as alveolar lining epithelial cells. These results suggest that matrix metalloproteinase, which may derive from neutrophils recruited into airspaces, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of hyperoxic diffuse alveolar damage...|$|R
