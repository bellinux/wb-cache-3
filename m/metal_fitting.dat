25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed {{in the pocket}} of his topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E
25|$|Scabbard: The scabbard, {{also known}} as the sheath, is a {{protective}} cover often provided for the sword blade. Over the millennia, scabbards have been made of many materials, including leather, wood, and metals such as brass or steel. The <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> where the blade enters the leather or metal scabbard is called the throat, which is often part of a larger scabbard mount, or locket, that bears a carrying ring or stud to facilitate wearing the sword. The blade's point in leather scabbards is usually protected by a metal tip, or chape, which on both leather and metal scabbards is often given further protection from wear by an extension called a drag, or shoe.|$|E
2500|$|The smoking {{of opium}} {{does not involve}} the burning of the {{material}} as might be imagined. Rather, the prepared opium is indirectly heated to temperatures at which the active alkaloids, chiefly morphine, are vaporized. In the past, smokers would use a specially designed opium pipe which had a removable knob-like pipe-bowl of fired earthenware attached by a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> to a long, cylindrical stem. A small [...] "pill" [...] of opium {{about the size of}} a pea would be placed on the pipe-bowl, which was then heated by holding it over an opium lamp, a special oil lamp with a distinct funnel-like chimney to channel heat into a small area. The smoker would lie on his or her side in order to guide the pipe-bowl and the tiny pill of opium over the stream of heat rising from the chimney of the oil lamp and inhale the vaporized opium fumes as needed. Several pills of opium were smoked at a single session depending on the smoker's tolerance to the drug. The effects could last up to twelve hours.|$|E

2500|$|Paxes with {{elaborate}} metalwork framing an image {{in a medium}} that would withstand kissing and wiping are the sort that have been most likely to survive. Other objects that might {{seem to have had}} another purpose, such as plaquettes, ivory panels or small painted enamel plaques, may have been made for a pax. [...] Equally other objects began life as serving some other purpose, and were turned into paxes. Some still have a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> at the rear, either a handle or a slot for a long wooden handle to fit into (a few of these survive). Glass or rock crystal over an image below allowed the image to be kissed repeatedly but not damaged, and enamel also wore relatively well. [...] Carved shell and mother of pearl are sometimes used. [...] Even with a frame paxes are usually less than a foot high, and the images often 4 to 6 inches high.

5000|$|The {{vibration}} of the rod {{with greater}} amplitude and weaker pressure is transmitted into the <b>metal</b> <b>fitting.</b> This causes a {{transformation in the}} vibrations and {{the shape of the}} wave produced. The vibrations propagating through the metal have a high pressure and a weak amplitude. This amplification in pressure is the result of fiberglass cones that are fixed in a wood frame alongside a tall, cut-out metal part {{in the shape of a}} flame. [...] "Whiskers," [...] placed on the side of the instrument, amplify high-pitched sounds.|$|E

50|$|A {{cingulum}} militare was a {{piece of}} ancient Roman military equipment {{in the form of a}} belt decorated with <b>metal</b> <b>fittings,</b> which was worn as a badge of rank by soldiers and officials. Many examples were made in the Roman province of Pannonia.|$|R
5000|$|The {{configuration}} of the typical opium pipe consists of a long stem, a ceramic pipe-bowl, and a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> known as the [...] "saddle", through which the pipe-bowl plugs into the pipe-stem. The pipe-bowl must be detachable from the stem due to the necessity to remove the bowl and scrape its insides clean of opium ash after several pipes have been smoked. The stems of opium pipes were usually made from bamboo, but other materials such as ivory and silver were used. Pipe-bowls were typically a type of ceramic, such as blue and white porcelain. Sometimes opium pipe-bowls were carved from more valuable materials such as jade.|$|E

5000|$|Ball {{check valves}} are often very small, simple, and cheap. They are {{commonly}} used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet ball check valves with both balls and seats made of artificial ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{possible}} {{that not only}} Poles, but also other Slavs worn a halfshaven head.British franscescan Bartholomeus Anglicus in year 1235 wrote in his encyclopedia, that mostly all the Slavs, except Ruthenians and Slavs mixed with Germans and Latins, shave their heads. Bartholomeus, who lived in Magdeburg from several years know good the Slavic lands. By [...] "Slavic lands" [...] he meant the area from Saxonia to Ruthenia and from Dalmatia, Carinthia and Serbia to the Baltic Sea. About shaven heads, and dislike to beards, wrote also Saxo Grammaticus when writing about the temple of Arcona. He wrote that according to the common custom, only priests could grow long hair and beards. [...] In a Saxon manifesto against Slavic pagans from year 1108 is mentioned that Slavs simulated Saxons during the attack by wearing their scalps - Saxons grew long hair, so Polabian haircut {{had to be very}} different: very short. So, the custom of shaving hair, in 13th century recognised as Polish, has to have bigger dimensions. The existence of czupryna amongst the Polabian Slav territories is obviously testified by many archaeological discoveries. Are for example: little bronze statue for Schwedt/Oder (X-11th century), Altfriesack Götze, a wooden statue from Altfriesack (6th-7th century), sitting statue from Gatschow near Demmin (XI-12th century), a little sculpture from Merserburg near Leipzig (10th century). All the figures have short hair and halfshaven heads. There are also a <b>metal</b> <b>fitting</b> from museum in Oldburg and a wooden statue from Wolin (10th century). Because of the corrosion, it is difficult to say if heads are shaven, but the hair are surely short. The most clear proof are the Sachsenspiegel illustrations - all Wends on the illustrations (in contrast with long-haired Saxons) have a short haircut, shaved at the ear-height.|$|E

40|$|Glass or ceramic tubes {{out-of-round}} sealed effectively {{by ordinary}} O-rings in caps of modified hydraulic fittings. In typical connection, O-ring squeezed between two surfaces having inward-opening slants of 5 degrees or 10 degrees. Slanted surfaces force ring inward, compressing it around tube. Connector <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> tightened by hand around O-ring, seals O-ring against tube {{as much as}} 1 / 16 in. out of round.

40|$|A {{relatively}} impervious {{mechanical seal}} is formed between the outer {{surface of a}} tube and the inside surface of a mechanical fitting of a high pressure fluid or hydraulic system by applying a very thin soft metal layer onto the outer surface of the hard metal tube and/or inner surface of the hard <b>metal</b> <b>fitting,</b> prior to swaging the fitting onto the tube. The thickness of such thin metal layer is independent {{of the size of}} the tube and/or fittings. Many metals and alloys of those metals exhibit the requisite softness, including silver, gold, nickel, tin, platinum, indium, rhodium and cadmium. Suitably, the coating is about 0. 0025 millimeters (0. 10 mils) in thickness. After swaging, the tube and fitting combination exhibits very low leak rates on the order or 10. sup. - 8 cubic centimeters per second or less as meaured using the Helium leak test...|$|E
