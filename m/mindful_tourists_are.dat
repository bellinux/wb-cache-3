40|$|It {{has been}} propounded that {{tourists}} who are mindful {{are able to}} value and understand heritage sites better {{compared to those who}} are mindless. Mindfulness is a concept that helps tourist build interpretation that will enhance the quality of experience and create a sustainable connection between the tourists and the heritage sites. <b>Mindful</b> <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> tourists who are actively engaged with the interpretation of the heritage sites resulting in greater learning and understanding. Conversely, a mindless individual is an individual who follows a routine, pay limited attention to what he or she is doing and trapped in a rigid mindset. Past research, however does not indicate an availability of measures of mindfulness in tourism. Thus, this research aims to identify, construct and validate the measure of mindfulness in the context of heritage tourism. This research utilised the quantitative research method and is carried out in Penang, a destination listed under the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The item questions, to measure mindfulness were developed based on extensive review of past literature. Data were collected through the distribution of questionnaires to 150 local and international tourists. To generate the measure of mindfulness, factor analysis was conducted. Results revealed from the study suggested four distinct factors in measuring mindfulness, namely curiosity and attention, alertness, emotional engagement and openness and flexibility. These key findings derived from the study offer new insights in understanding and quantifying the concept of mindfulness and further improve the model of mindfulness for future application especially in heritage tourism...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{distinguishes between}} the {{concepts}} of socio-cognitive mindfulness applied {{in a number of}} tourism studies and meditative mindfulness derived from a Buddhist philosophy. An operational definition of meditative <b>mindful</b> <b>tourist</b> experiences <b>is</b> proposed based on forty-three semi-structured interviews involving 77 episodes of meditative mindful experiences. The paper also proposes a framework of meditative mindfulness in tourism. The framework identifies a number of antecedents to meditative mindful experience episodes and reveals several psychological and physical benefits including mental ease and response flexibility. This is the first paper to examine meditative <b>mindful</b> <b>tourist</b> experiences in tourism contexts and to explore their antecedents and consequences. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{tourists}} to heritage sites has increased tremendously {{in recent years}} and has contributed to the growth of the nation’s economy since heritage tourism has become the central focus of Malaysia’s attraction to outsiders especially after the declaration of Malacca and Penang as world heritage sites by UNESCO in 2008. When planned and managed effectively heritage tourism can realize positive impacts but when poorly managed heritage tourism can be devastating and causing damage to resources from inappropriate treatments and uncontrolled visitation. Therefore, this study intends to analyse how can effective interpretation provide by tour guide can create <b>mindful</b> <b>tourists</b> which <b>is</b> <b>tourist</b> who has greater learning, high satisfaction and more understanding in order to give positive impact to the heritage tourism. With the greater learning experience and knowledge gain by the tourist from the interpretation by the tour guide, they are able to understand the place more and tend to appreciate the place better as they are able to distinguish their actions that may have impact at the heritage sites hence the heritage can be conserved...|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{destinations}} {{should be}} planned {{and designed to}} play a role in enhancing the state of mindfulness among visitors. Mindfulness refers to a state of mind of visitors who are actively engaged with the surroundings in processing information and is associated with greater learning and satisfaction. This paper will suggest how tourism destinations can be promoted and can enhance visitors’ positive attitudes, appreciation and empathy towards the sites they visit. Ultimately, mindfulness can induce them to develop a sense of attachment and stewardship towards the conservation of the places they visit. Learning theories and communication factors will be used to formulate a strategic perspective for the mindfulness approach to result in creating tourists with more knowledge, satisfaction and a higher level of understanding and interpretation towards the Lenggong Valley. In the final analysis, this paper assesses the challenges and processes of how tourism products, as in the case of the Lenggong Valley archaeological sites, can be narrated, interpreted and presented in a manner which can inculcate <b>mindful</b> <b>tourists</b> and induce them, in turn, to assist in the promotion of sustainable tourism in the area...|$|R

40|$|Mindfulness is {{the ability}} of an {{individual}} to actively process information surrounding them with the aim of using that information to draw distinctive or novel conclusions. By facilitating mindfulness, businesses can benefit from having a stronger competitive advantage, increased loyalty, and provide a more meaningful experience to their customers. Mindfulness is a state of awareness that can be encouraged in individuals regardless of their mental state or demographic characteristics; almost a universal tool to enhance individuals 2 ̆ 7 memories and well-being. Mindfulness literature relating to tourism is brief and often has considered individual sites from a quantitative perspective. In efforts to reduce this gap, a qualitative study was conducted, interviewing tourism business managers throughout Dubai to obtain their insights. The emerging themes facilitated the generation of a model providing an alternative perspective to Moscardo 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) model by placing the impetus of creating mindfulness on the individual and the provision of personal interactions. The model additionally stressed the importance of stimulating <b>mindful</b> <b>tourists,</b> in order to allow businesses to benefit from a combination of hard, financial, benefits and soft, experiential, benefits.

40|$|Local {{residents}} in tourism communities are observers {{of those who}} gaze at them. This research extends host gaze studies using an emic approach.

The young Tibetans viewing tourists in these three different settings have different economic and social backgrounds. They also have different degrees of exposure to tourists. The study offers baseline information on how <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> differently understood within Tibet across nationality differences. It was demonstrated that three different groups of young Tibetans variously use ethnic origins, travel and transport arrangement, and how <b>tourists</b> <b>are</b> hosted to develop their different classifications. Tolerance towards most types of <b>tourists</b> <b>is</b> high, though it varies subtly for different groups. These core perspectives can be helpful in establishing not only how Tibetan tourism is viewed but also how it can be managed and developed in the future...|$|R
