5|$|Yttrium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role, {{though it is}} found in most, if not all, organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. Normally, as little as 0.5milligrams {{is found in the}} entire human body; human breast milk contains 4ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20ppm and 100ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> 700ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to {{the happy}} couple, plot and scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Swan turned {{professional}} with Leeds United in August 1984, having impressed {{those at}} the club so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> earn comparisons to John Charles. Gary Speed was his boot boy. He was not utilised by Eddie Gray, but instead made his debut as a forward under Billy Bremner on 14 October 1985, in a Full Members Cup defeat to Manchester City at Maine Road. He won his first Football League start on 1 January 1986, playing alongside Neil Aspin in a Second Division fixture against Oldham Athletic. His first two senior goals came in a 4–0 win against Stoke City on 1 February, both were headers from John Stiles crosses. He finished the 1984–85 season with three goals in sixteen games.|$|E

25|$|Spencer {{followed}} Comte in {{aiming for}} the unification of scientific truth; {{it was in this}} sense that his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, the idea that the laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the inorganic, and to the human mind as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held {{that it was possible to}} discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man.|$|E

25|$|Spencer first {{articulated}} his evolutionary {{perspective in}} his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's Westminster Review in 1857, and which later {{formed the basis}} of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'The Theory of Life' – itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturphilosophie – with a generalisation of von Baer's law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while being accompanied by a process of greater integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be found at work, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, that was applying to the stars and the galaxies as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> biological organisms, and to human social organisation as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only by its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle.|$|E

Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|Muzaffar Shah {{was invited}} {{by the people}} in the north of the {{peninsula}} to become their ruler, establishing the Sultanate of Perak. Meanwhile, Mahmud Shah's other son, Alauddin succeeded his father and established the Sultanate of Johor. Malacca was later conquered by the Dutch in a joint military campaign in January 1641. The Portuguese fortress, however, did not fall to the force of Dutch or Johorean arms as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> famine and disease that had brutally decimated the surviving population. As a result of mutual agreement between the Dutch and Johor earlier in 1606, Malacca was handed over to the Dutch.|$|E

25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences {{between the military and}} civilian societies. This view claims to explain <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> why the military has been or may be used to press ahead of society's norms. This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E
25|$|Tensions soon arose {{between the}} two parties. Batticaloa was the {{traditional}} port of the Kandyan kingdom (Trincomalee had long been lost, first to the Jaffna kingdom {{and then to the}} Portuguese), and Rajasingha was eager to acquire it as soon as possible. The Dutch, however, demurred, demanding full payment for their assistance in displacing the Portuguese. Despite a rising suspicion that the Dutch were not in Sri Lanka to expel the Portuguese, so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> replace them, the alliance was one that was too valuable for Rajasingha to simply cancel, and joint Dutch–Kandyan efforts resulted in the seizure of Galle on 13 March 1640 and the restriction of Portuguese power to the west coast of Sri Lanka by 1641.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999 the Board of Alderman {{selected}} Sansone Development over Landside Resources for redevelopment of McKnight and Manchester. In October Sansone {{withdrew from}} the project. Sansone told Rock Hill later that year it wanted to scale back the development area from 25 acres to 16, just the northwest corner. After the city reopening the bid process Rock Hill agreed in April 2000 to allow Sansone to develop 16 acres, financed by up to $7 million in tax-increment financing. Sansone withdrew its proposal again in September 2000 citing city delays that meant surrounding development projects had progressed so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> make the 16-acre proposal infeasible. The city re-bid the projects and received 40-acre plans from Regency Realty and THF Realty and an additional 25-acre plan from Regency. In April 2001 both developers retracted their bids amid a firestorm of resident opposition against the proposals.|$|E

25|$|During the {{celebrations}} of Indonesia's {{independence from the}} Netherlands on 17 August 1964, President of Indonesia Sukarno declared that the year to come would be a 'Year of Dangerous Living.' This was meant to signal his intent upon stepping up the ongoing Confrontation with Malaysia so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> toe the line of a powerful Anglo-Malaysian military response. Unbeknownst to his people or the Malaysians and their allies, however, Sukarno meant {{to follow through with}} his statement, and had planned a series of air and seaborne attacks against the Malaysian peninsula, an overtly aggressive act in what had been so far a conflict contained to northern Borneo. Though this was a risky move, it had a chance of capitalizing upon recent unrest in Malaya and Singapore by putting Indonesian soldiers and sympathizers inside Malaysian territory, where they could attempt to raise the populace against a very new government to whom they owed little loyalty.|$|E

500|$|The Musical Times {{noted that}} Sullivan's tunes, {{at least in}} the comic operas, appeal to the {{professional}} as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> the layman: his continental contemporaries such as Saint-Saëns and the Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick held the Savoy operas in high regard. Hughes writes, [...] "When Sullivan wrote what we call 'a good tune' it was nearly always 'good music' as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said." [...] Although his melodies sprang from rhythm, some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the summer}} siege, illness {{spread through the}} British camps. [...] In August, Wolfe himself was bedridden, causing already low morale to slump even further among the British troops. With many men in camp hospitals, British {{fighting}} numbers were thinned, and Wolfe personally felt that a new attack was needed {{by the end of}} September, or Britain's opportunity would be lost. In addition, his frustration with Montcalm's defensive stance continued to grow. In a letter to his mother, Wolfe wrote, [...] "The Marquis of Montcalm is {{at the head of a}} great number of bad soldiers, and I am at the head of a small number of good ones that wish for nothing so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> fight him; but the wary old fellow avoids an action, doubtful of the behaviour of his army." [...] Montcalm also expressed frustration over the long siege, relating that he and his troops slept clothed and booted, and his horse was always saddled in preparation for an attack.|$|E
500|$|As {{subsequent}} Conciliation Bills were introduced, WSPU leaders {{advocated a}} halt to militant tactics. In March 1912 the second bill was in jeopardy and Pankhurst joined a fresh outbreak of window-smashing. Extensive property damage led police to raid the WSPU offices. Pankhurst and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of conspiracy to commit property damage. Christabel, who by 1912 was the chief coordinator for the organisation, was also wanted by police. She fled to Paris, where she directed WSPU strategy in exile. Inside Holloway Prison Emmeline Pankhurst staged her first hunger strike to improve conditions for other suffragettes in nearby cells; she was quickly joined by Pethick-Lawrence and other WSPU members. She described in her autobiography the trauma caused by force-feeding during the strike: [...] "Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office." [...] When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst raised a clay jug {{over her head and}} announced: [...] "If any of you dares so <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "ship portrait" [...] had a {{long history}} in {{maritime}} art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. [...] The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or [...] "plats", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during King Henry's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations.|$|E
