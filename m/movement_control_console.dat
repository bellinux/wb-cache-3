40|$|We {{present a}} study {{exploring}} upper body 3 D spatial interaction metaphors for control and communication with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) {{such as the}} Parrot AR Drone. We discuss the design and implementation of five interaction techniques using the Microsoft Kinect, based on metaphors inspired by UAVs, to support a variety of flying operations a UAV can perform. Techniques include a first-person interaction metaphor where a user takes a pose like a winged aircraft, a game controller metaphor, where a user’s hands mimic the <b>control</b> <b>movements</b> of <b>console</b> joysticks, “proxy ” manipulation, where the user imagines manipulating the UAV {{as if it were}} in their grasp, and a pointing metaphor in which the user assumes the identity of a monarch and commands the UAV as such. We examine qualitative metrics such as perceived intuition, usability and satisfaction, among others. Our results indicate that novice users appreciate certain 3 D spatial techniques over the smartphone application bundled with the AR Drone. We also discuss the trade-offs in the technique design metrics based on results from our study...|$|R
50|$|The <b>control</b> <b>console</b> {{is made up}} {{of three}} {{different}} but similar parts, to follow Italian, Austrian and German laws. <b>Movement</b> <b>controls</b> are duplicated on both the left and right, and monitors for security systems of both Germany and Italy are present. Moreover, on the right side a third monitor is used for operation in Germany, where the main direction of travel on multiple track lines is the opposite from that of Italy. An on-board computer chooses the active controls, giving priority to one or another based on the electric frequency. The cabs are connected by a corridor, and have climate controls, while in the central body of the locomotive all the technical equipment that can be reached easily from the corridor are placed. The whole electric and electronic systems have a self-control system.|$|R
