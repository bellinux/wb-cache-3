40|$|This book {{documents}} {{the biology of}} six species of New World quails that are native to North America north of Mexico (mountain, scaled, Gambel’s, California, and <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quails,</b> and the northern bobwhite), three introduced Old World partridges (chukar, Himalayan snowcock, and gray partridge), and the introduced common (ring-necked) pheasant. Collectively, quails, partridges, and pheasants range throughout all of the continental United States and the Canadian provinces. Two of the species, the northern bobwhite and ring-necked pheasant, are the most economically important of all North American upland game birds. All of the species are hunted extensively for sport and are highly popular with naturalists, birders, and other outdoor enthusiasts. The New World quails and Old World partridges share many basic aspects of social and reproductive behavior, such as gathering during nonbreeding periods into small, usually closely related coveys. They also all exhibit prolonged monogamous pair-bonding, biparental brood care, reduced sexual dimorphism in adult plumages and body mass, and a high diversity of vocalizations associated with covey, family, and pair interactions. As relatively small species with high mortality rates, they have evolved rapid periods to sexual maturity, unusually large clutch sizes that are among the largest of all birds, and pairings that regularly attempt to renest following nest failures. By comparison, the ring-necked pheasant {{is one of the}} Old World pheasants, who form less cohesive and less tightly structured flocks and have evolved nonmonogamous (polygynous or promiscuous) breeding strategies. Adult pheasants exhibit strong sexual dimorphism in plumage, body mass, and sexual behavior. Adult males have sharp tarsal spurs that are used during fights when establishing dominance status, and they perform some of the most spectacular sexual advertisement displays of all birds. Clutch sizes average considerably smaller than those of quails and partridges, whereas brooding durations and durations to sexual maturity are longer. The book totals more than 85, 000 words, and includes about 1, 100 literature citations, 29 pages of drawings, 27 photos, and 11 maps. Together with an earlier volume on grouse, it completes a survey of the biology and behavior of all 19 native and introduced species of North American quails, partridges, and pheasants. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|Like most {{birds of}} its order, the <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> {{is a popular}} game bird.

40|$|Changes in piñon-juniper (Pinus spp., Juniperus spp.) {{communities}} across the southwestern United States have often decreased ecological diversity of the understory and increases of exotic species. Reconstructing age and establishment patterns provides essential understanding to guide treatments and management for anthropogenically-altered forests. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine how patterns of piñon and juniper growth in the Davis Mountains, Texas, varied over time and how this pattern influenced wildlife habitat of several indicator species. Establishment patterns and basal area growth progression were identified, canopy cover estimates regressed from pre-developed canopy regression equations to re-construct historic forest stand structure and canopy characteristics in twenty year intervals and applied to known wildlife habitat requirements of <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> (Cyrtonyx montezumae), black bear (Ursus americanus) and White-tailed deer/Mule deer (Odocoileus virginianus / O. hemionus). The sites provided habitat for these wildlife species, but the specific habitat provided changed over time. Prescribed burning could promote better forage for black bear while fire exclusion could improve dense cover for escape and denning cover. <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> would use thinner, less-dense habitats for forage, loafing and escape cover and the denser stand dynamics for cover and shelter. If forage habitat for <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> is required, the more open habitats found in the early 1900 ’s could be re-established by prescribed burning and tree removal. Habitat for White-tailed deer transitioned from more open forage, loafing, fawning cover in the early 1900 ’s to denser thermal, and escape cover in the later 1900 ’s. Mule deer habitat transitioned from a preferred open habitat to a more dense cover habitat that would be utilized primarily for bedding. Prescribed burning and tree removal to open up the current habitat would benefit Mule deer and white-tailed deer to a lesser degree...|$|E

40|$|<b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> (Cyrtonix montezumae) {{life history}} is the least {{understood}} of all North American quail due to historical difficulties in capturing and monitoring marked individuals of this species. Most aspects of its population dynamics, range and habitat use have remained as knowledge gaps until now. My study overcame these difficulties and I was able to trap and monitor 88 individuals from 2008 ? 2010 at 3 study sites in southeast Arizona. Techniques for trapping and monitoring included the use of trained pointing dogs, hoop nets, funnel traps, and forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras. I estimated survival probabilities as well as range size for radio-marked individuals. The estimated survival, using the Kaplan-Meier staggered entry method, combined amongst 3 study sties, was 21. 9 % from fall 2008 ? 2009. Survival for quail at the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch in 2010 was 4. 8 %. For range estimation, I used the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and fixed kernel estimators. The largest MCP range estimate for an individual (206. 65 ha) was far greater than previous estimates reported for this species in the literature. The mean seasonal range size, using the fixed kernel 95 % utilization distribution, also was 60 % higher at Stevens Canyon, 63 % higher at Hog Canyon, and 47 % higher at the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch than the largest use area (50 ha) reported in the literature. A wildfire in 2009 provided an opportunity to examine post-fire succession and habitat use. I observed roosting in fire-affected areas within 1 week post-fire and successful nesting in fire-affected areas within 3 months post-fire. Low survival and reduced 95 % fixed kernel ranges for quail at the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch in 2010 was attributed to strong El Ni?o conditions in the Pacific that brought a severe winter storm to the region. The combined results from this research help to address knowledge gaps about <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail</b> survival demographics, range, habitat use, and provide references to baseline data to assist managing potential impacts associated with stochastic events such as wildfire and periods of inclement weather associated with above average winter precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The human diet {{consists}} of a great diversity of foods in where the most common source of protein comes from animals; mainly from fattening species of pigs, beef, chickens, and sheep due to intensive farming high fat content. The current study was aimed to evaluate the meat analysis of four species of wild quail breasts: Common quail, Banded quail, scaled or Squamous quail and <b>Montezuma</b> <b>quail.</b> Quails were collected from March to June, in the State of Mexico. The findings showed that of the studied species, the meat of Moctezuma had {{the greatest amount of}} protein (26. 99 %DM); however, the lowest fat content (1. 25 %DM) was with Squamos. Up to the time of this investigation, no data existed on the nutritional qualities of meat coming from these wild species in the State of Mexico. As we now know, this meat has better attributes, compared even to rabbit meat and to the meat of other domestic species that are consumed on a daily basis. It was concluded that the carcasses protein and dry matter contents were similar with all studied species where fat content of the Callipepla squamata had the highest value...|$|E
40|$|We used 19 {{bioclimatic}} variables, five {{species distribution}} modeling (SDM) algorithms, four general circulation models, and two climate scenarios (2050 and 2070) to model nine bird species. Identified as Species of Concern (SOC), we highlighted these birds: Northern/Masked Bobwhite Quail (Colinus virginianus), Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata), Pinyon Jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus), Juniper Titmouse (Baeolophus ridgwayi), Mexican Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis lucida), Cassin’s Sparrow (Peucaea cassinii), Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus), <b>Montezuma</b> <b>Quail</b> (Cyrtonyx montezumae), and White-tailed Ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus). The Generalized Linear Model, Random Forest, Boosted Regression Tree, Maxent, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and an ensemble model {{were used to}} identify present day core bioclimatic-envelopes for the species. We then projected future distributions of suitable climatic conditions for the species using data derived from four climate models run according to two greenhouse gas Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2. 6 and 8. 5). Our models predicted changes in suitable bioclimatic-envelopes for all species for the years 2050 and 2070. Among the nine species of birds, the quails {{were found to be}} highly susceptible to climate change and appeared to be of most future conservation concern. The White-tailed Ptarmigan would lose about 62 % of its suitable climatic habitat by 2050 and 67 % by 2070. Among the species distribution models (SDMs), the Boosted Regression Tree model consistently performed fairly well based on Area Under the Curve (AUC range: 0. 89 to 0. 97) values.
