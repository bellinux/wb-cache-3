"I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following <b>my</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2006, Robert Novak {{posted a}} column titled [...] "My Role in the Valerie Plame Leak Story": [...] "Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has {{informed}} my attorneys that, after two and one-half years, his {{investigation of the}} CIA leak case concerning matters directly relating to me has been concluded. That frees me to reveal my role in the federal inquiry that, {{at the request of}} Fitzgerald, I have kept secret." [...] Novak dispels rumors that he asserted his Fifth Amendment right and made a plea bargain, stating: [...] "I have cooperated in the investigation." [...] He continues: For nearly the entire time of his investigation, Fitzgerald knew — independent of me — the identity of the sources I used in my column of July 14, 2003. That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.... In my sworn testimony, I said what I have contended in my columns and on television: Joe Wilson's wife's role in instituting her husband's mission was revealed to me {{in the middle of a}} long interview with an official who I have previously said was not a political gunslinger. After the federal investigation was announced, he told me through a third party that the disclosure was inadvertent on his part. Following <b>my</b> <b>interview</b> <b>with</b> the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame's name from Joe Wilson's entry in [...] "Who's Who in America." [...] (Italics added.) Harlow is the person whom Novak refers to as his [...] "CIA source" [...] for his column [...] "Mission to Niger".|$|E

40|$|Of all the {{countries}} studied in the large-scale WHO Multi-country Study on Women´s Health and Domestic Violence against Women (2005), Ethiopian women had the highest numbers of acceptance of intimate partner violence. And according to previous research on the subject, Ethiopian women have a high tolerance for and acceptance of the violence they endure. Yet when I interviewed women in Ethiopia (all {{of whom had been}} victims of violence) I discovered multiple forms of resistance to - rather than acceptance of - violence. Rather than confirming how women come to accept violence, my study uncovers many ways in which women resist violence, even in contexts where the available means of resistance are extremely limited. The aim of my inductive study is to begin to do justice to these forms of resistance, which are easily overlooked. First, as I argue in the analyses of <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>with</b> the women, our ability to discern forms of resistance in situations of intimate partner violence requires a more capacious notion of resistance than the one usually employed. Second, as I argue through my engagement with the previous research and the analyses of <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>with</b> women’s organizations in Ethiopia, the inability to discern multiple and varied forms of resistance leads one to underestimate the degree of non-acceptance and active resistance in situations of intimate partner violence. Thus, while my limited study does not permit general conclusions about violence against women in Ethiopia, I conclude by suggesting that my findings have two important implications for social work, one theoretical and one practical...|$|R

40|$|Mid-Twentieth Century Modern Dance in the Twenty-First CenturyThe {{relevance}} of modern dance being performed today {{has been a}} growing topic in the dance field as legacy companies age and the field of contemporary dance continues to expand. This thesis begins with critical response to mid-century modern dance {{in the work of}} well-known dance critics John Martin, Edwin Denby and Louis Horst and how they substantiated modern dance’s place in dance history. <b>My</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>with</b> dance critics Alastair Macaulay and Sarah Kaufman discuss how the intention of dance writing has changed over the years and I examine the impact that some of those changes may have had on the state of modern dance in America today. I also discuss <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> <b>with</b> artistic directors of the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Limón Dance Company. I examine their ideas about finding unique approaches to engage and grow a newer, younger audience while maintaining a connection with their current fan base. They attempt to combat what some critics have identified as mid-century modern dance losing relevance with today’s dance audience. My research inspired a concert presentation on April 25, 2017, involving my restaging of a mid-century modern dance masterpiece in tandem with a premiere of my own choreography inspired by the same themes. This product is my response to contextualizing older work andgiving the audience a reference point for understanding new choreography. The final aspect of this paper explains my creative process of how I put the ideas of critics and artistic directors into action. I discuss restaging and choreographing through the inspiration of <b>my</b> <b>interviews</b> and research and how that work provided ideas which enabled me to build an evening of work to better engage an audience with mid-century modern dance and contemporary choreography...|$|R
