Four types of masonry were investigated and subjected to ordinary compressive tests orthogonally to the <b>mortar</b> <b>beds</b> and along the directions of the <b>mortar</b> <b>beds.</b> The experimental campaign confirmed the possibility of using an orthotropic plate model for {{prediction of}} the Poisson's ratio and Young modulus along the diagonal direction of infills (these parameters are requested by a model already known in the literature for the identification of struts equivalent to masonry infills). The experimental campaign made it possible to recognise a correlation between the Poisson's ratios and the strengths of masonries investigated along the orthotropic axes and to obtain the diagonal Poisson's ratio without specific experimental tests. Finally, the experimental responses of some infilled frames were used to test the reliability of the model proposed here. © 2013 RILEM...|$|R

50|$|Bricks, stone blocks, {{and other}} masonry units are {{typically}} laid {{in a bed}} of mortar. The process of placing a masonry unit in a <b>mortar</b> <b>bed</b> causes the mortar to be extruded between units. This excess mortar is cleared and shaped before the mortar hardens. In some cases, the bedding mortar {{is meant to be}} seen and the mortar joint is immediately given a finish profile. In other cases, especially where the mortar is pigmented, the bedding mortar is removed from the joint before it hardens (usually a depth that averages about one inch), and then pointing mortar is applied in the void and shaped with a finish profile.|$|E

50|$|Block cores are {{typically}} tapered {{so that the}} top surface of the block (as laid) has a greater surface on which to spread a <b>mortar</b> <b>bed</b> and for easier handling. Most CMU's have two cores, but three- and four-core units are also produced. A core also allows for the insertion of steel reinforcement, tying individual blocks together in the assembly, {{with the goal of}} greatly increased strength. To hold the reinforcement in proper position and to bond the block to the reinforcement, the cores must be filled with grout (concrete). Reinforcement is primarily used to impart greater tensile strength to the assembly, improving its ability to resist lateral forces such as wind load and seismic forces.|$|E

50|$|Roman mosaics are {{constructed}} from geometrical blocks called tesserae, placed {{together to create}} the shapes of figures, motifs and patterns. Materials for tesserae were obtained from local sources of natural stone, with the additions of cut brick, tile and pottery creating coloured shades of, predominantly, blue, black, red, white and yellow. Polychrome patterns were most common, but monochrome examples are known. Marble and glass were occasionally used as tesserae, as were small pebbles, and precious metals like gold. Mosaic decoration was not just confined to floors but featured on walls and vaults as well. Traces of guidelines have been found beneath some mosaics, either scored into or painted onto the <b>mortar</b> <b>bedding.</b> The design might also be pegged out in string, or mounted in a wooden frame.|$|R
50|$|The thick bed mortar {{method has}} been around for hundreds, if not {{thousands}} of years. Historically, a sand/cement mixture was mixed with water to a fairly dry consistency and was spread on either a portland cement water paste (neat cement), or over cement powder spread on the surface which is then sprayed with water to create a slurry coat and spread over the surface. The thick bed mortar would then be compacted and screeded (made flat and/or level) prior to installation of tile or stone. As the slurry coat dried it would bond the <b>mortar</b> <b>bed</b> to the concrete surface on which it was installed. Mortar beds were used underneath almost every tile or stone installation until the late 1950s when a chemical engineer, Henry M. Rothberg, invented the technology which introduced latex to sand/cement mortar mixes, and created a new industry based on thin bed adhesive installations by founding Laticrete International, Inc.|$|E

5000|$|Inexperienced homebuilders should {{experiment}} {{with a number}} of practice walls. This will ultimately expedite the building process and provide more satisfying results. When experimenting with M-I-M, (the more common form), two parallel 3 to 4 inch beads of mortar are laid down along the foundation, followed by a middle filling of insulation material. Then logs are laid on top with consistent mortar gaps, protruding no more than 1 inch on the inside and outside of the wall. Actual placement will depend on the size and shapes of the logs. Another layer of mortar is spread, then insulation poured in between, more logs follow and so on. When experimenting with Throughwall, a thin, even layer of insulative mortar is laid along the foundation, then the logs are seated firmly in the <b>mortar</b> <b>bed,</b> in an even fashion, leaving only enough space between them to [...] "point" [...] the mortar. The mortar gaps are filled to make a relatively flat top surface, then another thin layer of mortar is added and the process repeats. The shape and exterior orientation of logs is important only for appearance. Pre-split “firewood style” logs check less when in the wall and are easier to point or smooth and press evenly around than round pieces because the mortar gaps are generally smaller.|$|E
5000|$|LATICRETE {{was founded}} in 1956 by Dr. Henry M. Rothberg, a {{chemical}} engineer. Realizing that the installation methods used for tile and stone were outdated, Dr. Rothberg began a research and development program in partnership with Uniroyal Chemical in Naugatuck, Connecticut. The program led {{to the introduction of}} latex to traditional Portland cement-based mortar, resulting in a lighter, more flexible system for installing tile and stone products. This research became the foundation for the [...] "thin-bed" [...] method of installing tile and stone. The thin-bed method involves the application of thin-set adhesive mortars, a product of the research, with a notched trowel.

5000|$|Pathfinder Dam is {{composed}} of granite blocks, quarried from the same stone that forms the river's canyon. With Buffalo Bill Dam, its contemporary, Pathfinder Dam was intended to irrigate semi-arid lands in Wyoming. Buffalo Bill Dam, however, is of concrete construction, owing to its location within 7 mi from the railroad, while Pathfinder Dam is about 45 mi from the nearest railroad. Freight took {{at least three days}} to cover the distance, and once took 76 days. [...] Transportation of cement in barrels was not feasible by horse-drawn wagon, so the dam was built of quarried stone. The dam was faced with stones between 24 in and 36 in thick, laid in a 2 in thick <b>mortar</b> <b>bed.</b> Between these facings was a core of irregularly-shaped granite blocks of up to ten tons in weight, bedded in mortar and quarry tailings. The diversion tunnel was adapted to become the dam's outlet works. Construction costs were $2.5 million in 1909. An auxiliary dike, 38 ft high, extends to the south of the dam. It is an earthfill structure with a concrete corewall. A natural channel was enlarged and straightened to form an uncontrolled spillway {{on the north side of}} the dam.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{finite element}} studies of one-way out-of-plane failure of unreinforced masonry walls under static loading. The studies are early {{steps in the}} development of a method that will be applicable to two-way out-of-plane failure of walls under dynamic loading. The approach is based on a discrete-crack approach, where <b>mortar</b> <b>beds</b> are modelled using contact-interface elements, and masonry blocks are represented as assemblies of elastic eight-node elements. Predictions of the method are compared with published theoretical and experimental results, showing very good agreement with theory and reasonable agreement with experiment, considering uncertainties in boundary conditions and other factors.
