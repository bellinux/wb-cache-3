40|$|Flattened leaf {{architecture}} {{is not a}} default state but depends on positional information to precisely coordinate patterns of cell division in the growing primordium. This information is provided, in part, by {{the boundary between the}} adaxial (top) and abaxial (bottom) domains of the leaf, which are specified via an intricate gene regulatory network whose precise circuitry remains poorly defined. Here, we examined the contribution of the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES (AS) pathway to adaxial-abaxial patterning in Arabidopsis thaliana and demonstrate that AS 1 -AS 2 affects this process via multiple, distinct regulatory mechanisms. AS 1 -AS 2 uses Polycomb-dependent and -independent mechanisms to directly repress the abaxial determinants MIR 166 A, YABBY 5, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF 3), as well as a nonrepressive mechanism in the regulation of the adaxial determinant TAS 3 A. These regulatory interactions, together with data from prior studies, lead to a model in which the sequential polarization of determinants, including AS 1 -AS 2, explains the establishment and maintenance of adaxial-abaxial leaf polarity. Moreover, our analyses show that the shared repression of ARF 3 by the AS and trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-siRNA) pathways intersects with additional AS 1 -AS 2 targets to affect multiple nodes in leaf development, impacting polarity as well as leaf complexity.

40|$|Listeriolysin O (LLO) is a pore-forming toxin of the cholesterol-dependent {{cytolysin}} (CDC) {{family and}} a primary virulence factor of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. LLO mediates rupture of phagosomal membranes, thereby releasing bacteria into the growth-permissive host cell cytosol. Several unique features of LLO allow its activity to be precisely regulated {{in order to facilitate}} phagosomal escape, intracellular growth, and cell-to-cell spread. To improve our understanding of the <b>multifaceted</b> <b>contribution</b> of LLO to the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes, we developed a screen that combined saturation mutagenesis and signature tags, termed in vivo analysis by saturation mutagenesis and signature tags (IVASS). We generated a library of LLO mutant strains, each harboring a single amino acid substitution and a signature tag, by using the previously described pPL 2 integration vector. The signature tags acted as molecular barcodes, enabling high-throughput, parallel analysis of 40 mutants in a single animal and identification of attenuated mutants by negative selection. Using the IVASS technique we were able to screen over 90 % of the 505 amino acids present in LLO and identified 60 attenuated mutants. Of these, 39 LLO residues were previously uncharacterized and potentially revealed novel functions of the toxin during infection. The mutants that were subsequently analyzed in vivo each conferred a 2 - to 4 -orders of magnitude loss in virulence compared to wild type, thereby validating the screening methods. Phenotypic analysis of the LLO mutant library using common in vitro techniques suggested that the functional contributions of some residues could only have been revealed through in vivo analysis. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology...|$|E

Here we explore cellular reorganization associated with fusion pore expansion in syncytium formation using relatively simple experimental system. Fusion between murine embryonic fibroblasts NIH 3 T 3 -based cells is initiated on demand by well-characterized fusogen influenza virus hemagglutinin. We uncouple early fusion stages dependent on protein fusogens from subsequent fusion pore expansion stage and establish that the transition from local fusion to syncytium requires metabolic activity of living cells. Effective syncytium formation for cells with disorganized actin and microtubule cytoskeleton argues against hypothesis that cytoskeleton drives fusion expansion...|$|R

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is {{composed}} of a highly heterogeneous population of cells. Dynamic interactions between different compartments (neuronal, glial, and vascular systems) drive CNS function and allow to integrate and process information {{as well as to}} respond accordingly. Communication within this functional unit, coined the neuro-glio-vascular unit (NGVU), typically relies on two main mechanisms: direct cell-cell coupling via gap junction channels (GJCs) and paracrine communication via the extracellular compartment, two routes to which channels composed of transmembrane connexin (Cx) or pannexin (Panx) proteins can contribute. Multiple isoforms of both protein families are present in the CNS and each CNS cell type is characterized by a unique Cx/Panx portfolio. Over the last two decades, research has uncovered a multilevel platform via which Cxs and Panxs can influence different cellular functions within a tissue: (1) Cx GJCs enable a direct cell-cell communication of small molecules, (2) Cx hemichannels and Panx channels can contribute to autocrine/paracrine signaling pathways, and (3) different structural domains of these proteins allow for channel-independent functions, such as cell-cell adhesion, interactions with the cytoskeleton, and the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. In this paper, we discuss current knowledge on their <b>multifaceted</b> <b>contribution</b> to brain development and to specific processes in the NGVU, including synaptic transmission and plasticity, glial signaling, vasomotor control, and blood-brain barrier integrity in the mature CNS.

When the rigid Islamistic Mahdi {{regime in the}} Sudan was {{defeated}} by an Anglo-Egyptian army in 1898, H G Guinness and K Kumm came to Aswan and initiated the Sudan Pionier Mission (SPM) in 1900. The SPM had its spiritual roots in the Holiness Movement and became an interdenominational German-based faith mission. Although the SPM was started in Aswan to advance {{from there to the}} south to evangelize animistic people groups in the Eastern Sudan, the SPM actually consolidated its work in and around Aswan for internal and external reasons. Thus, the focus of the SPM shifted from an animistic to an Islamic audience with a special emphasis on the Nile-Nubians occupying the Nile valley between Aswan and Dongola. This study contributes generally to the historiography of the SPM between 1990 until 1966 and analyzes especially the development of the SPM into a mission among the Nile-Nubians during this period. The ethnic groups of the Nile-Nubians will be introduced and their historical, political, social, economic, linguistic and religious situation will be presented.

Behind-the-scenes studio production and recording footage of [...] "I Knew I Loved You" [...] can be viewed in the debut episode of the QuincyJones.com Podcast. The lyric, as with Morricones Love Affair, had been written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Morricones acceptance speech was in his native Italian tongue and was interpreted by Clint Eastwood, who stood to his left. Eastwood and Morricone had in fact met two days earlier {{for the first time in}} 40 years at a reception.|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most prevalent invasive malignancy with metastatic potential. The epidermis is exposed {{to a variety of}} environmental DNA-damaging chemicals, principal among which are polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) ubiquitous in the environment, tobacco smoke, and broiled meats. Langerhans cells (LC) comprise a network of dendritic cells situated adjacent to basal, suprabasal, and follicular infundibular keratinocytes that when mutated can give rise to SCC, and LC-intact mice are markedly more susceptible than LC-deficient mice to chemical carcinogenesis provoked by initiation with the model PAH, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). LC rapidly internalize and depot DMBA as numerous membrane-independent cytoplasmic foci. Repopulation of LC-deficient mice using fetal liver LC-precursors restores DMBA-induced tumor susceptibility. LC expression of p 450 enzyme CYP 1 B 1 is required for maximal rapid induction of DNA-damage within adjacent keratinocytes and their efficient neoplastic transformation; however, effects of tumor progression also attributable to the presence of LC were revealed as CYP 1 B 1 -independent. Thus, LC make <b>multifaceted</b> <b>contributions</b> to cutaneous carcinogenesis, including via the handling and metabolism of chemical mutagens. Such findings suggest a cooperative carcinogenesis role for myeloid-derived cells resident within cancer susceptible epithelial tissues principally by influencing early events in malignant transformation...|$|R
