40|$|A data {{acquisition}} system was developed to measure various tractor performance parameters such as wheel forces, three-point linkage forces, drawbar force, PTO torque and ground speed. An electronic circuit was designed and fabricated to provide exact angular position measurement of the clevis bolts in the tractor wheels at any travel speed and scanning rate of the datalogger used. This measurement {{is found to be}} more accurate and reliable as compared to the measurement by the <b>marker</b> <b>pulse</b> of the optical shaft encoder, which is dependent on the datalogger scanning time. The force measurement from the clevis bolts combined with the angular position measurement gives the total horizontal and the vertical components of forces on the revolving wheel. An onboard datalogger was used to sample signals from the various transducers as well as the angular position measurement circuit in the system. The system was field tested for its performance and found to be accurate and reliable in measurement of tractor performance parameters...|$|E

Department of Energy (DOE) programs in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) and Stockpile Stewardship (SS). Optical streak cameras {{are an integral}} part of the experimental diagnostics instrumentation at NIF. To accurately reduce streak camera data a highly accurate temporal calibration is required. This article describes a technique for simultaneously generating a precise +/- 2 ps optical <b>marker</b> <b>pulse</b> (fiducial reference) and trains of precisely timed, short-duration optical pulses (so-called “comb” pulse trains) that are suitable for the timing calibrations. These optical pulse generators are used with the LLNL optical streak cameras. They are small, portable light sources that, in the comb mode, produce a series of temporally short, uniformly spaced optical pulses, using a laser diode source. Comb generators have been produced with pulse-train repetition rates up to 10 GHz at 780 nm, and somewhat lower frequencies at 664 nm. Individual pulses can be as short as 25 -ps FWHM. Signal output is via a fiber-optic connector on the front panel of the generator box. The optical signal is transported from comb generator to streak camera through multi-mode, graded-index optical fiber...|$|E

40|$|Context: Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D 3) {{improves}} vascular {{function and}} inflammation, potentially providing {{an explanation for}} the proposed cardiovascular protection of Vitamin D. Objective: We investigated whether cholecalciferol supplementation reduces postprandial arterial dysfunction and inflammation. Design: Randomized, 1 : 1, double-blind trial. Setting: Diabetes and Vascular Center, Franciscus Gasthuis, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients: Twenty-four healthy, premenopausal, overweight or obese, Vitamin D-deficient women. Interventions: A single high (300, 000 IU) or low dose (75, 000 IU) of cholecalciferol. Main Outcome Measures: The effect of low-and high-dose cholecalciferol on postprandial leukocyte activation <b>markers,</b> <b>pulse</b> wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (AIx) during an oral fat loading test, expressed as area under the curve (AUC). Results: High-and low-dose supplementation increased Vitamin D by 163 % 6 134 % (P, 0. 001) and 66 % 659 % (P, 0. 001), respectively. Monocyte CD 11 b-AUC slightly increased after low but not high dose (6 % 6 2 %, P = 0. 012, and 4 % 6 1 %, P = 0. 339, respectively). There were no significant effects on postprandial PWV or AIx by high-or low-dose Vitamin D. Fasting complement component 3 (C 3) levels decreased by 5. 9 % (P = 0. 004) in the high-dose group and by 4. 0 % (P = 0. 018) in the low-dose group. Conclusion: A single dose of Vitamin D does not seem to reduce arterial stiffness and leukocyte activation in overweight, Vitamin D-deficient women. Vitamin D may decrease fasting C 3. Possibly, higher Vitamin D concentrations may be needed to decrease inflammation and improve vascular function in overweight or obese Vitamin D-deficientwomen...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A new {{technique}} for assessing implanted cardiac pacemaker {{function in the}} ambulant patient has been introduced and assessed. A modified portable electrocardiograph recorder is used to store 24 hours of electrocardiograms along with marker pulses indicating the timing of pacemaker impulses. The recorder detects this narrow impulse and records a wider <b>marker</b> <b>pulse</b> on a second channel. The false positive detection rate was estimated from recordings, each of 24 hours, taken from 10 patients. All of these patients were ambulant and none had a cardiac pacemaker. There was on average less than one false positive per 24 hours. When similar recordings were taken {{from a group of}} 15 patients with pacemakers, the average false positive rate in 13 of these patients was also less than one per 24 hours. In the two other recordings artefacts resulted in false positive rates of 28 and 960 per 24 hours. Failure to detect pacemaker pulses was confirmed in only one patient. In addition to determining the accuracy of pacemaker pulse detection, the clinical usefulness of this technique was assessed. Two patients had fixed-rate pacemakers and 13 had demand pacemakers.

Drosophila neural progenitors (neuroblasts) {{have been an}} excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation, but quiescence remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by {{the establishment of a}} unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation <b>markers.</b> The <b>pulse</b> of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors. Furthermore, loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. DOI: 10. 7554 /eLife. 03363. 00...|$|R

40|$|Early {{vascular}} ageing {{is common}} in patients with hypertension and increased burden of cardiovascular risk factors, often influenced by chronic inflammation. One aspect of this vascular ageing is arterial stiffening, as measured by increased pulse wave velocity or augmentation index and central pressure. Several {{studies have indicated that}} this process starts early in life and that arterial function and ageing properties could be programmed during foetal life or influenced by adverse growth patterns in early postnatal life. This could explain the repeated findings in observational epidemiology that an inverse association exists between birth weight, adjusted for gestational age, and systolic blood pressure elevation in childhood, adolescence and adulthood, as well as for increased cardiovascular risk. One new <b>marker</b> of increased <b>pulse</b> pressure and arterial ageing is telomere length, as regulated by telomerase enzymatic activity.

Early identification of children at risk of treatment failure in the community and prompt referral could lower mortality. A number of clinical markers have been independently associated with oral antibiotic failure in childhood pneumonia. This study aimed to develop a prognostic model for fast-breathing pneumonia treatment failure in sub-Saharan Africa. We prospectively followed a cohort of children (2 - 59 months), diagnosed by community health workers with fast-breathing pneumonia using World Health Organisation (WHO) integrated community case management guidelines. Cases were followed at days 5 and 14 by study data collectors, who assessed a range of pre-determined clinical features for treatment outcome. We built the prognostic model using eight pre-defined parameters, using multivariable logistic regression, validated through bootstrapping. We assessed 1, 542 cases of which 769 were included (32 % ineligible; 19 % defaulted). The treatment failure rate was 15 % at day 5 and relapse was 4 % at day 14. Concurrent malaria diagnosis (OR: 1. 62; 95 % CI: 1. 06, 2. 47) and moderate malnutrition (OR: 1. 88; 95 % CI: 1. 09, 3. 26) were associated with treatment failure.

40|$|Pulse {{crops are}} leguminous plants whose grains are used {{exclusively}} for food. In Asia, Africa, and many developing countries, pulses constitute {{a major source}} of dietary protein and extensive efforts are being undertaken to improve pulse production. However, due to global climate change, abiotic stresses are increasingly impeding crop production. Conventional plant breeding has contributed tremendously to the development of improved crop varieties, but other biotechnological tools are needed to complement breeding efforts to accelerate development of pulse crop varieties tolerant to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, and high and low temperatures. Genomics resources such as molecular markers have started to expedite marker-assisted breeding and quantitative trait loci (QTL) introgression in chickpea for drought tolerance. Similarly, transcriptomic resources such as expressed sequence tags and expression profiling such as microarrays also contribute to further understand abiotic stress tolerance in pulses and for the development of genic <b>markers.</b> In <b>pulse</b> crops, development of in vitro regeneration techniques and transgenics has been slow and more resources need to be allocated to expedite their development. In vitro regeneration techniques are also useful for embryo rescue of wide hybrids. Transgenics, although controversial, offer a faster means to develop abiotic stress-tolerant pulse crops. While enhancement of abiotic stress tolerance in pulse crops implies higher returns in the developed countries, in developing countries it will contribute to food and nutritional security and sustainable production. It is therefore encouraging that ICARDA, ICRISAT, and CGIAR (Generation Challenge Programme) invest extensively into using new technologies for improvement of pulse crops in these regions of low-input farming...|$|R

If the fish is lined up with the field, both sides of the fish are stimulated equally in amplitude and the direction of the signals. When the electric field turns to the fish’s left, receptors on the left side will be more strongly stimulated with perpendicular signals on the fish’s left side while the receptors on the right side would receive a weaker stimulus. The fish will turn {{to the side of the}} stronger stimulus. Using the receptors, the fish can detect field and orient itself to the electric field to follow the electric field and locate its source.|$|R

40|$|Model order {{reduction}} {{methods have}} proved to be an important technique for accelerating time-domain simulation in a variety of computer-aided design tools. In this study we present several new techniques for model reduction of the large-scale linear and nonlinear systems. First, we present a method for nonlinear system reduction based on a combination of the trajectory piecewise-linear (TPWL) method with truncated-balanced realizations (TBR). We analyze the stability characteristics of this combined method using perturbation theory. Second, we describe a linear reduction method that approximates TBR model reduction and takes advantage of sparsity of the system matrices or available accelerated solvers. This method is based on AISIAD (approximate implicit subspace iteration with alternate directions) and uses low-rank approximations of a system's gramians. This method is shown to be advantageous over the common approach of independently approximating the controllability and observability gramians, as such independent approximation methods can be inefficient when the gramians do not share a common dominant eigenspace. Third, we present a graph-based method for reduction of parameterized RC circuits. We prove that this method preserves stability and passivity of the models for nominal reduction. We present computational results for large collections of nominal and parameter-dependent circuits. Finally, we present a case study of model reduction applied to electroosmotic flow of a <b>marker</b> concentration <b>pulse</b> in a U-shaped microfluidic channel, where the marker flow in the channel is described by a three-dimensional convection-diffusion equation. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified AISIAD method in generating a low order models that correctly describe the dispersion of the marker in the linear case; that is, for the case of concentration-independent mobility and diffusion constants.

Calcification propensity (T 50) can be determined by a blood test predicting all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. We studied the impact of kidney donation on T 50 and markers of arterial stiffness. We analyzed T 50 prospectively before and 1  year after kidney donation in 21 LKDs along with fetuin-A, mineral metabolism <b>markers,</b> kidney length, <b>pulse</b> wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), and renal resistive index (RRI) as markers of arterial stiffness. We studied the impact of kidney donation on these parameters. LKDs were 54  ±  10  years old and had a GFR of 101  ±  18  ml/min/ 1. 73  m(2) before donation, decreasing to 67  ±  8  ml/min/ 1. 73  m(2) after donation (P <  0. 001). Despite this, T 50 improved after donation (290  ±  53 to 312  ±  38  min, P =  0. 049). This change was inversely related to plasma phosphate (P =  0. 03), which declined after donation (P =  0. 002). Fetuin-A levels increased after donation (P =  0. 01). Upon donation, {{the length of the}} remaining kidney increased (P <  0. 001) while PWV, AI, and RRI remained unchanged. Calcification propensity was not adversely affected by kidney donation.

Silurids have most ampullary organs in the head skin, but ampullary receptors are also found along the body side. Gymnotids have ampullary organs distributed on the head as well as scattered along the side of the body.

On an individual level, the process of keeping track of what your neighbors' opinions are has largely been a cognitive exercise.

Tracking how the tagging practices of an organization or group change over time can deliver valuable insight into what the organization is doing and thinking. If the object being tagged is explicitly restricted to someone's performance or expertise, a very interesting dataset could be collected quickly. What a group thinks someone is good at, while subjective, could be counted. Perhaps more interesting is the potential for seeing the time-lapsed tagging behavior around a collection of people's expertise.

40|$|Background: Fluid {{resuscitation}} is {{not only}} used to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI) but fluid management is also a cornerstone of treatment for patients with established AKI and renal failure. Ultrafiltration removes volume initially from the intravascular compartment inducing a relative degree of hypovolemia. Normal reflex mechanisms attempt to sustain blood pressure constant despite marked changes in blood volume and cardiac output. Thus, compensated shock with a normal blood pressure is {{a major cause of}} AKI or exacerbations of AKI during ultrafiltration. Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using MEDLINE, Google Scholar and PubMed searches. We determined a list of key questions and convened a 2 -day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated clinical practice recommendations and/or directions for future research. Results: We defined three aspects of fluid monitoring: i) normal and pathophysiological cardiovascular mechanisms; ii) measures of volume responsiveness and impending cardiovascular collapse during volume removal, and; iii) measured indices of each using non-invasive and minimally invasive continuous and intermittent monitoring techniques. The evidence documents that AKI can occur in the setting of normotensive hypovolemia and that under-resuscitation represents a major cause of both AKI and mortality ion critically ill patients. Traditional measures of intravascular volume and ventricular filling do not predict volume responsiveness whereas dynamic functional hemodynamic <b>markers,</b> such as <b>pulse</b> pressure or stroke volume variation during positive pressure breathing or mean flow changes with passive leg raising are highly predictive of volume responsiveness. Numerous commercially-available devices exist that can acquire these signals. Conclusions: Prospective clinical trials using functional hemodynamic markers in the diagnosis and management of AKI and volume status during ultrafiltration need to be performed. More traditional measure of preload be abandoned as marked of volume responsiveness though still useful to assess overall volume status...|$|R

Avaliar a concordância interobservador do método. Materiais e métodos: O estudo foi aprovado pelo comitê de ética médica e foi colhido o termo de consentimento informado. Estudou-se prospectivamente o volume de fluxo da artéria mesentérica superior em 60 voluntários sadios, dividido em 2 grupos de acordo com a faixa etária: crianças (5 - 9 anos) e adolescentes (10 - 17 anos). Todos foram classificados segundo o estado nutricional e pressórico. Todos os voluntários foram examinados por 2 radiologistas independentes com longa experiência e foram realizadas três medidas. Resultados: Os 60 indivíduos tinham idade média de 12, 2 anos, sendo 21 entre 5 e 9 anos (35 %) e 39 entre 10 e 17 anos (65 %). O VAMS foi significativamente menor nas crianças (média= 556 ml/min; DP= 122 ml/min) do que nos adolescentes (média= 775 ml/min, DP= 311 ml/min), com p< 0, 001. Os eutróficos também apresentaram o VFAMS menor do que os obesos. Os indivíduos com sobrepeso não apresentaram diferença significativa, tanto em relação aos eutróficos quanto aos obesos. Apenas a superfície corporal ficou associada significativamente com o VFAMS. Dessa forma, quanto maior a superfície corporal, maior será o VFAMS. Conclusões: O VFAMS determinado pela US com Doppler a cores é diretamente proporcional à superfície corporal. OBJECTIVE To measure superior mesenteric artery {{blood flow}} (SMABF) in healthy {{children and adolescents}} in age groups of greater Crohn's disease (CD) incidence. To assess the interobserver variability. MATERIAL AND METHODS The superior mesenteric artery blood flow was prospectively measured using pulsed Doppler ultrasound in 60 volunteers without any chronic diseases. Participants {{were divided into two}} groups: children (5 - 9 years) and adolescents (10 - 17 years). All were classified according to weight and blood pressure. Each volunteer was examined by two experienced radiologists. Each examiner made three measurements to decrease the chance of random errors. The Student t test was used to evaluate the difference between examiners, and Bland-Altman plots, to evaluate agreement. SMABF was compared with anthropometric data and hemodynamic parameters, and their correlation was determined using the Spearman coefficient. Multiple linear regression was used to control for confounding factors and to evaluate factors independently associated with SMABF. The difference between groups was significant at p< 0. 05. RESULTS The average age of participants was 12. 2 years; 21 (35 %) were in the 5 - 9 group, and 10 (65 %), in the 10 - 17 group. SMABF was significantly lower in the group of children (mean= 556 ml/min; SD= 122 ml/min) than among adolescents (mean= 775 ml/min; SD= 311 ml/min) (p< 0. 001). Participants with normal weight had a lower SMABF value than obese individuals. No {{significant differences were found between}} overweight and obese patients or patients with normal weight. Waist circumference and systolic blood pressure also were significantly associated with the SMABF. However, after multivariate analysis, only the body surface was significantly associated with SMABF, and the greater the body surface, the greater the SMABF. CONCLUSIONS: The SMABF is directly associated with the body surface. Studies are needed with CD activity and remission, considering the SMABF according to body surface in normal subjects for this parameter can be used as a <b>marker</b> of activity. <b>Pulsed</b> Doppler ultrasound was a feasible and accurate method for the pediatric population...|$|R
