40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to provide informa-tion regarding the distribution of transverse bending and shear stresses in a <b>main</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> of a catamaran cross-structure. Additionally, data is to be obtained on the width of deck plating between main bulkheads that resists transverse bending. The particular cross-structure configura-tion to be investigated is patterned after the United States Navy ASR- 21 Class catamaran. This study is of a two-dimensional nature to eliminate {{the influence of the}} adjacent transverse bulkheads on the stress distribution. In this configuration, the cross-structure bulkhead with its associated "effective breadth " of top and bottom deck plating resembles a large plate girder. The principle parameters varied are the breadth to dept...|$|E
5000|$|In September 1893 {{a report}} was {{published}} by the Director of Naval Construction, W. H. White, on how the ship had sunk, and it was submitted to parliament in November. It combined evidence from the survivors with the known design details of the ship. Camperdown struck approximately 65 ft from the stem of Victoria at an angle of approximately 80°, just ahead {{of one of the}} <b>main</b> <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> Camperdown was travelling at about 6 kn, so the blow roughly equated with the energy of a shell from one of the 12 in guns then in service, the 45-ton breech-loading rifle (BLR). It pushed Victorias bow sideways 60 - 70 ft. Camperdown was most probably held back from driving further into Victoria by coming up against the protective armoured deck running across Victoria below water level. Camperdowns stem penetrated approximately 6 ft into Victorias side, while the underwater ram penetrated about 9 ft, 12 ft below water level. Had Camperdown been travelling more slowly, then it was likely the damage from her stem would have been lessened, but the underwater ram might instead have torn a hole along Victorias relatively thin lower plating as she continued to move forward. A similar thing had happened in a collision between the German warships [...] and , causing the latter to sink. This did not happen because the two ships became locked together, although the momentum caused Camperdown to rotate relative to Victoria, tearing the hole wider.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} destroyer, {{like all}} ships in those days, was riveted. The {{greatest}} length is 92.75 m and width 9.07 m. Index extension was (L:B) = 10,23 (higher index ratio of length to width of the shell shows its degree of longitudinal flexibility). This allowed destroyers to withstand severe wave activity (five-meter wavelength of 100 meters). It also provided vysokohnuchkoyu steel (with a time fracture resistance of 55 kg / mm 2 [...] ).Strength and flexibility provided hull {{of a set of}} longitudinal and transverse ribs. Calculation of the frames was carried out from the stern to the bow of the ship. The main feature of the design of the shell was the use of a set of longitudinal ribs (41 - 139 units) in the boiler and engine room. The body is composed of 8-mm vertical stakes height 1050 mm, with double steel angles at the upper and lower edges, two dnyschevyh and other airborne stringer on each side, and one carling (350 × 1-1,5 mm [...] ) on each side.The whole design with 4 mm steel deck of the second floor and upper deck with longitudinal septa, 6-9 millimeter siding and 11.5 mm deck Stringer, were sufficiently strong and rigid structure, which was opposed longitudinal bending moment at different operating conditions.Since the construction of the ship included a double bottom mizhdonnyy space divided flora (peredilkamy) into compartments where fuel is stored.

25|$|A ship will sink if the <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads</b> are so {{far apart}} that {{flooding}} a single compartment would consume all the ship's reserve buoyancy. Aside from the possible protection of machinery, or areas most susceptible to damage, such a ship would be no better than a ship without watertight subdivision, and is called a one-compartment ship. A ship capable of remaining afloat when any single watertight compartment is flooded is called a two-compartment ship, but damage destroying the tightness of a <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> may cause flooding of two compartments and loss of the ship. A ship able to remain afloat with any two compartments flooded is called a three-compartment ship, and will withstand damage to one <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre, and its partner {{organisation}} initiated this research effort. In particular, BHP and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation held the principal interest, as this research effort {{was a part}} of the investigation into the utilisation of X- 80 steel in naval platforms. After some initial considerations, this research effort focussed on the development of X- 80 steel blast tolerant <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> Unfortunately, due to the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre not being re-funded after June 2000 and other project factors, the planned blast tests were not conducted, hence this research effort focussed on the tools needed for the formation of optimised blast tolerant <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads</b> rather than on the development of a single structural arrangement. Design criteria were formed from the worst case operational requirements for a <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead,</b> which would experience a 150 kg equivalent blast load at 8 m from the source. Since the development of any optimised blast tolerant structure had to be carried out using finite element analysis, material constants for X- 80 steel under high strain rates were obtained. These material constants were implemented in the finite element analysis and the appropriate solid element size was evolved. The behaviour and effects of stress waves and high strain rates were considered and the literature reviewed, in particular consideration was given to joint structures and weld areas effects on the entire structural response to a blast load. Furthermore, to support the design criteria, rupture prediction and determination methodologies have been investigated and recommendations developed about their relevance. Since the response of <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads</b> is significantly affected by their joint and stiffener arrangements, separate investigations of these structures were undertaken. The outcomes of these investigations led to improvements in the blast tolerance behaviour of joints and stiffeners, which also improved the overall response of the <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> to air blast loads. Finally, an optimisation procedure was developed that met all the design criteria and its relevant requirements. This optimisation procedure was implemented with the available data, to show the potential to develop optimised X- 80 steel blast tolerant <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads.</b> Due to the constraints mentioned above the optimisation procedure was restricted, but did show progression towards more effective blast tolerant <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkhead</b> designs. Factors, such as double skin bulkheads, maximising plate separation, and the use of higher yield steel all showed to be beneficial in the development of optimal X- 80 steel blast tolerant <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> when compared to the ANZACclass D- 36 steel <b>transverse</b> <b>bulkheads...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ultra large {{container}} ships are rather fl exible and exposed to signifi cant wave deformations. Therefore, the hydroelastic strength analysis {{is required for}} these types of ships.
