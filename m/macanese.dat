5|$|On 30 January 2008, Ao {{was found}} guilty on 40 counts of bribe-taking, 13 counts of money laundering, two counts of abuse of power, one count of {{incorrect}} declaration of assets and one count of holding assets from unknown sources; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison. About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most <b>Macanese</b> were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his superior in government, Edmond Ho.|$|E
5|$|Usage of the Octopus {{card was}} {{extended}} to Macau and the Chinese city of Shenzhen in 2006. In collaboration with China UnionPay, Octopus Cards Limited introduced Octopus card usage to two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen in August 2006. In 2008, five Café de Coral locations in Shenzhen also started accepting Octopus. Value cannot be reloaded to Octopus cards in Shenzhen, but the Automatic Add Value Service is available to automatically deduct money value from a customer's credit card to reload an Octopus card. The two Fairwood restaurants in Shenzhen that were enabled for Octopus card payments are located at Luohu Commercial City and Shenzhen Railway Station. Shenzhen became the first city outside Hong Kong in which Octopus cards may be accepted as payment. In Macau, the Octopus card was introduced in December 2006 when two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in the territory adopted its usage as payment. Similar to its usage in Shenzhen, an Octopus card may not be reloaded in Macau, and the currency exchange rate between the <b>Macanese</b> pataca and the Hong Kong dollar when using an Octopus card is MOP1:HKD1. The two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Macau that adopted the Octopus card for payment are located at the Rua Do Campo and the Sands Casino.|$|E
25|$|Macau still {{retains its}} own dialect of Portuguese, called <b>Macanese</b> Portuguese. Other languages—such as Mandarin, English, and Hokkien—are spoken by local communities. The <b>Macanese</b> language, a {{distinctive}} creole generally known as Patuá, is still spoken by several dozen <b>Macanese.</b>|$|E

25|$|Today, Portugal also {{exhibits}} a multicultural society {{from around the}} world, but in particular from its former colonies of the Lusosphere, such as Brazilians, Cape Verdeans, Angolans, Mozambicans, Goans and <b>Macanese</b> people.|$|E
25|$|Currently, the renminbi is the {{official}} currency of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It is the legal tender in mainland China, but not in Hong Kong or Macau. The special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau use the Hong Kong dollar and the <b>Macanese</b> pataca, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Local {{cooking in}} Macau {{consists}} of a blend of Cantonese and Portuguese cuisines. Many unique dishes resulted from the spice blends that the wives of Portuguese sailors used {{in an attempt to}} replicate European dishes. Its ingredients and seasonings include those from Europe, South America, Africa, India, and Southeast Asia, as well as local Chinese ingredients. Typically, <b>Macanese</b> food is seasoned with various spices and flavours including turmeric, coconut milk, cinnamon and bacalhau, giving special aromas and tastes. Famous dishes include minchi, capella, galinha à Portuguesa, galinha à Africana (African chicken), bacalhau, <b>Macanese</b> chili shrimps and stir-fry curry crab. Pork chop bun, ginger milk and Portuguese-style egg tart are also very popular in Macau. Especially from Lord Stow's Bakery in Coloane where the first Macau-style egg tart was invented (a blend of British and Portuguese styles).|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese often married Tanka women since Han Chinese {{women would}} not have {{relations}} with them. Some of the Tanka's descendants became <b>Macanese</b> people. Some Tanka children were enslaved by Portuguese raiders. The Chinese poet Wu Li wrote a poem, which included a line about the Portuguese in Macau being supplied with fish by the Tanka.|$|E
25|$|Custard tarts {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Hong Kong in the 1940s through cha chaan tengs. Hong Kong egg tarts are the adaptations of pastel de nata, popular in Macau. Canton (modern Guangdong) had more frequent {{contact with the}} West, particularly with Britain and Portugal, {{than the rest of}} China. Also, being a neighbour of Macau, Hong Kong has adopted some of the <b>Macanese</b> cuisine.|$|E
25|$|In the two Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, {{arrangements}} {{are similar to}} those in the UK; in Hong Kong, three commercial banks are licensed to issue Hong Kong dollar notes, and in Macau, banknotes of the <b>Macanese</b> pataca are issued by two different commercial banks. In Luxembourg, the Banque Internationale à Luxembourg was entitled to issue its own Luxembourgish franc notes until the introduction of the Euro in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Macau is {{the most}} densely {{populated}} region in the world, with a population density of 21,185.28 persons per square kilometre in 2016. Han Chinese make up 95% of Macau's population; another 2% is of Portuguese and/or mixed Chinese/Portuguese descent, an ethnic group {{often referred to as}} <b>Macanese.</b> According to the 2006 by-census, 47% of the residents were born in mainland China, of whom 74.1% were born in Guangdong and 15.2% in Fujian. Meanwhile, 42.5% of the residents were born in Macau, and those born in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Portugal shared 3.7%, 2.0% and 0.3% respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} of Portugal with Spain meant that Portuguese colonies became {{targets for the}} Netherlands, which was embroiled {{at the time in}} a lengthy struggle for its independence from Spain, the Eighty Years' War. After the Dutch East India Company was founded in 1602, the Dutch unsuccessfully attacked Macau several times, culminating in a full-scale invasion attempt in 1622, when 800 attackers were successfully repelled by 150 <b>Macanese</b> and Portuguese defenders and a large number of African slaves. One of the first actions of Macau's first governor, who arrived the following year, was to strengthen the city's defences, which included the construction of the Guia Fortress.|$|E
25|$|In {{the whole}} world there are easily {{more than one hundred}} million people with {{recognizable}} Portuguese ancestors, due to the colonial expansion and worldwide immigration of Portuguese from the 16th century onwards to India, the Americas, Macau (see <b>Macanese</b> people), East-Timor, Malaysia, Indonesia and Africa. Between 1886 and 1966, Portugal lost to emigration more than any West European country except Ireland. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Europe to live mainly in Brazil and with significant numbers to the United States. About 40 million Brazilians have relatively recent Portuguese background, due to massive immigration in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. About 1.2 million Brazilian citizens are native Portuguese. Significant verified Portuguese minorities exist in several countries (see table).|$|E

25|$|The Dutch marched {{toward the}} centre of the city in orderly fashion until {{reaching}} the artillery range of the Fortaleza do Monte, where they came under heavy bombardment. When the invaders passed by a small spring called Fontinha where local women used to wash their laundry, the Jesuit priest Giacomo Rho fired a cannon-shot from the Fortaleza do Monte which landed on a barrel of gunpowder {{in the midst of the}} Dutch formation, causing many casualties. This changed the tempo of battle, as the Dutch commanders halted the advance to deliberate their next steps. They decided to climb the Guia Hill, upon which a hermitage was situated, to get a better view of the enemy, but their ascent was resisted by a party of 30 <b>Macanese</b> and blacks, whose ferocity and effective use of terrain forced the Dutch to back down and change their plans again. Not expecting such stiff resistance, the invaders moved toward a patch of high ground near the Guia Hill, with the intention of retreating for the day due to fatigue and low ammunitions (most were lost in the explosion).|$|E
25|$|Through the Christian {{community}} in Japan, Pessoa was {{informed of the}} intrigues against him and promptly prepared for defence and departure. He prepared a large quantity of hand grenades and ammunition aboard the ship, but due to the large size of the cargo, the ship {{was not ready to}} sail until after New Years Day in 1610, whereas previous <b>Macanese</b> vessels usually returned before Christmas. While the ship was being loaded, Arima tried to entice Pessoa to come ashore with offers of hospitality, saying that he had been sent to Nagasaki only to negotiate silk prices, and that the high officials in Sunpu only wanted Pessoa to give his account of the Macau events in person—he would be pardoned as a foreigner even if he was found guilty. Many Portuguese believed Arima, but not Pessoa, who knew Arima had assembled a force of 1200 samurai against him. Pessoa now would not go ashore even for Mass, and ordered his crew to come aboard the carrack to set sail. However, this was delayed as some crew believed that the current crisis was merely Pessoa's personal feud and dragged their feet, while most who had wanted to embark were obstructed by Japanese guards. By the time Arima attacked the carrack on January 3, only about 50 Europeans were on board with some black slaves and lascars.|$|E

2500|$|The Shimabara Rebellion, {{led by a}} young Christian {{man named}} Amakusa Shirō Tokisada, took place against the shogunate in 1637. The {{rebellion}} broke out over economic desperation and government oppression but later assumed a religious tone. [...] About 27,000 people joined the uprising, but it was crushed by the shogunate after a sustained campaign. The reigning shogun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, who had issued the Sakoku Edict, restricting trade and effectively isolating Japan, two years earlier, came {{down hard on the}} Christians. Many Japanese were deported to Macau or to the Spanish Philippines. Many <b>Macanese</b> and Japanese Mestizos are the mixed-race descendants of the deported Japanese Catholics. 400 were officially deported by the government to Macau and Manila, but thousands of Japanese were pressured into moving voluntarily. About 10,000 <b>Macanese</b> and 3,000 Japanese were moved to Manila.|$|E

2500|$|Macao: The {{event was}} held in Macau on May 3. It {{was the first time}} that the Olympic torch had {{traveled}} to Macau. A ceremony was held at Macau Fisherman's Wharf. Afterward, the torch traveled through Macau, passing by a number of landmarks including A-Ma Temple, Macau Tower, Ponte Governador Nobre de Carvalho, Ponte de Sai Van, Macau Cultural Centre, Macau Stadium and then back to the Fisherman's Wharf for the closing ceremony. Parts of the route near Ruins of St. Paul's and Taipa was shortened due to large crowds of supporters blocking narrow streets. A total of 120 torchbearers participated in this event including casino tycoon Stanley Ho. Leong Hong Man and Leong Heng Teng were the first and last torchbearer in the relay respectively.

2500|$|As a non-UN member, the {{government}} of Taiwan calculates its own HDI, which had a value of 0.882 in 2011. Additionally, while the HDI for the Chinese special administrative region of Hong Kong is calculated by the UN, {{it is not for}} Macau. The <b>Macanese</b> government calculated the territory's HDI to be 0.868 in 2011. These values place both Taiwan and Macau well within the list of countries with [...] "Very high human development". Furthermore, in 2009 a United Nations project calculated the HDI for all of its members, as well as Taiwan, Macau, and many dependent territories. The HDI values for the countries of San Marino and Monaco, which have not been included in official annual HDI reports, were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively. This places both countries firmly within the category of countries with [...] "Very high human development" [...] as well. The dependent territories with HDI values equivalent to [...] "Very high human development" [...] were: Jersey, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Guernsey, Gibraltar, Norfolk Island, Faroe Islands, Isle of Man, British Virgin Islands, Falkland Islands, Aruba, Puerto Rico, Martinique, Greenland, and Guam. Of note, the HDI values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old HDI formula, while HDI values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula.|$|E
2500|$|Outwardly, Hasegawa still put Portuguese {{interests}} {{in mind as}} it was in his best interests to keep the Portuguese trade alive in Nagasaki. He arranged to have the Portuguese envoys arrive in Ieyasu's court at Sunpu before those of the Dutch trading party, even though Ieyasu chose to grant an audience to the Dutch envoys first. The Dutch entry provided Ieyasu an opportunity to break the Portuguese monopoly on Chinese silk, and the delighted ex-shogun gave the Dutch permission to establish a trading post anywhere in Japan without the restriction on prices like the Portuguese had. Hasegawa apparently took the Portuguese side and relayed information of Dutch activities to the Portuguese; however, Pessoa and the <b>Macanese</b> merchants were still suspicious of Hasegawa's intentions and resolved to petition Ieyasu directly to complain about Hasegawa and Murayama. The Jesuits were horrified when they found out about Pessoa's decision due to their knowledge that Hasegawa's sister Onatsu (お夏) was a favourite concubine of Ieyasu, [...] "so much so, that if she said black was white, [...] would believe it". The fathers used all sorts of rhetoric they could muster, including the threat of excommunication, to dissuade Pessoa from lodging the complaint. Pessoa desisted, but the damage had already been done, since the Japanese interpreter hired to translate the list of grievances showed it to the bugyō himself. Hasegawa, in great anger, swore to get even with Pessoa dead or alive.|$|E
2500|$|By then it {{had become}} {{apparent}} that the main Dutch force was attacking from the east and that the bombardment on São Francisco was just a feint. The commander of the São Thiago garrison therefore sent 50 men under Captain João Soares Vivas to aid the inland defense. As soon as the Portuguese realized the Dutch intentions, the defenders gathered for the counterattack and occupied the high ground ahead of the Dutch. With the battle cry [...] "Santiago!", Lopo Sarmento de Carvalho signaled the counterattack, and the combined forces of the Portuguese defenders, <b>Macanese</b> citizens, Dominican friars, Jesuit priests, and black slaves alike charged the enemy, compelling the Dutchmen to flee. Captain Hans Ruffijn urged his countrymen to stand fast, but {{he was killed in}} the fighting as the Dutch retreat turned into a rout. The onset of the [...] "drunken negro slaves" [...] in particular, sparing no one as they beheaded all Dutchmen they came across in the name of John the Baptist, greatly demoralized the Hollanders. One black woman was even compared to the legendary baker-woman of Aljubarrota by a contemporary Jesuit for her incredible skill with a halberd during the battle. However, the Dutch got some reprieve in the pursuit when the slaves abandoned the chase to plunder the dead. When the fleeing Dutchmen reached the Cacilhas Beach, the two rear-guard companies who were supposed to cover the retreat panicked and fled to the boats without firing a shot. The panic among the Dutch landing party was so complete that the Dutch ships had to push off into deeper water to avoid being overturned by the fugitives, causing many of them to drown or be shot by the Portuguese in the sea. The next day, Admiral Reijersen sent ashore a flag of truce to negotiate the release of prisoners. The negotiation was in vain, and the dejected Dutch fleet soon left Macau waters to head for the Pescadores.|$|E

5000|$|The mid-twentieth century, {{with the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in the Pacific and the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, saw the <b>Macanese</b> population surge through the re-integration of two disparate <b>Macanese</b> communities: the Hong Kong <b>Macanese</b> and the Shanghai <b>Macanese.</b> With the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941, the <b>Macanese</b> population, escaping the occupation, made its way to Macau as refugees. These <b>Macanese,</b> including many skilled workers and civil servants, were fluent in English and Portuguese and brought valuable commercial and technical skills to the colony. Another distinct group within the <b>Macanese</b> community is the 上海葡僑; the descendants of Portuguese settlers from Shanghai that acted as middlemen between other foreigners and the Chinese in the [...] "Paris of the Orient". They emigrated from Shanghai to Macau in 1949 with the coming of the Red Guard.
