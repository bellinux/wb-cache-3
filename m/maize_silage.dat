25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged, as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form. <b>Maize</b> <b>silage</b> {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread ensilaging, it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|E

40|$|<b>Maize</b> {{and grass}} <b>silages</b> are {{commonly}} used as major feed materials for dairy cows in Europe and are becoming common parts of dairy cow rations {{in other parts of}} the world. Thenutritive value of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> varies greatly due to variation in chemical composition. A combination of different factors such as the use of various cultivars, fertilization practices, growing conditions, harvesting technology, maturity at harvest and ensiling conditions cause this variation in chemical composition. The first aim of this thesis was to investigate relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ rumen degradation characteristics and in situ mobile nylon bag digestibility of dietary nutrients of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages.</b> <b>Maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> with a broad range in chemical composition and quality parameters were selected from different Dutch commercial farms. The broad range in the chemical composition of the <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> resulted in a large variation in rumen degradable fractions of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch. The intestinal digestibility of CP, NDF and/or starch was affected by the concentration of these components in the <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages,</b> by the rumen incubation time and the rumen escape content. Regression equations were developed describing relationships between the chemical composition and the in situ ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages.</b> A number of the developed regression equations presented in this thesis can be used for accurate and rapid estimation of the ruminal and postruminal degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages,</b> without conducting time consuming and expensive in situ experiments. The second aim of this thesis was to determine whether three cows are sufficient to cover the variation between individual cows in in situ rumen degradation characteristics of dietary nutrients of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages.</b> Significant differences (P 0. 05) between individual cows were found for all the parameters of DM, OM, CP and NDF. The results suggest that using three cows are sufficient for nylon bag incubations of grass silages and pooling of rumen incubated residues is allowed to obtain a representative sample. The third aim of this thesis was to compare two fractionation methods; the washing machine method and a modified method, for nitrogen (N) and starch fractions of <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> and N fractions of grass silages. The N and/or starch fractions of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> determined, using the washing machine method (washing with water for 40 min) and the modified method (shaking with buffer solution for 60 min) were compared. The different methodological approaches of both methods resulted in different values for the washout (W), the soluble (S) and the non-washout (D+U) fractions of N of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> and for the W, the insoluble washout (W-S) and the D+U fractions of starch of <b>maize</b> <b>silages.</b> The loss of insoluble small particles of starch was less during shaking of nylon bags in buffer solution, compared to washing nylon bags in the washing machine. Therefore, large differences were found between the D+U fractions of starch determined by both methods compared to the D+U fractions of N of <b>maize</b> <b>silages.</b> The developed regression equations for W, S and D+U fractions of N in grass silages and for D+U fractions of starch in <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> determined by both methods can be used for rapid estimation of these fractions from chemical characteristics of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages.</b> The information on nutrient bioavailability of <b>maize</b> and grass <b>silages</b> presented in this thesis can be used to more accurately formulate dairy ration in terms of maintenance, health and production of dairy cows...|$|R

These left over kernels, along with the corn stover, serve as an additional feed source for grazing cattle. Over time, the stalks will decrease in value as feed, so farmers aim to graze the corn stover as soon as possible after harvest.

Starch digestibility did not differ across <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturities; however, a linear (P = 0. 009) decrease in NDF digestibility was observed. Methane emissions, (g/d) measured using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, were not affected by <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturity. Methane emissions relative to DMI tended (P = 0. 05) to decline with advancing <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturity, with a similar decline observed when methane was expressed per kilogram of carcass gain.

Both the control and inoculated maize silages were well preserved with a pH of 3. 57 and 3. 62, a lactic acid concentration of 66 and 63 g/kg DM and an ammonia nitrogen concentration of 5. 88 and 5. 10 g/ 100 g of total nitrogen respectively. No butyric acid was found in either untreated or inoculated <b>maize</b> <b>silage.</b> The maize silages made in the bunker silos were well preserved with a DM of 283 and 307 g/kg silage, pH of 3. 50 and 3. 51, lactic acid of 37. 0 and 35. 3 g/kg DM for the control and inoculated <b>maize</b> <b>silage,</b> respectively. The addition of the inoculant to maize at ensiling improved the palatability, intake and the aerobic stability of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> compared to the untreated control <b>maize</b> <b>silage.</b> The intake of untreated and inoculated <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> by Jersey cows was 7. 6 and 8. 4 kg DM/day for the control and inoculant treatment, respectively.

40|$|Substituting {{grass silage}} with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in forage {{mixtures}} {{may result in}} one forage influencing the nutritive value of another in terms of whole tract nutrient digestibility and N utilisation. This experiment investigated effects of four forage combinations being, grass silage (G); 67 g/ 100 g grass silage + 33 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (GGM); 67 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> + 33 g/ 100 g grass silage (MMG); <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (M). All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (22. 4 g N/kg dry matter [DM]) using a concentrate mixture. Ration digestibility and N balance was determined using 7 Holstein Friesian steers (mean body weight 411. 0 +/- 120. 9 kg) in a cross-over design. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the diet had a positive linear effect on forage and total DM intake (P = 0. 001), and on apparent DM and organic matter digestibility (both P = 0. 048). Regardless of the silage ratio used, the metabolisable energy concentration of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was calculated {{to be higher than}} that of grass silage (P = 0. 058), and linearly related to the relative proportions of the two silages in the forage mixture. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the diet resulted in a linear decline in the apparent digestibility of starch (P = 0. 022), neutral detergent fibre (P < 0. 001) and acid detergent fibre (P = 0. 003). Nitrogen retention, expressed as amount retained per day or in terms of body weight (g/ 100 kg) increased linearly with maize inclusion (P = 0. 047 and 0. 046, respectively). Replacing grass silage with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> caused linear responses according to the proportions of each forage in the diet, and that there were no associative effects of combining forages.

40|$|In a {{completely}} randomised grazing trial, 8 cows in mid-lactation were offered white clover pasture (35 kg DM/cow/day) with 4 of the cows given a supplement of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (8 kg DM/cow/day). Factors evaluated over a 28 day period were total DMI, pasture DM/maize silage DM substitution rate, herbage selection in the pasture, milk yield, fat and protein concentration. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased total DMI by 22 % and lowered pasture herbage DMI by 21 %; {{equivalent to a}} substitution rate of 0. 5 kg pasture DM /kg of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM. Selection of herbage in the pasture was not affected by supplementation, but cows on both treatments selectively grazed the white clover. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased milk yield by 34 %, fat yield by 35 % and protein yield by 35 % (P< 0. 05), but did not affect milk fat and protein concentration. In a metabolism trial, 6 rumen fistulated cows in mid-lactation were fed similar diets in a crossover experiment but with white clover fed ad libitum. Digestibility, nitrogen balance, milk yield, fat and protein concentration were evaluated over a 7 day period. <b>Maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM and white clover DM digestion in the rumen were evaluated by DM disappearance rates from nylon bags over a 96 hr period. Measurments of rumen fluid volume, fluid mean retention time, fluid outflow, pH, ammonia and VFA concentration and the acetate/propionate ratio were estimated over a 24 hr period. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased total DMI by 34 %, without affecting DM digestibility (DMD). However, OMD was reduced by 5 % and fibre digestion by 18 % (P< 0. 05). Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> {{did not affect the}} rate of digestion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM or white clover DM in nylon bags, but white clover was digested at a faster rate than <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (P< 0. 05). The increased DOMI by cows supplemented with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was highly correlated with a 24 % increase in milk yield (P< 0. 05; iI= 61) but had no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. At similar nitrogen intakes cows supplemented with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> produced 2. 3 kg more milk (P< 0. 050 =' 66) but there was no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. Rumen fluid volume, mean retention time and fluid outflow rate were not significantly altered by the <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplement, although rumen pH and ammonia concentration were significantly lower (P< 0. 05). Total VFA concentration was not significantly different between the two diets, but acetate concentration was significantly lower (P< 0. 05), while propionate concentration was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in supplemented cows. The reduction in acetate and the corresponding increase in propionate, lowered the acetate/propionate ratio. Butyrate concentration was not affected. It was concluded that for cows in mid-lactation fed on good quality white clover dominant pasture, <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation can increase milk yield, without affecting milk fat and protein concentration. The increase in milk yield was attributed to increased apparent energy intake as nitrogen intake did not change markedly. However further work is required to quantify whether increased nitrogen utilization occurred and whether the lower ammonia concentration in <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplemented cows were due to improved rumen microbial synthesis. The possibility also exists that improved milk yields were due to by-pass rumen starch, thereby providing glucose to the animal, after enzymatic digestion in the small intestine.

40|$|This project should {{generate}} current regional results over {{a period}} of three years about the parameter yield and quality of alternative fodder crops to maize; this includes grass and clover grass mixtures, <b>silage</b> <b>maize,</b> varieties of Sorghum/millets and whole plant silages of wheat, rye and triticale. The tested <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> showed the highest and most reliable average dry matter yield with 23 tons per hectare, with a very low variance. The Sorghum and millet varieties had dry matter yields of 3 to 5 tons per hectare below the <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> yield but with individual values fluctuating in a broad range within years and locations. With values far below 28 % the dry matter contents were not suitable for ensiling. The grass and clover grass mixtures are good, stable and established alternatives to <b>maize</b> for <b>silage.</b> They achieved high yields comparable with these of Sorghum but stable and with a highly suitable dry matter content for ensiling. The yield of the whole plant silages was up to 22 % lower compared with maize. So none of the alternative crops can compete with the high level yield of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> in its favoured region, therefore would be a combination of two crops recommended. But some individual locally adapted mixtures or varieties of the alternative crops reached nearly 80 % of the <b>maize</b> yield. <b>Silage</b> <b>maize</b> showed the highest level of the net energy content for lactation (NEL), followed by the values of the fodder crops and the whole plant silages.

40|$|A {{randomized}} {{block design}} experiment {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of two contrasting <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> hybrids (DD: dry down vs. SG: stay green) harvested at 33 % dry matter (DM) on in situ degradation and dairy cow performance. Thirty-eight Red-HF cows were assigned to two silage treatments and individually fed. Mixtures containing one of the <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> grass silage and soy bean meal (70 : 17 : 13 DM basis) were offered ad libitum. Additionally, each cow received 7. 5 kg d- 1 of concentrate. Intake, milk yield and milk composition were analysed from wk 1 until wk 15 of lactation. The treatment period was from wk 5 to wk 15 of lactation. Pre-treatment data (wk 1 to 4) were used as covariates. In addition, fresh silage samples were ruminally incubated to determine the rate and extent of starch and NDF degradation.

40|$|Transition {{of dairy}} cows from grazing to silage based rations {{significantly}} increases the saturated: unsaturated fatty acids (FA) ratio and decreases {{the content of}} beneficial C 18 : 1 cis- 9, C 18 : 1 trans- 11, C 18 : 2 cis- 9,trans- 11 and C 18 : 3 n- 3 in milk fat. This is partly related to a lower polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) supply from ensiled forages. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} scope of increasing the content PUFA in grass and <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> and to establish relationships between silage quality {{on the one hand and}} the FA content and composition, post-ensiling stability of PUFA, and milk FA composition of dairy cows on the other hand. The first focus of this thesis was to quantify the variation in FA content and composition in grass (n = 101) and maize (n = 96) silages, randomly sampled from commercial dairy farms in the Netherlands, and use multivariate analysis to identify the causes of this variation. The FA content and composition of grass and <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> were highly variable, and this variation was primarily caused by differences in plant maturity at harvest. Silages made from younger grass and maize have higher contents of C 18 : 3 n- 3. Most of the variation in FA content in the ensiled forages was caused by differences in plant maturity at harvest. Changes in FA content and composition were investigated in stover (leaves and stem) and ears (cob, shank and husks) in a set of maize genotypes, grown on sandy and clay soils and harvested at 14, 42, 56, 70, and 84 days after flowering (DAF). The contents of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and total FAs in the stover dry matter (DM) declined at a slow rate up to 56 DAF and then decreased rapidly during 56 – 84 DAF. On the other hand the content of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and total FAs in the ears DM increased up to 56 DAF and thereafter remained more or less constant. The maximum amount of PUFA in <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> can be harvested around 56 DAF. Identifying pre and post-ensiling processes that optimize the stability of PUFA was the next goal. The stability of FA were investigated in untreated and mechanically bruised perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), wilted under field conditions for 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, or wilted under controlled climate conditions at three temperatures (15, 25 or 35 °C) and two light (dark or light) regimes to DM contents of 425, 525 or 625 g/kg. The oxidation of FAs during wilting of grass was mainly caused by the duration of the wilting, wilting temperature only provoked small differences, whereas mechanical bruising of grass and light intensity did not affect the changes in FA contents. The highly esterified lipids of forages are extensively hydrolysed in the silo. Therefore, the post-ensiling stability of FAs was investigated in grass and <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> with a wide range in qualities, exposed to air for 0, 12, and 24 h. Exposure of grass and <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> to air results in a quantitatively small, but consistent decline in the contents of major unsaturated FAs with a concomitant increase in the proportion of C 16 : 0. The final study evaluated the effects of feeding <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> ensiled at different maturities, in combination with a high or low degradable carbohydrate concentrate on nutrient intake, milk production, and composition of milk and milk fatinearly lactating dairy cows. Maize maturity at harvest at a DM content of 300 - 420 g/kg fresh weight, did not affect the production performance of dairy cows, but resulted in decreased contents of C 18 : 3 n- 3 and total n- 3 and a decreased n- 6 :n- 3 ratio in the milk fat of dairy cows.  ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine digestibility of dry matter(DM), organic matter (OM) and digestibility of organic matter in dry matter (D-value) of primary cut, different maturity stages grass silage in interaction with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (33 % and 67 %, DM based). Grass silage was harvested in three maturity stages of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) (late vegetative, internode elongation and flowering) that was a dominant grass in the sward. The study consisted of ten feeding treatments with 10 whether Charolais sheep in incomplete changeover design. Dry matter content of I, II and III cutting term was 396, 408 i 463 g kg- 1 of the fresh sample respectively, while crude protein (CP) content was 119. 6, 98. 0 i 93. 0 g kg- 1 in DM respectively. Dry mater and starch concentration in <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was 264 g kg- 1 fresh sample and 211 g kg- 1 DM respectively. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the grass silage of the I cutting term (33 % vs. 67 %) did not influence digestibility of DM and OM or D-value. Inclusion of 67 % of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the II cuting term grass silage based diet increased DM digestibility (P< 0. 05). Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (33 % vs. 67 %) in the grass silage of the III cutting term increased DM digestibility (P< 0. 05) and D-value (P< 0. 05), while the inclusion of 67 % of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased OM digestibility (P< 0. 05) in comparison with feeding treatment with grass silage III only.
