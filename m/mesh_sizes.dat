25|$|The {{fisheries}} in the Northeast Region are governed mostly by Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). An example of successful regulation is the 1994 Amendment 4 to the Sea Scallop FMP. This {{set out to}} control scallop fishing effort by not accepting more entrants, by restricting the time vessels could fish each day, and by requiring bigger <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> on dredges.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in February 2017 in the Village Nipah Panjang 2, Subdistrict Nipah Panjang, Tanjung Jabung Timur Regency, Province of Jambi. The method used is to observe directly the fishing gear used by fishermen. This study aims to produce an Efficient gillnet fishing gear design through {{an assessment of the}} construction of gillnet used by fishermen. The principle of design theory uses the reference formula Sadhori (1984) and Fridman (1986). The results show that the construction of gillnet consists as webbing, upper main line, under main line, float line, sinker line, float, sinker I, sinker II and buoy. Based on the calculation of design formula was obtained distinguish of <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> spin of line, number of float and sinker, floats and sinker mounting distance. The spin direction used in the sample as Z-Z, while for the new design it is better to use the opposite spin direction such as Z-S or S-Z. The number of sample float is 701 pieces with a distance of 1 m (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 3 inch) and 401 pieces with a distance of 1 m (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 7 inch). While the recommended number of float is 1567 pieces with a distance of 45 cm (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 3 inch) and 540 pieces with a distance of 75 cm (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 7 inch). The number of sample sinker is 1556 pieces with a distance of 45 cm (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 3 inch) and 160 pieces with a distance of 2, 5 m (<b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> 7 inch).

Drowning in gillnets is the main threat to them throughout their range. Between 1995 and 2001, there were 38 reported deaths and 74% {{died as a result of}} entanglement in gill-nets with large <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes.</b> The majority of reported dolphin deaths in all subpopulations is due to accidental capture and drowning in gillnets and dragnets, and in the Philippines, bottom-set crabnets. In Burma, electrofishing, gold mining and dam building are also serious and continuing threats. Though most fishers are sympathetic to the dolphins' plight, it is difficult for them to abandon their traditional livelihood.|$|E
25|$|The tangle net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard mesh size of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E

Ring, fence, fyke netting and beam trawling are also used occasionally, but more often associated with sampling the entire population for research purposes. [...] Research has focused on the effectiveness of different <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> used to net the species in order to prevent juvenile individuals dying after becoming enmeshed. Associated research has also shown that those whiting that survive and are discarded tend to have much lower survival rates due to scale loss, which is a major issue, as many young fish are regularly taken in such nets and released by the fisherman after sustaining scale loss. These studies have led to a number of proposals and subsequent changes to net regulations.|$|E
