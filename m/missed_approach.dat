5|$|On 20 April 1967, a Globe Air Britannia 313 was on {{a flight}} from Bangkok to Basel with {{intermediate}} stops at Colombo, Mumbai (Bombay) and Cairo. The crew didn't fly to Cairo, but elected to fly to Nicosia instead, where a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> and subsequent low circuit ended in impact near the airport perimeter.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
50|$|On 17 October 1988, Uganda Airlines Flight 775 from London Gatwick to Entebbe International Airport via Fiumicino, crashed {{short of}} the runway after two <b>missed</b> <b>approaches.</b> Twenty-six of the 45 {{passengers}} aboard, {{as well as all}} 7 crew members, died.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial <b>missed</b> <b>approach,</b> and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|See then {{elected to}} perform a visual {{circling}} approach, a simplified landing procedure allowing flight under instrument rules, {{as long as the}} pilot can keep the airfield and any preceding aircraft in sight. The reported weather conditions at the airport were adequate for this type of approach, but visibility was irregular and deteriorating rapidly. Stafford began to follow See's plane, but when he lost sight of it in the clouds he instead followed the standard procedure for a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> and pulled his aircraft up, back into the clouds for another attempt at an instrument landing.|$|E

50|$|On 30 August 1975, Wien Air Alaska Flight 99, a Fairchild F-27B on {{approach}} to landing, crashed into Sevuokuk Mountain after multiple <b>missed</b> <b>approaches,</b> killing {{the pilot and}} co-pilot and eight others out of the 32 crew and passengers on board. The weather was a low ceiling with sea fog, and below approach minimums.|$|R
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other inbound flights were performing <b>missed</b> <b>approaches,</b> as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|R

50|$|Fog was {{prevalent}} in the Gambell area, and the crew discussed strategies to land at the airport. After several <b>missed</b> <b>approaches,</b> the plane flew north over the community, and turned east, and then south to make one final pass.

25|$|The second fatal {{accident}} occurred on 1 November 1961. Bristol 170 Mark 32 Superfreighter registration G-ANWL operating a scheduled service from Cherbourg to Guernsey crashed after losing height during a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> to Guernsey Airport, damaging the aircraft beyond repair and killing {{two out of}} three crew members (all seven passengers survived).|$|E

25|$|On November 6, 1986 Eastern Air Lines Captain George Baines {{was flying}} {{in his private}} aircraft, a Piper PA-23 (N2185P), from his home to Tampa International to catch a flight.

25|$|A Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16 was {{destroyed}} on 5 January 2014 after crash-landing at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport in Colorado during a positioning flight from Tucson, Arizona to Salt Lake City, Utah, where a bank which was repossessing the aircraft {{was to take}} formal custody. The aircraft attempted a tailwind landing in low-level windshear and gust conditions, then declared a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> and executed a go-around. Upon the second landing attempt, the aircraft touched down, bounced airborne again and slammed into the runway, coming to rest upside-down near the departure end, in flames and its right wing separated from the airframe. One crewmember was killed; another crewmember and a passenger sustained serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|The first non-fatal {{incident}} was on 30 October 1961. It involved a BUA mainline Vickers Viscount 736 (registration: G-AODH operating an internal German charter flight {{under contract to}} BEA from Berlin Tempelhof Airport to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport. While executing a <b>missed</b> <b>approach</b> during an instrument approach to Rhein-Main Airport in poor visibility, the aircraft crash-landed. It struck the ground alongside Rhein-Main's runway 25 and rolled to a stop. There aircraft was damaged beyond repair, {{but there were no}} fatalities among the 16 occupants (four crew and 12 passengers) although a flight attendant and a passenger sustained injuries. Accident investigators concluded that the crash-landing was caused by the captain flying below the critical height in inadequate surface visibility. They furthermore concluded that the assistance the captain received from his co-pilot at the critical moment was erroneous and misleading, and therefore constituted an important contributing factor.|$|E
