Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a well-established machining option for manufacturing geometrically complex or hard material parts that are extremely difficult-to-machine by conventional machining processes. Its unique feature of using thermal energy to machine electrically conductive parts regardless of hardness has been its distinctive advantage in the manufacture of <b>mould,</b> <b>die,</b> automotive, aerospace and surgical components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{process is a}} manufacturing method for shaping hard metals and formation of deep and complex shaped hole by spark erosion in electrical conductive materials such as metals, metallic alloys, ceramics etc. EDM process is achieved {{by a series of}} recurring electrical discharges between the electrode and workpiece in the presence of dielectric fluid. EDM unique feature of using thermal energy to machine conductive materials irrespective of material hardness has been its major advantage in the manufacture of aerospace, surgical, <b>mould,</b> <b>die,</b> automotive and as well as sport components. The effectiveness of EDM process depends among other factors on the thermal properties of the electrode material. The objective {{of this study is to}} study the influence of electrode cooling on recast layers and micro crack in EDM of titanium. The machining parameters investigated in the present study are current intensity (I), pulse on-time (Ton), pulse off-time (Toff) and gap voltage (V), which are of great interest for EDM researchers. The copper electrode is used to EDM titanium workpiece at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature using liquid nitrogen.

40|$|Process {{technology}} of stock removal has, {{on the basis}} of process experiments carried out, reached a point where a systematic portrayal of the necessary measures for process optimization is permitted. It must, however, be stressed that the fusion caving still is classified as a comparatively young laser beam process. In view of this fact the investigations on this process must be concentrated on the optimisation of rectangular cavities with regard to the removal rate and surface quality. The important results are summarised below: plan, construction, manufacturing, schlieren optical measuring and application of strongly rotationally symmetric annular jet nozzles and the establishing of their parameter dependencies lead to a systematic optimisation of the process gas flow. With the drawing up and discussion of a list of measures concrete recommendations for the design of the basic parameter set are given. The important parameter dependencies and process rules are documented. The families of characteristics for removal depth, removal rate, surface roughness, efficiency and heat affected zone as a function of feed rate and laser beam power serve for the actual qualification of the fusion caving process. The investigations of the multi-layered caving verify the transferable nature of the results for the single-layered caving within the limits of definite parameters. Additionally, the results for form deviations beside the technological potential of the process reveal the need for further research to comply with the requirements of industrial <b>mould,</b> <b>die</b> and tool making.

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{based on}} the aluminium-silicon system are popular for {{automotive}} and aerospace applications, thanks to their high strength to weight ratio, excellent castability, and corrosion resistance. Microporosity is widely acknowledged to affect both static and dynamic properties of structural aluminium alloy castings. Formation of microporosity is a complex phenomenon and depends upon various factors but mainly hydrogen content and melt cleanliness, i. e., oxide films and inclusions. In {{the past few decades}} numerous studies on microporosity formation have been reported. However, several aspects of this subject are not fully understood. The motivation of this doctoral thesis has been to improve the knowledge of porosity formation and its affect of the mechanical properties of the cast products. This study aimed at understanding the effect of hydrogen and defects on microporosity of aluminium-silicon based castings. A literature review of the theories of porosity formation, and previously reported results on the factors affecting the microporosity formation in aluminium alloys is reported briefly in order to establish a basis of the present study. The research presented in this thesis is divided in five phases. In the first phase, lab scale directional solidification experiments were carried out with an A 356 alloy. Six hydrogen levels from 0. 48 to 0. 07 mL/ 100 g melt were reached by various up-gassing and de-gassing treatments of the melt. The melt quality was assessed by porous disc filtration apparatus (PoDFA) and reduced pressure test (RPT) methods. Microporosity distribution in the castings was characterized by the Archmedian method, image analysis and X-ray radiography. The results show that the porosity distribution is strongly dependent on the cooling rate and hydrogen content {{in the presence of the}} oxide films type defects. In the next phase, casting experiments with an A 356 melt were carried by using a step <b>mould</b> <b>die</b> and castings were produced with and without filtration. The experiments were divided into series I and series II. In the first series 70 kg of the A 356 ingots were melted in an electric resistance furnace. Three hydrogen levels namely 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 4 mL/ 100 g melt were reached first by Ar-degassing, and up-gassing with Ar- 10 % H 2 and Ar-water vapour mixture, respectively. In the second series of experiments similar procedure was applied to another melt but in the reverse order. The castings were characterized in terms of microporosity and mechanical properties distribution. In addition high pressure die casting of an A 380 alloy was carried out with different processing parameters like plunger speed, commutation point between first and second phase and pouring temperature. The results shows that tensile properties in both gravity and high pressure die castings were affected by the amount and distribution of casting defects. A series of casting experiments were carried out with the same type of step mould and with two hydrogen levels, namely 0. 1 and 0. 2 mL/ 100 g melt, in the third phase of the project. The main focus of these trials was to carefully control the variables during melt preparation, casting and solidification and keep the variations at minimum. Experiments were performed in two different days in order to check the reproducibility of the measurements. For the low gas level (0. 1 mL/ 100 g melt) higher porosity levels are observed in the thinnest step, while the trend is opposite with the medium gas level (0. 2 mL/ 100 g melt) castings. The data obtained form these trials where casting variables were controlled in a reproducible way form a basis for evaluating the results of simulated microporosity distributions using recent modelling approaches. The reproducibility of the step mould used was calculated to be 10 - 15 %. In the fourth phase, a study in an automotive casting plant was targeted to address the problem of high rejection rate of a cylinder head casting made from an A 354 alloy. In the foundry, the castings under investigation were usually made from the mixture of A 354 alloys from three different suppliers in uncontrolled proportions. In an attempt to solve this problem, a number of systematic experiments were carried out to assess the melt quality with RPT, and pressure filtration (PREFIL) tests. The results from these trials show that the bi-film index data from the RPT has a potential to be used in an industrial environment for routine melt quality control as the cause of high scrap was successfully identified with this technique. In the last phase of this work, state-of-the-art low pressure die casting (LPDC) experiments with an A 356 melt were carried out using the same step <b>mould</b> <b>die</b> used in second and third phases. Castings were made with two hydrogen levels, namely 0. 1 and 0. 2 mL/ 100 g melt. There is not much reported on microporosity simulation under LPDC conditions and reliable experimental validation is needed. The results from these LPDC trials provided a sound basis to assist and further develop the porosity modelling tools with the microporosity distribution data from carefully controlled LPDC experiments.
