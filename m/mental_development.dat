5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and <b>mental</b> <b>development</b> {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|Merit can {{be gained}} {{in a number}} of ways, such as giving, virtue and <b>mental</b> <b>development.</b> In addition, there are many forms of merit-making {{described}} in ancient Buddhist texts. A similar concept of kusala (Sanskrit: kusala) is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the Triple Gem, that is, the Buddha, his teachings, the Dhamma (Sanskrit: Dharma), and the Sangha. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of rituals, daily and weekly practice, and festivals. In addition, there is a widespread custom of transferring merit to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that kingship was often legitimated through it, and still is.|$|E
5|$|Unusual social {{development}} becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show {{less attention to}} social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, {{and do not have}} the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher <b>mental</b> <b>development</b> or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.|$|E

25|$|Barrie {{was very}} perspicacious in noticing {{many aspects of}} children's <b>mental</b> <b>development</b> decades before they were studied by {{cognitive}} psychologists.

25|$|PCBs {{have shown}} toxic and {{mutagenic}} effects by interfering with hormones in the body. PCBs, {{depending on the}} specific congener, {{have been shown to}} both inhibit and imitate estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Imitation of the estrogen compound can feed estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells, and possibly cause other cancers, such as uterine or cervical. Inhibition of estradiol can lead to serious developmental problems for both males and females, including sexual, skeletal, and <b>mental</b> <b>development</b> issues. In a cross-sectional study, PCBs were found to be negatively associated with testosterone levels in adolescent boys.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in January 1971 {{scientists}} {{conducted a}} series of neurolinguistic tests on Genie to determine and monitor the course and extent of her <b>mental</b> <b>development,</b> making her the first language-deprived child to undergo any detailed study of her brain. Genie's entire brain was physically intact and Shurley's sleep-studies found sleep patterns typical of a left-hemisphere dominant person, leading scientists to believe she was most likely right-handed. Over the following years multiple tests of her handedness bolstered this conclusion, as did observations of her in everyday situations. Based on their early tests, doctors suspected Genie's brain was extremely right-hemisphere dominant.|$|E

25|$|Stateside, Blackwell {{was faced}} with adversity, but did manage to get some media support from {{entities}} such as the New-York Tribune. She had very few patients, a situation she attributed to the stigma of women doctors as abortionists. In 1852, she began delivering lectures and published The Laws of Life with Special Reference to the Physical Education of Girls, her first work, a volume about the physical and <b>mental</b> <b>development</b> of girls. Although Elizabeth herself pursued a career and never married or carried a child, this treatise ironically concerned itself with the preparation of young women for motherhood.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations {{where there is}} a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutrition is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kwashiorkor, a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect physical and <b>mental</b> <b>development.</b> Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MSF sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished individuals.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones. Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity. Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds are products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's <b>mental</b> <b>development.</b>|$|E

Emerging research has supported a variety of influences (e. g., coaches, parents, self) and mechanisms (e. g., reflecting on our experiences, coach motivational climate) by which <b>mental</b> toughness <b>development</b> likely occurs. In this article we focus on a strengths-based approach to <b>mental</b> toughness <b>development,</b> which has received scant attention within the sport psychology literature. A brief history of strengths approaches to the development of human potential is presented and contrasted with assumptions of traditional psychological skills training. We then describe how a strengths-based approach was translated into practice using an example from professional cricket. The guidelines {{have been shown to be}} effective in elite sport settings, but we believe they may also prove effective in youth sport settings...|$|R
