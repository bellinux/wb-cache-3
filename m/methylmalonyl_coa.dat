We here functionally identify a <b>methylmalonyl</b> coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> mutase in C. glutamicum that is retained in all {{of the members of the}} suborder Corynebacterineae and is encoded by NCgl 1471, NCgl 1472, and NCgl 1470. In addition, we observe the presence of methylmalonate in C. glutamicum, reaching concentrations of up to 757 nmol g (dry weight) − 1 in propionate-grown cells, whereas in Escherichia coli no methylmalonate was detectable. As demonstrated with a mutase deletion mutant, the presence of methylmalonate in C. glutamicum is independent of mutase activity but possibly due to propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity. During growth on propionate, increased mutase activity has severe cellular consequences, resulting in growth arrest and excretion of succinate. The physiological context of the mutase present in members of the suborder Corynebacterineae is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Pathogenic {{mycobacteria}} {{contain a}} variety of unique fatty acids that have methyl branches at an even-numbered position at the carboxyl end and a long n-aliphatic chain. One such group of acids, called mycocerosic acids, is found uniquely in the cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria, and their biosynthesis is essential for growth and pathogenesis. Therefore, the biosynthetic pathway of the unique precursor of such lipids, <b>methylmalonyl</b> coenzyme A (<b>CoA),</b> represents an attractive target for developing new antituberculous drugs. Heterologous protein expression and purification of the individual subunits allowed the successful reconstitution of an essential acyl-CoA carboxylase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whose main role {{appears to be the}} synthesis of methylmalonyl-CoA. The enzyme complex was reconstituted from the α biotinylated subunit AccA 3, the carboxyltransferase β subunit AccD 5, and the ɛ subunit AccE 5 (Rv 3281). The kinetic properties of this enzyme showed a clear substrate preference for propionyl-CoA compared with acetyl-CoA (specificity constant fivefold higher), indicating that the main physiological role of this enzyme complex is to generate methylmalonyl-CoA for the biosynthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. The α and β subunits are capable of forming a stable α 6 -β 6 subcomplex but with very low specific activity. The addition of the ɛ subunit, which binds tightly to the α-β subcomplex, is essential for gaining maximal enzyme activity...|$|R

40|$|Methyl-branched {{fatty acids}} and {{polyketides}} {{occur in a}} variety of living organisms. Previous studies have established that multifunctional enzymes use <b>methylmalonyl</b> coenzyme A (<b>CoA)</b> as the substrate to generate methyl-branched products such as mycocerosic acids and polyketides. However, we do not know which of the component activities show selectivity for methylmalonyl-CoA in any biological system. A comparison of homologies of the domains of the multifunctional synthases that selectively use malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA suggested that the acyltransferase (AT) and beta-ketoacyl synthase (KS) domains might be responsible for the substrate selectivity. To test this hypothesis, we expressed the AT and KS domains of the mycocerosic acid synthase (MAS) gene from Mycobacterium bovis BCG in Escherichia coli and examined whether they confer to synthases that normally do not use methylmalonyl-CoA the ability to incorporate methylmalonyl-CoA into fatty acids. Both the AT and the KS domains of MAS showed selectivity for methylmalonyl-CoA over malonyl-CoA. Acyl carrier protein (ACP) -dependent elongation of the n-C 12 acyl primer mainly by one methylmalonyl-CoA unit was catalyzed by an E. coli fatty acid synthase preparation only {{in the presence of the}} expressed MAS domains. An ACP-dependent elongation of the n-C 20 acyl primer by one methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit was catalyzed by fatty acid synthase from Mycobacterium smegmatis only in the presence of the expressed MAS domains. These results show methylmalonyl-CoA selectivity for the AT and KS domains of MAS. These domains may be useful in producing novel polyketides by genetic engineering...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Aromatic {{polyketides}} are synthesised in streptomycetes by {{the successive}} condensation of simple carboxylic acids, catalysed by multienzyme complexes — the polyketide synthases (PKSs). Polyketide assembly intermediates are covalently linked as thioesters to the holo-acyl carrier protein (ACP) subunit of these type II PKSs. The ACP is primed for chain elongation by {{the transfer of}} malonate from malonyl CoA. Malonylation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) ACPs is catalysed by specific malonyl transferase (MT) enzymes. The type II PKS gene clusters apparently lack genes encoding such MT proteins, however. It has been proposed that the MT subunit of the FAS in streptomycetes catalyses malonylation of both FAS and PKS ACPs in vivo. Results: We demonstrate that type II PKS ACPs catalyse self-malonylation upon incubation with malonyl CoA in vitro. The self-malonylation reaction of the actinorhodin C 17 S holo-ACP has a Km for malonyl CoA. of 219 μM and a kcat of 0. 34 min− 1. Complete acylation of the PKS ACPs was observed with malonyl, <b>methylmalonyl</b> and acetoacetyl <b>CoAs.</b> No reaction was observed with acetyl and butyryl CoAs and FAS ACPs did not react {{with any of the}} substrates. Recombinant FAS MT from Streptomyces coelicolor did not accelerate the rate of malonylation. Conclusions: The catalytic self-acylation of type II PKS ACPs is an unprecedented reaction. We propose a reaction mechanism in which conserved arginines form a salt bridge with the acyl moiety and sequester it from bulk solvent. This work suggests that the β-ketoacyl synthase, chain length factor and ACP may constitute a truly minimal PKS in vivo...|$|R

50|$|Although {{the healthy}} body stores {{three to five}} years' worth of B12 in the liver, the usually undetected {{autoimmune}} activity in one's gut over a prolonged period of time leads to B12 depletion and the resulting anemia. B12 is required by enzymes for two reactions: the conversion of <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> to succinyl CoA, and the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. In the latter reaction, the methyl group of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is transferred to homocysteine to produce tetrahydrofolate and methionine. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme methionine synthase with B12 as an essential cofactor. During B12 deficiency, this reaction cannot proceed, {{which leads to the}} accumulation of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This accumulation depletes the other types of folate required for purine and thymidylate synthesis, which are required for the synthesis of DNA. Inhibition of DNA replication in red blood cells results in the formation of large, fragile megaloblastic erythrocytes.

50|$|<b>Methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> epimerase {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the catabolism of fatty acids with odd-length carbon chains. In the catabolism of even-chain saturated fatty acids, the β-oxidation pathway breaks down fatty acyl-CoA molecules in repeated sequences of four reactions to yield one acetyl CoA per repeated sequence. This means that, for each round of β-oxidation, the fatty acyl-Co-A is shortened by two carbons. If the fatty acid began with an even number of carbons, this process could break down an entire saturated fatty acid into acetyl-CoA units. If the fatty acid began with an odd number of carbons, however, β-oxidation would break the fatty acyl-CoA down until the three carbon propionyl-CoA is formed. In order to convert this to the metabolically useful succinyl-CoA, three reactions are needed. The propionyl-CoA is first carboxylated to (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA by the enzyme Propionyl-CoA carboxylase. <b>Methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> epimerase then catalyzes the rearrangement of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA to the (R) form in a reaction that uses a vitamin B12 cofactor and a resonance-stabilized carbanion intermediate.

50|$|Though {{not always}} grouped {{together}} with the inherited versions, a severe nutritional deficiency of vitamin B12 can also result in syndrome with identical symptoms and treatments as the genetic methylmalonic acidemias. <b>Methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> requires vitamin B12 to form succinyl-CoA. When the amount of B12 is insufficient for the conversion of cofactor methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, the buildup of unused methylmalonyl-CoA eventually leads to methylmalonic acidemia. This diagnosis is often used {{as an indicator of}} vitamin B12 deficiency in serum.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the MCEE gene, which encodes the <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> epimerase protein, also {{referred}} to as methylmalonyl racemase, will cause a much more mild form of the disorder than the related methymalonyl CoA mutase variant. Like the mutase, the epimerase also functions in breaking down the same substances, but to a significantly lesser extent than the mutase does. The phenotypic differences caused by a deficiency of the epimerase as opposed to the mutase are so mild that there is debate within the medical community {{as to whether or not}} this genetic deficiency can be considered a disorder or clinical syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{essential}} pathology {{is due to}} the inability to absorb vitamin B12 from the bowels, the solution is therefore injection of IV vitamin B12. Timing is essential, as some of the side effects of vitamin B12 deficiency are reversible (such as RBC indices, peripheral RBC smear findings such as hypersegmented neutrophils, or even high levels of <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA),</b> but some side effects are irreversible as they are of a neurological source (such as tabes dorsalis, and peripheral neuropathy). High suspicion should be exercised when a neonate, or a pediatric patient presents with anemia, proteinuria, sufficient vitamin B12 dietary intake, and no signs of pernicious anemia.|$|E
50|$|Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is {{a member}} of the {{isomerase}} subfamily of adensylcobalamin-dependent enzymes. Furthermore, it is classified as class I, as it is a ‘DMB-off’/’His-on’ enzyme. This refers to the nature of the AdoCbl cofactor in the active site of <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA.</b> AdoCbl is composed of a central cobalt-containing Corrin ring, an upper axial ligand (β-axial ligand), and a lower axial ligand (α-axial ligand). Both axial ligands are initially bonded to the central cobalt atom. In methylmalonyl-CoA mutase the β-axial ligand is 5’-deoxy-5’-adenosine and is involved in the free radical chemistry of the reaction. The α-axial ligand is 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) and is involved in organizing the active site to enable Histidine-610 to bond with Co, instead of DMB (the reason for the ‘DMB-off’/’His-on’ notation). The Histidine-610 residue is critical to enzyme functionality. Its binding increases the rate of homolytic β-axial ligand - Co bond breakage by a factor of 1012.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: <b>Methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> mutase {{catalyse}}s the interconversion of succinyl CoA and <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> via a {{free radical}} mechanism. The enzyme {{belongs to a}} family of enzymes that catalyse intramolecular rearrangement reactions in which a group and a hydrogen atom on adjacent carbons are exchanged. These enzymes use the cofactor adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B 12) which breaks to form an adenosyl radical, thus initiating the reaction. Determination {{of the structure of}} substrate-free <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> mutase was initiated to provide further insight into the mechanism of radical formation. Results: We report here two structures of <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> mutase from Propionibacterium shermanii. The first structure is of the enzyme in a nonproductive complex with CoA at 2. 5 å resolution. This structure serves {{as a model for the}} substrate-free conformation of the enzyme, as it is very similar to the second much poorer 2. 7 å resolution structure derived from a truly substrate-free crystal. The true substrate-free structure also shows the adenosyl group bound to the cobalt atom. Comparison of this structure with that of the previously reported complex of the enzyme with a substrate analogue shows that major conformational changes occur upon substrate binding. The substrate-binding site of the enzyme is located within a (βα) 8 TIM-barrel domain. In the absence of substrate, this TIM-barrel domain is split apart and the active site is accessible to solvent. When substrate binds, the barrel closes up with the substrate along its axis and the active site becomes completely buried. Conclusions: The closure of the active-site cavity upon substrate binding displaces the adenosyl group of the cofactor from the central cobalt atom into the active-site cavity. This triggers the formation of the free radical that initiates the rearrangement reaction. The TIM-barrel domain is substantially different from all others yet reported: in its unliganded form it is broken open, exposing the small hydrophilic sidechains which fill the centre. The typical barrel structure is only formed when substrate is bound...|$|E

In vitro, neither propionyl nor <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> affected the activity of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, ornithine transcarbamylase, nor the activation constant (KA) of carbamyl phosphate synthetase I for N-acetyl glutamate. Furthermore, rats injected with propionate showed no alteration of liver amino acid concentrations, which could explain impaired ureagenesis. Animals injected with methylmalonate showed an increase in both citrulline and aspartate, suggesting that argininosuccinic acid synthetase may also have been inhibited. Liver ATP levels were unchanged. Citrullinogenesis, measured in intact mitochondria from livers of injected animals, was reduced 20 - 25 % by 20 mmol/kg of propionate or methylmalonate (compared with acetate). This effect was attributable to an impairment in the normal rise of liver N-acetyl glutamate content after amino acid injection. Thus, carbamyl phosphate synthetase I activation was reduced. Liver levels of acetyl CoA and free CoA were reduced. Levels of unidentified acyl CoA derivatives rose, presumably reflecting the accumulation of propionyl and <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA.</b> Thus, the principal mechanism for hyperammonemia induced by these acids is depletion of liver N-acetyl glutamate, which is in turn attributable to depletion of acetyl CoA and/or competitive inhibition by propionyl and <b>methylmalonyl</b> <b>CoA</b> of N-acetyl glutamate synthetase.
