50|$|Macolor macularis, {{commonly}} known as the <b>midnight</b> <b>snapper</b> is a marine fish native to the western Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5000|$|The {{black and}} white snapper can reach a maximum length of 75 cm, though most do not exceed 35 cm. [...] Its fins and eyes are black and its body varies in color from light grey to black {{depending}} on age. Juveniles are typically striped, changing in complete black when adult. The {{black and white}} snapper is solitary when juvenile, but forms large schools as adults. They feed on crustaceans and small fishes. [...] It is sometimes confused with its congener, the <b>midnight</b> <b>snapper,</b> M. macularis.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Midnight</b> <b>Snapper</b> Macolor macularis, is {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from the Indian exclusive economic zone based on the two specimens collected from Cochin Fisheries Harbour, Kerala on the south-west coast of India on December 2012 and October 2013. Morphometric and meristic data of the specimens are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The DNA “barcode”, {{the partial}} {{sequence}} of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI), was assessed for species identification within the genus Macolor. The <b>Midnight</b> <b>Snapper,</b> Macolor macularis Fowler 1931, is compared with its only congener, the Black and White Snapper, Macolor niger (Forsskål 1775), both collected from the south-west coast of India. The examination of fresh specimens of the two species showed diagnostic anatomical and coloration differences and the DNA barcoding showed a genetic divergence of 3. 51 % between the species. We provide a description and illustrations of DNA-barcoded specimens, assess the reliability of some key marking characters for the two species, and document the DNA barcodes for Indian specimen...|$|E
