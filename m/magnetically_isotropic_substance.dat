40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{electroplated}} <b>magnetically</b> <b>isotropic</b> and anisotropic soft alloys and screen-printed soft ferrites {{applicable to}} micromachined micromagnetic devices are fabricated and characterized using {{in situ measurement}} techniques. Appropriate magnetic materials and deposition methods, such as electroplating and screen-printing techniques, are examined and material test structures are fabricated. Following material characterization, micromachined inductors with three-dimensional structure are fabricated to determine {{the usefulness of the}} magnetic materials and deposition methods. The micromachined inductor is a key component and geometry for realizing micromagnetic devices such as amplifiers, filters, sensors and actuators. Three different material types are studied in this work. Electroplated <b>magnetically</b> <b>isotropic</b> soft alloys, permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20), orthonol (Ni 50 Fe 50) and amorphous cobalt–iron-copper (CoFeCu) alloys, are studied, followed by electroplated magnetically anisotropic soft alloys of permalloy (Ni 80 Fe 20) and supermalloy (NiFeMo), which have magnetically easy and hard axes. Finally, screen-printed polymers filled with soft ferrite (NiZn and MnZn) powders are fabricated and characterized. 1...|$|R

Thus, the very principle of paramagnetic NSE {{used for the}} study of <b>magnetically</b> <b>isotropic</b> systems is based on the vector properties of the neutron polarization change in the scattering, which implies that the incoming and outgoing neutron spin directions are not parallel. Another, conventional polarization analysis feature is the opposite sign of the NSE signal for nuclear and nuclear-spin incoherent scattering, or the signal parallel and perpendicular magnetic fluctuations {{in the presence of a}} strong magnetizing field. In these cases the measured NSE spectra are the algebraic sums of two components. In its actual form, however, NSE does not allow one to investigate spin-flip and non-spin-Rip scattering channels independently from each other.

We investigated the impact of the growth regime by means of x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements and obtained signs of its influence on the local atomic order.

The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several major difficulties {{in the application of}} Active Contours. Primarily, a technique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active Contours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon expanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing the touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded remaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to trace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake curve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this criterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and continuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of the burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively. Secondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the contour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active Contours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing stages. By simulating the wave propagating in the <b>isotropic</b> <b>substance</b> at the final stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC based on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.
