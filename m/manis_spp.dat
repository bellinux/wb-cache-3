40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} international trade with <b>Manis.</b> <b>spp.</b> according to the CITES database during the period 2002 - 2013. <b>Manis</b> <b>spp.</b> was classified in appendix II CITES in 1995. In 2000 there was an unsuccesfull attempt to reclassified <b>Manis</b> <b>spp.</b> to appendix I CITES. In this year the zero quota was set for Asian pangolins for commercial purpose. A rapid increase of an illegal trade was noticed after the setting of zero quota. The most frequent trade with pangolins was in these forms: 1) derivatives, 2) specimens, 3) scales, 4) live pangolins and 5) skins. Asian pangolinsÂ´ species were traded mostly in forms of derivatives, specimens, scales and skins in the period 2002 - 2013. M. javanica and M. pentadactyla with medium and large distribution area were quantitatively the most traded species, respectively. Main importers of Asian forms of pangolins were: USA (derivatives and specimens), China (scales in kg) and Indonesia (scales in pieces) and Mexico (skins). The African pangolin M. tricuspis was the third most frequent species in the international trade and was traded especially in form of live pangolins. M. tricuspis lives {{in one of the}} largest distribution area. Main importer of live pangolins was Italy. Breeding pangolins in captivity is due to the specific feeding requirements demanding. There are about 46 individuals of pangolins in Zoos all over the world, whereas in Europe there are only 2 pangolins in the Leipzig Zoo...|$|E
40|$|Asian {{pangolins}} are a highly-threatened species group, mainly due to {{the perceived}} medicinal value of their scales. Increased demand from China has resulted in pangolins being the most trafficked mammal in the world. Three pangolin species are reported to occur in Bangladesh: Manis pentadactyla, M. crassicaudata, and M. javanica. No peer-reviewed studies exist detailing these species' current distribution or status within Bangladesh. A literature review was conducted resulting in the clarification of conflicting reports and misidentified observations and specimen records. In this paper, we also report {{the current status of}} pangolins (<b>Manis</b> <b>spp.)</b> in Bangladesh based on semi-structured interviews, camera trapping, media queries, and field surveys employing traditional ecological knowledge and non-randomized transect surveys. Ethnozoological knowledge pertaining to the natural history of M. pentadactyla is also reported from experienced Mro tribal hunters. The critically endangered M. pentadactyla was verified to occur in northwest, northeast, and southeast Bangladesh in natural and degraded habitats. Interviews with the Mro tribe in the southeast indicate that pangolin populations there were likely extirpated in 2014 due to skilled commercial collection beginning in 2010. Evidence of extant M. crassicaudata and M. javanica populations remain unverified and questionable, and historical records of M. crassicaudata and M. javanica are likely a result of misidentification...|$|E
