5|$|In addition, Sarria gave a small {{selection}} of costumes, accessories, and documents to the Oakland Museum of California—including a cape and headdress {{that he wore}} in performances of his comic version of Aida at The Black Cat. Sarria continued to own a smaller collection of art, artifacts and documentation; he had said that he expected to eventually donate those <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> the GLBT Historical Society. An article published in The Atlantic in 2011 asserted that Sarria had also donated <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> the Smithsonian Institution. This claim appears to be erroneous, as Sarria stated in 2012 that he declined the Smithsonian's request.|$|E

5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} apart by civilians {{who used the}} <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> rebuild their own homes, {{levelled}} out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E

5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} moderator, accumulation of Wigner energy followed by a sudden, spontaneous release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> combust.|$|E

The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. Afterwards, the branch served a scrapyard owned by the Roselli brothers.

5|$|It {{came to the}} Queen's {{attention}} that Frenchman Jean Laborde, who had been shipwrecked off Madagascar in 1832, was knowledgeable {{in the production of}} cannons, muskets and gunpowder.

5|$|Norwegian army {{units were}} skiing for sport (and prizes) in the 18th century. Starting {{in the latter}} part of the 20th century, {{technique}} evolved from the striding in-track classic technique to include skate-skiing, which occurs on courses that have been groomed with wide lanes for those using the technique. At the same time, equipment evolved from skis and poles that were made of wood and other natural <b>materials</b> <b>to</b> comprising such man-made materials as fiberglass, carbon fiber, and polyethylene plastics.|$|E
