5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass of dry air, known as the <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio,</b> is measured in grams of water per kilogram of dry air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E

Observations with a selective and sensitive instrument that uses the laser induced fluorescence technique for direct measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), show a significant increase of NO 2 <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios,</b> in the evening, when a fire plume reached the observations site.

40|$|This {{research}} work puts into application the regression equation derived by Ibearugbulem for a four component mixture of concrete {{to develop a}} model for the easy forecast of 28 th day flexural strengths. To ensure an accurate forecast, the <b>mix</b> <b>ratios</b> to be predicted must fall within the boundaries defined for a four component simplex latex structure. The materials used in the laboratory experiment include; water, Ordinary Portland Cement, river sand, river gravel, and periwinkle shells. River gravel and periwinkle shells were combined at a volumetric <b>mix</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1 : 1 thereby reducing the number of material components from five to four. Manual mixing operation was adopted while all concrete ingredients except for the coarse aggregates were batched by weight. A total of 30 <b>mix</b> <b>ratios</b> were utilised in the concreting operation. While the first 15 <b>mix</b> <b>ratios</b> were used in the formulation of the model, the last 15 <b>mix</b> <b>ratios</b> were used in the validation of the formulated model using fisher’s statistical test. Three concrete beams were cast for each <b>mix</b> <b>ratio</b> of which a total of 90 prototype beams measuring 150 x 150 x 600 mm were produced and cured for 28 days in an open curing tank filled with potable water. From the statistical analysis, the calculated f-value 1. 05 was less than the allowable f-value of 2. 48 obtained from statistical table at 95 % confidence level. This shows that the difference between the laboratory and model flexural strength results is not significant. Therefore, the formulated model is adequate and reliable for predicting the 28 th day flexural strengths of periwinkle shell-river gravel concrete when given <b>mix</b> <b>ratios...</b>|$|R

Model time-slice simulations for present-day {{and end of the}} 21 st century conditions were performed under the Representative Concentrations Pathways (RCP) climate scenario RCP 8. 5. All simulations reveal a strong seasonality in transport, especially over the tropics. The highest CO-tracer <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> aloft occur during boreal winter when strong vertical transport is co-located with biomass burning emission source regions. A consistent and robust decrease in future CO-tracer <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> throughout most of the troposphere, especially in the tropics, and an increase around the tropopause is found across the four CCMs in both winter and summer. Decreases in CO-tracer <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> in the tropical troposphere are associated with reduced convective mass fluxes in this region, which in turn may reflect a weaker Hadley Cell circulation in the future climate. Increases in CO-tracer <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> near the tropopause are largely attributable to a rise in tropopause height enabling lofting to higher altitudes, although a poleward shift in the mid-latitude jets may also play a minor role in the extra-tropical upper troposphere.

All VOC <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> measured were higher at the urban site (e. g. acetaldehyde, isoprene, benzene, and toluene with averages up to 1. 68, 0. 31, 0. 58 and 2. 71 ppbv, respectively), with the exception of some short-chain oxygenated VOCs such as acetone (with similar averages of 0. 7 – 1. 6 ppbv at both sites). The average diurnal pattern also differed between the sites. Most of the VOCs at the urban location showed their highest <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> in the morning and evening. These peaks coincided with traffic during rush hour, the main origin of most of the VOCs analyzed. Between these two peaks, the sea breeze transported the urban air inland, thus helping to lower the VOC loading at the urban site. At the rural site, most of the measured VOCs were advected by the midday sea breeze, yielding the highest daily VOC <b>mixing</b> <b>ratios</b> (e. g. acetaldehyde, isoprene, benzene, and toluene with averages up to 0. 65, 0. 07, 0. 19, and 0. 41 ppbv, respectively).

25|$|The {{stratosphere}} is {{the middle}} layer of the Uranian atmosphere, in which temperature generally increases with altitude from 53K in the tropopause to between 800 and 850K at the base thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere {{is caused by the}} downward heat conduction from the hot thermosphere as well as by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and the complex hydrocarbons formed as a result of methane photolysis. The methane enters the stratosphere through the cold tropopause, where its <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio</b> relative to molecular hydrogen is about 3, three times below saturation.

Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The <b>mixing</b> <b>ratio</b> is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known.
