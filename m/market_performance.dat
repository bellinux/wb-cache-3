Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 graphics processor, manufactured by NEC, in the production of their mainboard.

Against McDonald's struggles, Burger King's successful introduction of the Big King was later paired with a newly introduced, improved type of french fry in November of the same year. Along with these two product introductions, the company began a massive financial investment in product development across all parts of its menu which, in total, provided a boost in the chain's <b>market</b> <b>performance.</b> The mirrored failure and success for the two companies showed itself in the market share of the United States fast-food market: Burger King's share rose a percentage point, to 19.2%, while McDonald's share slipped 0.4 points, to 41.9% by the end of 1997.

Mike Abary, {{senior vice president of}} Samsung's U.S. PC and tablet businesses, also stated that the company was unable to build the Ativ Tab to meet its target price point—considering that lower cost was intended to be a selling point for Windows RT devices. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang expressed disappointment over the <b>market</b> <b>performance</b> of Windows RT, but called on Microsoft to continue increasing its concentration on the ARM platform.

In May 2013, reports surfaced that HTC had scrapped plans to produce a 12-inch Windows RT tablet as it would cost too much to produce, and that there would be greater demand for smaller devices.|$|E

The objective is to study the constructs as phenomenon, rather than as a process. The objective is to understand how <b>marketing</b> <b>performance</b> framework should be linked with marketing strategy, which factors influence marketing implementation in terms of adaptation and standardization in local business units of MNC and what kind of control tools can be used to manage the <b>marketing</b> <b>performance.</b> The theoretical framework of the study consists of marketing strategy implementation and <b>marketing</b> <b>performance</b> framework literature. First, marketing strategy implementation at MNCs is discussed in terms of factors influencing standardization and adaptation. Also the concept of marketing control and forms of control are introduced. Second, the concept of <b>marketing</b> <b>performance</b> frameworks are examined within MNC-context aiming at finding a link between <b>marketing</b> strategy and <b>performance</b> framework. The empirical part of this study is conducted following the principles of a single case-study method, since the research is conducted within one MNC.
