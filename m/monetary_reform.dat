5|$|Despite the {{territorial}} truncation, 14th-century Poland experienced {{a period of}} accelerated economic development and increasing prosperity. This included further expansion and modernization of agricultural settlements, the development of towns and their greater role in briskly growing trade, mining and metallurgy.

5|$|The Soviet <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> of 1991, {{commonly}} referred to as the Pavlov reform, was the last <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official explanation that this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the {{government}} was involved in launching Gutt's <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> plan {{as well as the}} disarming of the resistance as part of the transition to stability. A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E

Is it a problem, however, that international welfare spillover effects seldom receive much consideration {{in the design of}} <b>monetary</b> <b>reforms?</b> Surprisingly, the answer may be no. Under plausible conditions, as domestic rules improve and international financial markets become more complete, the Nash and cooperative monetary rule setting games converge. We base our analysis on a utility-theoretic sticky-wage (new open economy macroeconomics) model; the question we pose simply could not have been adequately formulated using earlier models of monetary cooperation. ...|$|R

5|$|Gia Long {{abolished}} all large landholding by princes, nobles {{and high}} officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with {{a portion of}} the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired and new ones constructed, with the north-south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organised a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E
5|$|As Prime Minister from 14 January 1991 to 22 August 1991 Pavlov {{initiated}} the 1991 Soviet <b>monetary</b> <b>reform,</b> {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, in early 1991. Early on he told the media that the reform was initiated to halt the flow of Soviet roubles transported to the Soviet Union from abroad. Although ridiculed at the time, the statement was later proven to be true. In June the same year, Pavlov called for a transfer of power from the President of the Soviet Union to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers. When that failed, he joined a plot to oust Gorbachev. In August, he participated in the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, which tried to prevent the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Pavlov was arrested for his involvement in the coup and went on to work in the banking sector in post-Soviet Russia. He was succeeded as premier by Ivan Silayev.|$|E

40|$|During World War II, the {{art market}} {{experienced}} a massive boom in occupied countries. The discretion, the inflation proof character, the absence of market intervention and the possibility to resell artworks abroad have been suggested to explain why investing in artworks {{was one of the}} most interesting opportunities under the German boot.

Despite the reform of Aurelian, silver content continued to decline, until the <b>monetary</b> <b>reform</b> of Diocletian. In addition to establishing the tetrarchy, Diocletian devised the following system of denominations: an aureus struck at the standard of 60 to the pound, a new silver coin struck at the old Neronian standard known as the argenteus, and a new large bronze coin that contained two percent silver.|$|E

Using annual data from 1980 to 2012, and after controlling for financial and <b>monetary</b> <b>reforms,</b> the study demonstrates a unidirectional causal relationship that runs from financial development to economic growth. The evidence shows that financial development; banking sector development in particular, is not a passive response to economic growth. Instead, it is a critical tool for accelerating economic growth. Policy implications of this evidence are that the banking sector in Zimbabwe must be supported with policies that encourage credit expansion and innovation to support economic growth. The equities market, on the other hand, requires more investor-friendly innovations and policies, especially with regard to trading efficiency and foreign investor participation in the primary market. In combination, these policy interventions should be able to magnify the positive effect of financial development on economic growth...|$|R
