500|$|Things did improve for Churchill-Redman and {{the sales}} rose {{dramatically}} from £200,000 in 1946 to £1M by 1955. This {{was in part}} because of innovative product development at the Halifax site which ultimately produced the CR P5 and P6 profiling lathes: the conclusion of this development is described by Jeremy as being a range of [...] "fully automatic, <b>multi-tool</b> and profiling lathes. A lathe with an automatic feed and delivery heralded an automatic machine tool production line." [...] The expansion of the motor vehicle industry once again was a significant factor, driving demand for machine tools much as the bicycling boom of the 1890s had done. In 1957 the Scotswood operation moved across the River Tyne to Blaydon, where a factory was built especially for the manufacturing purpose intended. Among other products from that site was the Vertimax lathe, which used a vertical spindle and was of interest to motor vehicle manufacturers. This particular design originated from James Anderson, a garage owner in Glasgow, during the war and whose business was brought into the Churchill group of companies. Churchill Gear Machines Ltd was part of the group, having been established in Blaydon since 1956: the cause of its origin and the nature of its products is uncertain.|$|E
2500|$|Microsoft {{introduced}} <b>Multi-Tool</b> Notepad, a mouse-based {{text editor}} written by Richard Brodie, with the $195 Microsoft Mouse in May 1983 at the Spring COMDEX computer expo in Atlanta. [...] Also introduced at that COMDEX was <b>Multi-Tool</b> Word, designed by Charles Simonyi {{to work with}} the mouse. Most watching Simonyi's demonstration had never heard of a mouse. Microsoft released the Microsoft Mouse in June 1983, and the boxed mouse and <b>Multi-Tool</b> Notepad began shipping in July. Initial sales were modest, as there was little one could do with it except run the three demonstration programs included in the box (a tutorial, practice application and Notepad) or program interfaces to it. The <b>Multi-Tool</b> product line began with expert systems for the Multiplan spreadsheet. On the suggestion of Rowland Hanson, who also convinced Bill Gates to change the name [...] "Interface Manager" [...] to [...] "Windows" [...] before the release of Windows 1.0, the <b>Multi-Tool</b> name was killed by the time Word shipped in November 1983. Hanson's rationale was that [...] "the brand is the hero". People didn't associate the stand-alone name <b>Multi-Tool</b> with Microsoft, and Hanson wanted to make Microsoft the hero, so the Microsoft name replaced [...] "Multi-Tool".|$|E

2500|$|During the videotaping of each episode, Stroud {{is alone}} and {{operates}} all the cameras himself, while his support team monitors {{him from a}} distance. [...] He is equipped with only his clothes, camera equipment, his harmonica, a <b>multi-tool,</b> and often [...] "everyday items" [...] relevant to the episode's particular survival situation or locale. For safety purposes, Stroud carries an emergency satellite phone and normally has daily radio contact with his support crew that is always within rescue range. However, Stroud has stated that while videotaping several episodes, {{there were times when}} his emergency phone did not work, leaving him totally alone and has mentioned his concern that his rescue crew may become stranded with him. On a few occasions, Stroud has also been provided with a rifle for safety reasons or as part of the survival situation; in the first-season episode [...] "Canadian Arctic", the local experts he consulted insisted that because of polar bears they would not let him go without a rifle.|$|E
