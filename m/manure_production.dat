Primary cecal impactions usually consist of dry feed material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days.

By saving this e-waste going to dumping ground it has also reduced water and air pollution as these e-waste leaches in water and generates toxic waste.These are some of the innovative and eco-friendly initiatives that college has started and look forward for plenty more.In an effort to reduce the carbon footprint the college is going Green.|$|E
40|$|Poultry manure {{can be used}} as {{fertilizer}} {{or other}} value-added application, such as energy generation using anaerobic digestion or thermo conversion. However, improper management of poultry farm manure can cause environmental problems including air and water pollution. Correctly calculating and documenting the quantities of poultry <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> on a farm and in an area is important for effective manure management and utilization, and environmental protection. Calculating <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> requires the numbers of poultry and the <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> rates of the poultry. Inventory data on numbers of poultry in Indiana were available from two major sources: USDA and IDEM. The USDA census provided the most detailed poultry inventory data. The IDEM data have more information coverage over CAFOs/CFOs. However, these databases do not always match with each other. There are different methods and standards for <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> rates that vary considerably and can introduce errors. In order to examine this issue, different sources of poultry inventory and <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> rates were collected. Experimental data from four Indiana commercial laying hen houses were also used. These inventory and <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> data were compared and analyzed to select the relatively reliable estimation methods for the <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> calculation. The results from the experimental data were used to calculate the laying hen <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> rates and to compare with other sources from the literature. To enhance the methods, several factors are considered such as the life cycle of each type of poultry, the cleaning periods after the poultry is removed from the farms, and the adjustments of different units used by different sources were used for comparison analysis with other sources. The USDA inventory data on state-wide <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> and number of poultry were assessed and validated. The inventory data were used to calculate the <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> using <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> rates from different publications. A set of rates was determined when the calculated <b>manure</b> <b>production</b> had a 10 % difference from the reported.
