5000|$|The Orwell {{provides}} a popular venue for sailing. Interest originally centred on the hamlet of <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> (featured in two children's novels by Arthur Ransome: We Didn't Mean To Go To Sea and Secret Water), which {{is home to}} the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Sailing Club and its Hard. Ransome had kept his yacht Selina King at the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> anchorage in 1937-39.|$|R
50|$|From {{the opening}} of the canals, {{development}} of mills continued on a much larger scale. Mills in Ancoats included, Victoria Mills, Wellington Mill, Brunswick Mill, India Mills, Dolton Mills, Lonsdale Mills, Phoenix Mill, Lloydsfield Mill and Sedgewick Mill, Decker Mill (owned by the Murray brothers), New Mill, Beehive Mill, Little Mill, Paragon Mill, Royal <b>Mill</b> and <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill.</b>|$|R
40|$|Ten {{kinds of}} rice flours were {{prepared}} by several milling methods including hammer <b>mill,</b> <b>pin</b> <b>mill</b> and blade mill. The rice flours were mixed with vital gluten (8 : 2) {{and used for}} bread making. Mean particle size of the rice flours ranged from 40. 9 μm to 407. 2 μm and damaged starch content from 6. 1 % to 27. 1 %. Specific volume of the breads ranged from 1. 98 mL/g to 3. 82 mL/g. Correlation of rice flour properties and bread qualities were analyzed. Negative correlation was found between amount of damaged starch and specific volume (r=− 0. 670, p< 0. 05). Mean particle size of the flour was not correlated with specific volume. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first micromachined {{double-sided}} contactless WR 03 pin-flange adapter for 220 - 325 GHz based on gap waveguide technology. The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m. The performance of the micromachined pin flange {{has been compared to}} a <b>milled</b> <b>pin</b> flange, a choke flange and to standard waveguide connections. The micromachined pin flange is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to the <b>milled</b> <b>pin</b> flange and choke flange. The benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin flanges and the better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without screws fixing the flanges. The flanges have also been applied to measure two devices, a straight rectangular waveguide of 1. 01 inch and a ridge gap resonator. In all cases, the micromachined pin flange performed flawlessly while the standard flange experienced significant losses at already small gaps...|$|R
50|$|From {{the opening}} of the Rochdale Canal in 1804 the {{development}} of mills continued on a much larger scale. Mills in Ancoats included Victoria Mills, Wellington Mill, Brunswick Mill, India Mills, Dolton Mills, Lonsdale Mills, Phoenix Mill, Lloydsfield Mill, Sedgewick Mill, Decker Mill (owned by the Murray brothers), New Mill, Beehive Mill, Little Mill, Paragon Mill, Royal <b>Mill</b> and <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill.</b>|$|R
50|$|During World War II <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> {{was home}} to Royal Navy Motor Launches and to a {{degaussing}} vessel created from a herring drifter. <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> and Woolverstone were home ports to many Landing craft tanks used in the invasion of Normandy in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> {{has often}} {{been the subject of}} {{painting}} and photography, and is a popular yacht and dinghy sailing destination. During WWII many yachts were placed for storage west of the hamlet in what were then called 'the saltings,' awaiting the cessation of hostilities. The moorings in the river were home to the Royal Harwich One Design Class boats for many years in the 1940s. A feature film about sailing, [...] "Ha'penny Breeze," [...] was filmed here in 1950, featuring the Welsh actress Gwyneth Vaughan. There is a boatyard, and the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Sailing Club has hosted an annual Barge Match since 1962. The Grindle is a small stream that flows alongside <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Common down to the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Hard on the foreshore. It is used by dinghies to ferry sailors ashore.Sadly due to the influx of houseboats and Dutch barges let out to holiday makers and week enders there is a serious risk health risk to all those using the waters of <b>pin</b> <b>Mill</b> for leisure activities especially to the many children who in hot weather play , paddle and swim in the water which is fouled daily by over 40 vessels (houseboats and holiday lets)all dumping raw sewage and foul water onto the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> foreshore. As a result the area on a hot day carries the stench of a sewage works.|$|R

5000|$|The {{expression}} [...] "pin mill" [...] means a pin factory, {{and also}} a word for a wheel with projecting pins used in leather production. But neither ofthese activities {{are known to have}} taken place at <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill,</b> so the origin of the name remains uncertain. <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> was once a busy landing point for ship-borne cargo, a centre for the repair of Thames sailing barges and home to many small industries such as sail making, a maltings (now a workshop) and a brickyard. The east coast {{has a long history of}} smuggling, in which <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> and the Butt and Oyster pub allegedly played key parts.|$|R
5000|$|In Arthur Ransome's 1937 novel for {{children}} We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea, the young adventurers {{stay at the}} real-life Alma Cottage, situated just by the Butt and Oyster pub. <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> also features in the next book Secret Water. Ransome had his own boats built at Harry King's boatyard in <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> and had kept his yacht Selina King at the <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> anchorage in 1937-39, although he himself lived for some time at Levington {{on the opposite side}} of the Orwell. In 1911 he had declined an offer to go sailing with the bibliographer Walter Ledger, as he was told by Oscar Wilde's friend Robbie Ross that Ledger had episodes of homicidal mania. Later though he said he always regretted that I did not sail with him, for he kept his [...] "Blue Bird" [...] at <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill,</b> and, if I had gone, I should have known that charming anchorage twenty years earlier.|$|R

50|$|To produce {{whole wheat}} flour, 100% of the bran and germ must be reintroduced {{to the white}} flour that the roller milling system was {{originally}} designed to separate it from. Therefore, these elements are first ground on another <b>mill</b> (usually a <b>pin</b> <b>mill).</b> These finer bran and germ fractions are then reintroduced to the endosperm (white flour) to produce whole wheat flour made of 100% of the kernel of wheat.|$|R

50|$|Great Ancoats Street is {{a street}} in the inner suburb of Ancoats, Manchester, England.Much of Great Ancoats Street was {{originally}} named Ancoats Lane and was the location of Ancoats Hall. The street passed through a thriving manufacturing area during the 19th century. It was {{in close proximity to}} the Ashton and Rochdale canals. A number of cotton mills built in the early and mid-Victorian period are nearby, some of which have been converted into residential or office buildings, such as Albion <b>Mills.</b> The <b>Pin</b> <b>Mill</b> Works at the junction with Fairfield Street was a late 18th-century pin works, that became a cotton mill run by J & J Thompson and works for dyeing and calico-printing. Brownsfield Mill, a Grade II* listed building, was built in 1825.|$|R

50|$|The most {{utilized}} grinding <b>mills</b> include <b>pin,</b> hammer, and disk mills, {{but many}} machines are utilized for more specific processes. To maintain a high starch extraction, the grains {{will go through}} a degermination process. This process removes the germ and fiber (pericarp) first, and the endosperm is recovered in several sizes: grits, cones, meal, and flow. It {{is important to note}} that the gluten protein matrix is not separated from the starch.|$|R

40|$|Stirred Mills are {{becoming}} increasingly used for fine and ultra-fine grinding. This technology is still poorly understood when used in the mineral processing context. This makes process optimisation of such devices problematic. 3 D DEM simulations {{of the flow of}} grinding media in pilot scale tower <b>mills</b> and <b>pin</b> <b>mills</b> are carried out in order to investigate the relative performance of these stirred mills. In {{the first part of this}} paper, media flow patterns and energy absorption rates and distributions were analysed to provide a good understanding of the media flow and the collisional environment in these mills. In this second part we analyse steady state coherent flow structures, liner stress and wear by impact and abrasion. We also examine mixing and transport efficiency. Together these provide a comprehensive understanding of all the key processes operating in these mills and a clear understanding of the relative performance issues. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
