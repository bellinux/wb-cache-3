A neural network with three hidden nodes and one linear output node operated on 15 km resolution data at 183 1 and 183 7 GHz, plus the cosine of scan angle, to produce estimates that match well the morphology of NEXRAD hurricane and frontal precipitation data smoothed to 15 -km resolution. A second neural network operated on the same three parameters used in the first network, but smoothed to 50 -km resolution, plus spatially-filtered cold perturbations detected in three AMSU tropospheric temper-ature-sounding channels (channels 4 – 6), which also have 50 -km resolution. Comparison with the same NEXRAD data smoothed to 50 -km resolution yielded root mean square (rms) discrepancies for two frontal systems and two passes over Hurricane Georges of 1. 1 mm/h, and 1. 4 dB for those precipitation events over 4 mm/h. Only 8. 9 % of the total AMSU-derived rainfall was in areas where AMSU saw more than 1 - mm/h and NEXRAD saw less than 1 -mm/h, and only 6. 2 % of the total NEXRAD-derived rainfall was in areas where NEXRAD saw more than 1 -mm/h and AMSU saw less than 1 -mm/h.

The remotely sensed Ts products are retrieved from the following: 1) Ka-band passive microwave (MW) observations using several of space-based MW radiometers and 2) thermal infrared observa-tions from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on two satellite platforms. Both methods show similar accuracy when compared to ground observations, although the dynamic range and mean differ significantly. However, a direct comparison of the two products at the same overpass time reveals a strikingly constant relation, with a standard error of∼ 4 K. The results of this study indicate that a merged Ts product of both MODIS and MW observations is feasible and would decrease the amount of data gaps and increase the sampling frequency for this region to 12 observations a day.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Microwave</b> <b>Radiometry</b> is a {{non-invasive}} method which determines within seconds the in vivo temperature of internal tissues {{at a depth}} of 3 - 7 cm with an accuracy of ± 0. 2 °C. In this proof-of-concept study, we tested the hypothesis that, in absence of relevant clinical signs, increased local temperature detected by <b>microwave</b> <b>radiometry</b> reflects subclinical synovial inflammation, using ultrasound as reference method. METHODS: Knees of healthy controls, subjects with recent knee trauma and symptom-free patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis were examined by placing the <b>microwave</b> <b>radiometry</b> sensor, a) at the upper one third of the anterior surface of the thigh (control-point), and b) over the suprapatellar recess. Ultrasound was performed immediately after and the possible presence of fluid and/or synovitis was correlated with <b>microwave</b> <b>radiometry</b> findings. RESULTS: In 30 healthy and 10 injured knees the temperature was always lower than thigh (32. 3 ± 1. 1 and 31. 8 ± 1. 4 versus 34. 1 ± 0. 9 and 33. 6 ± 1. 2 °C with a difference (ΔΤ) of - 1. 8 ± 0. 2 and - 1. 9 ± 0. 4 °C respectively). Of 40 RA and 20 osteoarthritis knees examined, ultrasound findings indicative of subclinical inflammation (fluid effusion and/or Doppler signal) were found in 24 and 12, respectively, in which the temperature was higher than healthy knees and ΔΤ was lower (- 0. 9 ± 0. 7 in RA and - 1. 0 ± 0. 5 in osteoarthritis versus - 1. 8 ± 0. 2 °C, p< 0. 001). The 5 RA knees with power Doppler findings indicative of grade 2 inflammation had a ΔΤ 3 times lower compared to healthy (- 0. 6 ± 0. 6, p =  0. 007), whereas the 9 RA and the 7 osteoarthritis knees with additionally fluid effusion, had even lower ΔΤ (- 0. 4 ± 0. 7, p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: Using a safe, rapid and easy-to-perform method, such as <b>microwave</b> <b>radiometry,</b> thermal changes within the knee joint may reflect non-clinically apparent joint inflammation.

40|$|Brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) plays an {{important}} role in whole body metabolism and with appropriate stimulus could potentially mediate weight gain and insulin sensitivity. Although imaging techniques are available to detect subsurface BAT, there are currently no viable methods for continuous acquisition of BAT energy expenditure. <b>Microwave</b> (MW) <b>radiometry</b> is an emerging technology that allows the quantification of tissue temperature variations at depths of several centimeters. Such temperature differentials may be correlated with variations in metabolic rate, thus providing a quantitative approach to monitor BAT metabolism. In order to optimize MW radiometry, numerical and experimental phantoms with accurate dielectric properties are required to develop and calibrate radiometric sensors. Thus, we present for the first time, the characterization of relative permittivity and electrical conductivity of brown (BAT) and white (WAT) adipose tissues in rats across the MW range 0. 5 - 10 GHz. Measurements were carried out in situ and post mortem in six female rats of approximately 200 g. A Cole-Cole model was used to fit the experimental data into a parametric model that describes the variation of dielectric properties as a function of frequency. Measurements confirm that the dielectric properties of BAT (εr = 14. 0 - 19. 4, σ = 0. 3 - 3. 3 S/m) are significantly higher than those of WAT (εr = 9. 1 - 11. 9, σ = 0. 1 - 1. 9 S/m), in accordance with the higher water content of BAT...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a general analysis of correlation measurements in an interferometer or a radiometer based on noise injection and/or switching and measurement of normal-ized correlations (e. g., imaging synthetic aperture or polarimet-ric radiometers). A compact unifying notation for denormalizing the measured normalized correlations {{in the presence}} of noise injection in {{one or both of the}} receiving channels is presented. Technological limitations are also assessed by evaluating the effect of associated approximations. Finally, the approach is validated by experimental results of the measurement and calibration of related front-end nonidealities, namely, the finite isolation of the front-end switch. The methods presented in this paper are illus-trated by a thorough analysis of the so-called mixed baselines of microwave imaging radiometer using aperture synthesis, which refer to those baselines which are formed between the regular receivers (light-weight cost-efficient front-end) and the reference radiometers. These baselines require special attention, since the reference radiometers are noise-injection radiometers, which in-ject noise to the measured signal, whereas the regular receivers are total power receivers.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for Earth-observation <b>microwave</b> interferometric <b>radiometry</b> using satellite formation flight is presented. The concept allows large apertures of unprecedented sizes to be synthesised {{by means of}} antennas mounted on several free-flying platforms performing interferometry. The size of the synthesised aperture {{is determined by the}} furthest distance between the free-flying satellites. The concept is applicable to wide range of microwave frequencies, meaning that the large aperture may be applied to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution, to extend Earth observation radiometry to unprecedented long wavelengths, or to enable radiometry in the geostationary orbit. Two such concepts are presented, and as an example they are applied to geostationary radiometry at 10 GHz. The first concept employs a rotating Y-shaped interferometric radiometer in formation with a constellation of nine free-flying microsatellites. The effective diameter of the synthesised aperture is 14. 4 m, which produces a spatial resolution of 79. 5 km at 10 GHz from the geostationary orbit. The total mass of the constellation can be within 2 tonnes, which may be deployed on a single launch vehicle. The second concept is a constellation of six formation-flying radiometers, which produce apertures of 28. 8 m, and produces a spatial resolution of 39. 8 km at 10 GHz. While this configuration is capable of producing larger effective apertures, the total mass can exceed 5 tonnes, and may require multiple launches and rendezvous at the operational orbit. Both of these concepts can be scaled up for larger apertures, and are bound primarily by the number of satellites deployable in the constellation. The free-flying nature of the concept means they are susceptible to interferometric performance degradation by array deformation. The effect of deviation on the radiometric resolution is explored and found, concluding that deviation as small as 0. 1 lambda can lead to performance degradation of up to 20 K. Annual Delta V required to maintain such constellations are also found at up to 2. 23 m/s annually...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{with recent}} {{technical}} advances, earth's surface is monitored with a dense network of satellites. Before these satellites launching, studies about the ocean requires costly in situ observations. Thus, global ocean study was hardly possible. Nowadays, satellites record global images at differ- ent resolution of multiple ocean parameters such sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), sea surface chlorophyll (CHL) concentration, ocean altimetry. Geophys- ical satellite observations exploit different modalities (e. g., infrared (IR) sensors or micro-wave radiometry (MW) as- sociated with different resolutions {{as illustrated in}} Fig. 1. In the case of SST parameter, <b>microwave</b> (MW) <b>radiometry</b> provides low resolution (25 km) [1] while infrared (IR) ra- diometry delivers high resolution SST measurements (5 km) [2]. In all cases, data acquisition by satellites {{are sensitive to the}} atmospheric conditions such as cloud coverage or heavy rains. Consequently observation series typically involve large percentage of missing data, high-resolution observations be- ing more affected. Besides missing data issues related to atmospheric conditions, low temporal or spatial resolution can also be assimilated to missing data problem. Thus, miss- ing data estimation in geophysical observation sequence is a critical issue [3, 4, 5]. Operational products mainly rely on statistical optimal interpolation techniques, Kalman filter- ing or smoothing techniques, or ensemble of Kalman filters [6, 4, 5, 7]. Their main drawbacks are that they require processing over very large covariance matrices, and assume statistical hypotheses such as stationarity, Gaussiannity and linearity of the dynamical model that can hardly be veri- fied in real observations. Qualitatively, the state-of-the-art missing data interpolation methods result in oversmoothed reconstruction and cannot recover fine-scale structures. As il- lustrated by SST and SSS observations in Fig. 1, gains can be expected from the fusion of multi-modal and multi-resolution observations. Thus, to address the missing data interpola- tion issue, we propose a variational data assimilation model that, from multi-resolution geophysical observations, jointly estimate the missing data and an associated transport field re- lated to the parameter temporal evolution. The performance of the proposed method are evaluated on real SST and SSS observations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Six {{years of}} Nimbus- 7 Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) data from 1979 to 1984 are recalibrated at the radiometric level. New {{statistical}} techniques are developed {{to quantify the}} temporal and orbital data errors and to generate numerical corrections for brightness temperatures prior to estimation of geophysical parameters. The foundations of passive <b>microwave</b> satellite <b>radiometry</b> are reviewed. The Nimbus- 7 spacecraft and the SMMR experiment are described, along with the radiometric data calibration methods. Sensor design weaknesses and orbit-related problems are summarized. Physical temperatures of various components of the SMMR sensor and housing structure, analyzed for six selected days of data, show systematic thermal changes throughout the orbit due to direct and indirect effects of solar heating. Changes in the operating temperatures, which impact the calibration, also occur from orbit-to-orbit following instrument startup on the SMMR's alternate sampling days. These errors and others contaminate the radiometric data. Incidence angle data, computed from measurements of spacecraft attitude, are analyzed for 1983 and found to contain discontinuities during every orbit due {{to the use of}} two different attitude sensors, and temporal drifts and jumps. The post-launch error corrections are developed from the NASA CELL-ALL brightness temperature data. The data are first converted to antenna temperatures, re-calibrated with a bias and slope adjustment, and corrected for temporal drifts. The cross-track bias and mean along-track error for an average annual orbit are statistically derived as well as a mean start-up bias for the first four orbits of each sampling day. The corrections describe only systematic errors found in global averages and are allowed to vary from year to year. Comparisons with Seasat radiometric data show that the errors are unique to the Nimbus- 7 SMMR. The corrections are applied to the six years of data and initial retrievals of integrated atmospheric water vapor are examined in a preliminary analysis. Global fields of 1 °x 1 ° monthly averaged water vapor show that the SMMR can map large scale features and document seasonal events, such as the Asian monsoons, and interannual events, such as the El Nino/ Southern Oscillation...|$|R
