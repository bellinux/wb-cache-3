50|$|Reduvius personatus or the <b>masked</b> <b>hunter</b> is {{an insect}} {{belonging}} to the assassin bug (Reduviidae) family. The name is because its nymphs camouflage themselves with dust. The <b>masked</b> <b>hunter</b> is a predator of small arthropods, including woodlice, lacewings, earwigs, and bed bugs. Masked hunters do not feed on human blood, but can bite humans in self-defense when mishandled. The bite can be extremely painful, but masked hunters are not known to transmit any diseases and medical attention is rarely needed.|$|E

They have an {{elongated}} head that includes a short, three-segmented beak, as well as long, slender antennae. Their abdomen is wide, extending in the middle beyond the wings to reveal the lateral margins of their abdominal segments. Nymphs of this species resemble the adult form and are naturally dark-colored, but often appear grey or light-colored due to a camouflage layer of debris covering them. Nymphs exude a sticky substance that covers their entire body, including the antennae and all six legs, which causes dust, lint, and other small particles {{to adhere to the}} surface of their body.|$|R

50|$|As nymphs, {{some species}} cover and {{camouflage}} themselves effectively with debris or {{the remains of}} dead prey insects. The nymphal instars of the species Acanthaspis pedestris present one {{good example of this}} behaviour where they occur in Tamil Nadu in India. Another well-known species is Reduvius personatus, known as the <b>masked</b> <b>hunter</b> because of its habit of camouflaging itself with dust. Some species tend to feed on pests such as cockroaches or bedbugs and are accordingly popular in regions where people regard their hunting as beneficial. Reduvius personatus is an example, and some people breed them as pets and for pest control. Some assassin bug subfamilies are adapted to hunting certain types of prey. For example, the Ectrichodiinae eat millipedes, and feather-legged bugs eat ants. A spectacular example of the latter is Ptilocnemus lemur, an Australian species in which the adult attacks and eats ants, but the nymph waits until the ant bites the feathery tufts on its hind legs, upon which it whips around and pierces the ant's head with its proboscis, and proceeds to feed.|$|E
40|$|The Arctic {{is not a}} {{pristine}} wilderness. Spitsbergen (now Svalbard) in the European Arctic was first documented in 1596. Since then, newcomers to the unpeopled archipelago have engaged in whaling, sealing, and hunting and trapping. This study investigates if historical human presence in Svalbard can be reconstructed and if is an appropriate indicator of long-term anthropogenic pressure on marine and terrestrial ecosystems. 54 fragmented datasets from published sources {{gave rise to the}} magnitude of human presence in Svalbard in the form of both voyages and participants per year. The resulting stacked column graphs are difficult to interpret. There is no clear trend of increasing human presence over time. Instead, there is a research bias towards certain nationalities, certain industries, and the marine ecosystem. Industries like whaling and sealing come and go. They are labour-intensive and thus dominate the charts, <b>masking</b> <b>hunters</b> and trappers in the terrestrial ecosystem. European wars hampered the whaling industry, but other causes of fluctuations are less obvious. Besides demand, technology may be an essential driver over time. Any gaps in the charts must not be understood as human absence; there are crucial research gaps concerning, for example, voyages between 1914 and 1997 and participants in the nineteenth century. In addition to the published sources, Norway’s database for cultural heritage provided geospatial information of the archaeological sites on Svalbard. Distribution maps indicate a human preference for the west coast of Spitsbergen, where the Gulf Stream alleviates sea ice conditions and creates biogeographical zones that support game animals; coal can be found. Science and the armed forces are less dependent on biogeography or geology but are restricted by climatic factors to the north and east. The lack of dated sites prevents a temporal analysis. Fine-grained data for the marine ecosystem was not available. The historical human presence in Svalbard can be reconstructed, but it is time-consuming. On its own, human presence is too difficult to interpret. It is a suitable indicator for anthropogenic pressure over time only in conjunction with other information. However, a holistic approach to historical and archaeological data in the study of Svalbard historical ecology is useful and necessary. The exercise highlighted the great potential of the sources consulted and raised important ecological questions to guide future research...|$|R

50|$|Hemiptera form prey to predators {{including}} vertebrates, such as birds, {{and other}} invertebrates such as ladybirds. In response, hemipterans have evolved antipredator adaptations. Ranatra may feign death (thanatosis). Others such as Carpocoris purpureipennis secrete toxic fluids {{to ward off}} arthropod predators; some Pentatomidae such as Dolycoris are able to direct these fluids at an attacker. Toxic cardenolide compounds are accumulated by the heteropteran Oncopeltus fasciatus when it consumes milkweeds, while the coreid stinkbug Amorbus rubiginosus acquires 2-hexenal from its food plant, Eucalyptus. Some long-legged bugs mimic twigs, rocking to and fro to simulate the motion of a plant part in the wind. The nymph of the <b>Masked</b> <b>hunter</b> bug camouflages itself with sand grains, using its hind legs and tarsal fan to form a double layer of grains, coarser on the outside. The Amazon rain forest cicada Hemisciera maculipennis display bright red deimatic flash coloration on their hindwings when threatened; the sudden contrast helps to startle predators, giving the cicadas time to escape. The coloured patch on the hindwing is concealed at rest by an olive green patch {{of the same size}} on the forewing, enabling the insect to switch rapidly from cryptic to deimatic behaviour.|$|E

Records are based on literature only. Figures are mostly from Blatchley's Heteroptera of Eastern North America. ] This is a large group (more than 160 North American species) of predaceous bugs, and many species are fairly common. They are often blackish of brownish in color, but many are brightly colored. The head is usually elongate with the part behind the eyes neck like. The beak is short and three-segmented, and its tip fits into a stridulatory groove in the prosternum. The abdomen in many species is widened in the middle, exposing the lateral margins of the segments beyond the wings. Most species are predaceous on other insects, but a few are bloodsucking and frequently bite people. Many species will inflict a painful bite if carelessly handled.

50|$|The first method, stand {{hunting is}} the most common method in wooded terrain. This is done by waiting where deer are likely to travel. Stand hunting is {{commonly}} done in an elevated tree stand, but it can be done in a blind on the ground. Hunting blinds allow more cover for the <b>hunter</b> thereby <b>masking</b> the <b>hunter's</b> movement and blocking the hunter's scent from contaminating the air and alerting the deer. Tree stands are usually placed 8 to 30 feet above the ground. Climbing tree stands are also used for the benefit of portability. The stands are made of metal or wood. Stands are often placed at the edge of fields of crops such as corn, wheat, buckwheat, alfalfa, clover, soybeans, cotton and many others. Often, hunters plant crops in strategic locations solely for the purpose of attracting deer. Food plots are very effective while hunting deer because deer spend the majority of their time eating getting the nutrients and the fats that they need to survive the winter. Without good feeding ground the deer will travel for miles if needed to find good feeding sources, this is why planting food plots is effective. Food plots keep the deer close by and improves the chances of harvesting quality deer. Some states allow bait to be placed near these stands to attract deer. Bait stands are legally distinct from planting food crops. The most common bait is corn. Another method of drawing deer within range of a stand is to use scents and decoys to draw bucks into range for a successful shot. This can be very effective during the rut, which is the deer breading season. Hunters use doe in estrus scent to pique a buck's interest and decoys to fix the visual interest of the buck away from the hunter, who is often concealed in a blind or tree stand. Bow hunters often rely heavily on scents to draw deer into the close ranges required for a successful hunt.|$|R
2500|$|Following the Skull Army's defeat, the Okotans {{return to}} the City of the Mask Makers {{for the first time}} in millennia. The Toa, {{bestowed}} with new armor and weapons by Ekimu, begin a new task of finding the Elemental Creatures: ancient beings who incarnate the life force of the elements and know of the locations of the Toa's golden Masks of Unity, as well as Makuta's Mask of Control. Finding one in each region, the Toa tame and befriend the creatures, who lead them to their unity mask temples. Donning the masks, the creatures mount and 'unite' with the Toa and share the location of Makuta's mask with them. Meanwhile, Umarak, a hunter born from the shadows, is employed by Makuta to find his lost mask. Aided by his Shadow Trap creatures, he follows the Toa and the Elemental Creatures to the Labyrinth of Control, the secret off-shore location of the Mask of Control. Inside, the heroes dodge the maze's booby traps and enter the mask's chamber, uniting with their creatures to do so. However, Pohatu's stubbornness to unite with Ketar, the Creature of Stone, allows Umarak to ambush him and enter himself. Fleeing with Makuta's <b>mask,</b> the <b>hunter</b> gives Pohatu the ultimatum of claiming it or saving Ketar, to which he chooses the latter. Umarak later confronts Makuta's spirit and defies the claim that he was ever his servant by wearing his mask, but Makuta takes control and transforms him into a horrific beast. Now the Mask Hoarder's minion, [...] "Umarak the Destroyer" [...] raises an army of Elemental Beasts created out of his Shadow Traps to attack the Mask Maker City as a distraction for the Toa, while he seeks out the lost pieces of the Mask of Ultimate Power. Realizing their enemies' true intent, the Toa and an upgraded Ekimu pursue the Destroyer to the Black Crater in the region of Stone, where he recreates Makuta's forbidden mask in order to open a portal to the Shadow Realm (Makuta's prison after his battle with Ekimu). But when Gali attempts to retrieve the mask pieces, her spirit is pulled through. In the realm, she discovers the Toa's true destiny, and just as Umarak is consumed by the portal, she returns to relay the information and unite the Toa into banishing Makuta for good. With their destiny fulfilled and power expended, the heroes {{return to the}}ir stars to overlook a safe Okoto, with the intent of returning should danger ever arise again.|$|R
5000|$|Alone {{for several}} years, Demona had an {{encounter}} with a child named Gillecomgain (based loosely on Gille Coemgáin of Moray), scarring his face when he catches her stealing food. Gillecomgain becomes the original Hunter, the progenitor of a millennial-long line of mercenary and assassin descendents seeking revenge against her. She is later joined by surviving Gargoyles from other clans in 997. During the year she encounters a time lost Brooklyn, who convinces her and the clan to help Kenneth III to fight against Constantine. Though she agrees, she plans to retrieve the Grimorum Arcanorum — the central book of spells featured in the Gargoyles storyline — after it is taken by Constantine's sorcerer Brother Valmont. After Kenneth's side has won the battle, the freed Phoenix (the former prisoner of The Phoenix Gate artifact) {{is about to take}} the [...] "timedancing" [...] Brooklyn to another time period. Since Brooklyn suspects that Demona wants the Grimorum to use in taking over Scotland, Brooklyn offers to hold it while she takes out her half of The Phoenix Gate and while Brooklyn is whisked away. By 1020 A.D., Demona allies herself with a young Macbeth to kill their common enemy of Gillecomgain. In 1032 A.D, an elderly Demona enters into a bargain with Macbeth; Macbeth entered it to protect his kingdom from his cousin Duncan I of Scotland, while Demona wanted her youth back so she could lead the last of her kind. The pact is facilitated by the Weird Sisters, rendering both of them immortal, except if one kills the other, in which case both would perish. Neither of them realized that the Weird Sisters and the evil Archmage from Castle Wyvern planned to take over the mystical island of Avalon in the 20th century, with their help. Macbeth himself soon comes to admire Demona's combat prowess, and eventually becomes heavily dependent on Demona's clan for support in the war with Duncan's forces. In the final battle with Duncan in August 1040, Demona's devastating attacks so impress Macbeth, he exclaimed [...] "You fight like a demon!" [...] — directly inspiring him to name her [...] "Demona" [...] (lit. [...] "She-Demon"), for the first time, a name she finds very pleasing, and simultaneously declares her as his primary adviser. The two become fast friends, and it appears that Demona's life may turn around for the better. Eventually, Demona's trust in Macbeth evaporates after overhearing Macbeth's courtier advising him on severing their ties with the Gargoyles in order to win the support of the English. Fearing that this would come to pass (though Macbeth strongly denies it), she abandons his forces to Duncan's son Canmore and the English armies. Canmore, in turn, betrays her, killing the last of her clan. Demona would not enter into another alliance with a human for almost a thousand years. During the intervening time, she amasses a substantial fortune, while plotting her revenge on humanity; all the while being hunted by Canmore's descendants, who take up the <b>mask</b> of the <b>Hunter.</b> One hunter attacked her in Florence in 1495. According to Greg Weisman: [...] "In 1920, Demona would encounter a hunter, Fiona Canmore in Paris, France. This event would have been seen in the unfinished Team Atlantis series." [...] She encounters and kills another hunter named Charles Canmore in Paris in 1980.|$|R
