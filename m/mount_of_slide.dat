40|$|Toluidine {{blue and}} gold {{chloride}} stains are both well-known for staining nervous tissue. Toluidine blue is a general method to stain neurons and glia, used because {{of the speed of}} action. Gold sublimate is a delicate procedure that requires extreme purity of reagents and materials, and it stains astrocytes and neurons. The aim {{of this study was to}} combine these two special staining methods for embryonic neural tissue and to obtain a repeatable and easily manageable new staining method with improved overall visualization of neural tissue. Fertilized broiler hatching eggs were incubated at 36 °C and on day 8 prepared for histology. Sections were cut at 7 μm thickness and slides were stained for 30 s using a 0. 1 % Toluidine blue solution. These slides were rinsed with dH 2 O followed by placing them in gold sublimate for 4 h at room temperature in the dark. Rinsing with dH 2 O and transferal to a 5 % sodium thiosulfate solution was done, followed by another rinsing and <b>mounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>slides.</b> Results showed that the combination of the two methods offers a fast, reliable method with which chick embryonic neural tissue can be evaluated...|$|R

Periretisyncolpites giganteus, Monocolpites sp 1, Foveotriletes margaritae, Syncolporites marginatus, and Longapertites marginatus.

40|$|Orientador: Prof. Dr. Marcelo Zanchetta do NascimentoDissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal do ABC, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia da Informação, 2014. In vitro {{production}} has been employed in bovine embryos and quantification of lipids {{is fundamental to}} understand the metabolism of these embryos. This paper presents an unsupervised segmentation method for histological images of bovine embryos. During the process <b>of</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>slides</b> some droplets <b>of</b> dye and other fragments could be remain out of the embryo. With this method, the irregularities were removed by applying an algorithm developed in the pre-processing step, in which a calculation is done to eliminate regions whose pixels have values of hypotenuse greater than 22 % of the image center. After removal of the irregularities a transformation of the RGB color model to the YIQ was applied. Then the global thresholding technique was applied with the threshold value obtained by the maximum entropy in order to separate the lipid droplets <b>of</b> histological <b>slides</b> at diferent stages: early cleavage, morula and blastocyst. After this step, false positive regions were removed using the technique of connected components. For this step, area information, center and amount of pixels were used. It enabled outliers removal of segmented regions. The proposed segmentation method was applied in 60 histological images of bovine embryos. The images were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively {{with respect to the}} gold standard images. The method presented accuracy values of 96 2 %, 942 % and 952 %, respectively in the tissues of early cleavage, morula and blastocyst.
