25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that {{if she was going to}} do nothing else she <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
500|$|Actor Owen Wilson and his then-girlfriend, Carolina Cerisola, {{appear in}} the video. Lanford Beard of Middlebury College Student Weekly, in review of the video, wrote that Timberlake's [...] "Mexicali saloon setting" [...] for the video [...] "embraced a certain macho, trashy playa aesthetic" [...] for him [...] "so we'll take {{it on the chin}} that this is the image he's {{building}} for himself and [...] love it or hate it [...] we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> used to it." [...] In 2004, the video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the category of Best Male Video.|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> a use out of it.' ...|$|E

[...] And the injured groom scudded across the farm-yard, knowing that there was {{something}} wrong with his master.|$|R

500|$|Shortly after {{receiving}} the trophy, Adams was called over by pitchside reporter Jim Rosenthal for a conversation on the field, explaining his absence from the celebratory team photograph for the press. The Arsenal captain spoke of how his team-mates were [...] "really fired up" [...] before the game and was delighted with the effort they put in {{during the course of}} the match. Graham was proud of his team's performance, and credited Adams, who [...] "suffered an awful lot of stick which has given football very little dignity." [...] When asked about the result he said, [...] "Nobody outside Highbury expected us to do it, but when you lose belief you <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> out of football." [...] Dalglish paid tribute to his players and refused to blame the fixture rearrangements for losing out to Arsenal, lamenting [...] "It just wasn't to be." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1965 season Tauranac {{was losing}} {{interest}} in this arrangement, reasoning that [...] "it {{was just a matter of}} a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" [...] and [...] "I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." [...] Although Brabham investigated using chassis from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship South African Grand Prix on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if {{we all know the}} drill and we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E
5000|$|Andersons {{signature}} {{was putting}} {{emphasis on a}} particular word. Examples included his enunciation of [...] "Love" [...] when saying [...] "The Love Boat", and [...] "The Man... The Machine... Street Hawk!" [...] from the 1985 motorcycle action series. Anderson told the San Francisco Chronicle that his goal as an announcer was to [...] "try to create a mood. I have to concentrate on each word, on each syllable. I have to bring something special to every sentence I say. If I dont do that, they <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> just <b>get</b> some announcer out of the booth to read it. I want people to hear me talk about a show and then to say, Hey, {{this is going to}} be great. I want to watch this." ...|$|R
60|$|That is {{excellent}} common sense, {{but it is}} not poetry; and {{it is not necessary to}} hunt through Johnson's bulky volumes for the information, since any moralist can give us offhand the same doctrine. As for his Rambler essays, once so successful, though we marvel at the big words, the carefully balanced sentences, the classical allusions, one <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> try to <b>get</b> interested in an old-fashioned, three-hour sermon. We read a few pages listlessly, yawn, and go to bed.|$|R
5000|$|As {{chairman}} of the club, he was instrumental in Palace hosting Real Madrid's first game in London. To celebrate the installation of new floodlights at the club, Wait and the board wanted to invite a famous club from the north of England to play a friendly. After discovering the fee demanded, Wait declared: [...] "If that's {{what they are going}} to do to us, we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> try to <b>get</b> Real Madrid." [...] Wait secured the services of Madrid for a fee of £10,000 and expenses. On the evening of 18 April 1962, the Spanish Ambassador switched on the floodlights and Madrid secured a first half lead of 3-1 and then held on to win 4-3.|$|R
500|$|The many {{historical}} {{meanings of}} the emblem, while provide a solid ground for its power as the national emblem of Iran, have also provided the rich ground for competing symbols of Iranian identity. One important campaign to abolish the emblem was initiated by Mojtaba Minuvi in 1929. In a report prepared {{at the request of}} the Iranian embassy in London, he insisted that the lion and sun is Turkic in origin. He recommended that the government replaces it with Derafsh-e-Kaviani: [...] "One cannot attributed a national historical story to the lion-and-sun emblem, for it has no connection to ancient pre-Islamic history, there is no evidence that Iranians designed or created it.... We <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> rid of this remnant of the Turkish people and adopt the flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur, that is Derafsh-e-Kaviani". His suggestion was ignored. The symbol was challenged during World War I, while Hasan Taqizadeh was publishing the Derafsh-e-Kaviani newspaper in Berlin. In his newspaper, he argued that the lion and sun is neither Iranian in origin nor very ancient as people assume. He insisted that the lion and sun should be replaced by the more Iranian symbol of Derafsh-e-Kaviani.|$|E
500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close calls in a couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Woodhouse had {{a history}} of theft, robbery and affray, and said that he had [...] "fallen out of love" [...] with football. He {{admitted}} to have been involved in around 100 street fights. He said; [...] "Boxing has always been my first love, even as a kid", and [...] "I love fighting...Rather than get locked up for it, I <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>get</b> paid for it." [...] He also stated that he used to spar in the boxing gym after football training without his manager's knowledge, saying [...] "A few times at Sheffield United, Neil Warnock would drag me in and say ‘I hear you’ve been boxing’. I’d be standing there with a big black eye and a fat lip and deny it." [...] He trained under former British featherweight champion, Gary De Roux, and made his boxing debut on 8 September 2006 at Grosvenor House Hotel, London, in a welterweight contest against Dean Marcantonio, despite not having any previous amateur experience. The former footballer had lost two stone in weight since his playing days with Grimsby Town. The fight was scheduled for four rounds of two minutes, Woodhouse knocked his opponent down twice in the final round and won on points.|$|E

Westport, Conn. : Praeger, in {{cooperation}} with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2003. ISBN 0 - 275 - 98227 - 0. Maps. Tables. Notes. Pp. xiv, 572. $ 44. 95. The Iraq War: A Military History. By Williamson Murray and Major General Robert H. Scales, Jr. Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2003. ISBN 0 - 674 - 01280 - 1. Maps. Photographs. Tables. Notes. Index. Pp. 312. $ 25. 95. The United States and its allies went to war against Iraq in 2003, as Williamson Murray and Robert Scales reasonably propose, “to make an example out of Saddam’s regime, for better or worse” (p. 44). Exactly what the war exemplified, and whether the results are better or worse than might have been achieved by other means, are, to say the least, matters of continuing dispute. In the meantime, we <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> start <b>getting</b> the facts straight, {{at least as far as}} military operations are concerned. The two books above are both contributions to that necessary work. They are exercises in bridge-building, reaching forward from wartime journalism and postwar postmortems to the more mature scholarship of the future. Given the time pressure under which they were prepared, they are far better than anyone would have had reason to expect...|$|R
6000|$|When {{he got to}} Verdun, Will {{continued}} to devote himself {{to the study of}} French. He knew that, should he escape, he could have no hope of finding his way across country unless he could speak the language fluently, and accordingly he passed the whole day in conversation with the guards and others employed about the prison. These were inclined to regard his anxiety to become proficient in the language as a national compliment. Some of the prisoners also knew French well, so {{that at the end of}} four months he could talk with perfect fluency. He was a good deal laughed at by the English officers for the zeal he was displaying in studying French, for, as they said, he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> try to <b>get</b> to the moon as out of Verdun. He accepted their chaff good-humouredly, and simply said: “Time will show, but for my part I would as soon be shot as continue to live as prisoner here.” ...|$|R

[...] Then Dick got up {{and walked out of the}} room with his pipe in his mouth, and went into his bedroom, {{thinking}} that it <b>might</b> be <b>as</b> <b>well</b> for him to pack up and take his departure. The quarters they were in were, as he declared to himself, [...] "beastly" [...] in wet weather; but his shirts hadn't come from the wash, and he had no vehicle to take him to the railway station without sending for a fly. And after all what he had said to Sir Francis was not much worse than what had often been said before. So he chucked off his slippers, and threw himself upon the bed, thinking that he <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> endeavour to <b>get</b> through the morning by going to sleep.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Roth {{appeared}} on the TV series The Sopranos as a poker-playing guest of Tony Soprano.
