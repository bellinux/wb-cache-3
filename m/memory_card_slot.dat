5|$|The PocketStation was a {{miniature}} game console created by SCE as a peripheral {{for the original}} PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It {{could also be used}} as a standard PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot.</b> It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.|$|E

25|$|The miniSD {{form was}} {{introduced}} at March 2003 CeBIT by SanDisk Corporation which announced and demonstrated it. The SDA adopted the miniSD card in 2003 {{as a small}} form factor extension to the SD card standard. While the new cards were designed especially for mobile phones, they are usually packaged with a miniSD adapter that provides compatibility with a standard SD <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E

25|$|The system {{includes}} 1GB {{of internal}} flash memory manufactured by Toshiba, {{but it is}} mostly used by the operating system and its pre-installed applications. The system's memory can be expanded via an SD <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot,</b> which supports SD and SDHC memory cards. All Nintendo 3DS systems come packaged with a 2GB SD card while Nintendo 3DS XL systems include a 4GB SDHC card. The system uses 2.4GHz 802.11 b/g wireless network connectivity with enhanced WPA2 security. There is also an infrared port {{on the back of}} the console, which allows the system to connect with certain peripherals such as the Circle Pad Pro and the amiibo reader/writer.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii U {{features}} 802.11 b/g /n {{wireless network}} connectivity {{and support for}} Fast Ethernet with an accessory, Bluetooth 4.0, {{a total of four}} USB 2.0 ports, and an SD/SDHC <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot.</b> An additional power port is also included to power the Wii Sensor Bar, an auxiliary infrared emitter used by Wii Remote peripherals for motion tracking. Video output options include 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 576i, 480p and 480i, through HDMI 1.4 and component video ( [...] , D-Terminal and RGB SCART) or 576i, 480i anamorphic widescreen through composite video (S-Video, SCART and D-Terminal). Audio output options include six-channel 5.1 linear PCM surround sound or analog stereo. The console also supports stereoscopic (3D) images and video.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} PS2 multitap (SCPH-10090) {{cannot be}} {{plugged into the}} newer slim models, as the multitap connects to the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot</b> {{as well as the}} controller slot and the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slot</b> on the slimline is shallower. New slim-design multitaps (SCPH-70120) were manufactured for these models, however third-party adapters also exist to permit original multitaps to be used.|$|E
2500|$|Original style {{consoles}} {{also have}} two front-mounted <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> for the system's proprietary Memory Unit. These {{can be used}} to transfer profile and game data from one Xbox 360 to another. Memory Units up to 512MB are available from Microsoft. The [...] "Arcade" [...] model formerly came with a 256MB Memory Unit, but with the Jasper motherboard revision of September 2008, the [...] "Arcade" [...] model began to include 256MB of built-in flash memory. This was later increased to 512MB. The <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> were replaced with USB ports on the newer Xbox 360 S models.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} players support <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots,</b> {{including}} CompactFlash (CF), Secure Digital (SD), and Memory Sticks. They are used to directly transfer content from external devices, and expanding the storage capacity of PMPs.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} PlayStation Multitap {{was one of}} {{the earliest}} peripherals released for the platform. It featured not only four additional controller ports, but also four <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> for each of them as well. Like the Team Player adapter for the Genesis, two PlayStation Multitaps could be used at the same time for up to eight controllers and <b>memory</b> <b>cards,</b> although very few games allowed for more than five players.|$|R
50|$|Kodak re-entered {{the digital}} photo frame market at CES in 2007 with the {{introduction}} of four new EasyShare-branded models that were available in sizes from 200 to 280 mm, included multiple <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots,</b> and some of which included Wi-Fi capability to connect with the Kodak Gallery—that gallery functionality has now been compromised due to gallery policy changes (see below).|$|R
5000|$|The machine uses a {{membrane}} keyboard, {{which is}} almost silent in use; an optional electronic [...] "click" [...] can be turned on to indicate keystrokes. The Z88 is powered by four AA batteries, giving up to 20 hours of use. It has three <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots,</b> which accommodate proprietary RAM, EPROM or FLASH <b>cards,</b> the third <b>slot</b> being equipped with a built-in EPROM programmer. Card capacities range from 32 KiB to 1 MiB.|$|R

Odama also includes a clip to attach the microphone to the controller. Commands are issued when users hold the X button on the controller. The microphone bundled with Mario Party 6 and 7, Odama and Densetsu no Quiz Ou Ketteisen is grey, while the mic bundled with KRP is black.|$|R

50|$|Although many early PDAs did {{not have}} <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots,</b> now most have either some form of Secure Digital (SD) slot, a CompactFlash slot or a {{combination}} of the two. Although designed for memory, Secure Digital Input/Output (SDIO) and CompactFlash cards are available that provide accessories like Wi-Fi or digital cameras, if the device can support them. Some PDAs also have a USB port, mainly for USB flash drives. Some PDAs use microSD cards, which are electronically compatible with SD cards, but have a much smaller physical size.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 May 2009, Sony {{introduced}} the first A-mount lenses to feature their new SAM (Smooth Auto-focus Motor) in-lens auto-focus motor for more lens-specific AF speed improvements. This introduction {{was made with}} the new [...] "+30" [...] series camera bodies (α350 + 30 = α380). These new bodies retain an in-body focus motor for backward compatibility with the historic lens collection. In addition, the new bodies utilize HDMI output for display on HDTV sets and feature dual <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> for both Sony's proprietary Memory Stick Pro Duo chips as well as SDHC media format, while eliminating CompactFlash support.|$|R
50|$|The PSX is not {{supplied}} with any game controllers, {{but there are}} two controller ports {{on the back of the}} device. While the PSX is compatible with standard PS/PS2 controllers and <b>memory</b> <b>cards</b> (with the exception of the PocketStation), a variant of the DualShock 2 controller marketed specifically for the PSX was also sold that featured a 4-meter long cord (a bit longer than the standard versions of the controller). Two PlayStation <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> ports were on the front of the PSX, behind a panel cover. Because of the different placement of the <b>memory</b> <b>card</b> <b>slots</b> (which are located above the controller ports on standard PS2 consoles), the PSX is incompatible with the PlayStation Multitap and its PS2 counterpart, and no PSX-compatible multitap was ever produced. Games that require the use of two or more USB ports are also incompatible with the PSX.|$|R
