25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that <b>meet</b> <b>our</b> particular purposes in reading them.|$|E

According to Marie Jackson, [...] "Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always <b>meet</b> <b>our</b> low standards." [...] As stated in the introduction to The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should [...] " [...] in a compelling image", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an [...] "Oh my God" [...] quality.|$|E

500|$|A {{turning point}} for {{development}} in the Everglades came in 1969 when a replacement airport was proposed as Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) bought [...] in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C, management of Everglades National Park or the Department of the Interior. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from The Miami Herald {{the day it was}} announced. The DCPA bulldozed the land it had bought, and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined; the location chosen was [...] north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: [...] "This {{is going to be one}} of the great population centers of America. We will do our best to <b>meet</b> <b>our</b> responsibilities and the responsibilities of all men to exercise dominion over the land, sea, and air above us as the higher order of man intends." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{detention}} conditions prompted {{national and}} international concern. Juan E. Méndez, United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture, told The Guardian that the U.S. government's treatment of Manning was [...] "cruel, inhuman and degrading". In January 2011 Amnesty International asked the British government to intervene because of Manning's status as a British citizen by descent, although Manning's lawyer said Manning did not regard herself as a British citizen. The controversy claimed a casualty in March that year when State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley criticized Manning's treatment and resigned two days later. In March, 295 members of the academic legal community signed a statement arguing that, contrary to former professor of constitutional law President Obama's assertion that Manning's confinement was [...] "appropriate and <b>meet</b> <b>our</b> basic standards," [...] Manning was being subjected to [...] "degrading and inhumane pretrial punishment." [...] On April 20 the Pentagon transferred Manning to the medium-custody Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where she was placed in an 80-square-foot cell with a window and a normal mattress, able to mix with other pretrial detainees and keep personal objects in her cell.|$|E
