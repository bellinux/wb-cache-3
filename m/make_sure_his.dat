5|$|In {{the space}} of six days, Galland's friend, Steinhoff was badly burned in a crash on 18 April, and then, on 24 April, his friend Lützow was posted missing. On 21 April, Galland was {{credited}} with his 100th aerial victory. He was the 103rd and last Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark. On 26 April, Galland claimed his 103rd and 104th aerial victories against B-26s, escorted by the 27th Fighter Group and 50th Fighter Group. Galland again made a mistake; he stopped to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> second victory was going to crash and {{he was hit by}} a USAAF P-47 Thunderbolt piloted by James Finnegan. Galland nursed his crippled Me 262 to the airfield, only to find it was under attack by more P-47s. Galland landed under fire and abandoned his jet on the runway. The battle was his last operational mission. Soon afterward, he was sent to hospital for a knee wound sustained during his last mission. The Americans lost four B-26s and another six damaged. In return two Me 262s were shot down: the other pilot surviving.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Legislative Council elections, {{the biggest}} problem facing the WAYL and the Mambii Party {{was the lack of}} {{suffrage}} for many of their supporters. Property and literacy requirements for voting were not a problem for the elite, but they were for Thompson's supporters. To combat this deficiency, the league employed some legal and illegal practices to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> supporters would be able to cast their vote. In one practice, the supporters who lacked suffrage were given fraudulent town council receipts, which stated their eligibility to vote. They were also given campaign badges for the opposing candidate to avoid possible discrimination at the polls, as election officials were against the Mambii party and the WAYL. The government and social elite were outraged after Thompson was declared the winner of the election. F. V. Nanka-Bruce, a representative in the Legislative Council, filed a petition against the election return and won his appeal a year later.|$|E
25|$|Lange {{began the}} new decade {{in the light}} romp How to Beat the High Co$t of Living (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, but it {{received}} mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, she was contacted by director Bob Rafelson regarding a project on which {{he was working with}} Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for Goin' South (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater, and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir, The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it. Although the controversial film received mixed reviews, Lange was widely praised for her performance.|$|E

500|$|The Farnborough too was sinking {{from her}} torpedo damage. Realising this, Campbell left {{the men in}} the boats, {{destroyed}} all confidential papers and radioed for help. His unorthodox message read: [...] "Q5 slowly sinking respectfully wishes you goodbye". This message reached nearby naval shipping, and within an hour the destroyers HMS Narwhal and HMS Buttercup arrived and began to tow the stricken ship back to land. During the night a depth charge accidentally exploded on board Farnborough and the tow was dropped. Campbell ordered the twelve men remaining aboard into a lifeboat and attempted to take a final survey of his vessel, only to be driven back by another exploding depth charge. On returning to the rail he discovered that Stuart had disobeyed his order and remained on board, to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> captain disembarked safely. The tow was later reattached and the battered Farnborough beached at Mill Cove, in no fit state to return to sea. Campbell was awarded the Victoria Cross in recognition of his service in the action and £1,000 of prize money was shared among the crew. Stuart and Engineer-Lieutenant Len Loveless were both presented with the Distinguished Service Order.|$|E
500|$|Shero's introverted, enigmatic {{personality}} had {{an effect}} on the way in which he coached players. Shero often communicated with his players by way of notes left in their lockers. When he did talk to them, he was known for never yelling. He believed that when coaches yell they do it for their own sake. He always defended his player whether it was in the press or even against management. He always tried to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> players were focused during the game. He often asked them how much time was left in the period to force them to pay attention. He had a unique take on practice as well. If the team was winning then he worked the team hard. If they were losing then there would be a low key practice. He believed that he could get more out of players when they were winning. He often had drills designed to let the players have fun, stating that [...] "Hockey is a child's game played by men. Since it's a child's game it ought to be fun". To have fun the Flyers occasionally had 12-on-12 games with the winning team earning a small monetary reward. He sometimes had the players perform drills that lacked purpose which the team performed until a player questioned the validity of the drill. At that point Shero stopped the drill and praised the player for being alert. Shero was notoriously bad with names. On one occasion it led to him trading for the wrong player. While GM of the Rangers Shero traded for Cam Connor believing it was Colin Campbell. Upon his arrival Conner had to explain that he was a winger and not a defenceman.|$|E

2500|$|On February 3 Kentucky hosted Georgia at Rupp Arena, {{defeating}} the Bulldogs 69 to 58. The Bulldogs were without leading scorer and rebounder Marcus Thornton, {{who was out}} due to a concussion. Andrew Harrison scored 23 points and combined with Towns for key baskets down the stretch that helped Kentucky pull away. Harrison's layup with 3:58 remaining provided a 62 to 54 lead before baskets by Georgia's Yante Maten and Nemanja Djurisic pulled the Bulldogs to 63 to 58 with 2:06 left. Towns' short jumper with 1:33 left got the lead to seven, and Tyler Ulis and Harrison each added two free throws {{in the final minute}} for the Wildcats. On February 7 Kentucky traveled to Gainesville to face arch-rival Florida. Florida swept all three meetings in 2014, winning in Lexington, in Gainesville and in the SEC Tournament. Both teams advanced to the Final Four in 2014, but had gone in different directions in 2015. Florida entered the game one game over [...]500 and struggling mightily through the beginning of SEC play. Aaron Harrison scored 23 points, Towns added 19 and the Wildcats remained unbeaten with a 68 to 61 victory over the Gators before a national television audience on ESPN's College GameDay. Florida led by nine {{in the first half and}} used a 6 to 0 run to go up 44 to 42 midway through the second half. However, Cauley-Stein's dunk proved to be the turning point. Florida's Devon Robinson turned the ball over on one end, and Cauley-Stein was the beneficiary on the other. He caught a pass in transition near the foul line, took two steps and then slammed it over Robinson. He was fouled on the play and made the free throw to put Kentucky ahead for good. Free throws were huge down the stretch, too. Kentucky closed out the game from the charity stripe and finished 21 of 22 from there. On February 9 traveled to Baton Rouge face LSU before another national television audience on ESPN. Frustrated by the way his team was playing, coach Calipari told them he hoped they'd lose. They almost did. Towns redeemed himself after drawing a technical foul for hanging on the basket and the ire of his coach by hitting a go-head jump hook with 1:30 left and grabbing a clutch offensive rebound against LSU in the final minute to help Kentucky stay unbeaten, {{defeating the}} Tigers 71 to 69. Calipari explained that he wanted to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> team won't lose elimination games in March over senseless fouls, so even as his assistants pleaded with him to call timeout, he just watched and joined in the ear-ringing frenzy at the sold out Pete Maravich Assembly Center during a stunning 21 to 2 LSU run that gave the Tigers a 66 to 60 lead. LSU's Keith Hornsby had a shot to win it for LSU in the final seconds, but his off-balance 3 bounced off the outside of the rim, and Kentucky was victorious. On February 14 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against South Carolina for the second time this season. After holding South Carolina to 27 percent shooting in last month's meeting, Kentucky limited the Gamecocks to just 13 of 55 from the field (24 percent) this time. Kentucky had a strong start that put South Carolina in a hole that steadily deepened. The Wildcats led 26 to 6 with 8:21 left in the first half and never eased off in overwhelming South Carolina on both ends. It was 43 to 18 at halftime, and Kentucky poured it on against a Gamecocks squad looking to build off a five-point win over Missouri. On February 17 Kentucky traveled to Knoxville to face arch-rival Tennessee. Booker had 18 points and seven rebounds as Kentucky picked up its defense in the second half and pulled away for a 66 to 48 victory over the Volunteers. The victory set a new record for the historic program as they became 26–0 for the first time, though the Wildcats finished the 1953–54 season with a 25–0 mark. On February 21 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to defeat Auburn 110 to 75. Towns scored 19 points to lead six Kentucky players in double figures. The Wildcats recorded their highest scoring total since 2002 in the blowout win over the Tigers. The victory also extended their best start ever and equaled the 1995–96 squad's school-record 27-game winning streak. At halftime Kentucky hoisted legendary player Tony Delk's #00 jersey in the rafters. On February 25 Kentucky traveled to Starkville to face Mississippi State. Kentucky looked slightly mortal for most of the first half, letting a 14-point lead evaporate to 33 to 27. Ulis hit a 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to push the Wildcats' advantage to 36 to 27. They had a few more careless defensive moments early in the second half, which helped Mississippi State briefly make things interesting. Mississippi State's Craig Sword's pass to a wide-open Roquez Johnson led to an easy layup, pulling the Bulldogs within 41 to 37 with 15 minutes remaining. Kentucky responded with the next six points by pounding the ball into the paint and using its significant size advantage to pull away for the win. Lyles scored a 18 points, and Kentucky was victorious 74 to 56. On February 28 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against nationally ranked Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered the game ranked No. 16/18 in the AP and USA Today Coaches polls. This was the first ranked opponent since they defeated Louisville in late December. Arkansas also entered the game on a three-game win streak over Kentucky. The Wildcats seized the tempo from the start with a quick pace that knocked the Razorbacks on their heels. Lyles started things off with a lob dunk from Towns (eight points, five rebounds), who followed with a putback basket. Aaron Harrison (nine points, seven rebounds) soon added a 3-pointer to get a sellout crowd into the game, and Kentucky had plenty more in an energetic if chippy first half by both teams. Arkansas went 0 for 9 from long range and shot 30 percent overall while getting outrebounded 24 to 18 through 20 minutes as Kentucky built a 42 to 26 halftime lead. At one point in the second half the lead swelled to 31 points. The Wildcats clinched the Southeastern Conference regular-season title defeating the Razorbacks 84 to 67.|$|E

60|$|In {{fulfilment}} of her resolution, Lady Valleys, who {{had returned}} to Town by a morning train, started with Barbara for the Temple about three in the after noon, and stopped at the doctor's on the way. The whole thing would be much simpler if Eustace were fit to be moved at once to Valleys House; and with much relief she found that the doctor saw no danger in this course. The recovery had been remarkable--touch and go for bad brain fever just avoided! Lord Miltoun's constitution was extremely sound. Yes, he would certainly favour a removal. His rooms were too confined in this weather. Well nursed--(decidedly) Oh; yes! Quite! And the doctor's eyes became perhaps a trifle more intense. Not a professional, he understood. It might be as well to have another nurse, if they were making the change. They would have this lady knocking up. Just so! Yes, he would see to that. An ambulance carriage he thought advisable. That could all be arranged for this afternoon--at once--he himself would look to it. They might take Lord Miltoun off just as he was; the men would know what to do. And when they had him at Valleys House, the moment he showed interest in his food, down to the sea-down to the sea! At {{this time of year}} nothing like it! Then with regard to nourishment, he would be inclined already to shove in a leetle stimulant, a thimbleful perhaps four times a day with food--not without--mixed with an egg, with arrowroot, with custard. A week would see him on his legs, a fortnight at the sea make him as good a man as ever. Overwork--burning the candle--a leetlemore would have seen a very different state of things! Quite so! quite so! Would come round himself before dinner, and <b>make</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>His</b> patient might feel it just at first! He bowed Lady Valleys out; and when she had gone, sat down at his telephone with a smile flickering on his clean-cut lips.|$|E
60|$|What befell, however, {{was that}} even while she thus waited {{she felt herself}} present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion, on the whole, {{appeared}} to require-- a process of weighing something in the balance, of considering, deciding, dismissing. He had guessed that she was there with an idea, there in fact by reason of her idea; only this, oddly enough, was what at the last stayed his words. She was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet done--which really {{brought it to the}} turn of a hair, for her, that she didn't <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>his</b> notion of her idea was the right one. It was the turn of a hair, because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her, ever so kindly, as if to see, to understand, more, or possibly give more--she didn't know which; and that had the effect of simply putting her, as she would have said, in his power. She gave up, let her idea go, let everything go; her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms. It was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this; felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadn't uttered--operated, in his view, as probably better than any words, as always better, in fact, at any time, than anything. Her acceptance of it, her response to it, inevitable, foredoomed, came back to her, later on, as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didn't anticipate and didn't dispose of, and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been, beyond any other, the impulse legitimately to provoke it. It made, for any issue, the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast; and at present, holding her to his side as they left the room, he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it, kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above. He had been right, overwhelmingly right, as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility, but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her. It was still, for her, that she had positively something to do, and that she mustn't be weak for this, must much rather be strong. For many hours after, none the less, she remained weak--if weak it was; though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success, since her agitated overture had been, after all, so unmistakably met.|$|E
