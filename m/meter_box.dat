40|$|AbstractEnergy {{conservation}} and energy management {{can be achieved}} in buildings by reducing the load on the HVAC systems used in the buildings. This is possible by reducing the magnitude of heat flow through the building materials and components such as the windows, ceilings, floors, walls, etc. The thermal performance of a material can be evaluated by measuring its {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} or the U-value. The U-value of a material can be measured using the Guarded Hot Box method. The setup comprises of three parts – the <b>metering</b> <b>box,</b> the guard box and the cold box. In this method a constant heat flow needs to be maintained through the test specimen from the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> to the cold box. Thus it is important to control temperatures in all the three parts accurately. In the present work the temperatures of the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> and the guard box have been controlled using three different software based temperature control strategies. In the first two strategies on-off control was implemented while in the third strategy proportional control was implemented. From the experimental data it was found that similar performances were obtained in the first two test cases where the temperatures could be controlled satisfactorily. Whereas, in the third case steady state offset was obtained while controlling the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> temperature and the guard box temperature showed fluctuations...|$|R

The guard system is automatic and controlled from the output of a thermopile on the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> walls. Fans are used to circulate the air in the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> and the heat contribution from the fan blades is taken into account in the measurement. Validation tests have been made using a glass fibre panel and the results agree very closely with the calculated thermal transmittance and conductance.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{considerations}} {{in the evaluation of}} building components and construction materials used in energy efficient designs is in determining their thermal characteristics while operating under different temperature regimes. This is normally achieved by testing the product to determine its thermal conductivity or its overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value) using the Guarded Hot Box method. In this method regulated heat flow is to be maintained through the specimen under a steady state condition. To achieve these conditions the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> and the guard box are to be maintained at a constant temperature level so as to ensure as far as possible one dimensional heat flow only through the specimen sample. This is achieved through the monitoring and measurement of both surface temperatures and air temperatures in the guard <b>box</b> and the <b>metering</b> <b>box</b> which are used to control the various heating and air circulating devices to achieve the desired level of accuracy. Heat is added into the system using tubular resistance heaters and DC plate heaters which allow for accurate measurement of the supply power used to maintain a temperature balance between the metering and guard chambers.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the temperature and shrinkage stresses of the mid-span cross-section of a 20 <b>meters</b> <b>box</b> girder to find the reasons which cause the longitudinal cracks in the web and bottom of box girder. According to the results of damage inspeation, there are many longitudinal cracks in the web and bottom slab of box girders, especially the web of the edger beam, the crack is very clear. Ansys ver. 10 software is used to analyze two dimensional finite element model of a typical cross section of a real bridge to calculate the temperature stresses caused by temperature difference between inside and out side of the box and the shrinkage stresses based on moisture diffusion. The results of analysis show that the outer surface of the web and bottom slab of the fabricated box girder will produce tensile stress at the effect of negative temperature difference. If the concrete reaches a certain age, the tensile stress does not cause creaks in the cross-section. The shrinkage stress changes with the moisture gradient in the box section. It will reach the maximum in 15 days and then decreases with the growth of the age. Shrinkage stress may cause cracking of the concrete surface because of the tensile strength is low in the early age...|$|R
