5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a geomagnetic reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{demand for more}} and more energy efficient <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> to be used in modern electrical devices like inverters or smart grid instrumentation (high and medium voltage instrument transformers). The most important magnetic parameters are as high as possible magnetization characteristics (Bm = f(Hm) curve) associated with lowest specific total <b>core</b> losses. As <b>magnetic</b> properties of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> become worse during production processes it is extremely important to test them in order to improve the production process. In the case of large <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> they cannot be tested in generally used computer systems. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} quality testing system for cores of large mass, in the order of several hundred kilogramms.

40|$|In Part I of this two-part paper, {{fundamental}} {{concepts of}} interlaminar fault {{and its consequences}} on <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> were presented. An equivalent configuration, which was proved by FEM modelling, was proposed for <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> with interlaminar fault. In this Part II paper, based on the equivalent configuration of the core and equivalent circuit of eddy current path, an analytical model is developed to estimate eddy current power loss of <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> with interlaminar faults {{in a wide range}} of magnetizing frequency. Important factors, such as skin effect, nonuniform flux density distribution, complex relative permeability and nonlinear relation of B (H), which are often neglected in the literature, are highlighted. Packs of two, three, and four Epstein-size laminations of conventional grain oriented were shorted together artificially to measure the extra power loss caused by the interlaminar fault and support the analytical modeling. It was found that in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> affected by interlaminar fault, the skin effect is a determinant factor in the magnetic properties determinations, even at low frequencies...|$|R

25|$|Electric {{machines}} with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced active current {{on either side}} of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{machines}} {{without a}} transformer circuit topology, {{such as that}} of WRSMs or PMSMs, cannot realize bursts of torque higher than the maximum designed torque without saturating the <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> and rendering any increase in current as useless. Furthermore, the PM assembly of PMSMs can be irreparably damaged, if bursts of torque exceeding the maximum operating torque rating are attempted.|$|E

25|$|The {{ignition}} coil {{consists of two}} transformer windings â€” the primary and secondary. These windings share a common <b>magnetic</b> <b>core.</b> An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary.

25|$|Because of {{the power}} that would be lost, {{resistors}} are not used as ballasts for lamps of more than about two watts. Instead, a reactance is used. Losses in the ballast due to its resistance and losses in its <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> may be significant, {{on the order of}} 5 to 25% of the lamp input electric power. Practical lighting design calculations must allow for ballast loss in estimating the running cost of a lighting installation.|$|E
25|$|The first rotating-drum {{storage device}} {{was used in}} the Birkbeck Automatic Relay Computer {{developed}} by Andrew Booth and Kathleen Booth in 1948.

Magnetic tape is still used in many computers.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{transformers}} {{are made}} of conventional <b>magnetic</b> <b>cores</b> which are constructed of a single grainoriented or amorphous, magnetic steel.

25|$|The {{simplest}} ballast for {{alternating current}} (AC) use is an inductor placed in series, consisting of a winding on a laminated <b>magnetic</b> <b>core.</b> The inductance of this winding limits the flow of AC current. This type is still used, for example, in 120 volt operated desk lamps using relatively short lamps. Ballasts are rated for the size of lamp and power frequency. Where the AC voltage is insufficient to start long fluorescent lamps, the ballast is often a step-up autotransformer with substantial leakage inductance (so as to limit the current flow). Either form of inductive ballast may also include a capacitor for power factor correction.|$|E
25|$|When optimally {{designed}} {{within a}} given core saturation constraint and for a given active current (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) {{within a given}} air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.|$|E

500|$|Two {{independent}} dual-CPU computers, A and B, {{form the}} controller; giving redundancy to the system. The failure of controller system A automatically {{leads to a}} switch-over to controller system B without impeding operational capabilities; the subsequent failure of controller system B would provide a graceful shutdown of the engine. Within each system (A and B), the two M68000s operate in [...] "lock-step", thereby enabling each system to detect failures by comparing the signal levels on the buses of the two M68000 processors within that system. If differences are encountered between the two buses, then an interrupt is generated and control {{turned over to the}} other system. Because of subtle differences between M68000s from Motorola and the second source manufacturer TRW, each system uses M68000s from the same manufacturer (for instance system A would have two Motorola CPUs while system B would have two CPUs manufactured by TRW). Memory for block I controllers was of the plated-wire type, which functions {{in a manner similar to}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>core</b> memory and retains data even after power is turned off. Block II controllers used conventional CMOS static RAM.|$|E
