On the top board, 5 bridges are placed in order to seat stretched metal strings across from side to side. The strings are plucked with a <b>metal</b> <b>pick</b> adjusted on the index finger of each hand.|$|E
50|$|Removal of the {{chlorides}} is essential. In practise {{this first}} involves physical cleaning (with a wooden or even <b>metal</b> <b>pick)</b> {{to remove the}} bulk of the chlorides and then chemical treatment. One chemical treatment is soaking the object in a 5% sodium sesquicarbonate solution. This serves to neutralise the acid that attacks the metal as well as converting the reactive cuprous chloride to largely inert cuprous oxide. The oxide may coat the artefact with unsightly but harmless black spots or generally darken the metal.|$|E

5000|$|Picks {{made from}} various metals produce a harmonically richer sound than plastic, {{and change the}} sound of the {{acoustic}} and electric guitar. [...] Some <b>metal</b> <b>picks</b> are even made from coins, which give players a unique tone as the alloys used in various coinage from around the world vary greatly.Playing guitar with a silver pick gives a unique, rich and bright sound, very different from normal plectrums (Brian May of Queen often plays with a silver sixpence). Picksmiths such as Master Artisan Guitar Picks are widely recognized for handcrafting <b>metal</b> guitar <b>picks</b> from coins and antique metals.|$|R
5000|$|After {{almost ten}} years of {{performing}} lobotomies Freeman heard of a doctor in Italy named Amarro Fiamberti who operated on the brain through his patients' eye sockets, allowing him to access the brain without drilling through the skull. After experimenting with novel ways of performing these brain surgeries, Freeman formulated a new procedure called the transorbital lobotomy. This new procedure {{became known as the}} [...] "icepick" [...] lobotomy and was performed by inserting a <b>metal</b> <b>pick</b> into the corner of each eye-socket, hammering it through the thin bone there with a mallet, and moving it back and forth, severing the connections to the prefrontal cortex in the frontal lobes of the brain. He performed the transorbital lobotomy surgery {{for the first time in}} Washington D.C. on a housewife named Sallie Ellen Ionesco. This transorbital lobotomy method did not require a neurosurgeon and could be performed outside of an operating room without the use of anesthesia by using electroconvulsive therapy to induce seizure. The modifications to his lobotomy allowed Freeman to broaden the use of the surgery, which could be performed in psychiatric hospitals throughout the United States that were overpopulated and understaffed. In 1950 Walter Freeman's longtime partner James Watts left their practice and split from Freeman due to his opposition to the cruelty and overuse of the transorbital lobotomy.|$|E

He has been a longtime user his 1962 Fender Stratocaster and 1971 Gibson Les Paul, and in the 1980s played Hamer and Jackson Soloists, which he still periodically uses today. He also has an extensive collection of over 100 various vintage guitars, most notably Les Pauls, Flying V's, Martin and Gibson acoustics. Today he uses his Fernandez Brad Gillis model, along with his 1962 Stratocaster, PRS 513 model and an Atomic Guitars Red, White and Blue American flag guitar. Gillis uses Taylor acoustic guitars in the studio and live with his band Night Ranger. Gillis's amplifiers are mainly Mesa Boogie but also uses Soldano, Marshall and vintage Fender amps in the studio.

50|$|The {{relatives}} {{pick the}} bones {{out of the}} ashes and transfer them to the urn using large chopsticks or <b>metal</b> <b>picks,</b> two relatives sometimes holding the same bone {{at the same time}} with their chopsticks (or, according to some sources, passing the bones from chopsticks to chopsticks). Known as kotsuage (骨揚げ), this is the only time in Japan when it is proper for two people to hold the same item at the same time with chopsticks. At all other times, holding anything with chopsticks by two people at the same time, or passing an item from chopsticks to chopsticks, {{is considered to be a}} major social faux pas as this will remind bystanders of the funeral of a close relative. The bones of the feet are picked up first, and the bones of the head are picked up last. This is to ensure that the deceased is not upside down in the urn. The hyoid bone, which is located in the neck, is the most significant bone to be placed in the urn.|$|R

25|$|King had an {{intuitive}} style, often creating guitar parts with vocal nuances. He achieved this {{by using the}} open-string sound associated with Texas blues and the raw, screaming tones of West Side, Chicago blues. King's combination the Texas and Chicago sounds gave his music a more contemporary feel than that of many Chicago bands who were still performing 1950s-style music, and he befriended the younger generation of blues musicians. In his early career he played a gold-top Gibson Les Paul with P-90 pickups through a Gibson GA-40 amplifier. He later played Gibson ES-355 guitars, using a plastic thumb <b>pick</b> and a <b>metal</b> index-finger <b>pick</b> to achieve an aggressive finger attack, a style he learned from Jimmy Rogers.|$|R

But the Rick's slim neck and low action let me explore jazz and blues scales up and down the fretboard, and incorporate more hammer-ons and pull-offs into my solos. I also translated some of my banjo picking techniques to the 12-string.

As part of the soil conservation efforts, Mike Ruppe, an Army Specialist on loan from Schofield Barracks, plus other military personnel, laid lines of explosives, detonating them to break the hardpan so that seedling trees could be planted. Used car tires were taken to Kahoʻolawe and placed in miles of deep gullies to slow the washing of red soil from the barren uplands to the surrounding shores.

2500|$|The band's guitar {{sound was}} also unconventional.

Durango remarked: [...] "I always thought that our guitar playing {{was not so much}} playing guitars, but assembling noises created by guitars." [...] He and Albini respectively billed their guitars as [...] "vroom" [...] and [...] "skinng" [...] in the liner notes for Atomizer.

50|$|One {{of those}} bands was Refused 13 from Nakhipot, Lalitpur. The band had played their first gig opening for Dead Soul (on Metallica Anthology Concert, 2001). The band started {{creating}} a formidable {{reputation in the}} valley as a very “tight” metal band with an in-your-face attitude, conceived {{by many as the}} band to <b>pick</b> <b>metal</b> where Dead Soul had left and then elevate the scene into another level. During the band’s active years, the band organized another memorable gig “Keep Suffering” at Nakhipot. Anuraag Pokhrel, former vocalist of Albatross on the band says, “Refused 13 was definitely a force - the band and the persona of the band.

5000|$|In the example, {{the lower}} roller (6) is <b>metal,</b> which <b>picks</b> {{negative}} charge off the inner {{surface of the}} belt. The lower comb (7) develops a high electric field at its points that also becomes large enough to ionize air molecules. In this case the electrons are attracted to the comb and positive air ions neutralize negative charge on the outer surface of the belt, or become attached to the belt. The exact balance of charges on the up-going versus down-going sides of the belt {{will depend on the}} combination of the materials used. In the example, the upward-moving belt must be more positive than the downward-moving belt. As the belt continues to move, a constant [...] "charging current" [...] travels via the belt, and the sphere continues to accumulate positive charge until the rate that charge is being lost (through leakage and corona discharges) equals the charging current. The larger the sphere and the farther it is from ground, the higher will be its peak potential. In the example, the wand with metal sphere (8) is connected to ground, as is the lower comb (7); electrons are drawn up from ground due to the attraction by the positive sphere, and when the electric field is great enough (see below) the air breaks {{in the form of an}} electrical discharge spark (9). Since the material of the belt and rollers can be selected, the accumulated charge on the hollow metal sphere can either be made positive (electron deficient) or negative (excess electrons).|$|R
