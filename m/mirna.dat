Thousands of <b>miRNAs</b> {{have been identified in}} many species. However, there is no information available concerning <b>miRNAs</b> in ma bamboo (Dendrocalamus latiflorus), {{one of the most important}} non-timber forest products, which has essential ecological roles in forests. To identify <b>miRNAs</b> in D. latiflorus, a small RNA library was constructed from leaf tissues. Using next generation high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis, we obtained 11, 513, 607 raw sequence reads and identified 84 conserved <b>miRNAs</b> (54 mature <b>miRNAs</b> and 30 star <b>miRNAs)</b> belonging to 17 families, and 81 novel <b>miRNAs</b> (76 mature <b>miRNAs</b> and five star <b>miRNAs)</b> in D. latiflorus.

40|$|Abstract Background MicroRNAs (<b>miRNAs),</b> {{which are}} small, non-coding RNAs {{approximately}} 21 -nucleotides in length, {{have become a}} major focus of research in molecular biology. Mammalian <b>miRNAs</b> are proposed to regulate approximately 30 % of all protein-coding genes. Previous studies have focused on highly conserved <b>miRNAs,</b> but nonconserved <b>miRNAs</b> represent a potentially important source of novel functionalities during evolution. Results An analysis of the chromosome distribution of <b>miRNAs</b> showed higher densities of <b>miRNAs</b> on the X chromosome compared to the average densities on autosomes in all eight mammalian species analyzed. The distribution pattern did not, however, apply well to species beyond mammals. In addition, by comparing orthologous human and mouse <b>miRNAs,</b> we found that X-linked <b>miRNAs</b> had higher substitution rates than autosomal <b>miRNAs.</b> Since the highest proportion of X-linked <b>miRNAs</b> were found in mouse testis, we tested the hypothesis that testis <b>miRNAs</b> are evolving faster on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Mature X-linked testis <b>miRNAs</b> had an average substitution rate between mouse and human that was almost 25 -fold higher than mature testis <b>miRNAs</b> on autosomes. In contrast, for mature <b>miRNAs</b> with precursors not expressed in testis, {{no significant difference in the}} substitution rate between the X chromosome and autosomes was found. Among mammals, the rapid evolution of X-linked testis <b>miRNAs</b> was also observed in rodents and primates. Conclusion The rapid evolution of X-linked testis <b>miRNAs</b> implies possible important male reproductive functions and may contribute to speciation in mammals. </p...|$|R

During blood feeding, presence of the malaria parasite, Plasmodium in the blood induces several host effector molecules including microRNAs which play important roles {{in the development and}} maturation of the parasite within the mosquito. The present study was undertaken to elucidate the dynamic expression of <b>miRNAs</b> during gonotrophic cycle and parasite development in Anopheles stephensi. Using next generation sequencing technology, we identified 126 <b>miRNAs</b> of which 17 were novel <b>miRNAs.</b> The <b>miRNAs</b> were further validated by northern hybridization and cloning. Blood feeding and parasitized blood feeding in the mosquitoes revealed regulation of 13 and 16 <b>miRNAs</b> respectively. Expression profiling of these <b>miRNAs</b> revealed that significant <b>miRNAs</b> were down-regulated upon parasitized blood feeding with a repertoire of <b>miRNAs</b> showing stage specific up-regulation. Expression profiles of significantly modulated <b>miRNAs</b> were further validated by real time PCR. Target prediction of regulated <b>miRNAs</b> revealed overlapping targeting by different <b>miRNAs.</b> These targets included several metabolic pathways including metabolic, redox homeostasis and protein processing machinery components. Our analysis revealed tight regulation of specific <b>miRNAs</b> post blood feeding and parasite infection in An. stephensi. Such regulated expression suggests possible role of these <b>miRNAs</b> during gonotrophic cycle in mosquito.

Several previous studies has demonstrated functional roles of <b>miRNAs</b> in antiviral defense mechanisms. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to identify rice <b>miRNAs</b> upon rice stripe virus (RSV) infection at three different time points. Six libraries from mock and RSV-infected samples were subjected for small RNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses revealed 374 known <b>miRNAs</b> and 19 novel <b>miRNAs.</b> Expression of most identified <b>miRNAs</b> was not dramatically changed at 3 days post infection (dpi) and 7 dpi by RSV infection. However, many numbers of <b>miRNAs</b> were up-regulated in mock and RSV-infected samples at 15 dpi by RSV infection. Moreover, expression profiles of identified <b>miRNAs</b> revealed that only few numbers of <b>miRNAs</b> were strongly regulated by RSV infection. In addition, 15 resistance genes were targets of six <b>miRNAs</b> suggesting that those identified <b>miRNAs</b> and 15 NBS-LRR resistance genes might be involved in RSV infection.
