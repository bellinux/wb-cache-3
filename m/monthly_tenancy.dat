25|$|After that challenge, the Court of First Instance of Hong Kong {{declared}} Tam bankrupt on 25 April 2012 {{for failing}} to pay legal fees, whilst allowing her to continue receiving her monthly allowance. In January 2013, {{the court ruled that}} the <b>monthly</b> <b>tenancy</b> of $120,000 to Tam, suspended since the previous July, would continue to be frozen due to mounting debts of the estate. Her brother was declared bankrupt on 17 January 2013 {{for failing to}} pay legal fees relating to the appeals. In May 2013, the court ordered the estate to pay Tam HK$20,000 a month for her living costs, as well as $240,000 to settle her overdue rent.|$|E
5000|$|Those Jews who survived, who {{returned}} either to Sana'a {{or to the}} other towns and villages, were mostly ill from being exposed to the changes in climate and from the poor quality of drinking water. In Sana'a, {{they were required to}} relinquish their ownership over their houses and fields within the city’s wall, in the neighborhood of al-Sā’ilah, and were directed to build humble abodes in a new area outside of the city’s walls, in a place then known as the “hyena’s field” (Ar. Qāʻ al-simaʻ), or what later became known as Qāʻ al-Yahud [...] (the Jewish Quarter). This place attracted other migrant Jews from the other towns and villages from which they had been expelled and soon grew into a suburb, situate about one kilometer beyond the walls which then existed on the extreme west-side of the city. Today, the place is called Qāʻ al-ʻUlufi (Ar. قاع العلفي). The lands upon which they built the new Jewish Quarter were lands provided by the king, but the Jews were later required to pay a <b>monthly</b> <b>tenancy</b> fee for the land, and which money accrued to the Muslim Waqf (mortmain land) for the upkeep of their own places of worship. Between the new Jewish Quarter and the city walls was a suburb full of gardens called Bi’r alʻAzab (the Single’s Well), being once the Turkish Quarter. In subsequent years, the Jewish Quarter was also enclosed by a wall.|$|E
5000|$|At Rabbi Yiḥya Yitzḥak Halevi's suggestion, {{the king}} of Yemen (Imam Yahya) settled a long-standing dispute between the Jewish {{community}} {{and the application of}} laws defined by the local Waqf, or mortmain property. [...] Accordingly, the land upon which the new Jewish Quarter was built following their return from Mawza was land provided by the king, but as of 1872, the Jews were required to pay a <b>monthly</b> <b>tenancy</b> fee for the land although they claimed ownership of the land, and which money accrued to the Muslim Waqf; being usufruct State land of which the State revenues are assured to pious foundations, in this case, for the upkeep of Muslim places of worship. The Rabbi suggested to the king that the Jews be permitted to purchase the land whereon they had resided, rather than pay tenancy fees for such land. The king acquiesced. In the winter of 1918, the Imam Yahya ordered that those Jewish residents who were able to provide legal documents proving that they had purchased their property would be made exempt from re-purchasing such property, while all other Jewish residents were to pay for their land, half of which payment would be given to the Waqf (Islamic trust), and half of which to the Imam. Assessors were sent to the Jewish Quarter, and it was decided that the Jews would pay 8000 Riyals for acquisition of the land. In the end, only 7500 Riyals were paid, while the Imam forgave the remaining 500 Riyals {{for the sake of the}} poor. A bill of sale was drawn up to that effect.|$|E
5000|$|Tenancies {{and other}} estates in land less than {{outright}} ownership {{are governed by}} the Tenancy Act of 2004, and by Land Act of 1979 where incorporated by Tenancy Act. Under these laws, tenancies must be supported by a written lease with definite terms. Tenancies entail several rights and obligations for tenant and landlord, enumerated by statute. These include many rights similar to common law guarantees, such as the tenant's right of [...] "peaceful enjoyment" [...] and duty to refrain from nuisance and dangerous activities. These also include remedies such as lease cancellation and rent abatement for a landlord's breach of warranty of habitability, and eviction for tenant's breach of duty to pay rent over two months. In Bhutan, however, sub-leases are unlawful. Notably, tenancies pass according to a set order upon {{the death of the}} leaseholder. Bhutanese law also contains provisions on rents the limit annual increases to 10 percent of the <b>monthly</b> rent. <b>Tenancies</b> are regulated by the Tenancy Authority, an agency of the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement.|$|R
