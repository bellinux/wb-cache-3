The {{common type}} of floater, which is present in most persons' eyes, is due to degenerative changes of the vitreous humour. The perception of floaters is known as myodesopsia, or less commonly as myodaeopsia, myiodeopsia, or myiodesopsia. They are also called <b>Muscae</b> <b>volitantes</b> (Latin: [...] "flying flies"), or mouches volantes (from the French). Floaters are visible because of the shadows they cast on the retina or refraction of the light that passes through them, and can appear alone or together with several others in one's visual field. They may appear as spots, threads, or fragments of cobwebs, which float slowly before the observer's eyes. As these objects exist within the eye itself, they are not optical illusions but are entoptic phenomena. They {{are not to be}} confused with visual snow, although these two conditions may co-exist.|$|E
60|$|When a fist, {{applied to}} the eye, makes us 'see stars'; when a liver not in good working order makes us see <b>muscae</b> <b>volitantes,</b> or 'spiders'; when alcohol {{produces}} 'the horrors,'--visions of threatening persons or animals,--when a lesion of the brain, or delirium, or a disease of the organs of sense causes visions, or when they occur to starved and enthusiastic ascetics, all these false perceptions are just as much 'apparitions,' as the view of a friend at a distance, beheld {{at the moment of}} his death, or as the unrecognised spectre seen in a haunted house.|$|E
6000|$|Taking these propositions into {{consideration}} seriatim, {{it may be}} assumed that everyone will assent to the first and second; and that for the third and fourth we have only to include the muscular sense tinder the name of sense of touch, as Berkeley did, {{in order to make it}} quite accurate. Nor is it intelligible to me that anyone should explicitly deny the truth of the fifth proposition, though some of Berkeley's supporters, less careful than himself, have done so. Indeed, it must be confessed that it is only grudgingly, and as it were against his will, that Berkeley admits that we obtain ideas of extension, figure, and magnitude by pure vision, and that he more than half retracts the admission; while he absolutely denies that sight gives us any notion of outness in either sense of the word, and even declares that [...] "no proper visual idea appears to be without the mind, or at any distance off." [...] By [...] "proper visual ideas," [...] Berkeley denotes colours, and light, and shade; and, therefore, he affirms that colours do not appear to be at any distance from us. I confess that this assertion appears to me to be utterly unaccountable. I have made endless experiments on this point, and by no effort of the imagination can I persuade myself, when looking at a colour, that the colour is in my mind, and not at a [...] "distance off," [...] though of course I know perfectly well, as a matter of reason, that colour is subjective. It is like looking at the sun setting, and trying to persuade oneself that the earth appears to move and not the sun, a feat I have never been able to accomplish. Even when the eyes are shut, the darkness of which one is conscious, carries with it the notion of outness. One looks, so to speak, into a dark space. Common language expresses the common experience of mankind in this matter. A man will say that a smell is in his nose, a taste in his mouth, a singing in his ears, a creeping or a warmth in his skin; but if he is jaundiced, he does not say that he has yellow in his eyes, but that everything looks yellow; and if he is troubled with <b>muscae</b> <b>volitantes,</b> he says, not that he has specks in his eyes, but that he sees specks dancing before his eyes. In fact, it appears to me that it is the special peculiarity of visual sensations, that they invariably give rise to the idea of remoteness, and that Berkeley's dictum ought to be reversed. For I think that anyone who interrogates his consciousness carefully will find that [...] "every proper visual idea" [...] appears to be without the mind and at a distance off.|$|E
50|$|Scheerer’s {{phenomenon}} can {{be easily}} distinguished from floaters (<b>muscae</b> <b>volitantes).</b> Scheerer’s phenomenon consists of corpuscles of identical diameter and visual sharpness, of a simple dot or worm-like shape, brighter than the background. If the eye stops moving, the dots keep darting around. If the eye moves, the dots follow instantaneously, because they are contained in the retina. In contrast, floaters are specks or threads of variable diameter and variable visual sharpness, some of complex shape, darker than the background. If the eye stops moving, the floaters settle down. If the eye moves, the floaters follow sluggishly, because they are contained in the vitreous humor which is subject to inertia.|$|E
5000|$|Floaters or <b>muscae</b> <b>volitantes</b> {{are slowly}} {{drifting}} blobs of varying size, shape, and transparency, which are particularly noticeable when viewing a bright, featureless background (such as the sky) or a point source of diffuse light {{very close to}} the eye. They are all shadow images of objects suspended just above the retina. Some may be individual red blood cells swollen due to osmotic pressure or chains of these cells stuck together and diffraction patterns can be seen around these. They may also be [...] "coagula of the proteins of the vitreous gel, to embryonic remnants, or the condensation round the walls of Cloquet's canal". Floaters may collect over the fovea (the center of vision) and therefore be more visible when lying on your back looking upwards.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{inform the}} {{importance}} of annual dilated eye exams. “Have you been noticing floaters in your vision? Light flashes? What about just not seeing as well? ” These are questions ophthalmic medical personnel routinely ask patients, but do we really consider the diagnosis of AIDS when asking these questions? Can you imagine your patient coming in to see their eye doctor and learning {{that they might have}} the AIDS virus? Most of us know that signs and symptoms may not show up for years after being exposed to the virus. It is possible to see the effects of the virus in the retina before developing outward symptoms. I would like to let you know about signs and symptoms associated with one of the retinal viral infections associated with HIV patients – Cytomegalovirus Retinitis or CMV. The initial complaints of patients with CMV retinitis include light flashes (also known as photopsia), multiple small floaters (<b>muscae</b> <b>volitantes),</b> and foggy vision or visual disturbances 1. These are common for many people and are symptoms of other disorders. Most everyone has CMV in their body, but do not develop CM...|$|E
