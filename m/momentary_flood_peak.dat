40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new Regional Estimation of Extreme <b>Flood</b> <b>Peaks</b> by Selective Statistical Analyses (REFSSA) method to estimate extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> from regional <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> data. The method differs from current regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) methods or approaches in that an additional separate statistical analysis is performed on "record maximum flood peaks" within a "similar hydrological region". Suitability {{of the method}} is demonstrated for the estimation of extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> with annual exceedance probabilities between 0, 001 (1 / 1 000) and 0, 0001 (1 / 10 000) for two major hydrological regions in South Africa, and for catchment sizes between 100 and 7 000 km². The applicability of the method for catchments outside these regions and limits has not been fully tested mainly due to a shortage of verified data. The theory and a practical example are presented. Excellent results have been obtained so far, displaying high correlation coefficients between extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> data and regression lines, namely 0, 99 on average on log-normal scale. The method is considered to have universal application, especially in climates experiencing outlier type of extreme <b>flood</b> <b>peaks...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Land use changes {{captured}} by remote sensing {{over a period}} of 21 years (1976 - 1997) were used to study changes in <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> and travel times in the Yasu River basin Japan. The impacts of these changes were simulated by a spatially distributed watershed model (SOWM-YRB). The model generates spatially distributed infiltration excess runoff and integrates the flow in the downstream direction using digital elevation model (DEM). Floods in the study basin originate in steep slopes and are caused by high intensity rainfall during typhoon events. Simulation results indicate the flood simulation component within SOWM-YRB captures properly the effects topography and surface conditions on spatially distributed runoff, <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> and travel time. Simulation results with 1976 and 1997 landuse data indicate land use change during this time might have caused 18 % increase in <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> and reduced the travel time.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the impact of {{combined}} catchment and storage upon flood occurrences and <b>flood</b> <b>peaks.</b> A significant factor that plays an important role of the combined catchment and storage is the ratio of contributing catchment area to storage area (AC/AS) where the impact significantly shows increasing frequency of storage overflow and <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> with the increasing of AC/AS. Some case studies examined in this work, i. e. Way Pegadungan (Lampung, Sumatra) and NagaraRiver (South Kalimantan) catchments show similar behavior. Swamps located on the sides of downstream of Way Pegadungan as well as Nagara River act as storages during flood events. The dyke which was planned to be built increases the ratio of AC/AS significantly as storage area reduced considerably. This has an impact on <b>flood</b> <b>peaks</b> which can increase considerably. The improved understanding of these process controls will be useful in assisting the management of such catchments, particularly to assist in flood prevention and mitigation...|$|R

The Minimize <b>Flood</b> <b>Peak</b> rule uses available flood storage capacity to store peak flows from an accurate hydrograph forecast.

30|$|Booming {{urbanization}} due to {{a fast-growing}} population results in more impervious areas, less infiltration, and hence greater <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> and runoff. Clear understanding of flood responses in regions with different levels and expansions of urbanization is of great importance for regional urban planning. In this study, comparison of flooding responses to urbanization processes in terms of <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> and runoff volume in the upper, middle, and lower Xiang River Basin (XRB), China, was carried out using the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) model. From 2005 to 2015, urbanization level and intensity {{were higher in the}} lower XRB compared to the upper and middle XRB, and the overall expansion rate of urban areas was 112.8 %. Modeling results by the HEC-HMS model indicate elevated <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> discharges and volumes due to fast urbanization in the XRB from the 1980 s to 2015. This rapid increase is particularly the case in the lower XRB. The study also revealed different hydrological responses of flood regimes—urbanization tends to have larger impacts on <b>peak</b> <b>flood</b> flow rather than on flood volume in the lower XRB, which further corroborated urbanization-induced intensifying flood processes in terms of <b>peak</b> <b>flood</b> flow. Urbanization has increasing impacts on flood volume from the upper to the lower XRB, which can be attributed to accumulated runoff down the river system. This study provides a reference for basin-wide land use and urban planning as well as flood hazard mitigation.|$|R

In this study, the suitability of various copula families for a bivariate analysis of <b>peak</b> discharges and <b>flood</b> volumes has been tested. Streamflow data from selected gauging stations along the whole Danube River have been used. Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient (tau) quantifies the dependence between <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> discharge and <b>flood</b> volume settings. The methodology is applied to two different data samples: 1) annual maximum <b>flood</b> (AMF) <b>peaks</b> combined with annual maximum flow volumes of fixed durations at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 60 days, respectively (which can be regarded as a regime analysis of the dependence between the extremes of both variables in a given year), and 2) annual maximum <b>flood</b> (AMF) <b>peaks</b> with corresponding <b>flood</b> volumes (which is a typical choice for engineering studies).

However, there is poor understanding of how these management practices affect river flow peaks during high magnitude rainfall events. Using the distributed TOPMODEL, spatial configurations of land management were modelled to predict flood response in an upland catchment which contains different regions operating subsidised agricultural stewardship schemes. Heavy grazing leading to soil compaction and loss of vegetation cover in stewardship regions covering 79. 8 % of the catchment gave a 42 min earlier flow peak which was 82. 2 % higher (under a 1 -hr 15 mm storm) than the current simulated hydrograph. Light grazing over the same regions of the catchment had much less influence on river flow peaks (18 min earlier and 32. 9 % increase). Rotational burning (covering 8. 8 % of the catchment), most of which is located in the headwater areas, increased the peak by 3. 2 % in the same rainfall event. Vegetation restoration with either Eriophorum or Sphagnum (higher density) in bare areas (5. 8 %) of the catchment provided a reduction of <b>flood</b> <b>peak</b> (3. 9 % and 5. 2 % in the 15 mm storm event); while, the same total area revegetated with Sphagnum in riparian regions delivered a much larger decrease (15. 0 %) in river flow peaks.
