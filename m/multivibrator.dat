40|$|Abstract — A {{new digital}} {{transceiver}} circuit for asynchronous frame detection is proposed where both the {{transmitter and receiver}} contain all digital components, thereby avoiding possible use of conventional devices like monostable <b>multivibrators</b> with unstable external components such as resistances and capacitances. The proposed receiver circuit, in particular, uses a combinational logic block yielding an output which changes its state {{as soon as the}} start bit of a new frame is detected. This, in turn, helps in generating an efficient receiver sampling clock. A data latching circuit is also used in the receiver to latch the recovered data bits in any new frame. The proposed receiver structure is also extended from 4 -bit information to any general n data bits within a frame with a common expression for the output of the combinational logic block. Performance of the proposed hardware design is evaluated in terms of time delay, reliability and robustness in comparison with the standard schemes using monostable <b>multivibrators.</b> It is observed from hardware implementation that the proposed circuit achieves almost 33 percent speed up over any conventional circuit...|$|R
