50|$|Cyanide, a {{substance}} of sanitary concern, is only due {{to use and}} discharge of the industrial sector. Cyanide has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following cyanide exposure depends {{in part on the}} form of cyanide, such as hydrogen cyanide gas or cyanide salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high. Cyanide has been a major component of <b>metal-plating</b> solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.|$|E

[...] "His experiments, {{which he has been}} conducting since his early youth, resulted in 1893 in the discovery of a process for electrically producing tinplate. Much money was expended upon improving the process... and has been of great practical value to the whole industry. Retaining its rights, he sold half the patent rights, and later used part of the proceeds to open the Art Metal Works in Newark, N.J. Soon the company was producing a variety of high-quality Lamps, Book ends, Art Statues and other decorative items, prized today for their detail in the collector marketplace.|$|E
40|$|<b>Metal-plating</b> on {{plastics}} {{has been}} used in household appliances, cars and others. <b>Metal-plating</b> and plastics have to be separated for recycling. The crush separation system is a high running cost. A melting separation system using an acid or an alkali causes deterioration the performance of plastics. Therefore, a new method separating <b>metal-plating</b> and plastics is expected. A method to separate <b>metal-plating</b> on plastics been developed using pulse arc discharges by pulsed power [1]. A large current flow into a metal thin and then a part of the metal film is vaporized by heating. At the same time, a shock wave occurs and removes metal thin film from the plastics. The plastics and metal removed are recyclable. In this paper, the effects ceramic tubes covered on electrodes, the kind of electrode material, the distance between electrodes and the diameter of electrodes on the removal efficiency are studied...|$|E

Application of magnetic additive has reduced the wear rate in 1, 5 – 3 times, de-pending on the brand of oil, load and temperature in the friction zone. To im-prove the additives of this type and the creation of new there were developed and patented the devices, evaluating the lubricity of hydrocarbon liquids, taking into account the effect of physical parameters of the magnetic field on the efficiency of the additives: a tribometer with a permanent magnet and a tribometer with al-ternating electromagnetic field...|$|E

40|$|A compact {{nucleated}} precipitation technology {{using two}} fluidised sand columns in series {{was developed to}} pretreat model <b>metal-plating</b> wastewater containing high concentrations of Cu(II) and Cr(VI).

Experimental results show that high pH has no positive influence on either Cr(VI) or Cu(II) removal in the continuous-flow fluidised metal stripper technology. Operation at pH 6. 5 in both columns can obtain significantly higher levels of both total Cr(VI) and total Cu(II) removal compared with work at pH 9. 5 in both columns and work at pH 6. 5 and 9. 5 in the 1 (st) and 2 (nd) columns, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} the {{solid-phase}} MetPLA TE, an enzyme assay that is specific for heavy-metal toxicity, to investigate metal toxicity of soils that have been amended with urban wastewater sludges or contaminated with dry deposition from <b>metal-plating</b> industries. We have shown that soil toxicity, using MetPLA TE, ranged from 21 to 72. 5 % inhibition of enzyme activity. Evin soil, which displayed the highest toxicity, also had the highest concentrations of Pb and Zn. Metal uptake studies with ryegrass grown on Evin soil, showed Zn, Cd, and Pb accumulation in the plant that exceeds the standard levels reported for grasses Solid-phase MetPLA TE was also used {{as a tool to}} study the reduction of heavy-metal toxicity following soil amendments to immobilize metals in soil and thus reduce their toxicity.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{construction}} methods and experimental results of electromechanical filters {{consisting of two}} rectangular piezoelectric resonators {{and one or two}} couplers. The resonators vibrate transversely and are coupled with torsionally or transversely vibrating couplers. 　First, construction of the piezoelectric resonator is described. The resonator is a rectangular plate made from lead zirconate and lead titanate ceramics. 　<b>Metal-plating</b> electrodes formed on both surfaces of the rectangular piezoelectric plate are split into two parts and the diagonal opposite electrodes among them are connected with each other electrically. 　When an ac voltage is applied between the electrical terminals, {{the upper part of the}} plate is lengthened and the lower one is contracted. Thus, the first and the third modes of transverse vibration are excited in the resonator. 　Secondly, three design methods of the mechanical filter are described. By exchanging the connection of out put terminals, two kinds of construction of the mechanical filter are obtained, one is of attenuation poles, and the other has none of attenuation poles. 　Lastly, some experimental results of the mechanical filters suppressJng higher harmonics are described...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{occurrence}} {{and behaviors}} of 6 : 2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (Cl- 6 : 2 PFESA, with trade name F- 53 B) have been receiving increased attention recently. Nevertheless, its potential fates under diversified conditions remain concealed. In this study, susceptibility of Cl- 6 : 2 PFESA to reductive dehalogenation was tested in an anaerobic super-reduced cyanocobalamin assay. A rapid transformation of dosed Cl- 6 : 2 PFESA was observed, with a hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (1 H- 6 : 2 PFESA) identified as the predominant product by a nontarget screening workflow. With the aid of laboratory-purified standards, hydrogen-substituted PFESA analogues (i. e., 1 H- 6 : 2 and 1 H- 8 : 2 PFESA) were further found in river water and sediment samples collected from two separate regions near <b>metal-plating</b> facilities. Geometric mean concentrations of 560 pg/L (river water) and 11. 1 pg/g (sediment) for 1 H- 6 : 2 PFESA and 11. 0 pg/L (river water) and 7. 69 pg/g (sediment) for 1 H- 8 : 2 PFESA were measured, and both analytes consisted average compositions of 1 % and 0. 1 % among the 18 monitored per- and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonate and carboxylate pollutants, respectively. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} to report existence of polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates with both hydrogen and ether functional group in the environment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop cost-effective, {{appropriate}} solidification technologies for treating hazardous industrial wastes that are currently disposed of in ways that may threaten the quality of local groundwater. One major objective was to use materials other than cement, and preferably materials that are themselves wastes, as the solidification additives, namely using wastes to treat wastes or locally available natural material. This research examines the cement-based and lime-based stabilization/solidification (S/S) techniques applied for waste generated at a <b>metal-plating</b> industry and a dye industry. For the lime-based S/S process the following binder mixtures were used: cement kiln dust/lime, bentonite/lime and gypsum/lime. For the cement-based S/S process three binder mixtures were used: cement kiln dust/cement, bentonite/cement and gypsum/cement. The leachability of the wastes was evaluated using the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. The applicability and optimum weight ratio of the binder mixtures were estimated using the unconfined compressive strength test. The optimum ratio mixtures were mixed with waste samples in different ratios and cured for 28 days in order to find the S/S products with the highest strength and lowest leachability at the same time. The results of this work showed that the cement-and lime-based S/S process, using cement kiln dust and bentonite as additives can be effectively used in order to treat industrial waste.

40|$|Approximately 100 million gal {{of liquid}} waste {{is stored in}} {{underground}} storage tanks (UST) s at the Hanford Site, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL), Savannah River Site (SRS), and Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR). This waste is radioactive with a high salt content. The US Department of Energy (DOE) wants to minimize the volume of radioactive liquid waste in USTs by removing the excess water. This procedure conserves tank space; lowers the cost of storage; and reduces the volume of wastes subsequently requiring separation, immobilization, and disposal. The Out-of-Tank Evaporator Demonstration (OTED) was initiated to test a modular, skid-mounted evaporator. A mobile evaporator system manufactured by Delta Thermal Inc. was selected. The evaporator design was routinely used in commercial applications such as concentrating <b>metal-plating</b> wastes for recycle and concentrating ethylene glycol solutions. In FY 1995, the skid-mounted evaporator system was procured and installed in an existing ORNL facility (Building 7877) with temporary shielding and remote controls. The evaporator system was operational in January 1996. The system operated 24 h/day and processed 22, 000 gal of Melton Valley Storage Tank (MVST) supernatant. The distillate contained essentially no salts or radionuclides. Upon completion of the demonstration, the evaporator underwent decontamination testing to illustrate the feasibility of hands-on maintenance and potential transport to another DOE facility.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a case of}} asthma associated with the inhalation of nickel salts. Immunologic studies showed circulating antibodies to the salt, and controlled inhalation exposure to a solution of nickel sulfate reproduced the illness. NICKEL CONTACT DERMATITIS {{is considered to be}} the commonest cause of dermatitis due to metal (1), but little information is available about possible im-mediate types of hypersensitivity reactions to the metal or its salts. Although much work has been done in animals, demonstrating pathological changes in the lungs after exposure to nickel carbonyl (2), and some pathological studies have been done in man after death from exposure to the same nickel salt (3), there is little clinical data {{on the role of the}} metal in allergic respiratory disease of man. Two cases of Loffler's syndrome associated with nickel have been reported (4, 5). We report a case study of a patient with asthma proved to result from exposure to nickel sulfate (NiS 04). Case Report The patient is a 24 -year-old man who began to work in a nickel <b>metal-plating</b> company in August of 1971. Within a week after he began to handle the metal parts being processed he noted a pruritic, vesicular eruption on areas of his body contacting the plating compound. This dermatitis was improved somewhat by protective covering of his hands. Ap-proximately 2 weeks later he noticed a nonproductive cough, chest tightness, and wheezing.

He did not have symptoms on weekends but repeatedly became ill shortly after arriving at work on Monday. At n...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis evaluates the performance of marine algal-based biosorbents in treating trace metal bearing aqueous solutions. Native seaweed varieties (Ascophyllum nodosum, Lessonia flavicans, Durvillea potatorum and Laminaria hyperborea) were {{selected on the basis}} of their varying algin composition as well as their characteristic mannuronic/guluronic acid content. Dealginated seaweed residues, i. e. waste materials arising during algin extraction from brown marine algae were also evaluated as potential metal biosorbent materials. The biosorbents showed significant metal sorption capacity for copper, cadmium, nickel and zinc from synthetic single metal and multi-metal bearing aqueous solutions. The equilibrium biosorption process may be described using a surface complex formation model. Copper biosorption involved chelation-type surface reactions as well as ion exchange whereas nickel and zinc biosorption may be described by simple ion exchange and electrostatic interactions between metal ions and the negatively charged algal surface. Evidence of stoichiometric release of protons upon metal biosorption has been found. Metal biosorption was found to be dependent upon transport limitations due to intraparticle diffusion. Surface functional groups within algal biosorbents that are responsible for metal-ion binding were identified in an attempt to understand the mechanisms of metal biosorption. Physical and chemical characterization techniques such as potentiometric titrations and esterification were used for surface acidity measurements, nitrogen sorption porosimetry for surface area and pore size distribution analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy to identify carboxyl groups attached to structural polysaccharides in algae. Performance of native and dealginate algal fixed-bed mini-columns provided optimum operating conditions for dynamic exchange between metal ions in solution and the algal biomass. Selected biosorbents were successfully employed to treat real industrial <b>metal-plating</b> rinse waters. The most efficient eluants for regeneration of metal-laden biosorbent columns were also identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{assessing}} {{the public health}} risk of exposure to particular environmental contaminants is complicated and full of assumptions and uncertainties (1, 2). However, the problems of assessing risks for chromium exposure are unusually complex (3, 4). The problems posed by current investigations of chromiumcontaminated soil in northern New Jersey (5), in part, provided the impetus for a conference on a research agenda for chromium contamination and risk assessment. During {{the first half of}} the present century, northern New Jersey was the chromite-chromate industrial capital of the world, and we face today the legacy of chromium-containing slag left by this industry and distributed gratis to many locations and communities in Hudson County. The magnitude of this waste problem measured in millions of tons at dozens of sites is staggering (5), but this conference (to the disappointment of some) is not about New Jersey per se but about the generic environmental health problems posed by chromium in the environment and the resultant human exposure and health risks. Chromium, because of its unique properties, was rapidly exploited for many purposes, first as a mordant and oxidizer in the dyeing industry, later in tanning, and then in metallurgy for its alloying properties with iron, and even more recently for its <b>metal-plating</b> properties (6). Chromium has been in commercial use for less than 300 years. It is a rather rare mineral in the earth's crust, with only a few deposits around the world proving economically exploitable. Although it does not have a long history comparable to lead, iron, or mercury, for example, it appears to be making up for this lack of history by providing major challenges for exposure and risk assessment and public health policy. The greatest challenge of chromium for the risk assessor, and certainly for the risk communicator, lies in the differential toxicity and carcinogenicity of trivalen...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of heavy metals within aquatic environments {{can be attributed}} to sources such as industry, municipal discharges, agriculture and natural processes which release various amounts into natural systems. Metals such as copper, zinc and chromium are listed as essential micronutrients for many plant and animal species. Of potential concern, however, is the tendency of heavy metals to accumulate within the food webs of ecosystems. Classified as biologically hard to degrade, heavy metals may concentrate to significant amounts within the trophic levels of a particular ecosystem. At these increased concentrations many of these heavy metals become toxic to living organisms. Previous research had detected the {{presence of}} heavy metals in water samples collected from the Missouri River near Sioux City, Iowa. Levels of zinc, copper and lead exceeding state quality standards water were observed in 1984 - 85 (Tondreau, 1984 - 86). The direct source of the metals was unknown but two local industries involved in <b>metal-plating</b> were suspected. Around this time the secondary treatment phase of Sioux City 2 ̆ 7 s wastewater treatment plant was shut down due to a shock load of zinc. The high metal levels were impetus to conduct studies on the bioaccumulation of metals within the aquatic communities found in the main channel border habitat of the channelized Missouri River. Conducted during the years 1986 and 1987, concentrations of copper, chromium, lead and zinc were measured in water, fish, periphyton and invertebrates collected at two sites just upstream from Sioux City R. M. 735 and downstream from Sioux City at R. M. 722. (Shane and Tondreau, 1987). Bioconcentration factors (BCF) were calculated by dividing the metal concentration of each aquatic group by the metal concentration in the water. Bioconcentration factors for the aquatic communities of periphyton, invertebrates and fish for 1987 are listed in Table 1...|$|E
