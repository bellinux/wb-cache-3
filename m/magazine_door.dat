50|$|Magazines are {{designed}} to be light-tight in and of themselves. However, usually this is buffered by additional precautions made to maintain light-tightness, against both fault of equipment and humans.

Sometimes the entire edge of the <b>magazine</b> <b>door</b> is taped as an extra measure of light-tightness, although for newer properly maintained magazines this is not strictly necessary.|$|E
