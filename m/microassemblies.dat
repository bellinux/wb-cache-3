40|$|Hybrid <b>microassembly</b> {{combines}} self-assembly {{technology with}} traditional robotic pick-and-place technology or other robotic feeding mechanics to construct microsystems. In a typical hybrid <b>microassembly</b> process, a micro part is brought {{adjacent to the}} assembly site by a robot handling tool at a high speed but with a relatively low precision, and liquid droplets dispensed by a dispenser at the assembly site align the part at a higher precision.

This thesis explores the adaptability of hybrid <b>microassembly</b> technique by investigating different hybrid <b>microassembly</b> methods and different types of the patterns. Three hybrid <b>microassembly</b> approaches have been investigated: 1) droplet assisted hybrid <b>microassembly,</b> 2) water mist induced hybrid <b>microassembly</b> and 3) hybrid <b>microassembly</b> with forced wetting. The droplet assisted hybrid <b>microassembly</b> has been studied using patterns with segments and patterns with jagged edges. Parallel <b>microassembly</b> of microchips with water mist induced hybrid <b>microassembly</b> has also been explored. Hybrid <b>microassembly</b> on hydrophobic receptor site with super-hydrophobic substrate has been experimentally investigated with two forced wetting techniques. Four different types of patterns have been investigated for hybrid <b>microassembly</b> technique: (a) oleophilic/phobic patterns, (2) hydrophobic/super-hydrophobic patterns, (3) segmented patterns and (4) patterns with jagged edges. Hybrid <b>microassembly</b> has been studied on a new patterned oleophilic/oleophobic surface using adhesive droplet in ambient air environment.

In order to develop advanced inspection/handling systems and methods for manipulation and assembly of micro products and micro components, robust micromanipulation and <b>microassembly</b> strategies can be implemented on a high-speed, repetitive, reliable, reconfigurable, robust and open-architecture <b>microassembly</b> workstation.

Reverse micelles, or water-in-oil microemulsions, are protein-sized, optically-clear <b>microassemblies</b> in which hydration can be experimentally controlled. We explore, by densimetry and ultrasound velocimetry, three basic proteins: cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myelin basic protein in reverse micelles made of sodium bis (2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate, water, and isooctane and in aqueous solvents. For comparison, we use β-lactoglobulin (pI= 5. 1) as a reference protein.

This system levitates a triangular single-moving-part platen, and produces the six-axis motion with six single-axis linear actuators. One of the prominent advantages of this magnetic levitation (maglev) system {{is that there is}} no physical contact between the moving part and the stator, which eliminates friction, wear, backlash, and hysteresis. As compared to other traditional devices, the present system is very compact with the minimum number of actuators for six-axis motion generation. The maglev device presented herein shows the position resolution better than 5 nm with 2 -nm rms position noise, and is capable of a velocity of 0. 5 m/s and an acceleration of 30 m/s 2. The nominal power consumption is only 15 mW by each horizontal actuator, and 320 mW by each vertical actuator. The actuators are sized to be able to orient and position a maximum payload of 1 kg. The key application of this maglev device is the manipulation at nanoscale for <b>microassemblies</b> and manufacture of their parts.

40|$|Proceedings of a {{workshop}} proposed in IEEE IROS' 2007. The increase of MEMS' functionalities often requires {{the integration of}} various technologies used for mechanical, optical and electronic subsystems {{in order to achieve}} a unique system. These different technologies have usually process incompatibilities and the whole microsystem can not be obtained monolithically and then requires <b>microassembly</b> steps. <b>Microassembly</b> of MEMS based on micrometric components {{is one of the most}} promising approaches to achieve high-performance MEMS. Moreover, <b>microassembly</b> also permits to develop suitable MEMS packaging as well as 3 D components although microfabrication technologies are usually able to create 2 D and " 2. 5 D" components. The study of <b>microassembly</b> methods is consequently a high stake for MEMS technologies growth. Two approaches are currently developped for microassembly: self-assembly and robotic <b>microassembly.</b> In the first one, the assembly is highly parallel but the efficiency and the flexibility still stay low. The robotic approach has the potential to reach precise and reliable assembly with high flexibility. The proposed workshop focuses on this second approach and will take a bearing of the corresponding microrobotic issues. Beyond the microfabrication technologies, performing MEMS <b>microassembly</b> requires, micromanipulation strategies, microworld dynamics and attachment technologies. The design and the fabrication of the microrobot end-effectors as well as the assembled micro-parts require the use of microfabrication technologies.

The devices are classified into species {{based on the}} design of their steering arm actuators, and the species are further classified as independent if they can be maneuvered independently using a single global control signal. In this paper, we show that microrobot species are independent if the two transition voltages of their steering arms, i. e., the voltages at which the arms are raised or lowered, form a unique pair. We present control algorithms that can be applied to groups of independent microrobot species to direct their motion from arbitrary nondeadlock configurations to desired planar <b>microassemblies.</b> We present designs and fabrication for four independent microrobot species, each with a unique transition voltage. The fabricated microrobots are used to demonstrate directed assembly of five types of planar structures from two classes of initial conditions.

Dipolar interactions between nano- and micron sized colloids lead to their assembly into domains with well-defined local order. The particles with a single dipole induced by an external field assemble into linear chains and clusters. However, to achieve the formation of multidirectionally organized nano-or <b>microassemblies</b> with tunable physical characteristics, more sophisticated interaction tools are needed. Here we demonstrate that such complex interactions can be introduced {{in the form of}} two independent, non-interacting dipoles (double-dipoles) within a microparticle. We show how this can be achieved by the simultaneous application of alternating current (AC) -electric field and uniform magnetic field to dispersions of superparamagnetic microspheres. Depending on their timing and intensity, concurrent electric and magnetic fields lead to the formation of bidirectional particle chains, colloidal networks, and discrete crystals. We investigate the mechanistic details of the assembly process, and identify and classify the non-equilibrium states formed. The morphologies of different experimental states are in excellent correlation with our theoretical predictions based on Brownian dynamics simulations combined with a structural analysis based on local energy parameters. This novel methodology of introducing and interpreting double-dipolar particle interactions may assist in the assembly of colloidal coatings, dynamically reconfigurable particle networks, and bidirectional active structures.

40|$|Latent {{transforming}} growth factor-beta- 1 binding protein- 2 (LTBP- 2) is {{a protein}} of ill-defined function associated with elastic fibers during elastinogenesis. Although LTBP- 2 binds fibrillin- 1, fibulin- 5, and heparin/heparan sulfate, molecules critical for normal elastic fiber assembly, {{it does not}} interact directly with elastin or its precursor, tropoelastin. We investigated the modulating effect of LTBP- 2 on two key interactions of tropoelastin during elastinogenesis a) with fibulin- 5 and b) with heparan sulfate (using heparin). Firstly, using solid phase assays we showed that LTBP- 2 bound fibulin- 5 (Kd= 26. 47 ± 5. 68 nM) with an affinity {{similar to that of}} the tropoelastin-fibulin- 5 interaction (Kd= 24. 66 ± 5. 64 nM). Then using a competitive binding assay we showed that LTBP- 2 inhibited the tropoelastin-fibulin- 5 interaction in a dose dependent manner with almost complete inhibition obtained with 5 -fold molar excess of LTBP- 2. Interestingly, a fragment of LTBP- 2 containing the fibulin- 5 binding sequence only partially inhibited the tropoelasin-fibulin- 5 interaction suggesting that LTBP- 2 was directly blocking only the C-terminal tropoelastin binding site on fibulin- 5 and indirectly blocking tropoelastin binding to the N-terminal region. In parallel experiments heparin was shown to have minor inhibitory effects on fibulin- 5 interactions with tropoelastin and LTBP- 2. However, LTBP- 2 was shown to significantly inhibit the binding of heparin to tropoelastin with 50 % inhibition achieved with 10 fold molar excess of LTBP- 2. Confocal microscopy of fibroblast matrix showed strong co-distribution of LTBP- 2 with fibulin- 5 and fibrillin- 1 and partial co-distribution with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, perlecan and syndecan- 4. Also addition of exogenous LTBP- 2 to ear cartilage chondrocyte cultures blocked elastinogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Overall the results indicate that LTBP- 2 may have a negative regulatory role during elastic fiber assembly, perhaps in displacing elastin <b>microassemblies</b> from complexes with fibulin- 5 and/or cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

40|$|LTBP- 2 is tightly {{associated}} with fibrillin microfibrils and elastic fibres {{in a range}} of tissues mainly in the lung, heart, skeletal muscle, placenta, liver and the aorta. LTBP- 2 belongs to the fibrillin-LTBP superfamily of extracellular matrix proteins. Unlike other LTBPs, LTBP- 2 does not covalently bind TGF-beta and its molecular function remains unclear. LTBP- 2 complexes with fibulin- 5, an elastin-chaperone protein critical for normal elastic fibre assembly, and {{it has been suggested that}} LTBP- 2 may preferentially direct fibulin- 5 -elastin globules onto fibrillin- 1 (rather than fibrillin- 2) microfibrils during elastinogenesis. However, we have now shown that LTBP- 2 inhibits rather than enhances the interaction of tropoelastin with fibulin- 5 in vitro. In addition LTBP- 2 inhibited elastic fibre assembly in ear cartilage chondrocyte cultures largely at the stage of elastin deposition onto the fibrillin microfibril scaffold. In parallel experiments, LTBP- 2 was shown to significantly inhibit the binding of heparin to tropoelastin suggesting LTBP- 2 may compete with tropoelastin for binding to certain cell surface HSPGs and contribute to controlling the release of elastin <b>microassemblies</b> from the cell surface. Confocal microscopy showed strong co-distribution of LTBP- 2 with fibulin- 5 and fibrillin- 1 and partial co-distribution with HSPGs, perlecan and syndecan- 4 in fibroblast matrix Thus it is evident that LTBP- 2 is a negative modulator of elastinogenesis and that LTBP- 2 levels may regulate the rate and extent of elastinogenesis in some tissues. A recent study has linked LTBP- 2 gene mutations to recessive form of Weill-Marchesani syndrome which is characterised by short stature, thick fibrotic skin and ectopia lentis. Since fibrillin- 1 mutations can also cause this syndrome it is now clear that LTBP- 2 is linked to fibrillin biology, growth factor regulation and fibrosis. To investigate growth factor binding to LTBP- 2, our laboratory screened a number of cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disorders and identified a very strong specific interaction of FGF- 2. The activity was confined to a central region of the LTBP- 2 consisting of 6 EGF-like repeats, suggesting a single binding sequence. The finding presented in this thesis found that 5 -fold molar excess LTBP- 2 can completely block FGF- 2 stimulation of fibroblast proliferation via its receptor. In addition increased levels and extensive co-localisation of LTBP- 2 and FGF- 2 were observed and quantitated in human hypertrophic scars and keloids. Furthermore, qPCR confirmed consistent elevation of LTBP- 2 and FGF- 2 expression in samples of these fibrotic tissues. The results support the concept that increased LTBP- 2 expression in fibrotic disorders may increase FGF- 2 binding and reduce FGF- 2 activity, inhibiting normal repair processes. Previously we have shown that LTBP- 2 competes with LTBP- 1 for binding to fibrillin in vitro, suggesting that LTBP- 2 may modulate TGF-β storage and activation. In experiments designed to measure displacement of TGF-β complexes from fibrillin microfibrils, our laboratory discovered addition of LTBP- 2, or a small bioactive fragment LTBP- 2 C F 3 to MSU 1. 1 skin fibroblasts resulted in a large increase in TGF-β levels in culture medium. However the increase in TGF-β the medium was cycloheximide sensitive indicating elevated cellular expression and secretion of TGF-β rather than release of matrix-stored TGF-β. Exogenous LTBP- 2 or fragment F 3 significantly increased levels of latent TGF-β in the medium after 9 h peaking at 15 h. The signalling mechanism appears to involve the PI 3 K/Akt and p 38 MAPK pathways, as incubation of cells with LTBP- 2 (10 μg/ml) elevated Akt 1 / 2 / 3 Ser 473 and P 38 D- 8 phosphorylation and inhibition of each pathway completely blocked the synthesis of TGF-β. Investigation of the cell surface receptor for the bioactive fragment of LTBP- 2 was less informative. Inhibitory antibody to β 1 integrins did not affect the TGF-β upregulation but it was partially inhibited by an antibody to the integrin αVβ 3 receptor, suggesting it may be involved in LTBP- 2 -cell interaction(s) resulting in elevated TGF-β expression. In conclusion, these findings are consistent with LTBP- 2 having novel regulatory functions in elastinogenesis, growth factor modulation and fibrosis which may lead to novel therapy development for fibrotic diseases and tissue repair.

40|$|Parallel {{motion and}} {{cooperation}} of multiple microrobots has many potential applications, including <b>microassembly.</b> In this paper, we present designs, {{theory and the}} results of fabrication and testing for an untethered multi-microrobotic system of stressengineered MEMS microrobots that implements a novel <b>microassembly</b> scheme. Our work constitutes the first implementation of an untethered, mobile multi-microrobotic system. The robots are designed such that multiple devices can be independently maneuvered using a single, global control signal. We used a novel stress-engineering fabrication process to build 15 microrobots and used these to demonstrate <b>microassembly</b> of five types of planar structures from two classes of initial conditions.

40|$|<b>Microassembly</b> and microadjustment {{techniques}} are key technologies {{in the industrial}} production of hybrid microelectromechanical systems. One focal point in current microproduction research and engineering is the design and development of high-precision <b>microassembly</b> and microadjustment equipment capable of operating {{within the framework of}} flexible automated industrial production. As well as these developments, suitable <b>microassembly</b> tools for industrial use also need to be equipped with interfaces for the supply and delivery of microcomponents. The <b>microassembly</b> process necessitates the supply of microparts in a geometrically defined manner. In order to reduce processing steps and production costs, there is a demand for magazines capable of providing free accessibility to the fixed microcomponents. Commonly used at present are feeding techniques, which originate from the field of semiconductor production. However, none of these techniques fully meets the requirements of industrial mic roassembly technology. A novel modular magazine set, developed and tested in a joint project, is presented here. The magazines are able to hold microcomponents during cleaning, inspection and assembly without any additional handling steps. The modularity of their design allows for maximum technical flexibility. The modular magazine fits into currently practiced SEMI standards. The design and concept of the magazine enables industrial manufacturers to promote a cost-efficient and flexible precision assembly of microelectromechanical systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Micro-masonry is a {{route to}} <b>microassembly</b> that {{involves}} elastomeric-stamp-based micromanipulation and direct bonding. This paper presents {{the assembly of}} MEMS mechanical sensors and actuators using micro-masonry, demonstrating its capability of constructing 3 -D microdevices that are impossible or difficult to realize with monolithic microfabrication. Micro-fabrication processes for retrievable MEMS components (e. g., combs, spacers, and flexure beams) are developed. As microma-nipulation tools, microtipped elastomeric stamps with reversible dry adhesion are also designed and fabricated {{to pick up and}} deterministically place those components. After the manipulation, the components are permanently bonded together via rapid thermal annealing without using any additional intermediate layers. The assembled MEMS device is modeled and analyzed in consideration of the <b>microassembly</b> misalignment. The sensing and actuating capabilities of the assembled MEMS devices are experimentally characterized.

40|$|International audienceFor many years, the {{increasing}} development of microcomponents based products requires {{more and more}} <b>microassembly</b> systems to permit the assembly of micrometric parts and MEMS. These systems require different tasks such as micromanipulation, <b>microassembly,</b> supervision, quality inspection and also require accurate metric measurements from images. The most widely used image sensor is the photon videomicroscope which is characterized by several weaknesses such as the depthof- field and the field-of-view. This paper deals with the calibration {{of this kind of}} imaging system used for robotic <b>microassembly.</b> In the first part, a multiscale calibration paradigm is proposed and is used to pick and place silicon microparts (400 × 400 × 100 μm 3) using multiscale 2 D visual servoing. In a second part, these microparts are assembled by a 3 D visual control approach. High precision, repeatable results are obtained during the MEMS manipulation and assembly tasks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis chapter aims {{to develop}} a self-sensing {{technique}} to measure the displacement and the force in piezoelectric microactuators dedicated to micromanipulation and <b>microassembly</b> contexts. In order to answer the requirements in these contexts, the developed self-sensing should perform a long duration measurement of constant signals (displacement and force) {{as well as a}} high precision. Furthermore, we propose to consider the dynamics in the displacement self-sensing measurement such that a positioning feedback is possible and therefore a high micro/nanopositioning accuracy is obtained.
