40|$|One {{key element}} for the {{industrial}} use of applications using high current pulses is the electrical switch. Such applications are {{for example the}} recycling of composite materials using shock waves, magnetoforming for the contactless joining of work pieces, plasma accelerators for surface processing or pulsed plasma X-ray sources. In this work a radial <b>multichannel</b> <b>switch</b> for currents higher than 100 kA has been investigated {{with respect to the}} increase of the lifetime demanded by industrial use and stable operation for voltages up to 30 kV. For the increase of the operation voltage the electrode geometry has been optimised with the result of a maximum achieved hold-off voltage of 40 kV under the constraints given by the principle of the geometry of the radial <b>multichannel</b> <b>switch.</b> To increase the operation voltage the electronic supply of a high dielectric trigger unit has been matched to the requirements of multichannel operation. Simultaneous ignition of at least 12 discharge channels has been demonstrated using this trigger concept. With the improvements of the electrode geometry and the trigger system a stable operation of at least 27 kV has been successfully demonstrated. Basic investigations of the type and the spatial distribution of the cathode spots reveal that the investigated electrode concept allows to distribute the discharge current homogeneously over the electrode surface which is necessary for low erosive operation. This low erosion has been demonstrated in lifetime tests with pulsed currents of 130 kA and a pulse duration around 20 #mu#s. For this parameter set a lifetime of more than one million pulses has been demonstrated {{for the first time with}} negligible electrode erosion. (orig.)

We find that the gain dynamics of a doped-fiber amplifier are completely specified by its total number of excited ions r, whose time behavior is described by a simple first-order differential equation. We exploit this new understanding of amplifier gain dynamics: 1) to develop an equivalent circuit model for amplifier gain dynamics, 2) to identify that channel addition causes much faster transients than channel dropping in wavelength division multiplexing networks, and 3) to demonstrate that gain excursions can be significant in <b>multichannel</b> packet <b>switching</b> applications, which unlike time-multiplexed signals are characterized by bursts and lulls in communications.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce erosion of {{electrodes}} and consequently achieve a long lifetime for high-power switches, alow-pressure switch, namely the pseudospark switch (PSS), is investigated {{as an alternative to}} the conventional high-power switches.

An intense electron beam is known to be emitted by the hollow cathode during the starting phase in a pseudospark discharge.

40|$|In {{the span}} of past one decade, {{the world has been}} revolutionised by the {{technology}} development and innovations. High speed communication technology on smarter and smaller gadgets has turned into a basic necessity of mankind today. With the growing market of consumerism each year, the technology has been pushing its limits for denser integration, high speed data transfer, and low power budget on cost effective hardware. For a long time opto-electronics has widely explored on various compound semiconductor platform for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM). However, to meet the growing demands of large volumes of data on traditional silicon platform, silicon on insulator (SOI) is the key to next generation hybrid devices. Silicon photonics on the SOI platform offers compatibility to LSI, by dense integration due to the nano-scale waveguide dimensions which is possible due to the refractive index contrast. The large confinement factor in SOI waveguides allows designing sharper bends in 10 s of micrometers. Silicon waveguides are being explored for wide applications such as silicon hybrid lasers, modulators, switches, filters and photo-detectors. Compared to compound semiconductors, SOI has limited physical phenomena to control the index modulation: thermo-optic effect and carrier plasma effect. Using carrier plasma effects high speed modulators of up-to 20 Gps have been successfully developed. On the other hand thermo-optic devices also have gained wide popularity for their stable performance for switching despite of low speed operation. However by optimized circuit design techniques the extent of these physical phenomena’s can be further exploited totheir extent. The challenge of smaller, faster and low power still hunts the industry to achieve ultra nano scale hybrid integration. In silicon-based photonic circuits, an optical modulator and switch {{are one of the most}} important devices. So far, microring resonator and Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) based modulators and switches have been well explored and developed individually. A Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) is a spectrally efficient device owing to its low chirp and multilevel modulation formats. However, considering the integration density it is necessary to design smaller MZM devices operable at lower power. On A microring resonator (MRR) is also a key device for ultra-compact optical modulator/switch having multiple wavelength channels, owing to its wavelength selectivity and phase-shift characteristics. However, the modulators and switches based on MRRs have less extinction ratio and higher power consumption. Therefore the combination of an interferometer and a resonator as MRR-loaded MZI can be a promising device for low power consumption and compactness owing to the phase-shift enhancement. In this study, we have demonstrated thermo-optically-driven silicon MRRloaded MZI to achieve low-power operation with a compact design for modulation and switching. Five devices were fabricated using the proposed geometry on SOI structure using the CMOS standard process: 1. Single MRR-loaded MZI Modulator/Switch (Low power) 2. Cascaded MRR-loaded MZI Modulator/Switch (Multiple wavelength operation) 3. Push pull MRR-loaded MZI Modulator/Switch (Low driving voltage operation) 4.
