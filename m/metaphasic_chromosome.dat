40|$|A {{recombinant}} plasmid containing sequences complementary to human pro-alpha l(I) collagen mRNA {{was used for}} the chromosomal assignment of the pro-alpha l(I) collagen gene. Restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA from mouse-human and Chinese hamster-human somatic cell hybrids revealed cosegregation with human chromosome 17. Hybrids containing derivative chromosomes with a t(2; 17) (q 14;q 21) translocation showed cosegregation of the pro-alpha l(I) gene with the segment 17 q 21 leads to qter. In situ hybridization on human <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> confirmed this conclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromosome}} morphology {{and number}} in somatic and germinal cells were studied in some species of Macrobiotus. Most {{of these species}} ((M. areolatus, M. coronifer, M. harmsworthi, M. hufelandi, and the bisexual biotype of M. richtersi) have 2 n = 12 chromosomes, but in two freswater species with similar morphology (M. dispar and M. pullari) 2 n = 10 chromosomes are found. The chromosome number in males and females of M. areolatus and M. richtersi is the same. In the ripening oocytes {{and in the first}} blastomeres the <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> show a peculiar large size. No idiograms were made because the chromosomes are too small, similar and without detectable centromeres...|$|R
40|$|Some {{environmental}} mutagenic agents cause genomic {{instability and}} increase susceptibility of DNA damage. One {{of them is}} mitomycin C which is connected to DNA as an alkylating factor and affects susceptible cells to reduction reactions. This drug is used in chemotherapy and treatment of tumors. Study of genomic instability {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of MMC can show susceptibility of DNA damage in the patients who are under chemotherapy with this drug. For this purpose, SCE is a qualified method that shows the number of sister chromatid exchanges in the <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The number of 10 ^ 5 lymphocytic cells which were separated with ficol, were cultured in media (5 ml, F 12 15...|$|R
40|$|Recombinant DNA probes {{specific}} for {{the human}} pro alpha 1 (II) and pro alpha 1 (III) collagen chains {{have been used for}} the chromosomal localization of the two genes. Restriction endonuclease analysis of DNA from human-rodent hybrid cell lines in conjunction with in situ hybridization of human <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have shown that the gene coding for the pro alpha 1 chain of type II collagen (COL 2 A 1) is located on chromosome 12 in the segment 12 q 131 [...] 12 q 132. Likewise, the gene coding for the pro alpha 1 chain of type III collagen (COL 3 A 1) was assigned to the segment 2 q 31 [...] 2 q 323 of chromosome 2...|$|R
40|$|Defensins are {{a family}} of host defence {{peptides}} that {{play an important role}} in the innate immunity of mammalian and avian species. In humans, four b-defensins have been isolated so far, corresponding to the products of the genes DEFB 1 (h-BD 1, GenBank accession number NM_ 005218); DEFB 4 (h-Bd 2, NM_ 004942. 2), DEFB 103 (h-BD 3, NM_ 018661); and DEFB 104 (hBD 4, NM_ 080389) mapping on chromosome 8 p 23. 22. We have localized b- defensin genes on <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of great apes and several non-human primate species to determine their physical mapping. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization and BAC probes containing the four b-defensin genes, we have mapped the homologous regions to the b-defensin genes on chromosome 8 p 23 -p. 22 in non-human primates, while no signals were detected on prosimians chromosomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper are {{described}} the karyotypes and the morphological traits of the chromosomes of two species of Inula: Inula spiraeifolia L. and Inula hirta L. We have used achenes of the two species. After germination the roots were prefixed in 0, 2 % colchicine, fixed and stained according to Feulgen method. The karyotype of Inula spiraeifolia L. (2 n= 16) is highly symmetrical with small length <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> All the eight pairs are classified as median chromosomes. All studied specimens were diploid. We have realized two variants of karyotype for Inula hirta L. (2 n= 16). In both cases the eight pairs are classified as median and submedian chromosomes. Also no polyploidisation phenomena were observed. As we know, this paper is the first report of karyological analysis of these species in Romania and our results are convergent with the data reported by foreign authorsl. </p...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} and cloned an 800 -bp highly repeated DNA (HRDNA) sequence from Lemur catta (LCA) and described its localization on LCA chromosomes. Lemur catta HRDNA sequences were localized by performing FISH experiments on standard and elongated <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> using an LCA HRDNA probe (LCASAT). A complex hybridization pattern was detected. A strong pericentromeric hybridization signal was observed on most LCA chromosomes. Chromosomes 7 and 13 were lit in pericentromeric regions, {{as well as}} in the interspersed heterochromatin. Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 17, 19, X, and microchromosomes (20, 25, 26, and 27) showed no signals in the pericentromeric region, but chromosomes 3 and 4 showed a positive hybridization in heterochromatic regions. The 800 -bp L catta HRDNA was species specific. We performed FISH experiments with the LCASAT probe on Eulemur macaco macaco (EMA) and Eulemur fulvus fulvus (EFU) metaphases and no positive signal of hybridization was detected. These findings were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis and PCR...|$|R
40|$|Nucleolin is a {{ubiquitous}} multifunctional protein {{involved in}} preribosome assembly and associated with both nucleolar chromatin in interphase and nucleolar organizer regions on <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in mitosis. Extensive nucleolin phosphorylation by a casein kinase (CKII) occurs on serine in growing cells. Here {{we report that}} while CKII phosphorylation is achieved in interphase, threonine phosphorylation occurs during mitosis. We provide evidence {{that this type of}} in vivo phosphorylation involves a mammalian homolog of the cell cycle control Cdc 2 kinase. In vitro M-phase H 1 kinase from starfish oocytes phosphorylated threonines in a TPXK motif present nine times in the amino-terminal part of the protein. The same sites which matched the p 34 cdc 2 consensus phosphorylation sequence were used in vivo during mitosis. We propose that successive Cdc 2 and CKII phosphorylation could modulate nucleolin function in controlling cell cycle-dependent nucleolar function and organization. Our results, along with previous studies, suggest that while serine phosphorylation is related to nucleolin function in the control of rDNA transcription, threonine phosphorylation is linked to mitotic reorganization of nucleolar chromatin...|$|R
40|$|In humans, the poly(A) -binding {{proteins}} (PABPs) {{comprise a}} small nuclear isoform and a conserved gene family that displays {{at least three}} functional proteins: PABP 1, inducible PABP (iPABP), and PABP 3, plus four pseudogenes (1, 2, 3, and PABP 4). In situ hybridization of PABP 3 cDNA as the probe on <b>metaphasic</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have revealed five possible loci for this gene family at 2 q 21 -q 22, 13 q 11 -q 12, 12 q 13. 3 -q 15, 8 q 22, and 3 q 24 -q 25. Amplifications of specific DNA fragments from a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel have allowed us to associate PABP 1 and PABP 3 with 8 q 22 and 13 q 11 -q 12, respectively. The iPABP gene has been assigned to chromosome 1. This result, compared with radiation hybrid database information, strengthens the location of this gene to 1 p 32 -p 36. The pseudogenes PABP 4, 1, and 2 have been assigned to chromosomes 15, 4, and 14, respectively. Three loci detected on chromosome spreads are not associated with any amplified fragment. They might represent other related PABP genes not yet identified...|$|R
40|$|The {{topographic}} {{structure of}} Giemsa banded (G-banded) early metaphase human chromosomes adsorbed on glass was analyzed by {{atomic force microscope}} using amplitude modulation mode [AM-AFM]. Longitudinal height measurements for early <b>metaphasic</b> human <b>chromosomes</b> showed a central ridge that was further characterized by transversal height measurements. The heterochromatic regions displayed {{a high level of}} transversal symmetry, while the euchromatic ones presented several peaks across the transversal height measurements. We suggest that this central ridge and symmetry patterns point out a transitional arrangement of the early metaphase chromosome and support evidence for interchromatidal interactions prior to disjunction...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The authors {{present the}} results of {{cytogenetic}} analysis of 21 patients with laryngeal carcinomas diagnosed and treated in the period 1995 - 2000 at the Institute of Otorhinolaryngology and Maxillofacial Surgery, Clinical Center of Serbia and Clinical Center of Novi Sad. Material and methods. The patients were specially monitored and the material was analyzed at the Institute of Human Genetics of the School of Medicine in Belgrade {{as well as in}} the Laboratory for Radiological Protection of the Institute of Occupational and Radiological Health 'Dr Dragomir Karajovic' in Belgrade. Results. The incidence of chromosomal aberrations and incidence of exchange of material between sister chromatids were observed in the preparation of the <b>metaphasic</b> lymphocyte <b>chromosomes</b> of the peripheral blood obtained in the culture. Structural aberrations were found on the chromosomes in the form of breakups, rings, translocations and dicentrics as early as after a single exposure of patients to tumor radiation dose of 2 Gy in the field sized 5 x 7. Out of the total number of 35 cultivated blood samples obtained from 13 patients, 21 were successfully cultivated and they were proved to contain chromosomal aberrations. Some of the peripheral blood samples failed to show cell growth in vitro due to the lethal cell damages in vivo. Discussion [...] We have consluded that the number of structural aberrations cannot be used as a biological measure of the absorbed ionizing radiation dose. The presence of aberrations per se is indicative of the mutagenic effect of the ionizing radiation, which was also confirmed in our series on the original model by cultivation of the peripheral blood lymphocytes in the culture of the cells of the volunteer donors upon in vitro radiation. Using the method of bromdeoxyuridylreductase, the increased incidence of SCE as a mutagenic effect was registered. Conclusion. It has been concluded that the increase of absorbed radiation dose in vitro leads to prolonged duration of cell cycle in the same conditions, which proves cytostatic effect of radiation. Further fundamental studies are required for clinical implementation of the findings...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) {{cell line}} and its {{different}} strains {{are widely used}} as models for studying epithelial simple polarity. Recently Dukes et al. [BMC Cell Biology 12 : 43, 2011] provided a useful guide to the different MDCK strains, with a directory of where to buy them. The present work focused on chromosome content of MDCK cells, a parameter often disregarded by researchers working with these cells. FINDINGS: Using a general and reliable method for obtaining high yield of <b>metaphasic</b> preparations, the <b>chromosome</b> content of MDCK, MDCK I, MDCK II obtained from reliable sources was determined after maintaining them in culture for various periods of time. Within two months significant changes were observed in the range and {{the mean number of}} chromosomes of MDCK I and MDCK II cells. MDCK II cells routinely cultured in six different laboratories were also examined. In some of these cultures the cells have considerably drifted as shown by a high scattering in their number of chromosomes. CONCLUSION: These results entitle me to encourage researchers using MDCK cells obtained from reliable sources, to determine their chromosomal content upon receipt, to check this content after several passages, to use this feature to follow the possible drift of these cells, and finally to avoid working with cells maintained for more than two months in culture...|$|R
