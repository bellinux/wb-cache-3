500|$|Terri {{has been}} poorly {{received}} by critics. The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called her [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and the show's [...] "one big flaw". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly has described {{her as a}} [...] "shrill, lying nag", whose main function is to bring the audience down. Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times, however, has praised Gilsig's acting in the role, and stated that his hatred of the character dissipated once her fake pregnancy was exposed. He noted that: [...] "Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames", and while he still isn't [...] "in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have my attention on the sidelines, as opposed to filing <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> until halftime. Baby steps, right?" ...|$|E
500|$|Gerrick Kennedy, in {{a review}} of [...] "Mattress" [...] for the Los Angeles Times, noted that in {{previous}} reviews he had [...] "never been shy of [...] disdain for Mrs. Schuester". He called her [...] "manipulative, heartless [...] shrill", and added that [...] "this whole train wreck of a fake pregnancy just added fuel to the fire that became a raging inferno of hate for Terri." [...] He also noted: [...] "Gilsig's superb acting isn't exactly doing anything to extinguish those flames", and while he still isn't [...] "in full-on Team Terri uniform [...] she did at least have my attention on the sidelines, as opposed to filing <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> until halftime. Baby steps, right?" [...] Kennedy praised the confrontation scene, and wrote that it was [...] "devastating" [...] to watch and that his hate for Terri [...] "vanished" [...] once the lie was over. Kennedy described: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear Laura, {{you know}} I do not ridicule you. You know I love {{you for what}} you are doing. Would not I do the same, and fight for him down to <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> if I had a brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} called it idleness; I didn't," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "I had my hair cut and <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> manicured; I was {{measured}} for four new suits of clothes, {{a certain number of}} shirts, and I bought some other indispensable trifles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{afterwards}} I dreamt {{dreams of}} precipices. I made strides over precipices, I fell and fell with a floating swiftness towards remote valleys, I was assailed by eagles upon a perilous ledge that crumbled away {{and left me}} clinging by <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> to nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{you dare}} do it," [...] she answered, with such fine intrepidity that I was silent, {{and began to}} crease {{patterns}} on the cloth with <b>my</b> thumb <b>nail.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Am I to work <b>my</b> very <b>nails</b> off, {{and push}} that {{perambulator}} about all day till my legs won't carry me,--and then I ain't to go out, not {{once in a}} week?' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{little pink}} sloth-creature was still {{blinking}} {{at me when}} my Ape-man reappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned me in. As he did so a slouching monster wriggled {{out of one of}} the places, further up this strange street, and stood up in featureless silhouette against the bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated, having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and then, determined to go through with the adventure, I gripped <b>my</b> <b>nailed</b> stick about the middle and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after my conductor.|$|R
60|$|I clung {{with both}} hands till <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> ached, and I shut my eyes as if {{to cover up the}} peril. Gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted down to a more natural time, and I was once more in {{possession}} of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "But oh, what's the use? I can't ever be {{anything}} but a dub! Cleaning <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> to make a hit with a girl that's got hands like hers! It's a long trail to Seattle, but it's a darn sight longer one to being--being--well, sophisticated. Oh! And incidentally, what the deuce am I {{going to do in}} Seattle if I do get there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{the boat}} was loaded I washed my hands seven times, and pared beneath <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> for I would not keep one grain. I went out by the little gate where the Castle's refuse is thrown. I dared not hoist sail lest men should see me; but the Lord {{commanded}} the tide to bear me carefully, and I was far from land before the morning.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Child," [...] {{replied the}} French commandant, [...] "you talk foolishly. You say this land belongs to you; {{there is not}} the black of <b>my</b> <b>nail</b> yours. It is my land, and I will have it, let who will stand up against me. I am not afraid of flies and mosquitoes, for as such I {{consider}} the Indians. I tell you that down the river I will go, and build upon it. If it were blocked up I have forces sufficient to burst it open and trample down all who oppose me. My force is as the sand upon the sea-shore. Therefore here is your wampum; I fling it at you." ...|$|R
60|$|I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, {{and rose}} with a torn ear and {{bleeding}} face. I {{had fallen into}} a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre. I was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I {{had no time to}} stand wondering then. I turned to my right, down-stream, hoping to come to the sea in that direction, and so have my way open to drown myself. It was only later I found that I had dropped <b>my</b> <b>nailed</b> stick in <b>my</b> fall.|$|R

6000|$|... "He was Lord of the Earth, but I was {{the prophet}} of the God of Heaven," [...] cried the Saint, [...] "and {{all the people}} marvelled at the sign. For I, O God, knew of the glories of thy Paradise. No pain, no hardship, gashing with knives, {{splinters}} thrust under <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> strips of flesh flayed off, all for the glory and honour of God." ...|$|E
60|$|I dug <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> {{into the}} palms of my hands, I set my teeth, but tears blinded me, sobs would have choked me had speech been {{required}} of me. The old vicar read on, there came a mumbled response--and so on to the end. I wept as it were internally, and only when we {{had come out of}} the churchyard could I think and speak calmly again.|$|E
60|$|But his hint was unnecessary; I dug <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> {{into the}} jack-stays, and swore that nothing but death should part me and them until I {{was able to}} turn round and look to windward. As yet, this was impossible; I could {{scarcely}} hear the man to leeward at my elbow; the wind seemed to snatch the words from his mouth and fly away {{with them to the}} South Pole.|$|E
6000|$|Calib. I pr'ythee let {{me bring}} thee where crabs grow; and I, with <b>my</b> long <b>nails,</b> will dig thee pig-nuts, shew thee a jay's nest, and {{instruct}} thee how to snare the marmozet: I'll bring thee to clustered filberts. Wilt thou go with me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would crush {{you like}} an insect beneath <b>my</b> <b>nail.</b> Murder you! Have you thought what murder is;--that {{there are more}} ways of murder than one? Have you thought {{of the life of}} that young girl who now bears in her womb the fruit of your body? Would you murder her,--because she loved you, and trusted you, and gave you all simply because you asked her; and then think of your own life? As the God of Heaven is above me, and sees me now, and the Saviour in whose blood I trust, I would lay down my life this instant, if I could save her from your heartlessness." [...] So saying he too turned away his face and wept like a child.|$|R
60|$|It {{was like}} a game, going down that canyon. <b>My</b> heavy <b>nailed</b> boots struck fire from the rocks. My heavy gloves {{protected}} my hands as I slid and hung on and let go. I outfooted the avalanches and wherever I came to a scaly slope or bank or decayed rock, I leaped down in sheer delight.|$|R
6000|$|Hapless, hapless, I must be [...] All {{the hours}} of life I see, [...] Since my foolish nurse did once [...] Bed me on her leggen bones; [...] Since my mother did not weel [...] To snip <b>my</b> <b>nails</b> with blades of steel.

6000|$|For dame Annatoo, {{almost from}} our first {{boarding}} the brigantine, something in our manner had bred in her a lurking {{doubt as to}} the genuineness of our atmospheric organization; and abandoned to her speculations when Samoa fled from her side, her incredulity waxed stronger and stronger. Whence we came she knew not; enough, that we seemed bent upon pillaging her own precious purloinings. Alas! thought she, my buttons, <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> my tappa, my dollars, my beads, and my boxes! ...|$|E
6000|$|Resolved my annual verse to pay, By duty bound, on Stella's day; Furnished with paper, pens, and ink, I gravely {{sat me down}} to think: I bit <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> and {{scratched}} my head, But found my wit and fancy fled; Or, if with more than usual pain, A thought came slowly from my brain, It cost me Lord knows how much time To shape it into sense and rhyme; And, what was yet a greater curse, Long-thinking made my fancy worse ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Mr. Dash, a chivalric young {{gentleman from}} Virginia, [...] "I wouldn't strike yet; I'd <b>nail</b> <b>my</b> colours to the main-royal-mast! I would, by Jove!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} I heard a staghound bay, {{and at that}} realised a new danger. I took {{little time}} to think, or they would have caught me then, but snatching up <b>my</b> <b>nailed</b> stick, rushed headlong from my hiding-place towards {{the sound of the}} sea. I remember a growth of thorny plants, with spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and with torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward. I went straight into the water without a minute's hesitation, wading up the creek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream. I scrambled out at last on the westward bank, and with my heart beating loudly in my ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, and yelp {{when it came to the}} thorns. Then I heard no more, and presently began to think I had escaped.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going back}} home--to have another look for those missing papers," [...] said Andy. [...] "Besides, I {{want to bring}} away the rest of <b>my</b> things, and <b>nail</b> up the cabin." ...|$|R
60|$|One {{familiar}} {{feature of}} Arizona travel manifested itself {{to me that}} day--the dry air. <b>My</b> <b>nails</b> became brittle and my lips began to crack. I have had my lips cracked so severely that when I tried to bite bread they would split and bleed and hurt so that I could not eat. This matter of sore lips was for long a painful matter. I tried many remedies, and finally found one, camphor ice, that would prevent the drying and cracking.|$|E
60|$|He put out {{a strangely}} {{distorted}} talon and gripped my fingers. The thing was almost like the hoof of a deer produced into claws. I could have yelled with surprise and pain. His face came forward and peered at <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> came forward {{into the light of}} the opening of the hut and I saw with a quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither man nor beast, but a mere shock of grey hair, with three shadowy over-archings to mark the eyes and mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} about that," [...] said the smith; [...] "but I {{know that a}} man with a gray palmer's hat and gown was here no very long time ago, and that he sat on yonder stump and ate a cold pullet and drank a flask of wine. Then he begged from me one of <b>my</b> <b>nails,</b> and filling his scrip with stones, he went upon his way. Look at these nails, and see if they {{are not the same as}} that which he has sold you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] she {{instantly}} replied. [...] "I am sure my guides will {{do anything}} they can to meet your wishes. You may <b>nail</b> <b>my</b> dress to the floor if you wish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ill-fard, crazy, crack-brained gowk, {{that she}} is!" [...] exclaimed the housekeeper, {{as she saw}} them depart, [...] "to set up to be sae muckle better than ither folk, the auld besom, and to bring sae muckle {{distress}} on a douce quiet family! If it hadna been that I am mair than half a gentlewoman by my station, I wad hae tried <b>my</b> ten <b>nails</b> in the wizen'd hide o' her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{grave and}} logical conduct of an absurd proposition, as {{exemplified}} in the cannibal proposal just mentioned, is our author’s constant method through all his works of humour. Given {{a country of}} people six inches or sixty feet high, and by the mere process of the logic, a thousand wonderful absurdities are evolved, at so many stages of the calculation. Turning to the first minister who waited behind him with a white staff near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, the King of Brobdingnag observes how contemptible a thing human grandeur is, as represented by such a contemptible little creature as Gulliver. “The Emperor of Lilliput’s features are strong and masculine” (what a surprising humour there is in this description!)—“the Emperor’s features,” Gulliver says, “are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip, an arched nose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs well-proportioned, and his deportment majestic. He is taller by the breadth of <b>my</b> <b>nail</b> {{than any of his}} court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into beholders.” ...|$|R
