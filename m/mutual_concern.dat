25|$|In {{pursuit of}} a more nuanced {{approach}} {{to the history of}} Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive Polish Jewry {{and the ways in which}} Poles and Jews have confronted their common history. Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of <b>mutual</b> <b>concern.</b> At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.|$|E
25|$|While Muslim intellectuals {{were already}} acquainted with Greek {{philosophy}} (especially logic), al-Kindi {{is credited with}} being the first real Muslim philosopher. His own thought was largely influenced by the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Proclus, Plotinus and John Philoponus, amongst others, although he does appear to have borrowed ideas from other Hellenistic schools as well. He makes many references to Aristotle in his writings, but these are often unwittingly re-interpreted in a Neo-Platonic framework. This trend is most obvious {{in areas such as}} metaphysics and the nature of God as a causal entity. Earlier experts had suggested that he was influenced by the Mutazilite school of theology, because of the <b>mutual</b> <b>concern</b> both he and they demonstrated for maintaining the singularity (tawhid) of God. However, such agreements are now considered incidental, as further study has shown that they disagreed on a number of equally important topics.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{milestone in}} interstate cooperation outside {{the framework of}} the Articles of Confederation occurred in March 1785, when delegates representing Maryland and Virginia met in Virginia, to address navigational rights in the states's common waterways. On March 28, 1785, the group drew up a thirteen-point proposal to govern the two states' rights on the Potomac River, Pocomoke River, and Chesapeake Bay. Known as the Mount Vernon Compact (formally titled the [...] "Compact of 1785"), this agreement not only covered tidewater navigation but also extended to issues such as toll duties, commerce regulations, fishing rights, and debt collection.

2500|$|Consultation is {{the process}} by which {{management}} and employees (or their representatives) jointly examine and discuss issues of <b>mutual</b> <b>concern.</b> It involves seeking acceptable solutions to problems through an exchange of views and information.

[...] The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS), is the UK government's independent agency for advice and conciliation. [...] Although the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and their member unions oppose the use of consultancies during recognition campaigns, calling it a union busting tactic, ACAS takes a different stance, [...] "Employee communications and consultation are the lifeblood of any business. which [...] "aims to improve organizations and working life through better employment relations".|$|E
2500|$|As the {{construction}} continued throughout 1905, Col. Page continued {{to meet with}} each of the big railroads to attempt to negotiate rates for the Deepwater Railway's coal, offering to stop construction on the Tidewater Railway, and/or perhaps sell off his fledging enterprise. The leaders of the C and N exchanged correspondence which has been preserved in company archives sharing their <b>mutual</b> <b>concern</b> about the [...] "common enemy." [...] To them, Page {{did not appear to be}} financially capable of the project and they were skeptical that the new Deepwater and Tidewater railroads could be financed and completed. After all, they reasoned, there had been no public offering of bonds or stock, which were the way such enterprises were customarily financed at the time. All across the United States, railroad projects had been started, and many had died for lack of funds. Perhaps, the Page enterprise would join such ranks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{major players}} of the Trial Smelter dispute were {{the owners of the}} smelter, the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (COMINCO), and the American {{residents}} (mostly farmers and landowners who were affected by the smoke generated from the smelter). The farmers and landowners in Washington who had a <b>mutual</b> <b>concern</b> for the smoke drifting from the smelter, formed the Citizens' Protective Association (CPA) when their direct complaints to COMINCO were not addressed. Initially the regional governments became involved, both the province of British Columbia and Washington State, but eventually the two federal governments took leadership roles in the dispute because of the issue of national boundaries and extraterritoriality. [...] Both governments were initially involved in the foundation of the International Joint Commission (IJC) in 1909, which was later responsible for investigating and then recommending a settlement for the alleged damages in the Trail case. The transformation of the smelter dispute into a foreign policy issue resulted in more institutions joining the dispute. [...] This included the Canada's National Research Council (NRC) and the American Smelting and Refining Company, which each contributed scientific experts to assess the damages from the smelter's smoke.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2009, Obama, who had {{received}} {{nearly half of the}} Cuban Americans vote in the 2008 presidential election, began implementing a less strict policy towards Cuba. Obama stated that he was open to dialogue with Cuba, but that he would only lift the trade embargo if Cuba underwent political change. In March 2009, Obama signed into law a congressional spending bill which eased some economic sanctions on Cuba and eased travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans (defined as persons with a relative [...] "who is no more than three generations removed from that person") traveling to Cuba. The April executive decision further removed time limits on Cuban-American travel to the island. Another restriction loosened in April 2009 was in the realm of telecommunications, which would allow quicker and easier access to the internet for Cuba. The loosening of restrictions is likely to help nonprofits and scientists from both countries who work together on issues of <b>mutual</b> <b>concern,</b> such as destruction of shared biodiversity and diseases that affect both populations. At the 2009 5th Summit of the Americas, President Obama signaled the opening of a new beginning with Cuba.|$|E
