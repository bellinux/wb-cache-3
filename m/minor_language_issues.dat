40|$|Two {{types of}} orbital {{detectors}} of extreme energy cosmic rays {{are being developed}} nowadays: (i) TUS and KLYPVE with reflecting optical systems (mirrors) and (ii) JEM-EUSO with high-transmittance Fresnel lenses. They will cover much larger areas than existing ground-based arrays and almost uniformly monitor the celestial sphere. The TUS detector is the pioneering mission developed in SINP MSU in cooperation with several Russian and foreign institutions. It has relatively small field of view (+/- 4. 5 deg), which corresponds to a ground area of 6. 4 x 10 ^ 3 sq. km. The telescope consists of a Fresnel-type mirror-concentrator (~ 2 sq. m) and a photo receiver (a matrix of 16 x 16 photomultiplier tubes). It is to be deployed on the Lomonosov satellite, and is currently at {{the final stage of}} preflight tests. Recently, SINP MSU began the KLYPVE project to be installed on board of the Russian segment of the ISS. The optical system of this detector contains a larger primary mirror (10 sq. m), which allows decreasing the energy threshold. The total effective field of view will be at least +/- 14 degrees to exceed the annual exposure of the existing ground-based experiments. Several configurations of the detector are being currently considered. Finally, JEM-EUSO is a wide field of view (+/- 30 deg) detector. The optics is composed of two curved double-sided Fresnel lenses with 2. 65 m external diameter, a precision diffractive middle lens and a pupil. The ultraviolet photons are focused onto the focal surface, which consists of nearly 5000 multi-anode photomultipliers. It is developed by a large international collaboration. All three orbital detectors have multi-purpose character due to continuous monitoring of various atmospheric phenomena. The present status of development of the TUS and KLYPVE missions is reported, and a brief comparison of the projects with JEM-EUSO is given.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{research}} on GRB host galaxies has proceeded to more detailed studies both using high resolution afterglow spectroscopy and spatially resolved spectra of nearby hosts. High resolution spectra give a detailed picture of the kinematic properties of matter along the line-of-sight in the host. Two afterglow spectra show clear indications for outflows from their host, namely GRB 030329 and GRB 060206, derived from the position of absorption and host emission lines, nonvariability of Mg I and the radiation field calculated from fine-structure line detections. In nearby GRB hosts {{it is possible to}} resolve the actual GRB site. GRB 060505, a SN-less GRB, originated in a relatively metal poor, star forming region with similar properties as other long-duration hosts. A similar conclusion is reached for the site of GRB 980425 /SN 1998 bw.

40|$|<b>Minor</b> <b>languages</b> hardly {{attract the}} {{attention}} of the policy makers anywhere in the world. But the linguists evince great interest to study the richness of languages and try to save the endangered languages from extinction. Technology has made it possible to empower all languages whether they are major or minor ones. The Corpora of a language describes how it works and what it can show about the context in which it is used. Many developed languages have abundant corpus with software for tagging, parsing, etc to use it for all Natural Language Processing activities. Keeping in view many of the advantages the developed languages receive from corpora creation, analysis- some of the possible ways to build the corpora in <b>minor</b> <b>languages</b> of India are discussed here. The language data and more technological information is not included due to paucity of print space, and only broad issues, linguistic and technological, relating to corpora creation in <b>minor</b> Indian <b>languages</b> are elucidated here.

40|$|A {{wide variety}} of methods exist {{in the field of}} {{accident}} investigation. The challenge to find the cause for each and every accident has perpetuated a complicated and fundamental debate. In spite of the different paradigms, the many branch specific investigation methods, decades of accumulated and documented accident investigation experience, the diversity in taxonomy of causal factors, and an increasing depth of general systematic analysis tools, there are still causal factors missing out. A recent study identifies <b>language</b> <b>issues</b> as an underestimated danger. Dutch Labour Inspectorate records identify procedures and communication as an important causal factor area for major accidents. Accident investigation method taxonomies that are frequently used in The Netherlands, were investigated on the content related to <b>language</b> <b>issues.</b> <b>Language</b> <b>issues</b> are found to be either present less than proportional with observed accident rates or not present at all in frequently applied accident investigation classification systems.
