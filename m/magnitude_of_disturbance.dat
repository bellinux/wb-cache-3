Finally, different mean wind speeds are used for testing the BSMC controller with the presence of disturbances, and it ensures adaptability of the proposed controller.|$|E

During that time, the ice fragments caused extensive physical disturbance in rocky intertidal communities, removing high quantities of seaweeds and invertebrates.

30|$|The {{ecological}} resilience {{focuses on the}} persistency, change and unpredictability, the core idea celebrated by biologists with an evolutionary perspective and by those who search for “safe-fail” designs (Holling 1996). It is a dynamic model that focuses on persistence despite changes in, and unpredictability of, a system’s properties (King 2008). It assumes multiple stability domains and {{is measured by the}} <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> that can be absorbed before instabilities flip into another regime of behavior (Sakurai et al. 2012). In other words, {{ecological resilience}} is the measure of the ability of the system to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and parameters (Holling 1973). The ecological resilience model is therefore grounded in constructivist tradition, both epistemologically and ontologically (King 2008). This definition and model is appropriate for analyzing food system that considers households as its sub-system. Due to the fact that food system is a cultural/social-ecological system, it is not a fixed system for which there is equilibrium steady state and for which resilience can assume efficiency, predictability and constancy. Such a system is characterized by persistency, change and unpredictability (Alinovi et al. 2008). Following this theory, some researchers have applied the ecological definition of resilience to analyze household resilience to food insecurity (Alinovi et al. 2009; Ciani 2012; Ferede and Muluneh 2015). In this paper too, we applied the ecological definition of resilience.|$|E
40|$|How do large herbivores affect {{grassland}} {{communities with}} regard to their evolutionary grazing histories? And how can we use this knowledge to develop conservation strategies for these areas? This bachelor thesis aims to provide an answer to these questions by constructing an overview of the effects of grazing to a grassland system (with either a short or a long evolutionary history of grazing) in the absence or presence of large herbivores. Grazing is defined as a gradient from low to high grazing intensity (i. e. grazing can be “low”, “intermediate” or “high”). To construct this overview, first and foremost the generalized grazing model for grasslands created by Milchunas et al. (1988) is used. In addition, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is used to clarify differences in <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> caused by grazing to different communities. Furthermore, it is considered how plant-plant interactions are altered in the presence of increasing grazing pressure by large herbivores. Grassland communities with a short evolutionary history are less resistant to stress induced by grazing than communities with a long evolutionary history. From a conservation point of view, low stocking rates are optimal for communities with a short evolutionary grazing history and intermediate stocking rates are optimal for communities with a long evolutionary grazing history. High stocking rates of large herbivores should always be avoided in grassland communities with a short evolutionary history of grazing, or else the system will become susceptible to invasion by exotic species and ultimately degrade. Abandoning grazing entirely results in a homogeneous vegetation structure dominated by a few plant species that outcompete all others, resulting in diminished habitat opportunities and diversity in higher trophic groups. ...|$|E

Although recovery from scouring has been quantified in time, the frequency of scouring in the Antarctic has not. We placed grids of markers at 9 - 17 m depth at two sites, to study ice-scouring over 2 years at Adelaide island (Antarctic Peninsula). We quantified the time scale of scour frequencies, and linked this to community mortality, age and diversity. Markers were hit from zero to {{at least three times}} in 2 years. At the least disturbed site (South Cove) 24 % of markers were destroyed per year, whereas in North Cove 60 % of markers were destroyed. There were significant differences in scouring frequency between our two sites: a given area in North Cove was on average hit twice as often as one in South Cove. Compared with near shore environments elsewhere, faunas of both sites were characteristic of high disturbance regimes, exhibiting low percent cover, diversity, ages and a high proportion of pioneers. Aspects of the encrusting communities studied reflected the differences between site disturbance regimes. North Cove was scoured twice as often, and bryozoan communities there had half the number of species, two-thirds the space occupation and twice the mortality level of those in South Cove. Maximum age in North Cove bryozoans was also half that in South Cove. Although there are natural disturbance events that rival ice-scouring in either frequency or catastrophic power at lower latitudes, none do both nor across such a wide depth range. We suggest that ice scour effects on polar benthos are even more significant than the same <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> at lower latitudes as recovery rates of high latitude communities are very slow.

40|$|The use of {{pipelines}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ways of delivering gas phases as shown by numerous examples in hydrocarbon transportation systems in Arctic regions, oil and gas production facilities in onshore and offshore wells, and municipal gas distribution systems in urban areas. A gas leak from pipelines can cause serious problems not only because of the financial losses associated but also its social and environmental impacts. Therefore, establishing an early leak detection model is vital to safe and secure operations of such pipeline systems. A leak detection model for a single gas phase is presented in this study by using material balance and pressure traverse calculations. The comparison between two steady states, with and without leak, makes it possible to quantify the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> in two leak detection indicators such as the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) and the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) in a broad range of leak locations (x leak) and leak opening sizes (d leak).  The results from the fit to large-scale experimental data of Scott and Yi (1998) show that the value of leak coefficient (C D), which is shown to be the single-most important but largely unknown parameter, ranges from 0. 55 to 4. 11, and should be a function of Reynolds number (N Re) which is related to leak characteristics such as leak location (x leak), leak opening size (d leak), leak rate (q leak) and system pressure. Further investigations show that between the two leak detection indicators, the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out) is superior to the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) because of larger disturbance, if the pressure drop along the pipeline is relatively small compared to the outlet pressure; otherwise, the change in inlet pressure (ΔP in) is superior to the change in outlet flow rate (Δq out).

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] monitoring of forest biomass and biomass change is needed to quantify natural and anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Landsat's temporal and spatial coverage, moderate spatial resolution, and long history of earth observations provide a unique opportunity for characterizing vegetation changes across large areas and long time scales. However, like with other multi-spectral passive optical sensors, Landsat's relationship of single-date reflectance with forest biomass diminishes under high leaf area and complex canopy conditions. Because the condition of a forest stand at any point in time is largely determined by its disturbance and recovery history, we conceived a method that enhances Landsat's spectral relationships with biomass by including information on vegetation trends prior to the date for which estimates are desired. With recently developed algorithms that characterize trends in disturbance (e. g. year of onset, duration, and magnitude) and post-disturbance regrowth, it should now be possible to realize improved Landsat-based mapping of current biomass across large regions. Moreover, given that we now have 40 years of Landsat data, it should also be possible to use this approach to map historic biomass densities. In this study, we developed regression tree models to predict current forest aboveground biomass (AGB) for a mixed-conifer region in eastern Oregon (USA) using Landsat-based disturbance and recovery (DR) metrics. We employed the trajectory-fitting algorithm LandTrendr to characterize DR trends from yearly Landsat time series between 1972 and 2010.

In the first instance it is shown that by using an extended state observer the fault (as well as disturbances) can be measured and compensated for at each sampling period using continuous thrust. It is proved that this control yields asymptotic tracking to a small bounded region around the desired reference orbit in the presence of these uncertainties. In addition, it is demonstrated that by combining this method with a sliding mode or an adaptive control, asymptotic tracking can be achieved. An advantage of this method is that the required gain for asymptotic tracking of the sliding mode component is much smaller than traditional methods; the gain magnitude is required to be larger than the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>disturbance</b> estimation error rather than the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> the <b>disturbance.</b> A comparison <b>of</b> the controllers performance against an linear quadratic regulator control scheme is undertaken in an application to low-thrust station-keeping on a halo orbit in the Earth– Moon–spacecraft system in the presence <b>of</b> <b>disturbances</b> and various thruster faults...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{contagiousness}} of canopy dynamics¿the {{tendency of}} canopy disturbances to occur nearby existing canopy openings {{due to an}} elevated risk of tree fall around gaps¿has been demonstrated in many temperate-zone forests, but only inferentially for tropical forests. Hypothesized mechanisms increasing the risk of tree fall around tropical forest gaps are (1) increased tree exposure to wind around gaps, (2) reduced stability of trees alongside gaps due to crown asymmetry, or (3) reduced tree health around gaps due to damage from prior disturbances. One hypothesized consequence of elevated disturbance levels around gaps would be that gap-edge zones offer relatively favorable prospects for seedling recruitment, growth, and survival. We tested whether disturbance levels are indeed elevated around natural canopy gaps in a neotropical rain forest in French Guiana, and more so as gaps are larger. We followed the fate of 5660 trees > 10 cm stem diameter over five years across 12 ha of old-growth forest and analyzed the risk and magnitude of canopy disturbance events in relation to tree diameter and the proximity and size of natural canopy gaps. We found that the cumulative incidence of disturbance over the five-year survey was not significantly elevated around preexisting gaps, and only weakly related to gap size. Also, neither the risk nor the magnitude of canopy disturbances increased significantly with the proximity of gaps. Moreover, canopy disturbance risk around gaps was independent of gap size, while the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> events around gaps was weakly related to gap size. Tree size was the major driver of disturbance risk as well as magnitude.

Many case studies of anthropogenic disturbance have been conducted in New Zealand. One of the main outcomes of this research is to collate, contrast and compare this wealth of case studies to look for any underlying trends in timing, distribution and <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> nationwide. This thesis focusses on late Holocene records from the North Island, and compared the history of disturbance with that from the South Island (as per McWethy et al. 2010). Based on the combination of palynology, sedimentology and geochemistry, this review demonstrates the pace of disturbance observed in the North Island was very rapid following occupation, a trend also established in the South Island. The other main outcome of this research is to add to the knowledge base of North Island disturbance history, through development of a landscape disturbance history in the Coromandel, using floodplain cores from the Paeroa and Kuaotunu areas. Sediment logging and subsequent XRF-geochemical analysis performed on these cores revealed a ‘mining layer’ that was used as a baseline for mining disturbance in this environment. This layer is interpreted as when European activities began disturbing the environment. Cores extracted from the Paeroa area indicated that the sedimentation rates in the floodplain had increased more than 15 -fold since human occupation. Significant rises in the amount of Arsenic and Lead contained within the sediment were also detected. Cores from the Kuaotunu floodplain also showed changes in geochemistry that coincided with historic mining in the area, but reverted back to near pre-mining levels following the initial disturbance. These results suggest that factors such as catchment characteristics and degree of disturbance in an area affect the extent of impact on a site, which may have implications for future management of post mining sites. XRF analysis is a relatively underutilized proxy in New Zealand. It, in conjunction with Particle Size Analysis, has proved valuable in this study and are recommended for application in future New Zealand environmental reconstruction-focused research...|$|E
40|$|Calcium {{stable isotope}} ratios are a {{relatively}} new tool that biogeochemists can use to investigate the biogeochemical cycle of calcium in terrestrial ecosystems, having seen widespread application {{only in the past}} 15 years. To advance the application of calcium isotopes in biogeoscience research, I conducted three investigations focused on interpreting calcium isotope ratios in streamwater and in the cation exchange pool of forest soils. In the first study, we observe a shift toward lower 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios in streamwater draining a New Hampshire watershed after an experimental clearcutting event. Isotope ratio measurements of ecosystem calcium pools indicate that enhanced leaching of the soil exchangeable pool produced the observed shift in 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios. A trend towards decreased 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios in soils in the years following the harvesting indicates that calcium leached from the soil exchangeable reservoir was likely replaced by calcium released by the decay of belowground biomass, maintaining pre-harvest levels of exchangeable calcium {{even in the face of}} a significant ecosystem disturbance. In a second study, we observed significant differences in the 44 Ca/ 40 Ca of the soil exchange pool between two neighboring tropical watersheds, although 44 Ca/ 40 Ca of calcium inputs (bedrock and atmospheric deposition) at the two sites were indistinguishable. Further, both sites had higher 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios compared with external inputs, a relatively rare observation globally. We propose that hurricane disturbance best explains the high 44 Ca/ 40 Ca at each site, and that the difference in 44 Ca/ 40 Ca between the two sites can be accounted for by the <b>magnitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> at each site. Finally, a synthesis of our new data with previously published results shows that globally, soil exchangeable 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios can be higher, lower or equal to external inputs. Modeling work indicates that in addition to isotopic fractionation, the balance in fluxes between vegetation and soil is critical in determining how soil exchangeable 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios vary relative to external inputs. When plant uptake and return to the soil are equal, soil and external inputs 44 Ca/ 40 Ca are equal, while high soil 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios develop when uptake exceeds return. Soil develops low 44 Ca/ 40 Ca when biomass obtains calcium from sources other than the exchangeable reservoir...|$|E
