40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the possible deformations in the surface of dental implants submitted to pullout and insertion test in polyurethane synthetic bone, using scanning electron microscopy. Material and Methods: Four different types of implants were used: <b>Master</b> <b>Screw,</b> Master Porous, Master Conect AR and Master Conect Conical (n = 8). These implants were into the femoral head synthetic bone (Synbone) and removed through the pullout test, performed with a universal testing machine (EMIC MEM 2000). All the screws, before and after the mechanical tests, were micro structurally analyzed in a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM - Zeiss EVO 50), utilizing a magnification of 35 times. The results were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Only the Master Conect Conical and Master Porous implants presented statistically significant difference to pullout and maximum deformation (P = 0. 014 and P = 0. 009, respectively). The SEM images did not show morphological changes of the implants when compared before and after the mechanical tests. Conclusion: We concluded that Master Porous presented higher pullout resistance, suggesting a greater primary stability...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the primary {{stability}} of dental implants with and without surface treatment, by means of resonance frequency, using different materials as substitutes for human bone substrates for insertion. METHODS: Sixteen external hexagon, cylindrical Conexão(r) titanium implants were used, 11. 5 mm long by 3. 75 mm wide, as follows: 8 Master Porous (MP), with surface treatment and 8 <b>Master</b> <b>Screw</b> (MS) machined. The implant placement was performed on the following substrates: pork rib bone, wood, artificial bone polyurethane National(r) (40, 20, 15 PCF) and Synbone(r). Primary stability was assessed via resonance frequency using an Osstell Mentor(tm) device. Data were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and Tukey's test, with a significance level of 5 %. RESULTS: It was found that although MP and MS have a higher value on all substrates, these were not statistically different between groups (p> 0. 05), except for polyurethane National(r) 20 PCF. When inserted into the wood substrate and polyurethane National(r) 40 PCF, MP and MS had higher values&# 8203;&# 8203;. MP, when inserted into the pig bone, was also statistically equal to these interactions. CONCLUSION: Despite the continuous development of innovations in the characteristics of implant surfaces to assist with the performance of osseointegrated implants, and the fact that our study has found that the surface treatment had no impact on the primary stability checked using ressonance frequency, there is still very little scientific understanding of these effects...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the profile of}} implants subjected to torsion test. Four types of implants (Conex&# 227;o&# 174;) were analyzed: Master Porous (MP - external hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), <b>Master</b> <b>Screw</b> (MS - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), Conect Conic (CC - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 5 mm) and Master Conect AR (CA - internal hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm). The Nikon&# 174; model C profile projector {{was used for the}} analysis before and after torsion test with a Mackena&# 174; model MK- 20 XX digital torque meter. The measures analyzed in the profile of implants were: diameter and height of the platform, diameter of the screw/platform connection, angle of the screw/platform connection, external diameter, internal diameter, thread pitch, height and length of the thread. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey test at 5 % significance level. The torsion test caused a visible deformity on the external implant profile. There was a statistical difference among the implants before and after torsion (p< 0. 05) for the variables: platform diameter, platform height, diameter of the screw/platform connection and length. Changes were observed in platform height of CC and CA, fracture of CA implants, fracture of the MP and MS assembler/connectors, and internal thread stripping of CC. Thus, it was concluded that excessive or some unadvised torque by the manufacturer can lead to changes in different geometric measurements of implants...|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} precise screwshafts were {{produced}} by {{starting with a}} low precision screwshaft, and then lapping the shaft with several spring-loaded nut laps. By rearranging and inverting the nut laps, the lengthwise errors of the nuts and shaft were averaged. Then, the very repeatable shaft's pitch is measured against a distance standard. A similar process is sometimes used today to produce reference standard <b>screw</b> shafts, or <b>master</b> manufacturing <b>screw</b> shafts.|$|R

40|$|Soft Extrusion Meeting 2004 Alvor, Portugal, October 14 - 18, 2004 International audienceReactive {{extrusion}} {{involves the}} difficulties of <b>mastering</b> the twin <b>screw</b> extrusion process and controlling a chemical reaction under very specific conditions (high viscosity medium, high temperatures, short residence times). Therefore, it is often very difficult to understand all the aspects {{of the process and}} the complex interactions between the numerous variables, and then to properly optimise the industrial process. Numerical modelling can be a very efficient tool to overcome these difficulties. However, it is a real challenge, as the information needed is sometimes difficult to obtain with the required accuracy. After a general presentation of the principles of reactive extrusion modelling, different examples of applications are presented to illustrate the interest of the method...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 890 – 895 Background: Although {{increase}} of misfit {{has been reported}} when associating implant and abutment from different manufacturers, Procera custom abutment has been universally used in clinical practice. Purpose: The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to compare the vertical gap of zirconia Procera® abutment associated with implants from the same manufacturer (Procera manufacturer) and two other implant systems. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four zirconia Procera abutments were produced using computer-assisted design and manufacture and paired with (a) eight MK III, RP 4. 1 × 10 mm implants (Nobel Biocare™, Göteborg, Sweden) – GNB group (Nobel Biocare group); (b) eight Try on, 4. 1 × 10 mm implants (Sistema de Implantes, São Paulo, Brazil) – ES group (SIN experimental group); and (c) eight <b>Master</b> <b>screw,</b> 4. 1 × 10 mm implants (Conexão® Sistema de Prótese, São Paulo, Brazil) – EC group (Conexão experimental group). A comparison of the vertical misfit at the implant–abutment interface was taken at six measuring sites on each sample using scanning electron microscopy with a magnification of 408 ×. One-way analysis of variance was used to test for differences, and Tukey's test was used for pair-wise comparison of groups (α = 0. 05). Results: Significant differences relative to average misfit were found when Procera abutments were associated with other implant manufacturers. The ES group and EC group did not differ significantly, but both demonstrated significantly larger average misfit than the GNB group (p =. 001). The average misfit was 5. 7 µm ± 0. 39, 9. 53 µm ± 0. 52, and 10. 62 µm ± 2. 16, respectively, for groups GNB, ES, and EC. Conclusion: The association of Procera zirconia abutment with other implant systems different from its manufacturer demonstrated significant alteration of vertical misfit at implant–abutment interface...|$|E
