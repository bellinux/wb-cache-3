50|$|In 1933, Bayswater {{introduced}} a <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme,</b> re-enforcing the developing industrial {{area in the}} east, and setting aside land for future residential areas.

40|$|The {{provision}} of parking {{is an integral}} component of the transportation system in metropolitan areas. Parking for developments within these areas should be sufficient to prevent congestion and illegal parking. Parking demand ratios are enforced by <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> and public transport systems. National, Provincial and Local public transport initiatives were reviewed. The eThekwini Integrated Rapid Public Transport Network (IRPTN), Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT) and Passenger Rail Route upgrades {{have a significant impact}} on these parking ratios. This paper reports on parking surveys done at randomly selected shopping centres in the eThekwini region. A comparison of the actual parking demand versus the recommended <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> ratios and costs are done. The findings confirm the diversity in parking requirements and the need to introduce supplementary provisions in the <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> and further to recognise areas where discretion needs to be applied.

In later reflections on the experience she said she had wanted to experience life under a totalitarian regime, in particular to observe early <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> created by National Socialist planners. There she studied under Gottfried Feder who sought to apply Nazi anti-urban, Blut und Boden doctrine, aimed at the dissolution of the metropolis whereby metropolitan populations would be reabsorbed into the surrounding landscape.|$|R
50|$|The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo {{combined}} to prepare <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Scheme</b> No.26 (Hamersley Development Scheme), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, {{was presented to}} both councils for consideration. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently.|$|R
50|$|In October 1969, the Government, {{in a bid}} {{to offer}} {{affordable}} land for housing following the McCarrey Report, rezoned a large portion of land in the area from Urban Deferred to Urban, which was then included in land set aside for the State Housing Commission under the Mirrabooka satellite city development <b>scheme.</b> The <b>plan</b> never came to fruition, although a <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> was approved by the Shire of Wanneroo in September 1970.|$|R

40|$|Palermo was a town still {{ravaged by}} war - as Argan {{reported}} and he stated that: >. In fact {{the outcome in}} terms of damages caused by the war was huge, as entire monuments and considerable urban environments had disappeared into large cavities. In particular, the Teatro Marittimo area, between the Foro Italico and the Cala, {{became one of the}} largest sites of ruins created by the war in Italy. With the reconstruction plan approved in 1947 certain indiscriminately destructive principles reappeared in planning policies, such as the implicit request for a new parallel road upstream the 17 th century Street called via Maqueda the third road crossing the old town centre, which had been already drawn in the projects that won the competition for the 1939 pre-war <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Scheme.</b> When the new <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> was drawn up in 1956, the "space for manoeuvre" was already limited.

50|$|The Environmental Planning Collaborative (EPC) was {{commissioned}} {{to provide a}} new city plan {{for the city of}} Bhuj. The plan focused on creating a wider roadway network to provide emergency access to the city. The EPC used land readjustment (LR) in the form of eight <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes.</b> This was implemented by deducting land from private lot sizes to create adequate public land for the widening of roadways. The remaining land was readjusted and given back to the original owners as final plots.|$|R

His other foreign work included a <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> for Mosul in Iraq, and a report for Baghdad airport, both in 1955.|$|R
50|$|Commercial icons {{appeared}} in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including the Wirrina Drive In, the Morley Park Hotel and the Boans department store. Parallel with the commercial growth, a settlement program resulted in the residential development of Morley. This was achieved {{through a series of}} <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> undertaken by Margaret Feilman, the consultant town planner to the Shire of Bayswater. These schemes especially catered {{to the needs of the}} home building companies whose style of large scale development was a new phenomenon of the 1960s.|$|R

Due to its {{outstanding}} {{architecture and}} layout Merville Garden Village {{is the sole}} designated Conservation Area in the Newtownabbey borough. Mawson's eldest son and colleague, Thomas P.

50|$|Romford Garden Suburb was {{constructed}} in 1910-11 on the Gidea Hall and Balgores estates as an exhibition of <b>town</b> <b>planning.</b> Small cottages and houses were designed by more than 100 architects, many of them of considerable reputation. A competition was held to select the best <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>scheme</b> for the suburb; the best designs for houses resulted in those being sold at a well-above average £500 and cottages at £375. The project, including a new railway station on the Great Eastern Main Line out of London, was promoted by a company founded by three Liberal Members of Parliament who had links with the Hampstead Garden Suburb development: Herbert Raphael, John Tudor Walters (both later knighted) and Charles McCurdy.|$|R

It mainly provides guided and planned development for the outgrowth of the city.

5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>schemes</b> in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|R
50|$|The {{road was}} {{initially}} a street which formed part of North Beach, which from the 1920s onwards was a coastal village {{which served as}} a holiday destination for Perth residents.
