5|$|Later {{the same}} month, on October 25, the allies <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> push {{to destroy the}} bridge going over the Vistula, from Warsaw to Praga, in order {{to slow down the}} Swedish troop movements. However, the attack was repulsed by a handful of men. A month later, on November 28, Sweden and Poland made peace in the Treaty of Warsaw through the Warsaw Confederation which {{increased}} Sweden's position even further. Charles could now march, after having waited more than a year since Augustus was dethroned, against the Russian army under Ogilvy which had already by this time reached Grodno.|$|E
5|$|Thomas enjoyed Fabian's {{performance}} in the episode, arguing {{that it was an}} example of the actor's scene stealer quality that led Thomas to initially cast him after his appearance in an episode of his earlier series Cupid. The scene in which Keith boards the ship on which Hank is located was difficult to film because there were limited daylight filming hours. The crew thought it was important for the audience to see the waves and the ocean. However, they were unable to finish filming the scene within the course of one day, so the crew <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> decision to place a makeshift blue screen as part of the background for the interior of the boat. It was intended that the blue screen be edited in post-production in order to represent the ocean, but upon learning that this change would cost millions of dollars, the crew decided to forgo the alteration and instead pass off the blue screen as a tarpaulin.|$|E
5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> repentance at a small church {{on his way back to}} Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E
5000|$|Atwater-Rhodes {{graduated}} Concord-Carlisle High in 2001, a year early [...] {{because she}} completed her {{junior and senior}} years simultaneously.

Despite initial fears, the injury was not as bad as reported and he <b>made</b> <b>a</b> fairly <b>quick</b> recovery.|$|R
5|$|On February 17, 2010, Sanchez {{underwent}} {{surgery to repair}} the patella ligament in his left knee that he originally injured when he played for USC. The surgery was successful. Sanchez was expected to miss early workouts and return in time for training camp however Sanchez <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> recovery and participated in team drills during Organized Team Activities (OTA). The Jets opened the 2010 season with a 5–1 record despite the passing game being subpar as Sanchez struggled to accurately throw the football. Sanchez recorded his first career 300-yard passing game in a win over the Detroit Lions on November 7, 2010. At 10–4, the Jets faced the Chicago Bears on December 26, 2010 {{with a chance to}} clinch a playoff berth. Though Sanchez injured his shoulder in a victory over Pittsburgh the previous week, he started the game completing 24 of his 37 passes for a touchdown and an interception. However, the Jets were unable to defend the Bears' offense and subsequently lost the game 38–34 after a comeback drive was halted when Sanchez was intercepted. Due to a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars that same day, the Jets clinched the playoff berth. Sanchez finished the season with 3,291 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The Fujiwhara {{interaction}} had {{a significant}} impact on the track of Humberto, which <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> turn to the northwest, and then to the north-northwest, early on August 25. The interaction came to an end that afternoon as Humberto completed the northerly turn, while remaining a Category2 hurricane in the tropical waters of the central Atlantic. It began to gradually weaken on August 26 due to an increase in southwesterly shear from a nearby upper-level low as it maintained a north-northwest track. The slow weakening trend continued into August 27 as the eye became intermittent in the moderate-shear environment, which was once again affected by the outflow of Iris to the southwest. That evening, it dropped to a minimal hurricane with 75mph (120km/h) winds, which was later confirmed to have been the low point. Operationally, Humberto was downgraded to a tropical storm for a while on August 28, but was later confirmed to have been underestimated. As it tracked away from Iris and into a more open environment, it turned more to the north-northeast and slowly re-intensified again on August 29. Its movement was now affected by an incoming mid-latitude trough that turned Humberto northeast early on August 30. Humberto reached its second intensity peak of 90mph (145km/h) at that time.|$|E
5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to get rich because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan made {{his way back to the}} North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E
50|$|Race day {{was cool}} {{with a chance}} of rain. Berger quickly pulled ahead of Martini and moved over in front of him, but Alesi, whose F1 career had begun in his home country of France the {{previous}} summer, <b>made</b> <b>an</b> even <b>quicker</b> start, passed them both and outbraked Berger into the first corner. He immediately began pulling away, and led by 2.4 seconds after one lap.|$|R
5000|$|Addison {{had a great}} {{start to}} the 2009-10 season with goals against Peterborough United and Plymouth Argyle, but a {{succession}} of foot problems restricted him to just five starts between October 2009 and February 2010 and he underwent specialist surgery in America. The surgery was successful but he was ruled out {{for the remainder of}} Derby's 2009-10 season as well as the entirety of the 2010-11 campaign. However, Addison <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> than expected recovery, with Clough suggesting he may be back in first team action as early as January 2011. He was pencilled in to play a reserve game against Sheffield Wednesday on 26 October 2010 but was later withdrawn as a precaution after admitting he felt [...] "a bit stiff". He eventually took to the pitch in a competitive capacity when he came on as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2-0 home win over Portsmouth on 6 November 2010, his first appearance in 10 months, as Derby reached 4th in the table.|$|R
5000|$|Musonda <b>made</b> <b>a</b> much <b>quicker</b> {{recovery}} from that ankle injury than was expected demonstrating his powers of recovery {{and he was}} soon playing again for Golden Arrows in South Africa. Indeed, in June 2012 the club tied him to a three-year contract extension that will take Musonda to 38 years of age. At the time, Joseph Musonda turned down {{the opportunity to play}} in the United Arab Emirates on a lucrative contract.|$|R

25|$|India {{began the}} day hoping {{to dismiss the}} Australian lower order quickly. A breeze had picked up speed through the ground and those bowling from the Paddington End had the {{advantage}} of running in with the breeze and bowling faster. However, Lee continued to resist, reaching 50 from 100 balls in the 98th over. Lee eventually fell five overs later for 59, leaving Australia at 8/421. Mitchell Johnson <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 28 from 29 balls before falling to Kumble, Stuart Clark fell two overs later and Australia were all out for 463.|$|E

The Benetton pitcrew <b>made</b> <b>a</b> very <b>quick</b> stop for Schumacher, getting him out in front of Senna to lead the race. Schumacher went on to win the Grand Prix after Senna spun out of the race. This sparked speculation that Benetton were using a system to make quicker pit stops than their rivals.|$|R

Charles David tried the same game and was similarly stimulated.|$|R
25|$|Nationalists in New York City {{as well as}} Puerto Rico {{were outraged}} by the attack. Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, among Nationalists in the city, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> plan to assassinate the U.S. President, Harry S. Truman.

25|$|The promised trading {{ship was}} later sent with a cargo of red wood, deerskins, raw silk and other commodities. Fray Geronimo <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> visit to Manila {{to find out}} the fate of {{ambassador}} Chiquiro, and then returned with the information to Japan. The missionaries that had been allowed into the country found their reception to be much cooler than anticipated, apparently because permission was a political measure intended to obtain Spanish help with shipbuilding. In 1600, a fleet from Satsuma raided a Chinese trading fleet, stole all its merchandise and attempted to sell it at the port in Manila. The Spanish authorities crucified all 400 of the crew.|$|E
25|$|When Höckert {{returned}} from his trip, the count of Trolleholm Castle did no longer want the Slottsbranden i Stockholm den 7 maj 1697 painting. As a result, Höckert <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> effort to get it finished for the 1866 Scandinavian art fair in Stockholm instead. The painting was displayed and, despite its uncompleted state, made a large impression. The judges at the fair awarded Höckert {{with one of the}} six gold medals. Slottsbranden i Stockholm den 7 maj 1697 is today regarded as one of Sweden's foremost paintings. The painting was later displayed in Paris and Philadelphia in 1867, before being bought by Höckert's heirs in 1883 and given to its current home at the National Museum of Fine Arts in Sweden.|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney said nothing, but <b>made</b> <b>a</b> few <b>quick</b> {{steps in}} the {{direction}} of the limp figure which the crowd was following up the beach; then she stopped. Her nature prompted her to go on; her present feelings restrained her. She could not help wondering at this, and said to herself that she must be aging faster than she thought. Her distant vision was excellent, and she knew that the inanimate form which was now being laid on the dry sand was not a boy.|$|R
50|$|Many of the detections to date {{have been}} <b>made</b> with <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> {{reduction}} package {{that allows us to}} find pulsars almost in real time. This is made possible by reducing the spectral and time resolution by a factor of 16, and using a computer cluster, the Arecibo Signal Processor to search for pulsars in the data. This is <b>a</b> nice and <b>quick</b> way of detecting slow pulsars, but the sensitivity to fast pulsars is severely degraded. Re-processing these data with full resolution is, computationally, a very challenging task but is essential for detecting many fast (both young and recycled) pulsars so far hidden by Galactic plasma.|$|R

25|$|In July 1711, {{the young}} duchess {{gave birth to}} her first child, an {{stillborn}} girl, at the Palace of Fontainebleau. Her death was blamed on the king who had made her mother travel with the Court to Fontainebleau despite the doctors advising her to stay at Versailles or at the Palais Royal because of her advanced pregnancy. The king did not give in and made Louise Élisabeth travel by barge instead of carriage. During this journey, the barge hit a pier of a bridge at Melun and nearly sank. Louise Élisabeth almost lost her life. According to the doctors, the death of the baby was due to the stress of the journey and the accident. The princess however <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> recovery.|$|E
25|$|Christmas {{made his}} début for Lincolnshire {{in their second}} match of the 1989 Minor Counties Championship. In a drawn match, he claimed one wicket and 42 runs.

In 2000, Christmas {{was part of the}} Lincolnshire side that beat Netherlands {{in the second round of}} the National Westminster Bank Trophy, before losing to a strong Lancashire side in the next round. Christmas <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 26 off 24 balls from number nine in the third round match, before being caught off the bowling of India Test cricketer Sourav Ganguly.

His last game for Lincolnshire was against Staffordshire in 2005, since which he has appeared on three occasions for 'Lincolnshire Development Squad'.|$|E
25|$|Essex and Worcestershire {{took notice}} of the bad weather forecasts, racking up runs swiftly at Chelmsford. The Essex batting effort was not very spectacular, and only Ronnie Irani's 85 saved some grace for Essex as wickets tumbled amid showers on the first day. They {{finished}} 220 all out as Worcestershire's bowlers teamed up, Matthew Mason the best with four for 48. In reply, Ben Smith made a century including fourteen fours, and with help of Gareth Batty (54) and Kabir Ali (53), both former England players, Worcestershire got to 383 all out - a lead of 163. Alastair Cook, Essex' 20-year-old prodigy, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 46, but it was their 37-year-old Zimbabwean Andy Flower who, as so many times before, was the top scorer and the rock of the Essex innings with 85 - which led them to 329.|$|E

50|$|Escobar <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{surprising}} <b>quick</b> {{recovery from}} his Achilles injury, {{allowing him to}} have a full participation in training camp, though he was passed on the depth chart by Geoff Swaim, who displayed better blocking ability. After being used primarily as a core special teams player and only participating in 29 offensive plays, Escobar became the backup tight end after Swaim suffered a season-ending injury in the week 10 win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Because he struggled with his blocking, the Cowboys were forced to use offensive lineman Joe Looney as the blocking tight end in short yardage situations. He finished with 4 receptions and one touchdown.|$|R
