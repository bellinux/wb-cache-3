5|$|There {{was another}} {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old <b>mine</b> <b>workings</b> near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the <b>mine</b> <b>workings.</b> The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any firedamp present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{industrialisation}} {{of nearby}} Northwest England, and its needs for mineral supplies, the mineral deposits in the Alyn valley created a population explosion in various villages, including Rhydymwyn.

25|$|In 1865 {{more than}} 80 acres of Ripley's land holding were still undeveloped. The area was dotted with the Bowling Iron Company's former <b>mine</b> <b>workings.</b> Several old mine shafts had been {{converted}} to wells to provide the dye works with its soft water supply. Ripley Ville occupied most of the Broom Hall Estate: Broom Hall was a working farmhouse into the 1860s. The {{northern part of the}} estate had been acquired by the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) to build the Bowling Curves that opened in 1867. The site chosen for Ripley Ville had the disadvantage being irregularly shaped with steep gradients. Its central street fell 40 feet over a distance of 300 feet but it was relatively free of old <b>mine</b> <b>workings</b> and contiguous to the urban development along Hall Lane which gave access to the town centre.|$|E

25|$|The tunnels were {{constructed}} in the late 1970s, using mining techniques, and {{were constructed}} as single-track tubes with a diameter of 4.75 metres. The tunnels under Newcastle were mechanically bored through boulder clay and lined with cast iron or concrete segments.

Old coal <b>mine</b> <b>workings,</b> some of which dated from the Middle Ages had to be filled in before the tunnelling began.|$|E
25|$|The Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex, which {{contains}} remnants of <b>mine</b> <b>workings,</b> battery, cyanide plant, township and cemetery, {{has the potential}} to provide information on important aspects of Queensland's history, especially early gold mining practices and treatment processes, and patterns of settlement in North Queensland. The Golden Gate Reef was the most productive on the Croydon goldfield and the complex demonstrates the pattern and development of gold mining on this important field.|$|E
25|$|Grant and his colleague, Sumner, saw {{potential}} in the extraction of coal in India and attempted to capitalise on that and {{their relationship with the}} East India Company, which they envisaged as being a significant purchaser. Their project involved several <b>mine</b> <b>workings,</b> the precise location of which has been debated. It was beset by problems, including those related to extraction, logistics and disease, and eventually petered out. Sumner had left before its demise, and others had become involved.|$|E
50|$|Many {{groups and}} campaigners {{objected to the}} project. An open letter signed by 29 {{different}} groups including the Caravan Club, the RSPB and the Campaign for National Parks, {{was sent to the}} National Park Authority (NPA) whose own internal report stated that the economic benefits of the mine did not outweigh the environmental damage it would cause. Initially, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) lodged an objection to the mine as its use of dynamite blasting had the potential to cause damage to the sensitive equipment at RAF Fylingdales which is only 4 mi south west of the mine head. This objection was withdrawn when the company agreed to the MoD's conditions and monitoring of the <b>mine's</b> <b>workings.</b>|$|R

25|$|Poland {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on coal for electrical generation. Unlike in most of Western Europe, Polish coal mines are still active.

As of 2010, Poland imports two-thirds of its natural gas from Russia. Tapping shale gas resources would greatly boost Poland's proven reserves, and lessen the importance of gas imports from Russia.|$|E
25|$|Mining, {{particularly}} of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), baryte, graphite and slate, was historically a major Lakeland industry, {{mainly from the}} 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide charcoal for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the Honister Mines, {{at the top of}} Honister Pass. Abandoned <b>mine</b> <b>workings</b> can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite {{led to the development of}} the pencil industry, especially around Keswick.|$|E
25|$|In March 1999, {{the then}} Department of Environment, Transport and Regions (DETR) {{announced}} a Land Stabilisation Programme, {{based on the}} Derelict Land Act 1982.

A Bath and North East Somerset Council outline bid for a two-phase stabilisation project was accepted in August 1999, by English Partnerships who administered the programme for the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Archaeological investigation of the Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex also provides for comparative and complementary research into other gold mining operations on the Croydon goldfield, including Enterprise Battery, Content Mine and the Homeward Bound Battery and Dam.|$|E
25|$|Mining of tin {{and copper}} {{was also an}} industry, but today the {{derelict}} <b>mine</b> <b>workings</b> survive only as a World Heritage Site. However, the Camborne School of Mines, which was relocated to Penryn in 2004, is still a world centre of excellence {{in the field of}} mining and applied geology and the grant of World Heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism. China clay extraction has also been an important industry in the St Austell area, but this sector has been in decline, and this, coupled with increased mechanisation, has led to a decrease in employment in this sector, although the industry still employs around 2,133 people in Cornwall, and generates over £80 Million to the local economy.|$|E
