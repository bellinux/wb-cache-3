Local people raised concerns and permission was denied in November 2006, but the pipeline was still laid in the area. As one local said: [...] "If there was a shift or a landslip again, {{my fear is that}} the pipe would fracture, and we'd get an enormous gas leak." [...] National Grid claimed that the pipeline would be secure. An undiscovered Roman road was found during the building of the pipeline near Brecon and was partially destroyed as a result.|$|E
