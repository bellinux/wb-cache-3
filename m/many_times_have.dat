5|$|Comets are {{distinguished}} from asteroids {{by the presence}} of an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere surrounding their central nucleus. This atmosphere has parts termed the coma (the central part immediately surrounding the nucleus) and the tail (a typically linear section consisting of dust or gas blown out from the coma by the Sun's light pressure or outstreaming solar wind plasma). However, extinct comets that have passed close to the Sun <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> lost nearly all of their volatile ices and dust and may come to resemble small asteroids. Asteroids are thought to have a different origin from comets, having formed inside the orbit of Jupiter rather than in the outer Solar System. The discovery of main-belt comets and active centaur minor planets has blurred the distinction between asteroids and comets.|$|E

That the song is good, {{and that it has}} the 'Glee' reach, makes it an easy song to play." [...] Keith Kennedy, program director at WKDD said the single made him ponder why they haven't played Glee songs prior to [...] "Loser Like Me". Kennedy said, [...] "How <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> you heard radio programmers claim that they use sales numbers to shape their stations' playlists? Look at iTunes every Wednesday: Glee often dominates the top 10." [...] Kennedy's station, WKDD, holds a [...] "Glee O'clock" [...] segment daily and he said [...] "While some of the remakes have leaned toward show tunes, several probably should have received more airplay." ...|$|E

They said he slept with Jade because [...] "too much stewing over work and not enough play makes Brennan a dull boy". TV Week described Mark's departure episode as [...] "edge-of-your-seat." [...] While {{a reporter for the}} Daily Record said [...] "Goodbye Brennan - we enjoyed having you and your hunky good looks around, but all good things must come to an end." [...] Nicky Branagh from Studentbeans.com included Mark in her list of the [...] "Top ten hottest Aussie soap guys" [...] and she stated [...] "As Ramsay Street's resident hottie back in 2010, Scott McGregor graced Neighbours as the coolest kind of police investigator (he rode a motorbike).

500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>have</b> I seen a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E

[...] Chauncey did not yet know English and was confused about the abrupt departure from his own culture. His braids were cut and his traditional clothing replaced with a white man's suit. In 1890, Captain Richard Henry Pratt, sent Yellow Robe to Washington DC to serve as an interpreter at an inquiry made by the Office of Indian Affairs into the treatment of Indians traveling with Buffalo Bill's show.
