This is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.|$|E

In this research, sheet hydroforming process (SHF) was adopted to improve the formability of Ti/Al clad <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> and SUS 304 <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> used in computer, communication, and consumer product housings. Both finite element simulation and experimental verification were carried out to investigate the deformation of blanks. Several significant process parameters, such as holding force, friction, counter pressure history, and blank dimensions, were discussed for improv-ing the formability of the two <b>metal</b> <b>sheets.</b> In SHF simulation, a virtual film technique was proposed to realistically approach the hydraulic loading condition during SHF. Finally, the deformed shape and thickness distribution of parts manufactured with SHF were com-pared {{with the results of}} simulation. Good agreements were obtained...|$|R
25|$|The Second World War Hangar No.7, located {{fronting}} Terminal Drive on {{the site}} of the old Brisbane Airport, is a timber truss igloo structure with ribbed <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> cladding. The hangar was constructed in 1942 for the use of the Allied Technical Air Intelligence Unit (ATAIU), as part of a major aircraft assembly depot and aerodrome under the control of the US 81st Air Depot Group, and under the US 5th Air Force under the command of General Douglas MacArthur's Supreme Headquarters of the South West Pacific Area.

25|$|Handloaders {{have the}} choice to swage but most choose to {{purchase}} pre-made jacketed bullets, due to the obscure nature of swaging and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a jacketed bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes jacketed bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938 {{the shadow}} mask color {{television}} was patented by Werner Flechsig (1900–1981) in Germany, and was demonstrated at the International radio exhibition Berlin in 1939. Most CRT color televisions used today {{are based on}} this technology. His {{solution to the problem}} of focusing the electron guns on the tiny colored dots was one of brute-force; a <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> with holes punched in it allowed the beams to reach the screen only when they were properly aligned over the dots. Three separate guns were aimed at the holes from slightly different angles, and when their beams passed through the holes the angles caused them to separate again and hit the individual spots a short distance away on the back of the screen. The downside to this approach was that the mask cut off the vast majority of the beam energy, allowing it to hit the screen only 15% of the time, requiring a massive increase in beam power to produce acceptable image brightness.|$|E

The timber building has a gabled-hipped roof clad with corrugated <b>metal</b> <b>sheet.</b> It has undergone changes, in particular at the ground floor level, which is now used as a space to park cars. The northwest external wall has been removed and replaced with three steel posts. The {{area in which the}} cars are parked has a pressed metal ceiling. At the first floor level the northwest veranda has been enclosed and extended and the roofline has been altered. The first level contained one large room, which has been subdivided with partitions.

The room retains its pressed metal ceiling and fittings such as a row of coat hooks.|$|E
25|$|In 1923 {{the almost}} {{monopoly}} {{position of the}} Mint as supplier to foreign (non-empire) countries was lost as the Royal Mint was given permission to supply to the world market, although the Mint continued to supply the Royal Mint. During The Depression profits were minute and after shareholder revolt the Mint {{was taken out of}} the hands of the Heaton family in May 1935. From this time the production of coins became a small part of the overall business of non-ferrous <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> and tube production. Coinage accounted for 10–20% of the business from 1940 to 1964. World War II again demanded quantities of brass sheet and copper tube for ammunition and aluminium-brass cylinder linings for Rolls-Royce aeroplane engines. Bomb damage and the effects of continuous production for the war left the factory run-down. It was unable to supply new minting machinery to the Royal Mint in 1948, but did provide the necessary drawings.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} mills besides the textile mills. Between Field Mill and Town Mill, {{there was an}} iron foundry, called Meadow Foundry, which was built by William Bradshaw and John Sansom in 1852. The site had {{previously}} been occupied by a water-powered bark mill, and remained in the ownership of the Duke of Portland. In 1867, Bradshaw and Sansom negotiated a new 14-year lease with the Duke, which included the supply of water from King's Mill reservoir, but they became bankrupt during the following year. It {{was taken over by}} James Bownes, who formed a limited company to operate it, and it remained in use until 1960, when the firm moved to new premises, and the site was redeveloped by the Mansfield Brewery. Below the foundry was Borough Mills, which operated as a saw mill. Between Town Mills and Stanton Mill was the Rock Valley Mill, which was operated by Dickenson Ellis as a mustard mill in the early nineteenth century. It was taken over by David Cooper Barringer in 1839, who formed Barringer and Company to operate it. In 1873, they decided to pack the mustard in decorated tin boxes, instead of wooden ones, and made the boxes on site from pre-printed <b>metal</b> <b>sheet.</b> Soon they were making tin boxes for other companies, and the separate Rock Valley Tin Works was formed in 1889. Three years later, a printing works was established, to print the metal sheets, and it became a limited company in 1895. Following several takeovers, it remains in business as Carnaud Metal Box Engineering.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 16th century the temple was {{furnished}} in the new Renaissance style. They maintained the four and six seat stalla with wooden inlays, dated from 1568 to 1569 on the side. This is attributed to George Tischler from Kezmarok. On the western chorus in 1634 a large organ was built with rich early Baroque ornamentation and sculpture of St. Michael the Archangel at the top. The northern side of the central presbytery under the Gothic arcades two tribunes with early Baroque railing were added. Into the outer side organ with rich polychrome decoration was put. At the top of the middle organ tower there is a sculpture of King David and on the sides there are statues of angels from Presov carvers. To the column between presbyteries of central and southern naves a baptistery was built in the Renaissance style in {{the second half}} of the 16th century. It was made of red marble with wrought copper lid. The lid is made of copper and it is decorated with wrought iron ornaments elevating by rope threaded through the bracket, with relief decorations of winged heads of angels, decorated with wrought scrolls, and on the <b>metal</b> <b>sheet</b> painting decoration of representation of Christ's baptism. Beaten grid with high sculpture of the Good Shepherd on the roof in northern presbytery comes from the same period. It was built at a time when it served the Presov German Lutheran Church. Originally it was an exit from the area of the temple, today it is entrance to the vestry. Stalla are decorated with herm pilasters. The pulpit was made in the 17th century in Renaissance style. Another relief of Christ and the Samaritan is the highlight of the rostrum to the arcuate windowsill. Another relief Christ, this time on a stormy sea, is located on the back panel of the pulpit. A statue of the Good Shepherd and the carved symbols of the three divine virtues rest on a canopy. In 1634 the church was bleached and in 1641 the tower was repaired. In {{the second half of}} the 17th century organ gallery was made with carved railing, which includes a smooth sill and a niche with the figure of Christ in its middle. On the sides it has columns decorated with wrapped vines. The parapet is decorated with ornaments and figurines.|$|E
