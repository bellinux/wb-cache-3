There is a risk that F concentrations in soil may increase to levels toxic to plants or grazing animals. If F added to soil remains in the upper soil profile, due to high reactivity with soil, grazing animals could increase their intake of F through inadvertent ingestion of F-enriched soil. This study determined the distribution of F in the soil profile of medium (> 8 years) and long-term permanent pastures (> 50 years) where F had been applied as an impurity in <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> and assessed the potential bioavailability of fertiliser F in soil. Long-term application of superphosphate was linked to increased concentrations of the more soluble fraction of F in soil. The more soluble F fraction in the soil surface led to increased F concentrations in herbage (from 11 to 22 mg F/kg). Fluoride concentrations in herbage were not high enough to be toxic to plants or grazing animals. Fluoride applied as an impurity in <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> was generally found to accumulate in the upper soil profile (0 – 6 cm depth). Such increases could also increase F ingestion by ruminants through incidental soil ingestion while grazing. The risk of fluorosis to grazing animals is low at present, but with continued application of fertiliser to soil containing high concentrations of F, and depending on the bioavailability of fertiliser-derived F in soil, we estimate that fluorosis may become an issue in the next 25 – 50 years in highly fertilised pasture soils.

40|$|Summary. Cadmium is a {{toxic metal}} for living organisms and an {{environmental}} contaminant. Agricultural soils {{in many parts}} of the world are slightly to moderately contaminated by Cd due to long term use of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> sewage sludge application as well as smelter dust spreading. Cd phytoextraction is a promising and environmentally friendly approach for soil decontamination. Plant potential for Cd extraction generally depends on shoot Cd concentration and shoot biomass yield. Some ecotypes of the metal hyperaccumulator species Thlaspi caerulescens J. & C. Presl possess an extraordinary Cd accumulation and tolerance, but have low biomass yield. Some fast growing trees (Salix, Populus) and high biomass producing crops (Brassica, Helianthus, Nicotiana) are also considered as suitable species for phytoextraction as they might compensate lower Cd accumulation with much higher biomass yields. Moreover, they deliver “production ” which eventually can be utilised, making the phytoextraction process more feasible from economical point of view. At present, plant potential for Cd phytoextraction is limited by: (1) low biomass yield and some undesirable characteristics of Thlaspi caerulescens, (2) low shoot Cd concentration and ability to withstand Cd of biomass plans, (3) economical factor. There are two general approaches for further development of Cd phytoextraction: genetic transformations to improve plant factor and agronomy-related optimisations in many different as...|$|R

Regression equations relating the logarithm of each biomass component to the logarithm of tree basal area were fitted for stem wood, stem bark, live branches, and live needles. Treatment effects were significant only for live-needle biomass, with unfertilised trees having greater needle biomass per unit of basal area than fertilised trees. The regression equations were solved for all trees and the biomass data converted to an area basis. Total above-ground biomass increased with increasing level of applied phosphate, up to 67 kg P/ha. Application of phosphorus resulted in significant increases in all above-ground components including stem wood, stem bark, live branches, and live needles. There was no additional response to nitrogen and potassium applied in combination with phosphorus at any level up to 800 kg N/ha. A large response to <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> occurred in diameter growth, with only a minor response in height growth. This caused {{a significant increase in}} the average taper of the fertilised trees. The pronounced response in growth did not result in any significant change in wood density.

40|$|This report {{marks the}} end of the first phase of a long term systems trial on phosphorus. The {{objective}} of the work was to define the minimum soil P necessary to ensure optimum production in terms of milk. If phosphorus applications are minimised, the potential damage to the environment is minimised. Three herds (21 cows each) were managed on three separate farmlets. The objective was to have each herd graze on land with it’s own soil P level. The target soil P levels required for herds 1, 2 and 3, were Indices 1, 2 and 3, respectively. At {{the end of}} this phase of the work these soil P targets were achieved. These were achieved by using no P fertiliser on treatment 1, application of maintenance P on treatment 2 (14 kg p/ha) and 28 kg P/ha on treatment 3. In the course of the four years, grass growth, silage yields, milk yields and composition, cow weights and body scores were recorded. Soil phosphorus levels changed slowly. It took between 20 and 40 kg P/ha to move Morgan’s P by one unit. Silage yields and grazing sward yields were not affected by <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments. The P status in silage was significantly reduced in the low P treatments in three out of the four years. This resulted in lower P levels in the slurry in the low P treatments. In the fourth year P status in the grazing swards was consistently reduced in the low P treatment. Milk yields and composition were not influenced by P treatment. There was some evidence that cow weight and body score of cows were adversely effected in the low P treatments towards the end of the trial. In the next phase of the work, phosphorus will be applied to all three treatments at similar rates, i. e. maintenance dressings of P will be applied to cows grazing on soils with Indices 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

Although present yields of these crops are low, they have excellent production potential in dryland conditions. In the seventies, a number of concepts and techniques have been developed that can substantially improve the productivity {{of many of these}} drylands. But they have yet to be exploited extensively and intensively. There are good indications that the new farming practices can bring about a breakthrough in production in deep Vertisols, which occupy many million hectares in India. An analysis of constraints to productivity and production in drylands shows that, besides environmental and socio-economic constraints, technological constraints also seriously limit productivity in many of these areas. Water is a limiting factor in drylands and provision of water for only "lifesaving" irrigation (i. e [...] the minimum to prevent total crop loss) can stimulate a favourable chain reaction. However, even without irrigation, appropriate biological technology coupled with fertilisers can enhance productivity manifold. Fertiliser-responsive genotypes with higher yield potential and stability against yield reducers are becoming a catalyst of change in drylands. Such genotypes are available in the case of sorghum, millet, and maize, but not yet for pulses and oilseeds. Dryland farmers are becoming interested in the use of fertilisers' for dry-farm crops, but their first preference is for high-value, market-oriented crops, high-yielding cereals and for lands with better moisture-storage capacity capable of giving stable yields and assured returns. The unirrigated lands of the semi-arid tropics (SAT) in India are at present given less than 18 kg of NPK per hectare, while irrigated fields in the same area receive about 58 kg per hectare annually. It is concluded that the rate of growth of fertiliser use in both these situations is commensurate with the technology and the infrastructure but there is considerable scope for increase. This suggests a need for intensive research on the loss and efficiency of notrogenous and <b>Phosphatic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> under dryland conditions and the development of implements for seeding and fertiliser application at proper depth in relation to soil moisture. To avoid shortfalls in production of coarse grains, pulses, and oil seeds and to substantially increase their productivity, intensified support for research and development of dryland agriculture is needed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with some economic aspects {{of the use of}} artificial nitrogen fertilisers in New Zealand agriculture. With the prospect of much cheaper nitrogen fertiliser in the future (and possibly more expensive <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser),</b> some agriculturalists looking well to the future have suggested that New Zealand should and will move progressively towards systems of farming which are much more dependent than at present on nitrogenous fertilisers. The most comprehensively argued approach comes from Dr K. J. Mitchell, Director of the Plant Physiology Division of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In a number of recent papers [14, 15] he has argued that fertiliser nitrogen should be progressively substituted for clover as a source of nitrogen in New Zealand agriculture. Also, this should be coupled with a change in farming systems away from conventional clover based pasture towards continuous cropping and storage of maize and annual winter ryegrass. Though we propose in the paper to touch on some of the wider aspects of nitrogen use, our attention will be concentrated mainly on Dr Mitchell's suggested system which is important enough to justify a preliminary economic appraisal. In subjecting Dr Mitchell's proposals to a critical economic appraisal, we are not indulging in the negative criticism that is so often implied when criteria of profit and loss are applied to a new and important idea. Indeed, we started out with the contrary hope, namely that we would find increased profits or reduction in costs in the suggested new approach. At the least we felt that an economic appraisal of this sort would lay bare just where the economic advantages and disadvantages of the nitrogen storage system lay by comparison with conventional systems of producing livestock fodder. Also, in what directions further technical research should proceed if the maximum cost reductions or profit increases were to be achieved. In tackling this subject we have laboured under two major disadvantages. The first concerns the fact that there does not exist a great volume of research data relating to the agronomy of nitrogen fertiliser in New Zealand, especially in relation to grassland. Thus we have had to fall back in many cases on the opinions and guesses of agricultural scientists with whom we have discussed the matter. The second problem is that there is very little data available on costs of production of conventional pasture and, imperfect as our methods are, we found it necessary to tackle this question first, in order to provide a bench mark against which to compare the production costs of the new technology. We proceed as follows: In Section II we discuss the economics of conventional clover based pasture production. This is followed in Section III by a brief description and case study of a Mitchell type farm, and in Section IV by an economic appraisal of both this and other types of farms. In Section V the original budgets are recalculated to give return to land rather than the conventional return to capital. Some general criticisms are given in Section VI, followed in Section VII with a discussion of costs of feed conservation and storage of alternatives. Some alternative nitrogen using approaches are canvassed in. Section VIII before the whole matter is summed up in the concluding Section IX...|$|R

40|$|Samples of Porites coral {{were removed}} from seven {{different}} reefs (No Name, Hastings, Upolu, Thetford, Batt, Green Island and Brook Islands Reefs), including two from the same reef (Green Island Reef), within Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Chemical and morphological data retrieved from these samples were used to investigate historical change in water quality surrounding the growing corals, particularly as this related to {{the increased use of}} <b>phosphatic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> on the nearby mainland. The study focused on a narrow section of the continental shelf adjacent to the mouth of the Barron River. In this area coral reefs are close to a mainland significantly altered for anthropogenic purposes. No Name Reef (approximately 300 km north of the study area and reasonably distant from known anthropogenic input) was included as a control. The Brook Islands Reef (approximately 300 km south of the study area) was added for geographic variability. Support data was gained by a two year nutrient monitoring programme of the Barron and Mossman River catchments, and marine waters adjacent to these two river systems. Additional information was acquired by the experimental supplementation of Acropora formosa corals with 2. 0 μM, 4. 0 μM and 8. 0 μM PO₄. Stream phosphate levels responded rapidly to rainfall. During the April 1989 flood period between 710 and 2, 850 tonnes of Superphosphate were delivered into the ocean. Estimates vary according to the presumed ratio of soluble to particulate phosphate in the flood plume (e. g. see Cosser 1987 and Brodie & Mitchell 1992). The lower figure is nearly half the total industry estimated fertiliser usage (1810 tonnes) for the Far Northern Statistical Division during 1988. The greater figure is more than a third higher than Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for the same period (Pulsford 1990). The marine monitoring program suggested that nutrient monitoring was an insufficient method of estimating water quality. The phosphate supplementation experiment showed that elevated levels of phosphate hindered calcium carbonate production with considerable alteration to the internal and external morphology of the coral skeleton. Chemical analysis of the Porites samples suggested that intra-reefal variation in the coral skeleton was minor, but with sufficient inconsistencies in the annual record to suggest that localised, micro-environmental conditions exist and should be recognised when attempting to reconstruct environmental records from the coral skeleton. Statistically, the inner- and inner/mid-shelf sample sets were significantly different from each other and from all other sample sets. No significant statistical difference could be distinguished in the mid- to outer-shelf sample sets, but the relative contribution of each element differed for each of these sample sets. The difference between the samples from nearer to shore and those from the outershelf was also apparent in the reconstructed coral inferred environmental record. Strontium-based sea-surface temperature estimates provided an adequate record of historical sea surface temperatures from the mid- to outer-shelf samples (No Name, Hastings, Upolu and Thetford Reefs), but were unreliable for the closer to shore samples (Batt, Green Island and Brook Island Reefs). Similar inconsistencies were noted in associations with climatic variables. Data from the outer-shelf No Name Reef sample correlated with climatic data associated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) while data from the Green Island Reef sample correlated with Mean Sea Level Pressure read at Darwin. These inconsistencies were inherent in the coral-inferred record and were not associated with anthropogenic influence. However, ambiguities in the chemical composition and morphological structure of the Green Island sample were noted post- 1950. These inconsistencies were statistically correlated to the use of fertiliser on the nearby mainland. Changes to the internal porosity of the coral skeleton were similar to those noted in the experimental phosphate supplementation programme. The study concludes that chemical and morphological variations in the skeleton of the massive Porites coral are suitable for hindcasting paleoenvironmental conditions laid down in the skeleton at the time of precipitation. The study further concludes that there is significant evidence of anthropogenic influence in the Green Island sample, and that this influence is related to the use of fertilisers on the nearby mainland...|$|R

The study suggests that morphology of kaolinitic minerals is influenced by the kind of parent material (i. e. feldspars or micas) and degree of chemical weathering. The pH values of pore water from clay samples range from 7. 14 - 9. 08. The electrical conductivities (EC) of the clay/water slurries (S/L ratio) range from 0. 004 mS/cm – 3. 02 mS/cm. The oxidation reduction potential (ORP) values range between- 62. 4 and – 6. 8 for the solids or slurries prepared with water. The dissolved oxygen (DO...|$|R
40|$|Pakistan has {{a history}} of subsidising {{agricultural}} inputs. Although none of the agricultural inputs were subsidised during the early 1950 s, the process was initiated {{in the second half of}} the decade by subsidising chemical fertilisers in order to popularise their use [Niaz (1984) ]. The list of subsidised inputs and the rate structure of the subsidies were expanded considerably throughout the Sixties. Towards the end of the Sixties, it was noted that almost all the agricultural inputs including fertilisers, insecticides, seeds, irrigation water, tubewell installations, and the operation and purchase of tractors and tractor-related equipment were subsidised in one form or another [Aresvik (1967) and Kuhnen (1989) ]. In the 1970 s, some curtailment of subsidies occurred as a result of input price increases which followed the worldwide recession, a major oil shock, the credit crunch, the war with India, and the consequent steep devaluation of Pakistani Rupee [Chaudhry (1982) ]. Although the subsidies had survived the onslaught of the Seventies and tended to persist on most inputs, the government became totally committed to their removal beginning with the 1980 s, under pressures from the IMF and the World Bank [Government of Pakistan (1980) ]. As a consequence, there was a total withdrawal of subsidy from seeds, insecticides, tubewells, and tractors. A phased-out withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, culminating in 1984 - 85 in the case of nitrogenous fertilisers and in 1989 - 90 in the case of <b>phosphatic</b> and potash <b>fertilisers,</b> was also to be undertaken [World Bank (1986) ]. The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the progress of withdrawal of input subsidies in Pakistan, to study the nature of the input subsidies and possibly analyse the impact of the withdrawal of subsidies on the farm sector. Needless to add that the study is also intended to make policy recommendations on the various aspects of subsidy withdrawal. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{study area}} {{situated}} {{to the southeast}} of Esh-Shidiya mines in the southeastern part of Jordan close to the Saudi Arabia borders. The phosphorites of Naqib Etaiq area (Campanian-Maastrichtian in age), crops out along the southeastern extension of Ras En Naqab-Batn Al Ghul escarpment, are up to 26 m thick and unconformably overlies the Upper Cretaceous-Batn Al Ghul Group. The phosphorites at this locality are composed of predominantly phosphatic sand, sandstone, phosphate, interbedded with thin limestone beds, coquinal limestone, coquina, marl, phosphatic chert and chert. The phosphate sequence {{in the study area}} shows lateral variations in lithology, thickness and distribution of the phosphate beds. Generally, phosphates at these localities form approximately 50 % of the section and occur as beds, up to 1. 7 m thick. Field observations indicate the presence of fragmented bones, reptile carapaces, Thalassinoides, gastropods, bivalves. Chemical analyses indicate that P 2 O 5 content of the phosphate beds increased upward in the section and varies from 8. 0 to 26. 42 %, whereas through SEM on selected phosphate areas the P 2 O 5 is up to 42. 13 %. The results of X-ray diffraction analyses indicate that the main <b>phosphatic</b> <b>mineral</b> is carbonate fluorapatite (francolite). Preliminary petrographic studies indicate the presence of phosphate pellets, bone fragments, intraclasts, fish teeth, and quartz grains cemented by calcite and dolomite. The phosphorites in the study area were probably deposited in marine environment, upper shoreface, very close to the shore lines of the continent...|$|R

As {{the study of}} microbes {{and their impact on}} the environment grows, so too does the desire to understand the genetic basis of the physiologies that make possible interactions between microbial cells and their environment. Since it is now much more cost-effective to sequence bacterial genomes, environmental metagenomic assembly is a very attractive option for obtaining the genetic blueprints of bacterial physiologies. Bacteria of the genus Thiomargarita (Greek; theio-: sulfur; margarites: pearl), pose a particularly interesting quandary. The genus includes the world's largest bacteria, but as uncultured organisms, their physiologies and basis for their gigantism are not well understood. In order to investigate the genetic basis for these modes, a single cell MDA amplification approach was used on T. nelsonii cells collected at the Hydrate Ridge methane seep off of the coast of Oregon. These particular cells were derived from a gastropod-attached epibiont community. Next-generation sequencing produced a metagenomic product representing both T. nelsonii and attached bacteria (epibionts). These reads were assembled into contigs, binned using the tetranucleotide frequency of the resultant contigs, and finalized using a more stringent secondary assembly. The resulting draft genome shows evidence in Thiomargarita nelsonii for a complete denitrification pathway not previously known in large, vacuolated, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Additionally, the genes necessary for polyphosphate metabolism were observed. Polyphosphate metabolism is thought {{to play a role in}} the formation of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>minerals</b> that serve as important reservoirs in the marine phosphorous cycle...|$|R
40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{and major}} ions were determined in rainwater samples collected from Guiyang in the acid rain impacted zone of Southwest China. The concentrations of total dissolved and acid-soluble REEs in rainwater {{are higher than}} those of most of the world's cities as well as the local surface water. The dissolved REE concentrations are negatively correlated to pH in rainwater. This is consistent with acidification of rainwater resulting in increasing REE concentrations. Speciation calculations using the PHREEQC-Model predict that the free REE metal ion (i. e., Ln 3 +), sulfate (LnSO 4 +), oxalate (LnOx+ and LnOx 2 -) and fluoride (LnF 2 +) complexes were relatively important forms of dissolved REE. Although the contribution to rainwater acidity of oxalic acid is much lower than that of sulfuric acid, the proportion of REE-oxalate complexes is not lower than that of REE-sulfate complexes in rain waters. The rainwater is enriched in the middle REEs (MREE) compared to both the light REEs (LREE) and heavy REEs (HREE). REE-phosphate complexes, <b>phosphatic</b> <b>minerals</b> and a Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxide coating are more likely controls on the development of MREE enrichment in the rainwater. Complexation of sulfate and REE played little {{role in the development of}} MREE enrichment, even though sulfate is the most important anion in acidic rainwater. In the shale-normalized REE pattern plot, La showed a clear positive anomaly. La might have two main anthropogenic sources in rainwater. One of the important sources could be automobile emission; another main source of excess La in rainwater could be the REE fertilizer that has been widely used in the agriculture of China for approximately 30 years...|$|R
40|$|Spatial {{data are}} {{a model of}} the real world that allows the use of {{information}} for further computer analysis and graphics. However, to assure a correct use of the data, it is necessary that all criteria for collecting and implementing of data be amply documented. Since producers and users of geo-spatial data manage a great quantity of information, an appropriate documentation will guarantee a complete and accurate knowledge of all possessed data, thus assuring the correct management of their production, storage, use and updating. For this purpose, the use of standard management criteria seems essential: the aim is to establish consistent procedures for the description of spatial data sets. One of the most important GIS standards is metadata. Metadata allow a complete description of a set of data, thus enabling the users to comprehend the limitation and collecting criteria while evaluating the possibilities and modes of use for specific purposes. In projecting the GIS of the city of Khouribga - carried out in the sphere of the diagnostic phase of the SIGEK 2000 project: “amélioration des capacitès techniques et de gestion locale pour la mise en place d'un système de gestion environnementale intégrée dans la ville de Khouribga (Maroc) ", financed by the EU - a particular attention has been given to the organisation of the database documentation by adopting the CEN TC 287 Standard of the European Technical Committee. The objective was to create an information system of the city and its surroundings to be used by the various technical bureaux of the Khouribga municipality. Through this project the city has acquired a flexible and dynamic tool for land management and planning of all environmental aspects regarding an area with a strong industrial and human expansion. This area has been chosen as a model due to the several environmental problems that it presents. The city and its surroundings are characterised by the presence of intense activities for the exploitation of <b>phosphatic</b> <b>minerals</b> and also by large quantities of phosphatic waste, which, beyond altering the landscape, are a source of environmental pollution to which the local authorities want to find a solution. All the data sets (either initial or produced during the project) have been associated to the respective metadata created during the construction of the database; all output data have been continuously updated. This has avoided eventual posterior reconstruction of the information contents, thus relieving the implementation process of a great burden...|$|R
