50|$|Pentane is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C5H12—that is, an alkane with five carbon atoms. The term may refer {{to any of}} three structural isomers, or to a mixture of them: in the IUPAC nomenclature, however, pentane means exclusively the n-pentane isomer; {{the other two are}} called isopentane (<b>methylbutane)</b> and neopentane (dimethylpropane). Cyclopentane is not an isomer of pentane because it has only 10 hydrogen atoms where pentane has 12.|$|E
50|$|Isopentane, C5H12, {{also called}} <b>methylbutane</b> or 2-methylbutane, is a {{branched-chain}} alkane with five carbon atoms. Isopentane {{is an extremely}} volatile and extremely flammable liquid at room temperature and pressure. The normal boiling point {{is just a few}} degrees above room temperature and isopentane will readily boil and evaporate away on a warm day. Isopentane is commonly used in conjunction with liquid nitrogen to achieve a liquid bath temperature of −160 °C. It is 1% or less of natural gas.|$|E
40|$|The {{pyrolysis}} of isopentyl and neopentyl P-toluenesulfonates in {{the liquid}} phase at 200 °gave 2 -methyl- 1 -propene (3. 0 and 4. 3 %), 2 -methyl- 1 -butene (10. 8 nad 14. 5 %), 3 -methyl- 1 -butene (12. 1 and 2. 3 %), 2 -methyl- 2 -butene (59. 7 and 59. 6 %), 2 -methylpropane (3. 4 and 5. 1 %), and 2 <b>methylbutane</b> (11. 0 and 14. 2 %). The former gave predominantly rearranged hydrocarbons, but the latter gave exclusively rearranged hydrocarbons. The {{ratio of the}} saturated to unsaturated hydrocarbons was 1 : 6 and 1 : 4. 2, respectively. It was suggested that the pyrolysis may proceed, at least in part, through a free radical process {{on the basis of}} (1) a change in the product composition and a decrease in yield caused by the addition of a free radical inhibitor,(2) the close resemblance of the product composition to that from a simple free radical reaction of isopentyl system, and (3) an ESR study...|$|E
40|$|Barriers to {{internal}} rotation about the C(2) -C(3) bonds have been determined for ten closely related halogenated <b>methylbutanes</b> by detailed line-shape {{analysis of their}} nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. The experimental barriers range from 9 to 16 kcal/mol. In addition, {{for some of the}} compounds investigated, free energy differences were obtained for rotational isomers under conditions of slow conformational exchange. The results are discussed in terms of possible contributing nonbonded interactions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{previous}} {{model for}} the calculation of proton chemical shifts in substituted alkanes based upon partial atomic charges and steric interactions has been modiÐed by {{the replacement of the}} CÈC bond anisotropy term with an orientation-dependent c e†ect (i. e. C ÉC ÉC ÉH). The new scheme (CHARGE 5) predicts the proton chemical shifts of a variety of acyclic, cyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons over 188 data points spanning 2 ppm to within. 1 ppm, an improvement over the previous model with three fewer variable parameters. Systems con-sidered include cyclobutanes, cyclopentanes, cyclohexanes, norbornanes, cis- and trans-decalin, perhydrophenalene, anthracene, adamantane, androstane, <b>methylbutanes</b> and tert-butylmethanes. The signiÐcance of these results is discussed with respect {{to the development of a}} comprehensive theory of proton chemical shifts and it is concluded that CÈC bond anisotropy does not in general contribute signiÐcantly to proton chemical shifts, although a possible speciÐc shielding e†ect in planar eclipsed C ÉC ÉC ÉC fragments is noted. 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
30|$|Femurs were excised, trimmed of skin, {{and fixed}} in 10  % neutral {{buffered}} formalin (HT 501320.9; Sigma) at 4  °C before shipment to the Rowe laboratory for histological imaging. The fixator device was removed after the femur was radiographed at 24  kV for 8  s {{with a digital}} X-ray (LX 60; Faxitron, USA). Subsequently, each femur was soaked overnight in 30  % sucrose/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, positioned in Neg- 50 frozen-section medium (Richard-Allan Scientific, MI), frozen over chilled <b>methylbutane,</b> and kept at − 20  °C. Longitudinal full-length 5 -μm cryosections were taken either in line with or in cross-section to the screw holes (CM 3050 S cryostat; Leica, Germany) using a steel blade (cat# 3051835; Fisher Scientific, MA) and nonautofluorescent adhesive film (Section Lab, Co., Ltd., Toyota-gun, Hiroshima, Japan). Three sections were taken at three different depths, and each section was transferred to a glass slide, soaked for 10  min in PBS, stained in 30  mg/mL calcein blue solution (#M 1255 - 1 G; Sigma) for 30  min, and cover-slipped with 50  % glycerin in PBS prior to microscopy for the endogenous fluorescent signals.|$|E
40|$|The carbon kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of the room-temperature {{reactions}} of several light alkanes and ethene with OH radicals were measured in a 30 L PTFE reaction chamber at ambient pressure using gas chromatography coupled with online combustion and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GCC-IRMS). For simplicity, KIEs {{are reported in}} per mil according to epsilon (parts per thousand) = (k(12) /k(13) - 1) x 1000. The following average KIEs were obtained, (all in parts per thousand) : ethane, 8. 57 +/- 1. 95; propane,. 5. 46 +/- 0. 35; n-butane, 5. 16 +/- 0. 67; methylpropane, 8. 45 +/- 1. 49; n-pentane, 2. 85 +/- 0. 79; <b>methylbutane,</b> 2. 91 +/- 0. 43; n-hexane, 2. 20 +/- 0. 07; n-heptane, 1. 96 +/- 0. 26; n-octane, 2. 13 +/- 0. 39; cyclopentane, 1. 84 +/- 0. 13; cyclohexane, 4. 46 +/- 0. 51; methylcyclopentane, 1. 77 +/- 0. 53; ethene, 18. 6 +/- 2. 9. As well, the room-temperature rate constant for the reaction of methylcyclopentane + OH, not previously reported in the literature, was determined using relative rates: (8. 6 +/- 2. 2) x 10 (- 12) cm(3) molecule(- 1) s(- 1), including the estimated 25 % uncertainty in the rate constant for cyclopentane + OH. KIE values for propane, n-butane and n-hexane have been reported previously [J. Geophys. Res. [Atmos. ] 2000, 105, 29329]. Our KIE for n-hexane is {{in agreement with the}} previous measurement, but our values for propane and n-butane are both higher. The dependence between the KIE and chemical structure is discussed, and a method for estimating unknown carbon KIEs for the {{reactions of}} light alkanes with OH radicals is presented. With only one exception, predictions using this method agree within a factor of 2 of the experimental KIE results...|$|E
40|$|For {{immunohistochemistry}} and in situ hybridization. Human tissue specimens obtained during autopsy, per-formed 8 to 12 {{hours after}} death, were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde (E. Merck, Darmstadt, FRG), embedded in paraffin (Merck), sectioned into 7 - to 10 -fim slices, mounted on microscope slides, and stored {{at room temperature}} until further use. Samples obtained during cardiovascular surgery were immediately placed in 4 % formaldehyde and processed as described above or embedded within 1 hour of removal in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound, Miles Scien-tific, Elkhart, Ind), frozen in cold <b>methylbutane</b> (Merck), and stored at- 70 °C. Sections for immunohis-tochemical purposes were cut at 7 /Am, fixed with cold acetone, air dried, and used within 24 hours. For in situ hybridization, sections were cryosectioned at 7 fim, placed on poly-L-lysine-coated (Fluka, Buchs, Switzer-land) slides, air dried, fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (Sigma, St Louis, Mo) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), dehydrated, and stored at- 20 °C. Arterial seg-ments were obtained from 17 patients, 12 during sur-gery and 5 after autopsy. For electron microscopy immunogold labeling. Vessel segments obtained at cardiovascular surgery were fixed by immersion in 4 % paraformaldehyde plus 0. 1 % glu-taraldehyde in 0. 1 mol/L sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7. 4, for 30 minutes and diced into 1 -mm cubes. The fixation was continued for up to 2 hours at room temperature. Postfixation in osmium tetroxide was not employed because preliminary experiments showed that this treatment leads to a complete loss of antigenicity. After fixation, the samples were dehydrated in 50 % and 70 % ethanol and transferred first to 1 : 1 (vol/vol) then 2 : 1 (vol/vol) LR White (Polyscience Inc, Warrington, Pa) resin/ 70 % ethanol for 60 minutes. 10 Blocks were placed in fresh resin and infiltrated overnight at 4 °C. The samples were then embedded in gelatin capsules containing fresh LR White resin {{and placed in a}} vacuum oven at 40 °C to 50 °C for 24 hours. Blocks were trimmed, and semithin sections were cut with a glass knife and stained with toluidine blue. Ultrathin sections (70 to 110 nm) were cut using a diamond knife and picked up on uncoated or Formvar-coated 200 -mesh nickel grids...|$|E
40|$|Dogs {{develop an}} age-associated {{cognitive}} dysfunction syndrome with several aspects resembling Alzheimer's disease. Affected animals {{show signs of}} disorientation in their familiar surroundings, dementia, and a disturbed circadian rhythm. The underlying neurodegenerative disease is associated with pathologic changes in the brain including regularly deposition of β-pleated amyloid and rarely hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation. However, {{there have been no}} reports of the highly cytotoxic and modified pE 3 Aβ in the canine brain. Equally, altered microglial morphology has not been documented so far. For this study 24 euthanized thoroughbred dogs and mongrels of different ages were available. Five of these animals had an average age of 2. 1 years and served as control group. The remaining 19 dogs were 8 to 19 years old. Accor-ding to their height and weight these dogs were divided into 3 different categories including small (≤ 10 kg), medium (11 - 25 kg) and large dogs (> 25 kg). Brains were dissected from the skulls and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde. Afterwards the frontal and entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampal for-mation were isolated, vitrificated in 30 % sucrose solution and frozen to - 80 °C by <b>methylbutane.</b> These regions were sliced into 40 µm thick sections and subsequently stained by immunohistology in order to detect deposits of Aβ 8 - 17, pE 3 Aβ and hyperphosphorylated tau, respectively. Antibodies against Iba 1 and TAL. 1 B 5 were used to analyze microglial morphology and activation status. Additionally further investigations were made with the Filament Tracer of Imaris software. Stereological analysis methods served for the quantification of Aβ depositions and microglia. Disseminated Aβ plaques were detected in dogs from 9 years on. Within the examined brain regions of elderly dogs a progressive course of Aβ depositions was observed. Especially small dogs had a longer lifespan than medium and large dogs with the result that more plaques were deposited in the brains of small dogs. Elderly dogs had in common that pE 3 Aβ-plaques where more often located in the examined brain regions than plaques containing Aβ 8 - 17. Minor parenchymal and meningeal vessels seemed to be susceptible especially to pE 3 Aβ depositions. The amount of vessel-associated Aβ 8 - 17 and pE 3 Aβ in the entorhinal cortex of small dogs was almost equal. Within the entorhinal cortex of medium and large dogs the amount of vessel-associated Aβ 8 - 17 predominated. The ventral hippocampus of small dogs showed significantly more vessel-associated Aβ 8 - 17 than pE 3 Aβ depositions. Hyperphosphorylated tau was present in the hippocampal formations of 3 dogs with an age of 11 and 15 years, respectively. The degree of severity varied with the result that only one dog showed a high-grade pathology with development of NFTs and neuritic plaques. Accompanied by age and associated protein pathology altered microglial morphology was detected. Alongside with ramified microglia, activated cells were identified in the examined brain regions. Several microglia showed signs of senescence and were present in the brains of dogs with severe Aβ and tau pathology. Summarizing, this study facilitated a further characterization of the canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome. The results are of highly translational importance and encourage the establishment of the dog as a natural animal model for studying age-associated processes and the initial stage of Alzheimer’s disease...|$|E
