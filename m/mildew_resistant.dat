However, powdery mildew resistance has previously been discovered in two Central Asian cultivars and in Chinese Vitis species. 				 				 					 						Results 					A set of 380 unique genotypes were evaluated with data generated from 34 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The set included 306 V. vinifera cultivars, 40 accessions of V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris, and 34 accessions of Vitis species from northern Pakistan, Afghanistan and China. Based on the presence of four SSR alleles previously identified as linked to the powdery mildew resistance locus, Ren 1, 10 new <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> genotypes were identified in the test set: eight were V. vinifera cultivars and two were V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris based on flower and seed morphology. Sequence comparison of a 620 bp region that includes the Ren 1 -linked allele (143 bp) of the co-segregating SSR marker SC 8 - 0071 - 014, revealed that the ten newly identified genotypes have sequences that are essentially identical to the previously identified <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> V. vinifera cultivars: &# 8216;Kishmish vatkana&# 8217; and &# 8216;Karadzhandal&# 8217;.

In this study, we characterized {{a gene encoding}} a protein with an NB-ARC domain from wild Chinese grapevine Vitis pseudoreticulata accession Baihe- 35 - 1, which was identified in a transcriptome analysis of the leaves following inoculation with Erysiphe necator (Schw.), a causal agent of powdery mildew. Transcript levels of this gene, designated VpCN (GenBank accession number KT 265084), increased strongly after challenge of grapevine leaves with E. necator. The deduced amino acid sequence was predicted to contain an NB-ARC domain in the C-terminus and an RxCC-like domain similar to CC domain of Rx protein in the N-terminus.

In total, 6, 156, 6, 875 and 3, 276 transcripts {{were found to be}} differentially expressed in PmA, Han and Cha respectively. Among them, 260 genes exhibited consistent expression patterns in all three wheat lines and may represent a subset of basal H(2) O(2) responsive genes that were associated with cell defense, signal transduction, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, redox homeostasis, and transport. Among genes specific to PmA, 'transport' activity was significantly enriched in Gene Ontology analysis. MapMan classification showed that, while both up- and down- regulations were observed for auxin, abscisic acid, and brassinolides signaling genes, the jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathway genes were all up-regulated, suggesting H(2) O(2) -enhanced JA/Et functions in PmA. To further study whether any of these genes were involved in wheat PM response, 19 H(2) O(2) -responsive putative defense related genes were assayed in wheat seedlings infected with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Eight of these genes were found to be co-regulated by H(2) O(2) and Bgt, among which a fatty acid desaturase gene TaFAD was then confirmed by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) to be required for the PM resistance.

40|$|Pea {{powdery mildew}} is an {{air-borne}} disease of worldwide distribution. It is particularly damaging in late sowings or in late maturing varieties. It {{is caused by}} Erysiphe pisi, although other fungi such as Erysiphe trifolii and Erysiphe baeumleri have also been reported causing this disease on pea. The disease can cause 25 - 50 % yield losses, reducing total yield biomass, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, plant height and number of nodes. The disease also affects green pea quality. Current powdery mildew control methods include early planting, the use of fungicides and of resistant cultivars. Chemical control is feasible {{with a choice of}} protective and systemic fungicides. However, public attitude and environmental concerns towards the use of pesticides as well as the development of powdery <b>mildew</b> strains <b>resistant</b> to different fungicides have reduced the appeal of chemicals and have led to the search of alternative control methods. The present review summarises the current control strategies and highlights future challenges for efficient and sustainable powdery mildew management. Non-fungicide products, such as soluble silicon, oils, salts and plant extracts are under study but are not fully ready yet for commercial application. Attempts have also been made to control powdery mildews with mycolytic bacteria, mycophagous arthropods, fungi, yeasts and other possible non-fungal biological control agents, but more efforts are still needed to prove the efficacy of these methods in agricultural practice. Genetic resistance is acknowledged as the most effective, economic and environmentally friendly method of control. However, only three genes (er 1, er 2 and Er 3) have been described so far in Pisum germplasm and only er 1 has been widely used in breeding programmes, what is very risky. Expansion of cultivation areas of pea varieties harbouring the same resistance gene could promote the occurrence of new races of the pathogen that would lead to a breakdown of the resistance.

40|$|Powdery mildew is an {{important}} disease in commerciall members of the cucumber family. The specific pathogen that infects cucurbits in California is Podosphaera fusca (synonyms: P. xanthii, Sphaerotheca fulginea and S. fusca), (Janousek et al. 2009, McGrath and Thomas 1996, Pérez-García et al. 2009). Over-wintering chasmothecia produce ascospores that then develop into whitish colonies on leaves, leaf petioles, and stems (McGrath and Thomas 1996, Glawe 2008). Wind or insect vectors disperse asexually-produced conidia and thus spread the disease (Blancard et al. 1994). Favorable conditions for disease epidemics include temperatures between 20 - 27 °C and lower-intensity light (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease outbreaks in the Central Valley of California tend to occur during late summer and autumn months, but coastal areas may be continuously threatened (Davey et al. 2008). Infections {{have the potential to}} reduce the yield and quality of fruit and can lead to early plant senescence (Blancard et al. 1994, McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease management in cucurbits usually involves foliar applications of synthetic fungicides and/or use of disease resistant cultivars (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, myclobutanil, quinoxyfen, trifloxystrobin, triflumizole, and micronized sulfur can be used to treat plants (Davis et al. 2008). Sulfur has the advantage of little or no risk of selecting for <b>resistant</b> <b>mildew</b> strains (Blancard et al. 1994). Previous work in our lab has shown that quinoxyfen, triflumizole, and penthiopyrad are highly effective at managing powdery mildew in disease susceptible varieties (Janousek et al. 2007, 2009).

Yields of Sosat-C 88, Sosank, and CIVT were more stable across environments, and yields of ICMV IS 89305, Gwagwa, and NKK increased in response to more favorable environments. Sosank, CIVT, ICMV IS 89305, Sosat-C 88, and Gwagwa were also among the most downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> entries. Across locations and years, grain yield was negatively correlated with downy mildew incidence, and positively correlated with days to flowering, plant height, and panicle length. These correlations differed {{among some of the}} individual trials, with days to flowering having the least consistent correlations with grain yield. Further selection for improved yield and broad adaptation in pearl millet is likely to be possible, however, site-specific selection is necessary to identify other important traits in addition to yield. The high-yielding and downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> pearl millets identified in this study will be useful to introgress new traits into preferred local varieties, or to serve as parental material for breeding and hybrid development...|$|E
40|$|Autofluorescence of downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> and {{susceptible}} {{cells of}} pearl millet seedlings undergoing hypersensitive reaction (HR) upon Sclerospora graminicola-inoculation and arachidonic acid (AA) -treatment was studied. Two-day-old seedlings {{of a highly}} resistant (IP 18296) and a highly susceptible (23 D(2) B) genotype of pearl miller were either inoculated with zoospore suspension of S. graminicola or treated with AA for 24 h. The coleoptiles with hypersensitive necrotic spots were processed by the standard procedure, and the tissues were subjected to fluorescence microscopy. A differential accumulation of autofluorescent compounds in resistant and susceptible pearl millet genotypes was observed with most accumulation occurring in resistant cells treated with AA. The variation {{in the degree of}} fluorescence and the spatial accumulation of autofluorescent compounds among the two inoculated/treated genotypes is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Inheritance of {{downy mildew}} (Sclerospora graminicola) {{resistance}} in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) was studied in a cross involving DMRP (downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> Pennisetum) 292 and DMSP (downy mildew susceptible Pennisetum) 23. DMRP 292, derived from IP 18292, and DMSP 23, derived from Tift 23 DB, were made homozygous for {{downy mildew resistance}} susceptibility by 3 generations of single plant selection following inoculations with homogenized sporangial population of S. graminicola from the ICRISAT Asia Center. Potted seedlings of parental lines, F 1, F 2 and BC progenies were evaluated for their reactions to downy mildew following inoculation. The results show that complete resistance to downy mildew in DMRP 292 is controlled by a single dominant gene. Because of the simple mode of inheritance, resistance utilization from DMRP 292 is simple and straightforward. This gene is designated Rsg...|$|E
40|$|Plant disease {{resistance}} is commonly triggered by early pathogen recognition and activation of immunity. An alternative form of resistance is mediated by recessive downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> 1 (dmr 1) alleles in Arabidopsis thaliana. Map-based cloning revealed that DMR 1 encodes homoserine kinase (HSK). Six independent dmr 1 mutants each carry a different amino acid substitution in the HSK protein. Amino acid {{analysis revealed that}} dmr 1 mutants contain high levels of homoserine that is undetectable in wild-type plants. Surprisingly, the level of amino acids downstream in the aspartate (Asp) pathway was not reduced in dmr 1 mutants. Exogenous homoserine does not directly affect pathogen growth but induces resistance when infiltrated in Arabidopsis. We provide evidence that homoserine accumulation in the chloroplast triggers a novel form of downy mildew resistance that is independent of known immune responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} gene conferring mildew resistance has been {{transferred from the}} diploid wild species, Avena prostrata (2 n= 2 X= 14) into the cultivated oat A. sativa cv. Sun II (2 n= 6 X= 42). The Cw 57 genotype of A. longiglumis {{has the effect of}} increasing homoeologous chromosome pairing and can be successfully used to induce upsets the control of chromosome pairing in A. sativa. The possible recombinant lines Av 3678 / 12 / 40 and Av 3945 / 7 / 2 were selected at an early stage of breeding programme. The confirmation of desirable recombination was carried out by crossing the disomic addition line and the ditelocentric IX line with the <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> lines. The use of the chromosome substitution line as a source genotype in the crossing programme reduced the amout of screening required compared with the addition line...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{relation}} between powdery mildew resistance and sensitivity for leaf chlorosis of glasshouse cucumber was investigated. The powdery <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant,</b> leaf chlorosis sensitive hybrid variety 'Profito' was crossed with the powdery mildew susceptible, non chlorosis sensitive hybrid variety 'Corona'. Forty four F 6 inbred lines of this cross, produced by single seed descent, were tested for powdery mildew resistance (PMR) and leaf chlorosis sensitivity (LCS). PMR and LCS were positively correlated (r = 0. 59). One {{or more of}} the PMR genes probably causes LCS as a pleiotropic effect or is closely linked to LCS, but also other factors, not genetically linked to PMR can cause LCS. Five F 6 lines combined a significantly higher level of PMR than 'Corona' with a significantly lower LCS than 'Profito'. Three of these lines could hardly be distinguished from 'Corona' for the level of LCS. ...|$|E
40|$|Host plant {{resistance}} {{is an effective}} and economical means of controlling downy mildew disease in maize (Zeamays L.). The present study was initiated with screening of 100 maize inbreds against downy mildew. The parents UMI 57 and UMI 743 showed resistance to downy mildew. Among 56 hybrids, two hybrids viz., CM 500 x UMI 39 and CM 500 x UMI 57 {{were found to be}} highly resistant (100 %) to downy mildew with higher grain yield. The disease reaction of the progenies ranged from zero to 100 per cent. The maximum disease incidence was registered in CM 500. The incidence was recorded nil in UMI 57. All downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> hybrids were found to possess significantly higher concentration of total phenols, soluble protein (mg/g), peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Hence these biochemical substances could have a possible role in the resistance behaviour of the genotypes against downy mildew...|$|E
40|$|Downy mildew (Sclerospora graminicola) {{has been}} a major biotic factor {{affecting}} grain yield of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) in India for the last 25 years. Many downy <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> cultivars have been produced and several have been cultivated widely, but the vulnerability of their resistances to the disease {{has been a}} major cause of concern. Recovery resistance, in which the pathogen completes its life cycle without affecting the normal development of the plant, has potential for providing durable resistance to the disease. A high level of recovery resistance (more or = 95 %) was developed in ICMA 1 (81 A, a leading male-sterile line in India) and its maintainer line ICMB 1 (81 B), through pedigree selection for five generations. The recovery trait in the selected line, designated as RECRES 81 A, was stable against the major pathotypes present in India. RECRES 81 A is agronomically and phenotypically similar to 81 A, produces equally high yielding hybrids and is being used to produce commercial hybrid...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{powdery mildew}} strains, four {{collected}} {{from the field and}} the other four derived from a cross between two strains, were inoculated to seven mutant barley lines having the ml-o gene for powdery mildew resistance and their original varieties of barley. These eight powdery mildew strains showed a distinctive reaction to the nine testers having various resistant genes. Onthe other hand, the original barley varieties showed a similar reaction to all the powdery mildew strains inoculated, indicating that the genetic background of these varieties was similar. In comparison with the ml-o mutants and their original varieties, the type of lesion did not change in most cases, but the number of lesions decreased significantly without exception. In conclusion, the powdery <b>mildew</b> <b>resistant</b> gene ml-o does not affect the type of lesions but it reduces the number of lesions. うどんこ病抵抗性遺伝子ml-oを持つ 7 つの突然変異系統と原品種に対して圃場で採取したうどんこ病菌 4 菌株と交雑由来の 4 菌株計 8 菌株を接種し、ml-oの突然変異系統とその原品種のうどんこ病菌に対する反応を比較した。供試 8 菌株は判別品種に対して相互に異なる反応を示し、従って異なる病原性遺伝子を持つものとみられた。一方、 7 つの原品種は 8 つの菌株に対する反応が一般的に良く似ており、抵抗性に関する遺伝的背景が似通っているとみられた。ml-oを持つ突然変異体とその原品種を比較すると、一部の例外を除けば病斑型はほとんど等しい一方、病斑数が顕著に減少していたので、ml-oは病斑型に対してではなく、病斑数を減少させる方向に働くとみられる...|$|E
