5|$|The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) ordered 14 {{aircraft}} in 2003 {{to use in}} both the airborne <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (AMCM) and transport roles. The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH-101. Special features include the automated folding of the rotor and tail. For the mine-hunting role, the MCH-101 has been outfitted with Northrop Grumman's AQS-24A airborne mine-hunting system and AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for a complete surface-to-bottom mine detection capability, as well as Mk-104 acoustic mine sweeping gear.|$|E

25|$|From 26 February to 6 March 2008 Scout {{participated in}} another <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> {{exercise}} in the northern Persian Gulf with British and Kuwaiti forces. During the exercise, Scout exchanged two sailors with the Royal Navy ship Blyth to foster interoperability between coalition forces engaged in mine warfare.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} {{stages of the}} Cold War, the Royal Navy was reconfigured with three anti-submarine warfare (ASW) {{aircraft}} carriers and a force of frigates and destroyers. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic. There were also <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> and submarine forces as well as support ships. As the Cold War ended, the Royal Navy fought in the Gulf War against Iraq, with Sea Skua anti-ship missiles sinking {{a large proportion of}} the Iraqi Navy. The WRNS was amalgamated with the RN in 1991. The RN also carried out many <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> operations. However, the end of the Soviet threat brought about a very large reduction in the strength of the Navy. All its diesel-electric submarines were decommissioned in 1992 and more surface combatants left the fleet.|$|E
25|$|The Special Operations Warfare (SPECOPS) {{insignia}} is {{earned by}} officers {{by virtue of}} training in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), <b>Mine</b> <b>Countermeasures</b> (MCM), Operational Diving and Salvage (ODS), and Expendable Ordnance Management (EOM). Not {{to be confused with}} Special Warfare (i.e. SEALs), Special Operations, in Navy parlance, refers to dive qualified EOD technicians.|$|E

25|$|Two <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> steamers {{ordered by}} the Russian Navy and built in 1917 had stayed {{in the hands of}} the shipbuilder. The ships were sold to German Navy. The company had to find a new {{customer}} also for the diesel-powered ship ordered by Russian Hydrographic Office; she became eventually a part of the Finnish merchant ship fleet and sailed under name Sunkist.|$|E
25|$|Between 1914 and 1917 total 400 vessels were docked. 135 were navy vessels {{which were}} repaired. In 1916 the company built two large <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> steamers, which were {{one year after}} {{followed}} by two nearly alike vessels. In 1917 the company started to build a diesel-powered vessel for the Russian Hydrographic Office. The company headcount exceeded 1,500 people. In 1916 engineer K. Albin Johansson started as shipbuilding master and captain Ludwig Schwindt as vice president.|$|E
25|$|The Echo-class is a {{class of}} {{multi-purpose}} hydrographic survey ships in commission with the Royal Navy. The ships are primarily tasked with conducting survey work in support of submarine and amphibious operations, however, the class also has a secondary role in <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures.</b> The two vessels of the class are the most recent additions to the Royal Navy's Hydrographic Squadron. Each ship displaces approximately 3,700 tonnes, and {{is equipped with a}} state of the art suite of equipment.|$|E

25|$|The Bedok-class are <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasures</b> vessels (MCMVs) of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). They play an {{important}} role in the maritime security of Singapore, ensuring that the Singapore Strait and the sea lanes surrounding Singapore remain mine-free and open to international shipping. It is estimated that closure of Singapore's ports would result in direct trade losses amounting to more than US$1.2 billion daily, posing a serious threat to Singapore's economy. The four ships form the 194 Squadron of the RSN.|$|E
25|$|The FSC {{concept was}} brought {{forward in the}} 2008 budget, {{at the expense of}} options for two Type 45 destroyers not being taken up (ships 7 and 8). In 2009 BAE Systems {{received}} a contract to design the C1 and C2 frigates with a planned 25-year life. A total of 18 vessels (10 C1 and 8 C2) were planned to enter service from 2020, at a pace of roughly one per year. In early 2010 the C3 variant was dropped in favour of the <b>Mine</b> <b>Countermeasures,</b> Hydrography and Patrol Capability (MHPC) programme.|$|E
25|$|The Navy {{has over}} 600 personnel. The Navy {{consists}} of the Warship Flotilla, the Sea Coastal Surveillance System, the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Divers Team, the Naval Logistic Service, Training Center and Maritime Rescue Coordination Center. The flotilla is the core component of the Navy, and {{consists of the}} <b>Mine</b> <b>Countermeasures</b> Squadron, the Patrol Ships Squadron, and the Harbour Boats Group. The current Commander in Chief of the Lithuanian Navy is Rear Admiral Kęstutis Macijauskas. The Naval base and Headquarters {{are located in the}} city of Klaipėda. The Navy uses patrol ships for coastal surveillance.|$|E
25|$|The ROKN {{plans to}} build and {{commission}} an uncertain number of <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasure</b> ships similar to the Yangyang class.|$|R
25|$|In {{its safety}} and defence policy report of 2004 the Finnish Government {{announced}} that, {{in addition to}} training mobile coastal troops and protecting sea traffic, the Finnish Navy would start focusing on developing its <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasure</b> capabilities. As a result {{a decision was made}} to retire the aging Kuha-class minesweepers and invest in a new <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasure</b> fleet, which would include minehunters and -sweepers, divers and a new mine warfare information system.|$|R
5000|$|The Royal Navy {{maintains}} a permanent {{presence in the}} Gulf consisting of <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasure</b> vessels. It provides continued support to the region ensuring the [...] "safe flow of trade and oil". Presently four vessels are deployed to the region; HMS Middleton (M34), HMS Chiddingfold (M37), HMS Bangor (M109) and HMS Penzance (M106). Typically the <b>mine</b> <b>countermeasure</b> vessels are supported by a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship acting as a 'mothership', this is currently RFA Lyme Bay.|$|R
