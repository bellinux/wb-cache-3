The research {{set out to}} identify patterns of innovative activity toward a sustainable development. A conceptual study was developed, based on the literature and empirical studies, to help understanding of the factors determining innovation in small businesses in incubation facilities. Two conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the findings. On the one hand, businesses in incubation units see innovation as an essential, continuing activity with interrelated dimensions. These firms tend to introduce new products, innovate in processes and implement changes in the organization and exploration of new markets. On the other hand the research showed that some areas of innovation depend on the type of origin of the firm, and its size...|$|R

40|$|Defining the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> is {{somewhat}} arbitrary as criteria used to classify entities as such include size, number of employees, sales volume, asset size, type of customer, capital requirements and market share. There is, however, general agreement that smallness and newness create specific difficulties for business. Furthermore, {{there is widespread}} acceptance {{of the notion that}} <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> typically possess certain characteristics, which serve to differentiate them from larger organisations. These characteristics include inherent weaknesses with respect to capitalisation and marketing awareness and practice. <b>Small</b> <b>firms</b> are perceived as vulnerable yet valuable entities, important both economically and socially. High failure rates of <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> are largely attributed to weaknesses in financial management and marketing. Many classical management concepts are unsuitable for application in a <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> context, with research suggesting non-implementation of theoretically based marketing practice is the rule rather than the exception in the <b>small</b> <b>firm.</b> This paper reviews issues pertaining to marketing practice in the <b>small</b> <b>firm.</b> It examines the absence of agreed definitions of "the small firm" and "success" or "failure" of such entities, offers definitions for these terms, acknowledges the importance of <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> to the economy, reviews <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> characteristics, acknowledges inherent weaknesses with regard to finance and marketing in <b>small</b> <b>firms,</b> reviews marketing practice in the context of <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> characteristics, and considers the roles of marketing educators and owner/managers in improving <b>small</b> <b>firm's</b> marketing practice...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> promote job growth. In fact, <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> both create and eliminate far more jobs than large firms do. On balance, they account for {{a disproportionate share of}} net job growth—however, that greater net growth is driven primarily by the creation of new <b>small</b> <b>firms,</b> frequently referred to as start-ups, rather than by the expansion of mature <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> The greater net job-creation rates associated with new <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> could motivate lawmakers to consider supporting such firms through various policy initiatives. However, policies specifically favoring <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> have both advantages and disadvantages. For instance, policies designed to prevent discrimination or reduce pollution would probably have smaller adverse effects on employment if they exempted <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in those cases where compliance was particularly costly for <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> Conversely, some policies CBO has examined that would increase employment, such as reducing payroll taxes for firms that hire additional workers, would be less cost-effective if they were restricted to <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> Under current federal laws and regulations, <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> already receive more favorable treatment than large firms do in many areas. For example, certain provisions of the tax code relating to capital gains and the expensing of capital investments favor <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> The <b>Small</b> Business Administration (SBA) helps <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> obtain loans. And many regulatory policies, such as those prescribed by the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, include exemptions for <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> Because further efforts to favor <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> may shift employment away from large firms in an inefficient manner, broadly targeted policies may spur total employment more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} in <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> {{are far more}} likely than their large firm counterparts to enter entrepreneurship. We label this phenomenon the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> effect and explore its origins. In particular, we identify four classes of explanations for the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> effect [...] preference sorting, ability sorting, opportunity cost, and the possibility that workers in <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> develop entrepreneurial human capital [...] and examine the empirical evidence for each. We find that preference sorting does play a role in generating the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> effect: <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> attract those with prior preferences for autonomy who are similarly drawn into entrepreneurship. Similarly, ability sorting plays a role: those who ultimately become entrepreneurs may be drawn first to <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> because they offer tighter pay-for-performance links and can subsequently improve their expected earnings by becoming entrepreneurs, or because the skills required for success in <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> are also valuable in entrepreneurship. Evidence suggests that although those with the very least to lose do enter entrepreneurship with greater frequency, opportunity cost has at best a modest role to play in explaining the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> effect. Finally, we interpret evidence that prior experience in <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> predicts positive performance outcomes {{in the early stages of}} entrepreneurship as suggesting that workers in <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> may develop entrepreneurial human capital that makes them better entrepreneurs.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that knowledge spillovers have significant consequences for <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> performance especially in Clusters, past empirical findings have largely ignored the question of whether knowledge spillovers also matter for <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in Non-Clustered regions. Extending previous research, this paper analysis the impact of different types of knowledge spillover mechanisms on <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> performance in Non-Clustered regions. The paper argues that due to the greater disadvantage of Non-Clustered <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in accessing local knowledge resources from research intensive universities and dearth of geographically proximate firms, growth performance of Non-Clustered firms will be specifically significantly influenced by ‘imitation of non-local firms for product development’. Based on a survey of Non-Clustered and Clustered (as control group) technology-based <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in the East of England, and controlling for several factors, the findings suggest that: imitation spillovers have a significant positive impact on employment growth of <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> in Non-Clustered regions. The suggests that Non-Cluster <b>small</b> <b>firm’s</b> boosts their ability to generate for new products that influence their growth through the imitation of non-local competitors. Key policy implication is that: while policies for promoting <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> growth performance through university research appear to be appropriate for Clustered regions, Non-Clustered regions may need to adopt somewhat different policies that allow <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> to imitate technologies of others though appropriate legal means...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach – Relevant recent literature is critiqued concerning <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> and learning, and MBAs and <b>small</b> <b>firms.</b> A description is given of the research methods employed involving a mail questionnaire sent to 600 small and microenterprises eliciting 99 completed questionnaires, and follow-up interviews with a sample of 20 respondents. Findings – Identifies a potential market for an MBA tailor-made to the requirements of a “learning segment” of <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> owner-managers. Finds owner-managers have sophisticated product requirements to be satisfied which would necessitate significant changes in higher education course provision and processes. Research limitations/implications – The research was not concerned with investigating price. Bridging the gap between meeting the educational needs of <b>small</b> <b>firms</b> and higher education provision would help to address issues of social exclusion and potentially enhance the competitive economy. Practical implications – Higher education institutions need to make significant changes to course provision and teaching, learning and assessment processes in order to develop an MBA product appropriate for the <b>small</b> <b>firm</b> market.
