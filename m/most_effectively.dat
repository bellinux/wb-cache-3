5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed <b>most</b> <b>effectively</b> against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth of spin bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, the prominence she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can <b>most</b> <b>effectively</b> contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} over 300 births to captive female gorillas {{revealed}} that older females tend {{to give birth}} to more male offspring as opposed to females under 8 years old.

The technique was revived in the 18th and especially 19th centuries in England and elsewhere, and was <b>most</b> <b>effectively</b> used in French Art Nouveau glass that {{made no attempt to}} follow classical styles.|$|E
25|$|Monarchs are foul tasting and {{poisonous}} due to {{the presence}} of cardenolide aglycones in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. By ingesting a large amount of plants in the genus Asclepias, primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars are able to sequester cardiac glycosides, or more specifically cardenolides, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to digitalis. It has been found that monarchs are able to sequester cardenolides <b>most</b> <b>effectively</b> from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory has}} {{implications}} for understanding {{the different types of}} litter reduction interventions that will <b>most</b> <b>effectively</b> reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.|$|E
