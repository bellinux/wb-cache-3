5000|$|Later {{modifications}} to the EF-4s included the removal of driving controls and windows at one end to permit the relocation of new, improved <b>main</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> into a cooler environment. (The model for this modification was the EP-4s, in which the Milwaukee Shops replaced the operating controls in the [...] "B" [...] end with a steam generator before they entered service.) The loss of this cab was operationally inconsequential, as many Milwaukee electric locomotives were normally turned {{at the end of}} their runs in Avery, Deer Lodge or Harlowton, the road having preferred to maintain only one set of controls even on double-ended units. The most important and final major modification was the provision of multiple unit controls for trailing diesel-electric locomotives. This system was designed in-house. It was not uncommon to see several diesel-electric locomotives being led by, and controlled from, one or two Joes (or a set of Boxcabs) in the 1960s and 70s.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a low cost non-intrusive home energy monitor built {{on top of}} Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) concepts and techniques. NILM solutions are already considered low cost alternatives to the big majority of existing commercial energy monitors but the goal here is to make its cost even lower by using a mini netbook as a whole in one solution. The mini netbook is installed in the homes <b>main</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> and computes power consumption by reading current and voltage from the built-in sound card. At the same time, feedback to the users is provided using the 11 ’’ LCD screen {{as well as other}} built-in I/O modules. Our meter is also capable of detecting changes in power and tries to find out which appliance lead to that change and it is being used as part of an eco-feedback platform that was build to study the long terms of energy eco-feedback in individuals. In this thesis the steps that were taken to come up with such a system are presented, from the basics of AC power measurements to the implementation of an event detector and classifier that was used to disaggregate the power load. In the last chapter results from some validation tests that have been performed are presented in order to validate the experiment. It is believed that such a system will not only be important as an energy monitor, but also as an open system than can be easily changed to accommodate and test new or existing nonintrusive load monitoring techniques.
