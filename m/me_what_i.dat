Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex. I must have been crazy," [...] as well as the line [...] "What was I thinking?"

Coulter explained, [...] "I'd {{met with a}} number of labels and Shock were the only one that asked <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do and what kind of album I wanted to make and who I wanted to work with".

500|$|Sawyer and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) {{were the}} least-liked {{characters}} by viewers {{during the first}} few episodes, because, according to Lindelof, [...] "they were just really obnoxious, bad guys". In later episodes, however, Sawyer and Jin changed to be more likable. Towards the beginning of [...] "Confidence Man", Sawyer is seen reading the novel Watership Down by Richard Adams (this is the book that caused Boone to think that Sawyer took Shannon's inhaler). The novel has numerous similarities to Lost, including [...] "letting go", and building a society. Furthermore, the protagonists of Watership Down are rabbits – a recurring motif in Lost. The episode ends with a montage of various characters performing different activities, featuring the song [...] "I Shall Not Walk Alone", written by Ben Harper and performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama. One lyric from the song is, [...] "I just reach for mother Mary"; Sawyer's mother's name is Mary, and, according to reviewer Therese Odell from the Houston Chronicle, the lyric may be alluding to this. Also, percussionist Ryan McKinnie of The Blind Boys of Alabama said of many members of the group's blindness, [...] "Our disability doesn’t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you do. And what we do is sing good gospel music." [...] This quotation is very similar to the oft-repeated quotation by many characters (especially Locke), [...] "Don't tell <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can't do." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the NBA, Javie developed a reputation early for having a [...] "quick trigger finger", and he {{was believed to be}} one of the league leaders in calling technical fouls during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, [...] "I'd get so mad I'd lose control for two or three minutes, and that's when I would miss calls." [...] Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. [...] Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. [...] While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. [...] As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. [...] In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. [...] Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, [...] "My mentors have made <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me." ...|$|E

500|$|Like some of Madonna's {{previous}} music videos, such as [...] "La Isla Bonita" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer", religious imagery plays a {{big role}} in the music video. In the book Madonna's Drowned Worlds the use of Catholic imagery in the video is discussed. Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández points out that unlike Madonna's previous music videos, much of the religious imagery is associated with the torero, not Madonna, {{due to the fact that}} religious images are a strong part of the bullfighting ritual. It has also been argued that in the video Madonna [...] "subverts the gender structure and masculine subjectivity implicit in traditional bullfighting." [...] This is achieved through the [...] "feminization of the matador and the emphasis on Madonna's character" [...] and also through Madonna's [...] "dominant gaze" [...] as she watches the matador perform." [...] Roger Beebe, one of the authors of Medium Cool: Music Videos from Soundies to Cellphones, noted that the video was an example of [...] "how music, image, and lyrics of a song possesses their own temporality". He explained that the [...] "graceful" [...] nature of the song was contrast to the repetitive scenes in the video, which he felt indicated that the protagonist has long been engaging in the activities, including the [...] "demoralizing sex scenes". In Madonna as Postmodern Myth, author Georges-Claude Guilbert felt the video [...] "defied feminists of the Marilyn Frye and Adrienne Rich variety, who see in the video a disgusting example of passé female submissiveness." [...] Madonna responded to this criticism by stating [...] "I don't believe that any organization should dictate to <b>me</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can and cannot do artistically." [...] Guilbert also noted the usage of religious iconography in the video, especially dubious representation of the Virgin. He explained that most of the times Madonna and the torero make love through the television screen, implying that [...] "one of their purity had to be maintained always".|$|E
