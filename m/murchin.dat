50|$|Julie von Massow, née von Behr, {{was born}} in Pinnow, {{district}} of Greifswald (today part of <b>Murchin)</b> into a Pomeranian noble family, which held high positions in the court and government of Prussia. The visitors to her salon came from the highest echelons of society, and included Bismarck, Alexander von Humboldt, {{and members of the}} noble Stolberg family. She was originally Lutheran, but converted to Catholicism in 1885.|$|E
40|$|The VP 1 -coding {{regions of}} {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} strains from 18 recent European {{outbreaks}} and of 9 strains isolated more than 20 years ago and used in part as vaccines were determined by direct cDNA sequencing. Comparison of the sequences revealed {{that most of the}} isolated outbreak viruses are closely related to the vaccine strains used. Isolates from the Italian epizootic of 1984 to 1985 correspond, for example, to the vaccine strain A 5 Parma 62; the outbreak in 1984 in Bernbeuren, Federal Republic of Germany, was induced by A 5 Allier 60; outbreaks in 1982 in Funen, Denmark, and in <b>Murchin,</b> German Democratic Republic, were caused by O 1 Lausanne 65. Viruses isolated during the 1983 Iberian epizootic show a close relationship to the vaccine strain A 5 Allier 60 but were probably derived from another not yet identified vaccine strain from Spain. Only two minor outbreaks in the Federal Republic of Germany, A Aachen in 1976 and O Wuppertal in 1982, did not correspond to the classical European strains but were obviously introduced from outside. We suggest that nucleotide sequence analysis should be used as a standard method of diagnosis, because when compared with other techniques it more clearly reveals the origin and course of epizootics and offers the possibility of preventing further outbreaks...|$|E
