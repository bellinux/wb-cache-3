40|$|At present, the City of Davis, {{surrounding}} communities, and the UC Davis campus {{are struggling}} {{with many of the}} same transportation problems that plague larger urban centers including increasing traffic, limited parking, and challenges to effective operation of the public transit system. The campus is expecting to grow by 6, 000 students in the next ten years (plus approximately 3, 000 faculty and staff) and is developing a Long-Range Development Plan (LRDP) that will serve to guide this growth. This plan will include housing, traffic control, parking, alternative transportation modes, and interactions with the broader community. The development of the LRDP provides a unique opportunity for the Institute of Transportation Studies-Davis (ITS-Davis), the University of California (UC) -wide partners for Advanced Transit and Highways (PATH) program, and Caltrans to provide input and advice on mobility options that will help the campus accommodate the expected growth while minimizing negative transportation impacts.

An analysis of six case-studies (i. e., cities) showed a degree of disconnect between stated policy aims and implementation in practice, and in some of the cases this difference was substantial. No obvious national contextual factor explaining implementation success was identified: in both contexts the (local) political will and practical tools to ensure transfer of parking capacity to P+R, were the key factors. The overall car restraining effect of P&R hoped for was mostly not achieved - mainly due to transfer from public transport-only trips and from cycling and because overall parking supply across city centres increased...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the need for cross-disciplinary, {{collaborative}} international research that supports implementation of a ‘smart mobility’ for sustainable urban transportation. Progress toward a positive, integrated, and sustainable future for urban transportation will require more than technology. According to Susan Zielinski (2006) there are three frontiers of thinking and practice for Smart mobility, namely: complexity, accessibility and new business models (1). To our view, in addition to Zielinski’s frontiers of thinking there are at least three other fundamental aspects to be considered in order to create a framework for Smart mobility, namely: matching Business and Technology; integrating Spatial Planning with Transportation Planning; promoting a cultural change. Besides, innovations such as Smart Cards, On-Line Traveller Information, Car-Sharing, bundled <b>mobility</b> <b>packages</b> and snappy marketing techniques are coming together and changing the way investors and users think about urban transportation.

40|$|Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is {{entering}} the transportation market. MaaS aims at the full {{integration of the}} existing transportation services and it offers tailored <b>mobility</b> <b>packages</b> to the user. In MaaS ecosystems, on-demand services {{play an important role}} as complement to public transport due to their flexibility. However, to date, most attention has been placed on individual on-demand services. This study focuses on Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) : collective on-demand services. Using an on-line survey, we analysed the characteristics of the respondents who chose different modes of transport among their selected modes. Results find a distinctive pattern in the willingness of users to use different modes, with different levels in what could be considered as a multimodality ladder. The different rungs of it would be: 1 st car (if available), 2 nd public transport, 3 rd DRT and 4 th taxi-like services. This way, a person standing on the third rung would include car, public transport and DRT in their consideration set, but not taxi. This finding suggests that, if implemented in the right way, DRT services can attract a larger number of users than taxi-like services, especially in a MaaS ecosystem where initial barriers to try this service can be lessened.

40|$|The {{advent of}} Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is {{suggested}} {{to represent a}} significant step in the move towards Mobility as a Service (MaaS) networks, in which private vehicle ownership is largely replaced by fleets of on-demand AVs {{as a part of}} a broader, multi-modal <b>mobility</b> <b>package.</b> To maximise the benefits of a shift from the current situation of predominantly private vehicle ownership to a MaaS system, it is desirable that the use of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs) becomes the norm. But just how willing are people to use an SAV with others, particularly strangers? Furthermore, how much might people pay for different AV experiences? Our paper presents a novel willingness-to-pay (WTP) analysis of AV future scenarios, drawn from a detailed survey of 730 travellers appraising four AV “contexts” (privately owned AV, AV-Taxi, Shared-AV, and AV-Bus) in terms of their preferences and WTP for these options. The analysis further examines these in relation to demographic and psychosocial characteristics. These findings are discussed alongside qualitative comments provided by participants, giving additional insight into people’s preferences. Our results identify significant uncertainty about AVs.

40|$|The {{need for}} more {{sustainable}} and integrative planning processes {{as a way of}} dealing with the complexity of urban mobility has been widely recognized. Within the European Union (EU) there has been an enhanced focus on urban mobility solutions where local authorities move away from past ‘silo approaches’ and develop approaches that can stimulate a shift towards cleaner and more sustainable transport modes, in line with the EU’s 2013 Urban <b>Mobility</b> <b>Package</b> and Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs). As people choose to move away from cities to the periphery or to neighboring municipalities, it becomes critical that the organization of urban transport services, including commuter rail, is coordinated within functional urban areas based on travel-to-work patterns and not be limited to a city’s administrative area. International experience suggests that public transport planners must recognize two integration dimensions: (a) integration among all modes and routes comprising the multi-modal public transport network, (b) integration of the public transport offer within a functional urban area, such that the public transport offer matches the mobility requirements of passengers. Successful integration in both dimensions will provide a more customer-friendly experience and make public transport more efficient and cost-effective. The objective of this Report is to assess barriers to fare integration and impediments to integrated service planning. More specifically, it aims to: analyze the current legal framework, review current fare discount policy and public financing of such discounts, identify legal obstacles to fare integration; present examples of European best practice in the area of public transport integration; and provide recommendations to remove barriers to fare and ticketing integration. The World Bank identified six key recommendations aimed at incentivizing public transport integration: i) Introducing uniform statutory fare discount system. ii) Reforming the system for financing statutory fare discounts. iii) Removing barriers to cooperation among different levels of self-government. iv) Strengthening local authorities responsible for transport and creating open integration platforms. v) Protecting PSO Operators from creaming skimming. vi) Promote fare integration. Changing the status quo will require significant changes to the legal environment for public transport aimed at removing barriers to integration. Policy, Organisation Law and Gamin...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} and evaluates {{a business}} model for connected full electric vehicles (FEV) for the European market. Despite a promoting political environment, various barriers {{have thus far}} prevented the FEV from becoming a mass-market vehicle. Besides cost, the most noteworthy of these barriers is represented by range anxiety, a product of FEVs’ limited range, lacking availability of charging infrastructure, and long recharging times. Connected FEVs, which maintain a constant connection to the surrounding infrastructure, {{appear to be a}} promising element to overcome drivers’ range anxiety. Yet their successful application requires a well functioning FEV ecosystem which can only be created through the collaboration of various stakeholders such as original equipment manufacturers (OEM), first tier suppliers (FTS), charging infrastructure and service providers (CISP), utilities, communication enablers, and governments. This thesis explores and evaluates how a business model, jointly created by these stakeholders, could look like, i. e. how stakeholders could collaborate in the design of products, services, infrastructure, and advanced mobility management, to meet drivers with a sensible value proposition that is at least equivalent to that of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. It suggests that this value proposition will be an end- 2 -end package provided by CISPs or OEMs that comprises <b>mobility</b> <b>packages</b> (incl. pay per mile plans, battery leasing, charging and battery swapping (BS) infrastructure) and FEVs equipped with an on-board unit (OBU) combined with additional services targeted at range anxiety reduction. From a theoretical point of view the thesis answers the question which business model framework is suitable {{for the development of a}} holistic, i. e. all stakeholder-comprising business model for connected FEVs and defines such a business model. In doing so the thesis provides the first comprehensive business model related research findings on connected FEVs, as prior works focused on the much less complex scenario featuring only “offline” FEVs...|$|R

This object is a generator that yields {{the position of the}} nodes in each step. For example, to print a 2 -dimensional array with the node positions produced in the first step, call >>> positions = next(rw) >>> print positions You can also iterate over the positions produced in each step: >>> for positions in rw: [...] . print positions [...] . Contact Models The contact models are available in the pymobility. models. contact package. Differently from the <b>mobility</b> <b>package</b> that yield node positions for each time step, the contact models yield a list of node pairs that were in contact at each time step. For example, to create a Dynamic G(n,p) model instance, use the following commands: >>> from pymobility. models. contact import dynamic_gnp >>> m = dynamic_gnp(200, p= 0. 01) This will create a Dynamic G(n,p) model instance with 200 nodes that generates a list of contacts at each time step. The probability of any edge appearing at each step is defined by the parameter p. Now you can iterate over the list of contacts produced in each time step: >>> for contacts in m: [...] . for source, target in contacts: [...] . print (source, target) Simulation and Visualization The script pymobility/simulation. py, under the src directory, contains examples on how to run different models and to plot the points in a simulation area using Matplotlib. To run it, open a shell prompt, go to the src directory and run the following command: python pymobility/simulation. py Contributing If you have a Github account please fork the repository, create a topic branch, and commit your changes.

40|$|AbstractSustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are a core {{element of}} the European Commission's Urban <b>Mobility</b> <b>Package.</b> A bundle of {{measures}} combines infrastructure; clean fuels and vehicles; and soft measures to promote walking, cycling and public transport use. Looking at the problems of cities world-wide, one crucial aspect not (yet) adequately addressed is increasing car-ownership, leading to over-consumption of space in cities creating both congestion and parking problems. The City of Bremen's SUMP, which received the 2014 CIVITAS Award and the 2015 SUMP Award, integrates car sharing as a strategic element to reduce car ownership. The ambitious Car Sharing Action Plan from 2009, the first municipal thematic plan on car sharing, set a target of 20, 000 car sharing users by 2020 and, more important, the replacement of about 6, 000 private cars through the service of car sharing. Annual user surveys in Bremen show that every car sharing car takes 15 private cars off the road. This figure includes only cars that car sharers report giving up after becoming car sharers and does not include car purchases that were avoided by users who may have bought a car if no option had been available. Station-based car sharing, with its wide variety of vehicles and the reliability of pre-reservation (but also the option of spontaneous bookings) has a much higher impact on car ownership than does free-floating car sharing. In its 2010 ‘momorandum’, the European IEE project momo Car Sharing estimated that European cities could be unburdened of the parking needs of 600, 000 cars – end-to-end a row from London to Athens – if other cities applied policies {{similar to those in}} Bremen (and also Switzerland). The potential is huge to improve traffic, the environment and quality of life in European cities. This practitioner's report presents municipal policies and activities undertaken in Bremen (1) to exploit the potential of car sharing (e. g. providing mobility hubs and on-street car sharing stations; integration in new urban developments; multi-modal integration; optimising fleet management, information and awareness), (2) to develop quality requirements and (3) to prepare for future developments (e. g. autonomous transport systems). It also clarifies the different roles of station-based and free-floating car sharing and their potential for different types of cities and towns. The presentation will show – {{from the perspective of a}} municipality – how car sharing can be integrated into both advanced sustainable urban mobility planning and into more efficient urban developments. New urban developments with integrated car sharing, bike sharing and high quality public transport do not need as many car parking spaces as conventional developments, creating potential for reducing costs and improving the quality of urban space...|$|E

New configurations, including small multi-rotor uncrewed aerial systems, fixed- and tilt-wing distributed electric propulsion aircraft, high-speed rotorcraft, hybrid-electric commercial transports, and low-boom supersonic transports, are being made possible through a host of propulsion and airframe technology developments. The resulting noise signatures may be radically different, both spectrally and temporally, {{than those of the}} current fleet. Noise certification metrics currently used in aircraft design do not necessarily reflect these characteristics and therefore may not correlate well with human response.

Fortunately, a new set of tools are available for assessing human perception during the design process in order to affect the final design in a positive manner. The tool chain utilizes system noise prediction methods coupled with auralization and psychoacoustic testing, making possible the inclusion of human response to noise, along with performance criteria and certification requirements, into the aircraft design process.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in eukaryotes depends upon posi-tioning, <b>mobility</b> and <b>packaging</b> of nucleosomes; thus, {{we need the}} detailed information of the human nucleosome core particle (NCP) structure, which could clarify chromatin properties. Here, we report the 2. 5 A ̊ crystal structure of a human NCP. The overall structure is {{similar to those of}} other NCPs reported previously. However, the DNA path of human NCP is remarkably different from that taken within other NCPs with an identical DNA sequence. A comparison of the structural parameters between human and Xenopus laevis DNA reveals that the DNA path of humanNCPconsecutively shifts by 1 bp in the regions of superhelix axis location 5. 0 to 2. 0 and 5. 0 to 7. 0. This alteration of the human DNA path is caused predominantly by tight DNA–DNA contacts within the crystal. It is also likely that the conformational change in the human H 2 B tail induces the local altera-tion of the DNA path. In human NCP, the region with the altered DNA path lacks Mn 2 + ions and the B-factors of the DNA phosphate groups are substantially high. Therefore, in contrast to the histone octamer, the nucleosomal DNA is sufficiently flexible and mobile and can undergo drastic conformational changes, depending upon the environment...|$|R
40|$|This master’s thesis studies Mobility as a Service (MaaS) – {{a recent}} {{phenomenon}} in the Finnish public transportation industry that has gained widespread interest both in Finland and globally. At the core of MaaS are new mobility operators that facilitate interaction between transportation service providers and users by bundling existing services into <b>mobility</b> <b>packages</b> that enable so-called door-to-door travel. This bundling is facilitated by digital platforms, which allow users to compare alternative transportation services and purchase travel chains in one go. The empirical purpose of this master’s thesis was to describe and analyze the concept of Mobility as a Service and its development in Finland. Two primary research questions were asked: (1) What kind of mobility systems are currently emerging around the Mobility as a Service ideology inFinland? (2) How do the emerging mobility systems co-create value with their end users? To this end, two MaaS pilots and two startups were studied. The purpose was on one hand to describe these initiatives at a general level, {{and on the other}} hand to analyze how they co-create value with their end users. The research was conducted as a qualitative, multiple-case study, and the primary data collection method was semi-structured interviews. The theoretical purpose of this research was to bridge two streams of literature: platform theory and Service Science. Both literatures are relevant to studying Mobility as a Service, as both are involved in exploring services and the role of ICT and data in service innovation. Both literatures were reviewed in an effort to find relevant concepts and theory frameworks that could allow creating conceptual links between the two theories. As a result, a theory framework was created that brings together the technological-managerial perspective of platform theory and the value co-creation perspective of Service Science. The framework was then tested through analyzing the MaaS cases. The main empirical finding of this master’s thesis was that the all four MaaS cases can be classified as market platforms. According to platform theory, market platforms facilitate direct interaction between two or more actors that are affiliated with the platform. The MaaS cases co-create value with their end users by facilitating efficient resource exchange and integration between end users and transportation service providers. They do so by providing information about alternatives as well as maps, ticketing and payment tools and other structures that allow the users to view alternatives, plan journeys, and purchase service bundles. The findings are in line with extant platform and Service Science theories. With that being said, the cases are all at pre-market-penetration stage, and overall, MaaS is still mostly an ideology that awaits testing. Empirically, this master’s thesis increases our understanding of existing MaaS platforms and their development. Theoretically, the main contribution was the development of the platform framework that combines platform theory with Service Science...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is {{a generic}} name {{referring}} to optimization problems in transportation, distribution and logistics industry. They mainly focus on serving {{a number of}} customers {{by a number of}} vehicles. Route planning techniques {{is one of the main}} tasks of VRP which aims to find an optimal route from a starting point to a destination on a road map. As road traffic conditions may change during the car journey (e. g., increase/decrease of the congestion level, road incidents etc), the optimal route should be re-evaluated as soon as an update in traffic conditions is available. Choosing an appropriate route planning algorithm among the existing algorithms in the literature to apply it in real road networks is an important task for any transportation application. In this paper, we first present a classification of the different route planning algorithms, and then explain how we compare and analyze their performance when they are applied in real road networks. For the purpose of comparison, we simulate the behavior of these algorithms during runtime using Simulation of Urban <b>Mobility</b> (SUMO) <b>package</b> and TRACI. We have chosen Dijkstra, the most well-known shortest path algorithm, to be the first algorithm to be implemented in SUMO. Upon reception of any traffic conditions update that affects the current optimal route of a car, we use TRACI to re-apply the algorithm and change this cars route accordingly. In the near future, our target is to simulate other algorithms and compare their performance based on the quality of the obtained best route...|$|R
