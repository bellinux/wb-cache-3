50|$|On {{the morning}} of August 8, 1956, {{a fire in the}} mines of Marcinelle {{resulted}} in 262 casualties. At the time of the incident, 274 people were working in the colliery Bois du Cazier, also known as Puits Saint-Charles. A <b>mining</b> <b>wagon</b> incorrectly positioned in the elevator cage struck an oil pipe and electrical cables when the elevator started moving. This caused a fire, which trapped the miners working in the galleries below. Of the 274 people working on that morning, only twelve survived. Most of the victims were immigrants. Among the victims, there were 136 Italians, 95 Belgians, eight Poles, six Greeks, five Germans, five Frenchmen, three Hungarians, one Englishman, one Dutchman, one Russian and one Ukrainian.|$|E
50|$|Jo and Bert {{have made}} good {{progress}} through the old mine tunnels, when they find a green slime trickling down the wall. When Bert touches this, he begins to grow weak, and his hand starts to turn bright green. At Bert's insistence, Jo goes on without him. Dave and the Doctor find Bert, and the Doctor goes on to find Jo. By the time they reunite, Jo has found a vast lake of bright green slime, filled with huge maggot creatures. When the tunnel collapses behind them, they use an old <b>mining</b> <b>wagon</b> to get across the green lake. They then climb a steep shaft, where the Doctor collects a huge egg to take back for experimentation. At {{the top of the}} natural shaft, they find a large pipe, with the insides covered with traces of crude oil waste—meaning that the pipe leads to the Global Chemicals plant.|$|E

50|$|Even in the 16th century, mining {{engineers}} used crude wooden rails {{to facilitate}} the movement of <b>mine</b> <b>wagons</b> steered by hand. In Nottingham, 1603, a tramway was constructed to transport coal from mines near Strelley to Wollaton. Horse-drawn lines were increasingly common by the 18th and early 19th centuries, chiefly to haul bulk materials from mines to canal wharves or areas of consumption.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations of the magnitude and nature of change loads drive of mine shuttle car used to deliver ore to extraction chambers in PAO “Uralkaliy” potash mines. The design of recording complex software “VATUR” developed by the staff of the Mining Electrical Engineering department, Perm National Research Polytechnic University, was described. In the course of research of the drive modes of self-propelled <b>mine</b> <b>wagons</b> measurements of instantaneous values of current and voltage motors were carried out. The values of active and apparent power consumed by electric pumping stations and conveyors of mine shuttle car were calculated. Modes and changes in loads on components and parts drives were studied. It was proved that the operation modes of mine shuttle car motors with increased lift capacity are characterized by a systematic overload. Outdated system controlling the rotational speed of shafts drive motor gives rise to considerable dynamic loads on components of mechanical transmissions for shuttle cars. Significant loss of time causing the reduction in technical performance longwall set of equipment of potash mines arises during the maneuvering operations and unloading ore from shuttle cars. Based on the analysis of load drive graphs and emergency failure statistics the technical solutions were justified to improve the reliability of mine shuttle cars. The recommendations to increase the efficiency of transporting potash in the longwall set of equipment, improving maneuverability of self-propelled cars and reduce downtime for unloading are given...|$|R
5000|$|In Europe {{in former}} times, {{before he could}} become a hewer, the miner {{had to learn to}} be a [...] "sorter boy" [...] (Scheidejunge), {{identifying}} ores and separating the ore from the gangue. After that he would continue his training in the pit itself. Here, he had to learn further skills, initially as a putter (Hundtstößer literally [...] "truck pusher"), transporting material around the <b>mine</b> in <b>wagons.</b> Only afterwards could he learn the skills, as an apprentice hewer (Lehrhäuer), that he would later need as a hewer. This form of training, the acquisition of knowledge by experience, was practised in mining until the First World War.|$|R
5000|$|The Knoxville Iron Company, cofounded by Welsh {{immigrants}} in 1868, began mining coal in the Coal Creek Valley {{in the late}} 1860s, initially hauling the coal from the <b>mines</b> via <b>wagon,</b> and later by railroad {{after the completion of}} a Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad line between Knoxville and Coal Creek (now Lake City) in 1869. In subsequent years, Knoxville Iron and other companies gradually worked their way up the Coal Creek Valley, opening mines in The Wye, Fraterville, and Slatestone Hollow. In 1888, at Senator Calvin Brice's behest, a railroad spur was built connecting Coal Creek with Slatestone Hollow. After this line's completion, the Slatestone Hollow community was renamed [...] "Briceville." ...|$|R
50|$|Hudson was a {{major player}} in setting the {{standards}} for coal haulage. In the 1930s the introduction of practical locomotive haulage in coal <b>mines</b> demanded better <b>wagons</b> than the traditional plain bearing designs. Hudson introduced new designs with pressed steel corrugated bodies with roller bearing wheels. This style of vehicle was ultimately adopted by the National Coal Board as its standard coal haulage vehicle.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1907, a tram began {{operation}} in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners {{would no longer}} have to walk several kilometers through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: bergbanan (funicular), stadsspårvägen (city tramway) and gruvspårvägen (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of [...] and was unique due to the 1-meter gauge, double windows and heated wagons. It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the <b>mine,</b> with <b>wagons</b> bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.|$|R

This also means the {{location}} of Santa Barbara, was 3 miles down river below the fort.|$|R
25|$|By the 1880s {{there was}} a {{management}} team whose salaries were paid quarterly. The chief agent earned £200 per annum, two assistant agents £115 and £100, the foreman (or timekeeper) £75 and the office clerk £37/10/0d. Mining work was still carried out under the bargain system but payments were made every four (or five) weeks. Men employed on the <b>mine</b> transport (filling <b>wagons,</b> driving horses, working at the shafts) as well as timbermen, blacksmiths and surface workers were paid wages at weekly rates.|$|R

50|$|This river {{settlement}} {{originated in}} 1900, {{with the decision}} of the directors of the Quartette Mining Company that it would be more profitable to crush their own ore than freight it 23 miles by wagon to Manvel, then ship it by rail from there to the smelter at Needles. No adequate supply of water being found near their mine, they decided to locate their 20 stamp mill and a cyanide plant on {{the west bank of the}} Colorado River and haul the ore the twelve miles to the mill from the <b>mine</b> by <b>wagon.</b> In May 1901 the company decided to build a 14-mile narrow gauge railroad to haul its ore to the landing. During this period as the mill, steamboat landing and railroad were established, the mine had a post office called Quartette from September 15, 1900, to Sept. 15, 1902.|$|R
5000|$|By 1855, Phineas Banning's wagon trains were {{carrying}} supplies from Los Angeles via Fort Tejon to Fort Miller (in {{what is now}} Fresno County) and for the Kern River gold rush. [...] Several thousand miners participated in the Kern River Gold Rush but most were disappointed. Over the following {{seven or eight years}} other discoveries were made nearby at White River, Keyesville, Owens River, in the Slate Range and in the Coso District that caused other mining booms. These kept the Stockton - Los Angeles Road active, connected with two trails cut across the Sierra Nevada mountains over which pack trains carrying supplies were sent to these new <b>mines.</b> A <b>wagon</b> road was also constructed from Visalia through Keyesville and Walker Pass to Owens Valley. By 1858 there were three stamp mills in the Kern River district, several other stamp mills were constructed a few years later to mill the ore of the Coso and Owens River districts and the freighting of supplies to these places became a major business in Los Angeles and Stockton.|$|R
5000|$|The Homestake deposit was {{discovered}} by Fred and Moses Manuel, Alex Engh and Hank Harney in April 1876, during the Black Hills Gold Rush. A trio of mining entrepreneurs, George Hearst, Lloyd Tevis, and James Ben Ali Haggin, bought it from them for $70,000 the following year. George Hearst arrived at the mine in October 1877, and took active control of the property. Hearst had to haul in all the <b>mining</b> equipment by <b>wagons</b> from the nearest railhead in Sidney, Nebraska. Arthur De Wint Foote worked as an engineer. [...] Despite the remote location, an 80-stamp mill began crushing Homestake ore in July 1878.|$|R
50|$|The Uintah Basin {{includes}} seams of asphaltum remaining where petroleum {{from the}} Green River Formation oil shales seeped into fissures in the overlying sandstone where smaller hydrocarbon molecules were slowly evaporated or digested by aerobic microbes. The remaining large-molecular-weight hydrocarbons formed a lustrous black solid at ambient temperatures, resembling anthracite coal with a brownish dust. Following ignition, the heat generated by combustion causes the burning asphaltum to melt and flow. European Americans began mining this asphaltum in the 1860s, but attempts to burn it in conventional coal stoves were unsuccessful. The asphaltum was named Gilsonite after Samuel Henry Gilson began using {{the material in}} 1886 as a varnish and as electrical insulation. Gilson built a manufacturing plant in Salt Lake City, and began mining operations in 1888. The plant was purchased {{by a group of}} Missouri businessmen who formed the Gilsonite Asphaltum Company. For more than a decade, Gilsonite was hauled from the <b>mines</b> in horse-drawn <b>wagons</b> to be loaded aboard railway cars at Price, Utah. The wagons took ten or eleven days to make a round trip, and the hauling costs encouraged construction of a railroad.|$|R
