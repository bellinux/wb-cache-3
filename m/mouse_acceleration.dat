In this paper, we investigate how sensitive user information leaks from displacements of Bluetooth mouse while our results can be easily extended to mouse using other radio links, which are not encrypted either. We begin with presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data, seemingly harmless, may reveal extremely sensitive information, including text-based passwords clicked through software keyboard and graphical passwords such as Windows 8 picture password. Nonetheless, such a Bluetooth-mouse data leakage attack can be challenging to perform because: (i) packet loss is common for sniffing Bluetooth traffic, and (ii) modern operating systems use complex <b>mouse</b> <b>acceleration</b> algorithms, which introduce noise for reconstructing the on-screen cursor coordinates from sniffed mouse movement data.

40|$|The c-myc {{oncogene}} has {{the unusual}} ability to induce proliferation and apoptosis. Transgenic mice have been generated {{in which the}} expression of Myc is {{under the control of}} an epithelial-specific keratin 5 (K 5) promoter. These mice have increased levels of proliferation and p 53 -dependent apoptosis, and are predisposed to developing spontaneous tumors in epithelial tissues. In this study, various knockout mice were bred to K 5 Myc transgenic mice to identify factors involved in the aberrant apoptosis, hyperproliferation, and spontaneous tumorigenesis present in these mice. Consistent with in vitro studies, Myc-induced, p 53 -dependent apoptosis in transgenic epidermis was found to be partially dependent on p 19 ARF, a p 53 regulator that inhibits mdm 2. Additionally, the rate of tumorigenesis was increased when p 19 ARF was absent in Myc transgenic mice. Consistent with previous reports that some E 2 F family members may function as tumor suppressors, inactivation of either E 2 f 1 or E 2 f 2 was found to accelerate tumor development in the K 5 Myc transgenic <b>mice.</b> <b>Acceleration</b> of tumorigenesis in the absence of E 2 F 1 occurred despite the fact that apoptotic levels were increased in transgenic tissue and tumors null for E 2 f 1, whereas hyperproliferation was unaffected. In contrast, inactivation of E 2 f 2 was found to increase hyperproliferation in the K 5 Myc transgenic mice, while having no effect on apoptosis. The lack of E 2 f 1 in the Myc transgenic mice increased the expression of several p 53 transcription target genes, which may explain the increased apoptosis in these mice. In transgenic epidermis, p 53 is phosphorylated at serine 18, a site of phosphorylation by ATM. Inactivation of ATM in K 5 Myc transgenic mice impaired Myc-induced apoptosis, identifying ATM as having an important role in Myc-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the absence of ATM accelerates tumorigenesis in K 5 -expressing tissues. However, p 53 accumulation and phosphorylation at serine 18 induced by Myc occurs independent of ATM. Therefore, another activity of ATM appears to be important for Myc-induced apoptosis. These findings show that acceleration of tumorigenesis in K 5 Myc transgenic mice, {{as in the case of}} p 53, p 19 ARF, E 2 F 1, E 2 F 2, and ATM absence, does not necessarily correlate with suppression of Myc-induced apoptosis, as seen only when p 53, p 19 ARF or ATM was absent. ...|$|R

Here we exploit the cyclic growth and regression {{activity of the}} murine hair follicle to explore potential nonneuronal functions of neurotrophins in the skin, and analyze the follicular expression and hair growth-modulatory function of BDNF, NT- 4, and their high-affinity receptor, TrkB. The cutaneous expression of BDNF and NT- 4 mRNA was strikingly hair cycle dependent and peaked during the spontaneous, apoptosis-driven hair follicle regression (catagen). During catagen, BDNF mRNA and immunoreactivity, as well as NT- 4 -immunoreactivity, were expressed in the regressing hair follicle compartments, whereas TrkB mRNA and immunoreactivity were seen in dermal papilla fibroblasts, epithelial strand, and hair germ. BDNF or NT- 4 knockout mice showed significant catagen retardation, whereas BDNF-overexpressing <b>mice</b> displayed <b>acceleration</b> of catagen and significant shortening of hair length.

Here, {{we show that}} the development of the disease is dependent on both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II–restricted CD 4 + T cells and IL- 6 family cytokines. In spite of the necessity for CD 4 + T cells, the gp 130 mutation was only required in nonhemtopoietic cells for the disease. The gp 130 mutation resulted in enhanced production of IL- 7. Conditional knockout of STAT 3 in nonlymphoid cells showed that the enhancement of IL- 7 production was dependent on STAT 3 activation by IL- 6 family cytokines. Homeostatic proliferation of CD 4 + T cells was enhanced in gp 130 mutant <b>mice</b> and <b>acceleration</b> of homeostatic proliferation enhanced the disease, whereas the inhibition of homeostatic proliferation suppressed the disease. Anti–IL- 7 antibody treatment inhibited not only the enhanced homeostatic proliferation, but also the disease in gp 130 mutant mice. Thus, our results show that autoimmune disease in gp 130 mutant mice is caused by increased homeostatic proliferation of CD 4 + T cells, which is due to elevated production of IL- 7 by nonhematopoietic cells as a result of IL- 6 family cytokine-gp 130 -STAT 3 signaling...|$|R

In this study, we investigated the effect of endogenous n- 3 PUFAs on fracture healing by measuring femur fracture repair in both fat- 1 transgenic mice and WT mice. Proximal femoral fracture model was established in fat- 1 transgenic mice and WT mice, respectively, and then the fracture was analyzed by using X-ray, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and histological assessment at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after fixation. The results showed that compared with WT mice, fat- 1 <b>mice</b> exhibited <b>acceleration</b> in fracture healing through radiographic and histological analysis (18 – 21 days versus 21 – 28 days postfracture). Meanwhile, X-ray and micro-CT analysis that showed better remodeling callus formation were in the fat- 1 group compared to WT group. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed that endogenous n- 3 PUFAs promoted local endochondral ossification and accelerated the remodeling of calcified calluses after fracture. In conclusion, the present study indicated that endogenously produced n- 3 PUFAs promote fracture healing process and accelerate bone remodeling in mice, and supplementation of n- 3 PUFAs was positively associated with fracture healing...|$|R

Epidemiological {{studies show that}} bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, has been detected in about 90 % of all analyzed human urine samples. In this study, BPA was found {{to increase the severity}} of insulitis and the incidence of diabetes in female non obese diabetic (NOD) mice offspring after transmaternal exposure through the dams' drinking water (0, 0. 1, 1, and 10 mg/l). Both the severity of insulitis in the pancreatic islets at 11 weeks of age and the diabetes prevalence at 20 weeks were significantly increased for female offspring in the highest exposure group compared to the control group. Increased numbers of apoptotic cells, a reduction in tissue resident macrophages and an increase in regulatory T cells were observed in islets prior to insulitis development in transmaternally exposed offspring. The detectable apoptotic cells were identified as mostly glucagon producing alpha-cells but also tissue resident macrophages and betacells. In the local (pancreatic) lymph node neither regulatory T cell nor NKT cell populations were affected by maternal BPA exposure. Maternal BPA exposure may have induced systemic immune changes in offspring, as evidenced by alterations in LPSand ConA-induced cytokine secretion in splenocytes. In conclusion, transmaternal BPA exposure, in utero and through lactation, accelerated the spontaneous diabetes development in NOD <b>mice.</b> This <b>acceleration</b> appeared to be related to early life modulatory effects on the immune system, resulting in adverse effects later in life. © The Author 2013.

We hypothesized that RB is an important mediator of Sertoli cell tumorigenesis in inhibin a knockout (Inha KO) mice. In our previous mouse studies, we found that conditional knockout (cKO) of Rb in Sertoli cells caused progressive Sertoli cell dysfunction. Initially, loss of RB had no gross effect on Sertoli cell function as the mice were fertile with normal testis weights at 6 weeks of age, but by 10 – 14 weeks of age, mutant mice demonstrated severe Sertoli cell dysfunction and infertility. Although double knockout (dKO) of Rb and Inha did not result in exacerbation of the tumorigenic phenotype of Inha-null mice, we found that the dKO <b>mice</b> demonstrate an <b>acceleration</b> of Sertoli cell dysfunction compared to Rb cKO mice.

Sequential changes in cellular (total and differential counts) and biochemical markers of alveolitis (lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], total proteins) were monitored in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and the fibrotic lung response was assessed histologically. An intense but spontaneously resolving alveolitis {{was produced by}} manganese dioxide (MnO 2) and a fibrosing alveolitis was elicited by crystalline silica (DQ 12). Minimal and noninflammatory responses were obtained after instillation of titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and tungsten carbide (WC), respectively. The comparison between the resolving and the fibrosing alveolitis model was especially taken into consideration {{in an attempt to}} identify fibrinolytic changes associated with the development of fibrosis. At the alveolitis stage, similarly increased BALF PA activities were measured in both the resolving and the fibrosing alveolitis models whereas only slight and no PA modifications were noted after administration of TiO 2 and WC, respectively. Persistently (up to 120 d) increased BALF PA activity was selectively associated with the progression to fibrosis (DQ 12), suggesting that PA is involved in the fibrotic process. ELISA measurements demonstrated that the changes in BALF PA activity were exclusively related to changes in urokinase (uPA), not tissue-type PA. A rapid and persisting (up to Day 30) upregulation of cell-associated PA activity occurred after DQ 12, MnO 2, and TiO 2 treatment only. Cellular PA activity was however significantly higher in fibrogenic inflammatory cells recovered from DQ 12 than from MnO 2 -treated mice suggesting that the intensity of cellular PA upregulation may represent an early indicator of the progression to fibrosis. The implication of urokinase in the pathogenesis of silica-induced fibrosis was demonstrated by the use of a uPA knockout <b>mice.</b> The <b>acceleration</b> of the fibrotic process in uPA-deficient compared with the wild type animals demonstrated the contribution of uPA to limit the fibrotic process...|$|R

A Tax transgenic mouse model was utilized to study the contribution of p 53 inactivation to Tax-mediated tumorigenesis. These mice develop primary, peripheral tumors consisting of large granular lymphocytic (LGL) cells, which also infiltrate the lymph nodes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, and lungs. Primary Tax-induced tumors and tumor-derived cell lines exhibited functional inactivation of the p 53 apoptotic pathway; such tumors and tumor cell lines were resistant to an apoptosis-inducing stimulus. In contrast, p 53 mutations in tumors were found to be associated with secondary organ infiltration. Three of four identified mutations inhibited transactivation and apoptosis induction activities in vitro. Furthermore, experiments which involved mating Tax transgenic mice with p 53 -deficient <b>mice</b> demonstrated minimal <b>acceleration</b> in initial tumor formation, but significantly accelerated disease progression and death in mice heterozygous for p 53.

The transgene was specifically expressed in the osteoblasts of transgene positive mice and was absent in the growth plate. Histological analyses at embryonic day 14. 5 demonstrated that the humeri of transgene positive embryos were longer than those isolated from wild-type littermates largely due to an expansion of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer. Acceleration of osteoblast differentiation was observed with greater and more extensive expression of type I collagen and more extensive mineral deposition in the bone collar of transgene positive embryos. Acceleration of vascular invasion was also observed in transgene positive mice. Postnatal analyses of transgenic <b>mice</b> confirmed persistent <b>acceleration</b> of osteoblast differentiation. Targeted expression of Wdr 5 to osteoblasts resulted in earlier activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in the bone collar {{as well as in}} primary calvarial osteoblast cultures.

Here we show that PARP- 1 −/− mice exhibit a reduction of life span and a significant increase of population aging rate. Analysis of noninvasive parameters, including body weight gain, body temperature, estrous function, behavior, and a number of biochemical indices suggests the acceleration of biological aging in PARP- 1 −/− mice. The incidence of spontaneous tumors in both PARP- 1 −/− and PARP- 1 +/+ groups is similar; however, malignant tumors including uterine tumors, lung adenocarcinomas and hepatocellular carcinomas, develop at a significantly higher frequency in PARP- 1 −/− mice than PARP- 1 +/+ mice (72 % and 49 %, resp.; <. 05). In addition, spontaneous tumors appear earlier in PARP- 1 −/− mice compared to the wild type group. Histopathological studies revealed a wide spectrum of tumors in uterus, ovaries, liver, lungs, mammary gland, soft tissues, and lymphoid organs in both groups of the mice.

Based {{on the knowledge}} that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression {{is necessary for the}} embryonic development of hair follicles, and that anagen in the postnatal cycling follicle has morphologic similarities to the epithelial invagination process in embryonic skin, we hypothesized that localized, but transient, enhanced expression of the Shh gene in postnatal skin would accelerate initiation of anagen in the hair follicle cycle, with concomitant accelerated hair growth. To assess this concept, an E 1 – adenovirus vector, AdShh, was used to transfer the murine Shh cDNA to skin of postnatal day 19 C 57 BL/ 6 mice. The treated skin showed increased mRNA expression of Shh, Patched (the Shh receptor), and Gli 1 (a transcription factor in the Shh pathway). In mice receiving AdShh, but not in controls, acceleration into anagen was evident, since hair follicle size and melanogenesis increased and the hair-specific keratin ghHb- 1 and the melanin synthesis–related tyrosinase mRNAs accumulated. Finally, C 57 BL/ 6 <b>mice</b> showed marked <b>acceleration</b> of the onset of new hair growth in the region of AdShh administration to skin 2 weeks after treatment, but not in control vector–treated or untreated areas. After 6 months, AdShh-treated skin showed normal hair and normal skin morphology. Together, these observations are consistent with the concept that upregulation of Shh activity in postnatal skin functions as a biologic switch that induces resting hair follicles to enter anagen with consequent hair growth...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{expression}} of AKT {{has been noted}} in {{a significant percentage of}} primary human breast cancers, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} PTEN/PI 3 K pathway deregulation. To investigate the mechanistic basis of the AKT gain of functiondependent mechanisms of breast tumorigenesis, we explored the phenotype induced by activated AKT transgenes in a quantitative manner. We generated several transgenic mice lines expressing different levels of constitutively active AKT in the mammary gland. We thoroughly analyzed the preneoplastic and neoplastic mammary lesions of these mice and correlated the process of tumorigenesis to AKT levels. Finally, we analyzed the impact that a possible senescent checkpoint might have in the tumor promotion inhibition observed, crossing these lines to mammary specific p 53 (R 172 H) mutant expression, and to p 27 knock-out mice. We analyzed the benign, premalignant and malignant lesions extensively by pathology and at molecular level analysing the {{expression of}} proteins involved in the PI 3 K/AKT pathway and in cellular senescence. Our findings revealed an increased preneoplastic phenotype depending upon AKT signaling which was not altered by p 27 or p 53 loss. However, p 53 inactivation by R 172 H point mutation combined with myrAKT transgenic expression significantly increased the percentage and size of mammary carcinoma observed, but was not sufficient to promote full penetrance of the tumorigenic phenotype. Molecular analysis suggest that tumors from double myrAKT;p 53 (R 172 H) <b>mice</b> result from <b>acceleration</b> of initiated p 53 (R 172 H) tumors and not from bypass of AKT-induce...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 10 % of {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis (ALS) {{cases are}} familial (FALS), and ∼ 25 % of FALS cases are caused by mutations in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD 1). Mutant (MT) SOD 1 {{is thought to be}} pathogenic because it misfolds and aggregates. A number of transgenic mice have been generated that express different MTSOD 1 s as transgenes and exhibit an ALS-like disease. Although one study found that overexpression of human wild-type (WT) SOD 1 did not affect disease in G 85 R transgenic mice, more recent reports claim that overexpression of WTSOD 1 in other MTSOD 1 transgenic mice hastened disease, raising a possibility that the effect of WTSOD 1 overexpression in this FALS mouse model is mutant-specific. In order to clarify this issue, we studied the effect of WTSOD 1 overexpression in a G 85 R transgenic mouse that we recently generated. We found that G 85 R/WTSOD 1 double transgenic <b>mice</b> had an <b>acceleration</b> of disease onset and shortened survival compared with G 85 R single transgenic mice; in addition, there was an earlier appearance of pathological and immunohistochemical abnormalities. The spinal cord insoluble fraction from G 85 R/WTSOD 1 mice had evidence of G 85 R–WTSOD 1 heterodimers and WTSOD 1 homodimers (in addition to G 85 R homodimers) with intermolecular disulfide bond cross-linking. These studies suggest that WTSOD 1 can be recruited into disease-associated aggregates by redox processes, providing an explanation for the accelerated disease seen in G 85 R mice following WTSOD 1 overexpression, and suggesting the importance of incorrect disulfide-linked protein as key to MTSOD 1 toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Human type 1 {{diabetes}} is an autoimmune disease that results from the autoreactive destruction of pancreatic b cells by T cells. Antigen presenting cells including dendritic cells and macrophages are required to activate and suppress antigen-specific T cells. It {{has been suggested that}} antigen uptake from live cells by dendritic cells via scavenger receptor class A (SR-A) may be important. However, the role of SR-A in autoimmune disease is unknown. In this study, SR-A 2 / 2 nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice showed significant attenuation of insulitis, lower levels of insulin autoantibodies, and suppression of diabetes development compared with NOD mice. We also found that diabetes progression in SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice treated with low-dose polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) was significantly accelerated compared with that in disease-resistant NOD mice treated with low-dose poly(I:C). In addition, injection of high-dose poly(I:C) to mimic an acute RNA virus infection significantly accelerated diabetes development in young SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice compared with untreated SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice. Pathogenic cells including CD 4 +CD 25 + activated T cells were increased more in SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice treated with poly(I:C) than in untreated SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice. These results suggested that viral infection might accelerate diabetes development even in diabetes-resistant subjects. In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that diabetes progression was suppressed in SR-A 2 / 2 NOD <b>mice</b> and that <b>acceleration</b> of diabetes development could be induced in young mice by poly(I:C) treatment even in SR-A 2 / 2 NOD mice. These results suggest that SR-A on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells may play a...|$|R
40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} acceleration in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice through coxsackievirus B 4 (CVB 4) infection {{requires a}} preexisting {{critical mass of}} autoreactive T cells in pancreatic islets, {{and in the absence}} of this insulitic threshold, CVB 4 infection leads to long-term disease protection. To understand this acceleration and protection process, we challenged 8 - and 12 -week-old NOD mice containing a disruption in interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) or gamma interferon (IFN-γ) genes (NOD IL- 4 −/− and NOD IFN-γ−/−, respectively) with a diabetogenic, pancreatropic Edwards strain of CVB 4. The elimination of IL- 4 did not alter the rate of insulitis or diabetes development in NOD mice, while the elimination of IFN-γ delayed these events several weeks. CVB 4 infection in 8 -week-old mice only significantly accelerated the onset of diabetes in a subset of standard, but not IL- 4 - or IFN-γ-deficient, NOD mice. Long-term diabetes protection was established in standard NOD mice as well as in the NOD IFN-γ−/− mice that did not rapidly develop disease following CVB 4 infection at 8 weeks of age. When mice were infected at 12 weeks of age, the onset of diabetes was accelerated in NOD IL- 4 −/− <b>mice,</b> while neither <b>acceleration</b> nor long-term protection was elicited in NOD IFN-γ−/− mice. No differences were observed in the kinetics of CVB 4 clearance in pancreases from NOD, NOD IL- 4 −/−, and NOD IFN-γ−/− mice. Collectively, these results suggest that at the insulitis threshold at which CVB 4 infection can first accelerate the onset of diabetes in NOD mice, IL- 4 as well as IFN-γ contributes to this pathogenic process. The protective mechanism against diabetes elicited in NOD mice infected with CVB 4 prior to the development of a critical threshold level of insulitis requires neither IL- 4 nor IFN-γ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring hair {{follicle}} (HF) morphogenesis, p 75 neurotrophin receptor (p 75 NTR) reportedly {{is the first}} growth factor receptor found to be expressed by those fibroblasts that later develop into the dermal papilla (DP) of the HF. However, the functional role of p 75 NTR in HF morphogenesis is still unknown. Studying HF development in fetal and neonatal C 57 BL/ 6 murine back skin, we show that p 75 NTR-immunoreactivity (IR) is prominently expressed by DP fibroblasts {{as well as by}} skin nerves during the early steps of HF development. In contrast, p 75 NTR-IR disappears from the DP in the fully developed HF and it is expressed only in the epithelial outer root sheath of the HF. Compared to age-matched wild-type animals, p 75 NTR knockout (−/−) <b>mice</b> show significant <b>acceleration</b> of HF morphogenesis, and DP fibroblasts of p 75 NTR knockout mice show reduced proliferative activity in situ, indicating alterations in their transition from proliferation to differentiation. Although no significant differences in the expression of adhesion molecules (NCAM), selected morphogens (TGFβ- 2, HGF/SF, FGF- 2, KGF), or their receptors (TGFβR-II, m-met, FGFR- 1) were seen between DP of p 75 NTR knockout and wild-type mice, p 75 NTR mutants showed a prominent upregulation of FGFR- 2, a high-affinity receptor for KGF, in both follicular DP and epithelium. Furthermore, the administration of anti-KGF neutralizing antibody significantly inhibited acceleration of HF morphogenesis in p 75 NTR knockout mice in vivo. These observations suggest that p 75 NTR plays an important role during HF morphogenesis, functioning as a receptor that negatively controls HF development, most likely via alterations in DP fibroblast proliferation/differentiation and via downregulation of KGF/FGFR- 2 signaling in the HF...|$|R
40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of end-stage renal failure, but the factors responsible for the development of diabetic nephropathy have not been fully elucidated. We examined the effect of deletion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace 2) gene on diabetic kidney injury. Ace 2 −/− mice were crossed with Akita mice (Ins 2 WT/C 96 Y), a model of type 1 diabetes mellitus, and four groups of mice were studied at 3 months of age: Ace 2 +/yIns 2 WT/WT, Ace 2 −/yIns 2 WT/WT, Ace 2 +/y Ins 2 WT/C 96 Y, and Ace 2 −/yIns 2 WT/C 96 Y. Ace 2 −/y Ins 2 WT/C 96 Y mice exhibited a twofold increase in the urinary albumin excretion rate compared with Ace 2 +/yIns 2 WT/C 96 Y mice despite similar blood glucose levels. Ace 2 −/yIns 2 WT/C 96 Y mice were the only group to exhibit increased mesangial matrix scores and glomerular basement membrane thicknesses compared with Ace 2 +/yIns 2 WT/WT mice, accompanied by increased fibronectin and α-smooth muscle actin immunostaining in the glomeruli of Ace 2 −/y Ins 2 WT/C 96 Y mice. There were no differences in blood pressure or heart function to account for the exacerbation of kidney injury. Although kidney levels of angiotensin (Ang) II were not increased in the diabetic mice, treatment with an Ang II receptor blocker reduced urinary albumin excretion rate in Ace 2 −/yIns 2 WT/C 96 Y <b>mice,</b> suggesting that <b>acceleration</b> of kidney injury in these mice is Ang II-mediated. We conclude that ACE 2 plays a protective role in the diabetic kidney, and ACE 2 is an important determinant of diabetic nephropathy...|$|R
40|$|The selenoprotein Phospholipid Hydroperoxide Glutathione Peroxidase (PHGPx/GPx 4) is {{an enzyme}} unique {{among the various}} GPxs, because {{it is able to}} use protein thiols, beside glutathione, The GPx 4 gene encodes for three isoforms having {{different}} subcellular localization, being located in the mitochondria (mGPx 4), in the cytosol (cGPx 4) and in the nucleus (nGPx 4), each having distinct functions. The mGPx 4 is important to male fertility, as proven by the structural abnormalities of sperm tails from KO mice specifically lacking this isoform, which make these mutants infertile. As for the nuclear isoform, nGPx 4 -KO mice are fertile but show impaired nuclear condensation of sperm isolated from the caput epididymis, suggesting a role in chromatin stability. To gain more insight into the functions of nGPx 4, we first investigated the subnuclear localization of this form in both COS- 1 cells overexpressing nGPx 4 and mouse male germ cells at different steps of maturation (round spermatids and epididymal spermatozoa). We performed both biochemical and morphological analyses and found that nGPx 4 was localized {{at the level of the}} nuclear matrix. To test the functional role in chromatin dynamics sperm isolated from the caput and the cauda epididymides from WT and nGPx 4 -KO mice were subjected to an in vitro chromatin decondensation assay. Our results show that nGPx 4 -KO mice sperm decondensed earlier than those from WT at all stages of epididymal maturation, providing conclusive evidence that nGPx 4 is required for a correct sperm chromatin remodelling. We next addressed the issue whether the sperm nuclear structure instability caused by the lack of nGPx 4 might impact on the early events occurring after fertilization. In "in vitro" fertilization experiments, we revealed that, compared to WT, nGPx 4 -KO <b>mice</b> showed an <b>acceleration</b> of sperm nuclear decondensation, confirming the results previously obtained...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that galectin- 1 (GAL- 1) and galectin- 3 (GAL- 3) {{are involved in}} the process of axonal regeneration after injury and the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies, but the precise roles of these galectins in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) remain unclear. In this paper, we summarized the distribution and possible functions of GAL- 1 and GAL- 3 in the PNS at mature stages under normal and pathological conditions. Predominant expression of GAL- 1 and GAL- 3 in isolectin B 4 (IB 4) -binding small non-peptidergic sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) accords with the involvement of these molecules in nociceptive and thermoceptive functions and GDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Up-regulation of GAL- 1 mRNA/protein in the neurons and Schwann cells upon peripheral nerve injury suggests its active participation in axonal regeneration; both GAL- 1 in the reduced and oxidized forms appear to be key molecules for normal onset of Wallerian degeneration and subsequent neurite outgrowth, but the latter lacks lectin activity and may promote the process by stimulating macrophages rather than directly acting on neurons. GAL- 3 deficient <b>mice</b> exhibited the <b>acceleration</b> in the process of Wallerian degeneration, but there is room for argument on its pathological roles in axonal regeneration. Up-regulation of GAL- 3 protein in immortalized Schwann cells IFRS 1 under diabetic conditions and its cytoprotective functions on the cells suggest that it may act as a factor against the progression of diabetic neuropathy, but further evidence is needed to support this idea. All these findings have shed light on both physiological and pathological roles of GAL- 1 and GAL- 3 in the PNS, and further evidence will be helpful to develop novel strategies for functional restoration after peripheral nerve injury and therapeutic efficacy against diabetic and other neuropathies...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe human neocortex {{differs from}} that of other great apes in several notable regards, {{including}} altered cell cycle, prolonged corticogenesis, and increased size [1 – 5]. Although these evolutionary changes most likely contributed to the origin of distinctively human cognitive faculties, their genetic basis remains almost entirely unknown. Highly conserved non-coding regions showing rapid sequence changes along the human lineage are candidate loci for the development and evolution of uniquely human traits. Several studies have identified human-accelerated enhancers [6 – 14], but none have linked an expression difference to a specific organismal trait. Here we report the discovery of a human-accelerated regulatory enhancer (HARE 5) of FZD 8, a receptor of the Wnt pathway implicated in brain development and size [15, 16]. Using transgenic mice, we demonstrate dramatic differences in human and chimpanzee HARE 5 activity, with human HARE 5 driving early and robust expression at the onset of corticogenesis. Similar to HARE 5 activity, FZD 8 is expressed in neural progenitors of the developing neocortex [17 – 19]. Chromosome conformation capture assays reveal that HARE 5 physically and specifically contacts the core Fzd 8 promoter in the mouse embryonic neocortex. To assess the phenotypic consequences of HARE 5 activity, we generated transgenic mice in which Fzd 8 expression is under control of orthologous enhancers (Pt-HARE 5 ::Fzd 8 and Hs-HARE 5 ::Fzd 8). In comparison to Pt-HARE 5 ::Fzd 8, Hs-HARE 5 ::Fzd 8 <b>mice</b> showed marked <b>acceleration</b> of neural progenitor cell cycle and increased brain size. Changes in HARE 5 function unique to humans thus alter the cell-cycle dynamics of a critical population of stem cells during corticogenesis and may underlie some distinctive anatomical features of the human brain...|$|R
