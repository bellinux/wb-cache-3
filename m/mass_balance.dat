5|$|The <b>mass</b> <b>balance,</b> or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in <b>mass</b> <b>balance.</b> A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.|$|E
5000|$|Mass balancing: the {{aileron control}} system is <b>mass</b> <b>balanced,</b> with {{integral}} counterweights inside the wings. The ailerons themselves are also <b>mass</b> <b>balanced</b> in the longer-span versions, {{with up to}} 1.5 kg of lead added to the leading edges of each control surface.

5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may {{have a significant impact on}} the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> and are retreating.|$|E
25|$|Crucial to the {{survival}} of a glacier is its <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> or surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> (SMB), the difference between accumulation and ablation (sublimation and melting). Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, causing changes in the surface <b>mass</b> <b>balance.</b> Changes in <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> control a glacier's long-term behavior and are the most sensitive climate indicators on a glacier. From 1980–2012 the mean cumulative mass loss of glaciers reporting <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> to the World Glacier Monitoring Service is −16 m. This includes 23 consecutive years of negative mass balances.|$|E

25|$|The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) noted, {{it is hard}} {{to measure}} the <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> precisely, but most results {{indicate}} accelerating mass loss from Greenland during the 1990s up to 2005. Assessment of the data and techniques suggests a <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> for the Greenland Ice Sheet ranging between growth of 25 Gt/yr and loss of 60 Gt/yr for 1961 to 2003, loss of 50 to 100 Gt/yr for 1993 to 2003 and loss at even higher rates between 2003 and 2005.|$|E
25|$|Glacier <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> is {{measured}} {{once or twice}} annually on numerous stakes on the several ice caps in Iceland by the National Energy Authority.

Profiles of <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> (pit and stake) have been established on the eastern and south-western side of Hofsjökull since 1989. Similar profiles have been assessed on the Tungnaárjökull, Dyngjujökull, Köldukvíslarjökull and Brúarjökull outlet glaciers of Vatnajökull since 1992 and the Eyjabakkajökull outlet glacier since 1991.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941 flutter was a {{familiar}} engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's empennage was completely skinned in aluminum rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter. To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> {{above and below the}} elevator, though the P-38 already had large <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote [...] "the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions." [...] The external <b>mass</b> <b>balances</b> did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.|$|R

25|$|Glacier <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> {{studies have}} been ongoing in New Zealand since 1957. Tasman Glacier has been studied since then by the New Zealand Geological Survey and later by the Ministry of Works, {{measuring}} the ice stratigraphy and overall movement. However, even earlier fluctuation patterns were documented on the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers in 1950. Other glaciers on the South Island studied include Ivory Glacier since 1968, while on the North Island, glacier retreat and <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> {{research has been conducted}} on the glaciers on Mount Ruapehu since 1955.

25|$|The {{health of}} a glacier is usually {{assessed}} by determining the glacier <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> or observing terminus behavior.

25|$|Recent {{global warming}} has caused {{mountain}} glaciers {{and the ice}} sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt and global sea level to rise.

25|$|Glaciers are {{considered}} among the most sensitive indicators of climate change. Their size is determined by a <b>mass</b> <b>balance</b> between snow input and melt output.
