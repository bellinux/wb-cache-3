The project examined bait for non-native invertebrate animals, macroalgae (also known as seaweeds), and harmful, toxin-producing <b>microalgae.</b> Bait <b>was</b> <b>purchased</b> from retail bait shops at locations ranging from northeastern Long Island Sound along the Connecticut shoreline to the southwestern part of the Sound in Long Island. Using a combination of visual and microscopic inspection, and sophisticated molecular biological techniques to detect the presence of microalgal cells, the study questioned whether (i) non-native organisms were being imported via bait worms, and if so whether; (ii) non-native organisms vary according to purchase location, or; (iii) time of year. Overall, 14 species of macroalgae, two species of harmful microalgae (Alexandrium fundyense, and Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries), and 23 different categories of invertebrate animals were discovered among the wormweed. Only one of the microalgal species was not native to Long Island Sound. Overall, location (eastern vs. western, northern vs. southern Long Island Sound) did not affect the number of algal or invertebrate species. Temperature did affect algal diversity and abundance, however, both in post-collection incubation (5 ° 3 ̆c 15 ° = 25 °) and seasonally (summer produced highest numbers). Invertebrates were most abundant in summer as well. The Gulf of Maine now harbors a diverse suite of non-native organisms. These may be exported to other areas of the U.

In addition to potential ecological impacts associated with the import of non-native organisms, economic harm is also possible. For example, commercial shellfishing beds may be closed when harmful microalgae bloom in coastal waters. With ca. 470 retail bait shops in NY and CT, the chances of introduction of harmful non-natives is not trivial.

They can store high amounts of neutral lipids (bioil), carbohydrates (mainly starch), carotenoids (such as lutein, astaxanthin, beta-carotene), proteins and other molecules. Productions of lipids and carbohydrates have recently received an increasing interest for biofuel production, while proteins, carotenoids and other minor products are usable as feed additives and nutraceutical compounds. Biofuel production from <b>microalgae</b> <b>is</b> not yet economically sustainable, {{while there are}} different industrial plants {{in the world for}} the production of high values chemicals as carotenoids. Starch production from <b>microalgae</b> has <b>been</b> investigated mainly for the production of biofuels (e. g. bioethanol) by successive fermentation. However, purified starch can be used for other aims such as the production of bioplastics. Superior plants as corn, potato and wheat are currently used for this purpose. However, there are different environmental and economic issues related to the use of fertile lands and edible plants for these kinds of productions. Microalgae can solve these social and ethical issues because they can grow on nonfertile lands and also reach starch productivity per hectare higher than plants. In this work, the production of starch and carotenoids from Scenedesmus sp. microalgal strain is reported. A two-stage process has been developed in order to reduce operative and investment costs.

This has been supported by a report published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) which stated that under a controlled environment, <b>microalgae</b> <b>are</b> capable of producing 40 % surplus oil for biodiesel per unit area of land as compared to crops such as palm seed or sunflower. <b>Microalgae</b> <b>are</b> being cultivated for the generation of biomass for biofuels; however, microalgae require nutrients to grow and with growing water scarcity issues {{there is a need for}} an economical growth medium.

One of the most promising sources of oil for biodiesel production <b>are</b> <b>microalgae.</b> They <b>are</b> unicellular or colonial photosynthetic organisms, with permanently increasing industrial application in the production of not only chemicals and nutritional supplements but also biodiesel. Biodiesel productivity per hectare of cultivation area can be up to 100 times higher for microalgae than for oil crops. Also, microalgae can grow in a variety of environments that are often unsuitable for agricultural purposes. Microalgae oil content varies in different species and can reach up to 77 % of dry biomass, while the oil productivity by the phototrophic cultivation of <b>microalgae</b> <b>is</b> up to 122 mg/l/d. Variations of the growth conditions and the implementation of the genetic engineering can induce the changes in the composition and productivity of microalgal oil. Biodiesel from <b>microalgae</b> can <b>be</b> produced in two ways: by transesterification of oil extracted from biomass or by direct transesterification of algal biomass (so called in situ transesterification). This paper reviews the curent status of microalgae used for the production of biodiesel including their isolation, cultivation, harvesting and conversion to biodiesel. Because of high oil productivity, microalgae will play a significant role in future biodiesel production. The advantages of using microalgae as a source for biofuel production are increased efficiency and reduced cost of production. Also, microalgae do not require a lot of space for growing and do not have a negative impact on the global food and water supplies.
