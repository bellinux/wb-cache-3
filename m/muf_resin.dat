30|$|The {{effect of}} {{melamine}} content in melamine-urea-formaldehyde (<b>MUF)</b> <b>resins</b> on the formaldehyde emission and resin structure was investigated using six <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> synthesized with different F/(M + U) and M/U molar ratios. The formaldehyde emission from the plywood decreased as the F/(M + U) molar ratio decreased and the M/ U molar ratio increased. In addition, the bond performance was enhanced as the M/U molar ratio {{increased in the}} <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> with a fixed F/(M + U) molar ratio. Quantitative solution 13 C-NMR spectra of <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> revealed that the <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> with a high melamine content consisted of more highly branched crosslinkage structure and free melamine compared to the resins with low melamine contents. Furthermore, solid-state 13 C CP-MAS NMR spectra of cured <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> proved that more methylol groups, dimethylene ether, and branched methylene structures {{were present in the}} <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> with a higher F/(M + U) molar ratio, leading to increased bond strength and formaldehyde emission. There is {{no significant difference in the}} linkage structure of the cured resins with the same F/(M + U) and different M/U molar ratios except the ratios of carbonyl carbon of urea and triazine carbon of melamine. Therefore, the lower formaldehyde emission from cured <b>MUF</b> <b>resins</b> with a higher M/U molar ratio might be ascribed to the stronger linkages between triazine carbons of melamine than those of urea carbons. Consequently, the melamine contributed to strong crosslinking linkages in the cured resin structures, leading to lower formaldehyde emission and better bond performance.|$|R

The present aim {{of the study was}} to explore the usage of nanoclay Nanomer PGV against White rot fungus in particle board. Methodology : For the study, eight single layer particle board particle board made using (0. 25 and 0. 5 % wt) nanoclay reinforced Urea formaldehyde resin (UF) and melamine urea formaldehyde resin (MUF) was compared with control boards and boards made using 0. 5 % boric acid. Dispersion of nanoclay in the urea formaldehyde and melamine urea formaldehyde resin was done by mechanical mixing and it was characterised using Xray diffraction. Efficacy of nanoclay against white rot fungus was studied using Agar block method as per IS: 4873. Results:The intensity peak of Nanoclay disappeared after being dispersed into the UF resin and <b>MUF</b> <b>resin</b> by mechanical mixing. This indicated that the UF resin or <b>MUF</b> <b>resin</b> was able to enter the interlayer space of Nanomer PGV, hence exfoliated.

These are stabilized {{by the presence of}} strong anions such as SO 24 and HSO 4, that is, “hexamine sulfate. ” The effect of hexamine sulfate was closely linked to the strong buffering action it has on <b>MUF</b> <b>resins.</b> Its role is mainly to induce regularity of the reaction and the stability of conditions during resin networking, due to the buffer. Shifting of the polycondensation a degradation equilibrium to the left appeared to be the determinant factor. This was a consequence of maintaining a higher, constant pH during curing, due to the buffer action. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) increases the curves of hexamine sulfate-catalyzed <b>MUF</b> <b>resins,</b> confirming this trend. The resins are faster curing than when catalyzed by ammonium sulfate. The effect is valid within the narrow buffering range of pH’s used for resin hardening. Polycondensation is far too slow to occur at a much higher pH, and degradation is, instead, more predominant at much lower pH’s. The network formed is then more crosslinked and less tainted by degra- dation when curing occurs within the correct pH range. The result is a much better performance of the wood board after water attack. The effects induced by hexamine sulfate effects are of longer duration than those of other potential buffers. This is due to the hexamine sulfate heat stability under standard hot curing conditions of the resin. Alternate systems were found and shown to have a comparable effect...|$|R

The contact angle measurements of the modified resins indicated better wetting over wood substrates while their active participation in the condensation and crosslinking reactions with wood substrates was ensured with thermomechanical analysis (TMA).

UF composite resin system of the ignition times (214  s) was longer than MF resin’s (131  s). It suggested the mass ratio of M in melamine-IFR composite had a negative impact on the fire retardancy. Guo [10] believed that a higher char yield of intumescent fire-retardant foam layer of carbon foam was more homogeneous and foam walls were thick, and the fire-retardant effect was good. But the increase of the contents of melamine in the resin’s fire-retardant composite could decrease the char yield, and increase the viscosity [10 – 12].

Thermomechanical analyses (TMA) tests were carried out {{as an indication of}} the final strength of the adhesive systems revealed by the elasticity modulus (MOE). The MOE results have demonstrated the best mechanical resistance values in 40 / 60 lignin/mimosa tannin proportion with respectively 3. 422 and 3. 347 (MPa), for CIMV and LN-T-CO 2 - 2, and 2. 122 (MPa) for 50 / 50 proportion. Particleboards were prepared and the internal bond (IB) tests were carried out according to the European Standard EN 312. The IB tests confirmed the TMA results. The higher mechanical results of the IB were 0. 43 and 0. 53 (MPa), for CIMV and LN-T-CO 2 - 2 lignin in a 40 / 60 lignin/mimosa tannin proportion. They were classified as interior panel P 2 in according with the standard request EN- 312. Free-formaldehyde was determined through the flask method EN 717 - 3. Particleboards prepared with these natural adhesive resins registered emissions at least 87 and 75 % lower than the commercial UF and <b>MUF</b> adhesive <b>resins.</b> The panels were classified as E 0...|$|R
40|$|Four tyoes of {{commercial}} adhensives, ureaformaldehyde resin adhensives (UF 9, malamine-urea formaldehyde copolymer <b>resin</b> adhensives (<b>MUF),</b> phenol firmaldehyde <b>resin</b> adhensives (PF) and diphenylmethane diisocyanate adhensives (MDI) were studied, by first using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) alone, {{and then by}} using thermogravimetric analysis with infrared spectrometry (TGA-IR). Results obtained from the TGA tests found that MDI exhibited the highest initial decomposotion at a temperature of 297 ℃ and better overall thermo-stability than one other types of adhensives. PF and MDI provided a better yield of char at about 24. 88 and 20. 61 wt%, respectively, at 850 ℃. This showed that their thermal behavior was better than that of UF (5. 40 wt%) or MUF (6. 99 wt%). The IR response of all adhensives in the TGA-IR tests showed that the absorbance of UF, MUF and MDI was {{higher than that of}} PF; this indicated that the concentration of evolved species of PF was less than that of MDI, and less than that of urea copolymer series adhensives, UF and MUF. It has been suggested that PF is the most environmentally friendly adhensive, because it has the least environmental impact when used in many industrial and domestic applications, such as for structural mebers in furniture or architecture. These results, when compared to the molecular structures of the adhensives, enabled us to point out the kinds of evolved species (funcianal bases or the change in molecular structures) for referencing the thermo-degradation processes of the adhensives. Using TGA-IR, to analyze the thermal behavior of 4 types of adhensives, in combination with TGA analysis, has led to useful results, involving the identification of pyrolysis products...|$|R
40|$|Wood base {{industries}} {{are among the}} dominant players in Malaysia economic activities. In this research, by using Response Surface Method (RSM), studies of bonding between Disodium Tetraborate Decahydrate (DTD) pesticide and various formulation of wood adhesive i. e., Melamine-Urea-Formaldehyde (<b>MUF)</b> <b>resin</b> is carried out. The RSM formulated twenty-five MUF formulations, consisting combination of different amount of formaldehyde, melamine, urea added in stage- 1 and stage- 2 of resin synthesis and DTD pesticide. The liquid products of resin are then hardened and tested using Fourier Transformation Infra-Red (FTIR) and visible spectrophotometer (VIS), to analyse the bonding of the resin and pesticide. The data from the FTIR and VIS analysis were then compiled and analysed using Response Surface Method. The results show that, different amount of the formaldehyde, melamine, urea and DTD pesticide, gives specific impact {{to the strength of}} MUF resin-pesticide bonding...|$|E
