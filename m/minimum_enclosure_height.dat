40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to characterize the conjugate heat transfer due to a square flush heat source mounted {{at the center of}} a square horizontal plate in a small horizontal enclosure. The plate area was six times larger than the heat source area. Three different plates with heat source facing upwards were considered: a 25 mm balsa wood plate which provided a nearly adiabatic surface, a 1. 57 mm thick FR- 4 plate with no copper, and a 1. 57 mm thick FR- 4 plate with a single layer of 0. 036 mm thick copper cladding on source side. The back of the board was insulated for all cases. The experimental exploration included measurement of heat transfer coefficient over the heat source, plate surface temperature distribution and temperature distribution in the air volume above the plate. The heat transfer coefficients exhibited distinct behavior at high aspect ratios in which the dominant length scales were related to the source. At intermediate aspect ratios, length scales for both source and enclosure were relevant, and at small aspect ratios, a conduction limit was observed, which was dependent on board conductivity. The heat transfer coefficients at high aspect ratios exceeded by 14 % the prior correlations for upward facing isolate plates, when the ratio of source area to perimeter was used as the significant length scale, and a stronger dependence than Ra 1 / 4 was measured. Classical correlations for shallow differentially heated enclosure were not satisfactory in describing the dependence on <b>enclosure</b> <b>height.</b> With increasing board conductivity, board thermal spreading increased the effective source size so that the discretely heated board heat transfer coefficients tended towards the behavior of the classical uniformly heated board. New first-order thermal design formulae were derived for determining peak temperatures of sources on conducting substrates, and for determining the associated thermal "zone of influence" or "footprint.

40|$|Triangular {{enclosures}} {{are typical}} configurations of attic spaces found in residential {{as well as}} industrial pitched-roof buildings. Natural convection in triangular rooftops has received considerable attention over the years, mainly on right-angled and isosceles enclosures. In this paper, a finite volume CFD package is employed to study the laminar air flow and temperature distribution in asymmetric rooftop-shaped triangular enclosures when heated isothermally from the base wall, for aspect ratios (AR) 0. 2 ≤ AR ≤ 1. 0, and Rayleigh number (Ra) values 8 × 105 ≤ Ra ≤ 5 × 107. The effects of Rayleigh number and pitch angle on the flow structure and temperature distributions within the enclosure are analysed. Results indicate that, at low pitch angle, the heat transfer between the cold inclined and the hot base walls is very high, resulting in a multi-cellular flow structure. As the pitch angle increases, however, the number of cells reduces, and the total heat transfer rate progressively reduces, even if the Rayleigh number, being based on the <b>enclosure</b> <b>height,</b> rapidly increases.

The transport equations, along with the Boussinesq approximation {{as well as the}} energy equation, are solved using the finite volume method (FVM) coupled with SIMPLE algorithm. The steady state mean Nusselt number over the isothermal plate surface area is computed for each case as a function of Rayleigh number, the plate length and position.

The buoyancy-driven displacement ventilation model of Linden et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 212, 1990, p. 309) predicts {{the formation of a}} two-layer stratification when a single plume is introduced into an enclosure with vents at the top and bottom. The model assumes that diffusion plays no {{role in the development of}} the ambient buoyancy stratification: diffusion is a slow process and the entrainment of ambient fluid into the plume from the diffuse interface will act to thin the interface resulting in a near discontinuity of density between the upper and lower layers. This prediction has been corroborated by small-scale salt bath experiments; however, full-scale measurements in ventilated rooms and complementary numerical simulations suggest an interface that is not sharp but rather smeared out over a finite thickness. For a given plume buoyancy flux, as the cross-sectional area of the enclosure increases the volume of fluid that must be entrained by the plume to maintain a sharp interface also increases. Therefore the balance between the diffusive thickening of the interface and plume-driven thinning favours a thicker interface. Conversely, the interface thickness decreases with increasing source buoyancy flux, although the dependence is relatively weak.

This model has applications to liquid acquisition devices inside the cryogenic storage tanks used to transport vapor-free propellant to the main engine. We show that heat loads from Q = 0. 001 to 10 W, with corresponding Rayleigh numbers from Ra = 109 to 1013, yield a range of unsteady convective states and temperature rise in the liquid. The results show that Q = 1 to 10 W (Ra = 1012 to 1013) yield temperature distributions along the <b>enclosure</b> <b>height</b> that are similar in trend to experimental measurements. Unsteady convection, which shows selfsimilarity in its planforms, is predicted for the range of heat-load conditions. The onset of convection occurs from a free-convection-dominated base flow that becomes unstable against convective instability generated {{at the bottom of}} the enclosure while the top of the enclosure is convectively stable. A number of modes are generated with small-scale thermals {{at the bottom of the}} enclosure in which the flow selforganizes into two symmetric modes prior to the onset of the propagation of the instability. These symmetric vertical modes transition to asymmetric modes that propagate as a traveling-wave-type motion of convective modes and are representative of the asymptotic convective state of the flow field. Intense vorticity production is created in the core of the flow field due to the fact that there is shear instability between the vertical and horizontal modes. For the higher Rayleigh numbers, 1012 to 1013, there is a transition from a stationary to a nonstationary response time signal of the flow and temperature fields with a mean value that increases with time over various time bands and regions of the enclosure...|$|R

The city of Hochelaga is round compassed about [...] with timber, with three courses of rampires [stockades], [...] one within another, framed like a sharp spire, but laid [...] across above. The middlemost of them is made and built [...] as a direct line but perpendicular. The rampires are [...] framed and {{fashioned}} with pieces of timber laid along [...] on the ground, very well and cunningly joined together [...] after their fashion. This <b>enclosure</b> is in <b>height</b> about [...] two rods. It hath but one gate of entry thereat, which [...] is shut with piles, stakes, and bars. Over it and also [...] in many places of the wall there be places to run along [...] and ladders to get up, all full of stones, for the [...] defence of it.|$|R
5000|$|.....on a {{very fine}} plain and had an {{enclosure}} three estados (about 16.5 feet or 5-m) high, which was made of logs as thick as oxen. They were driven into the ground so close together that they touched one another. Other beams, longer and not so thick, were placed crosswise {{on the outside and}} inside and attached with split canes and strong cords. On top they were daubed {{with a great deal of}} mud packed down with long straw, which mixture filled all the cracks and open spaces between the logs and their fastenings in such manner that it really looked like a wall finished with a mason's trowel. At intervals of fifty paces around this enclosure, were towers capable of holding seven or eight men who could fight in them. The lower part of the <b>enclosure,</b> to 'the <b>height</b> of an estado' (5.55 feet), was full of loopholes for shooting arrows at those on the outside. The pueblo had only two gates, one on the east and the other on the west. In the middle of the pueblo, was a spacious plaza around which were the largest and most important houses." ...|$|R
30|$|Measurements were {{performed}} under semi-controlled conditions and ambient relative humidity and temperature. Relative humidity and temperature from each enclosure was {{monitored by the}} use of two combined temperature/humidity sensors (Model Rotronics MP- 100 A, Walz, Germany). In most cases additional photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) was constantly provided by a LED system consisting of four double chains of a mixture of red, blue, and white light constructed and designed by the electronics department of the MPI for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. This LED system was placed perpendicular to the enclosure and the gaps between the LED groups were closed by a reflecting film in order to obtain a homogenous distribution of the light in the enclosure. PAR was measured with a quantum sensor (Model SB 190, Licor, USA) inside the <b>enclosure</b> at different <b>heights</b> before and after the measurements. During the long-term inundation experiment the control of light intensities was not possible during nonflooded measurements. Therefore natural sun light was used. One minute averages for enclosure and leaf temperatures were measured with thermocouples (Type E, Chrom-Constantan, OMEGA) and were recorded with a datalogger CR 23 X (Campbell Scientific Ltd. Shepsherd, UK). All other micrometeorological and physiological parameters were recorded simultaneously by a V 25 control unit, built at the MPI for Chemistry, on the same time scale.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} accuracy of the fire dynamics simulator (FDS 6. 0. 1) for under-ventilated enclosure fires with external flaming. The accuracy is discussed first in terms of mass balance at the steady-state stage for the enclosure volume. The required fineness of the grid is determined by analyzing the mass balance using two non-dimensional length scales. The first considers the ratio of the ventilation factor to the grid cell size, and the second considers the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the opening to the grid cell size. When these two length scales are larger than 10, the corresponding mass balance error as obtained from post-processing the output is lower than 4 %. The simulation results, including flow through the vertical opening, heat release rate inside the enclosure, gas temperature inside the <b>enclosure,</b> neutral plane <b>height,</b> and external flame height are compared with experimental data and empirical correlations. The air inflow rate through the opening is found to correlate linearly to the ventilation factor as m˙= 0. 41 *A*H^(1 / 2). For the heat release rate inside the enclosure, the predictions follow the empirical correlation Qin= 1131 *A*H^(1 / 2). This {{is directly related to the}} air inflow rate and incomplete combustion with the inflowing oxygen. Time-averaged gas temperatures inside the enclosure are under-predicted by maximum 13. 1 % compared with experimental data at the corner near the opening. Neutral plane height values at the opening, determined from the velocity profile of the vent flow, show good agreement with empirical estimations (Zf= 0. 4 ⋅H). Two methods are employed to determine the external flame height, namely a temperature based method and a volume heat release rate based method. The trends are captured correctly...|$|R
40|$|In an {{open plan}} office, an {{acoustic}} environment significantly affects the occupant&# 039;s satisfaction, performance and psychological wellbeing. The work stations or office pods {{in an open}} plan office are normally made up of partial <b>height</b> <b>enclosures</b> of acoustic screens which tend to provide {{a certain level of}} speech privacy for working individuals or corporate meeting. In general these pods consist of several acoustic screens, most of which contain fibre materials for sound attenuation and give an elegant look. In this regard, two sets of information, the performance in speech privacy and the longevity of the textile quality parameters, are two crucial tools {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} such pod materials. Several variables affect the acoustic performance in such case, and the sound absorption and sound transmission loss are two vital acoustic parameters to gain some initial thought on speech intelligibility or speech privacy of any particular screen. These acoustic phenomena depend on the quality parameters of the covering textiles such as thickness, fineness, density, construction etc. Other textile quality parameters including the material type, fire and thermal ratings, the fastness to light and rubbing, cleanability etc. are also essential facts to consider. From the buyer&# 039;s perspective, it is very important to understand these characteristics prior to buying such products, as they greatly influence the performance in different work environment setups. The characteristics are also vital for the manufacture to develop new products or to impart new features to the existing one. However, there is lack of basic research on the quality characterization of these pods or screen materials in terms of their acoustic and textile performance. As a result not only the consumer, but also the manufacturer does not have sufficient information to critically distinguish the performance of one such product from another...|$|R
