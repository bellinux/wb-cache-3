Australia batted first against Kent and Morris made 43 in a total of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Morris was rested for the following three matches against the Gentlemen of England, Somerset and the South of England. The first two matches were won by innings while the third was washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead. In the meantime, Morris underwent <b>minor</b> <b>surgery</b> for a split in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{started the}} season {{competing}} over 400 metres {{in order to}} improve his speed, winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston, and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 second finish of the season in the 100 m in March. In late April Bolt suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash. However, he quickly recovered following <b>minor</b> <b>surgery</b> and (after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester Great City Games. Bolt won the race in 14.35 s, the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m. Despite not being at full fitness, he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships, with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively. This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships. Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt's 100 m record was within his grasp, but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted that he was more interested in Asafa Powell's return from injury. Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July, running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9m/s headwind and rain, to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m, one hundredth off Gay's best time.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{analgesic}} efficacy of Bupivacaine 0. 25 % wound infiltration with Ketorolac incisional infiltration in relieving postoperative pain for first twenty-four hours. METHODOLOGY: Analytical, interventional and comparative study {{was performed on}} seventy patients, of both sexes, with varied age groups. Patients underwent <b>minor</b> and moderate <b>surgeries,</b> confined to American Society of Anaesthesiologist ASA category 1 -II. Patients were selected by convenience sampling and {{were divided into two}} groups i. e. Group I and Group II. Group-I comprised of thirty five patients and were infiltrated with Bupivacaine 0. 25 % at wound margins postoperatively. Group-II also comprised of thirty-five patients and were infiltrated with Ketorolac at wound margins 60 mg postoperatively. RESULTS: Bupivacaine 0. 25 % wound infiltration had onset of action within 4 +/- 2 minutes. Percentage pain relief was 80 % in <b>minor</b> <b>surgeries</b> and 60 % in moderate surgeries. Duration of action lasted for 8 +/- 2 hours regarding <b>minor</b> <b>surgeries</b> while it was 6 +/- 1 hours for moderate surgeries. Ketorolac incisional infiltration had onset of analgesic action within 10 +/- 5 minutes. Duration of action lasted for 6 +/- 1 hours regarding <b>minor</b> <b>surgeries</b> while it was 4 +/- 2 hours regarding moderate surgeries. Percentage pain relief was 60 % in <b>minor</b> <b>surgeries</b> and 50 % in moderate surgeries. CONCLUSION: Wound infiltration with Bupivacaine 0. 25 % was better for postoperative pain relief in comparison with Ketorolac regarding percentage pain relief, onset and duration of action...|$|R

Many naturopaths present themselves as primary care providers, and some naturopathic physicians may prescribe drugs, perform <b>minor</b> <b>surgery,</b> and integrate other conventional medical approaches such as diet and lifestyle counselling with their naturopathic practice. Traditional naturopaths deal exclusively with lifestyle changes, not diagnosing or treating disease. Naturopaths do not generally recommend vaccines and antibiotics, based in part on the early views that shaped the profession, and they may provide alternative remedies even in cases where evidence-based medicine has been shown effective.|$|E

Nurses provided prenatal care, worked as midwives, performed <b>minor</b> <b>surgery,</b> conducted medical inspections of schoolchildren, and sponsored immunization programs. The post-World War II discovery of large oil and gas reserves resulted in economic prosperity and the expansion of local medical services.

25|$|Bromazepam (marketed under several brand names, {{including}} Lectopam, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium and Lexotanil) is a benzodiazepine derivative drug, {{patented by}} Roche in 1963 and developed clinically in the 1970s. It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam (Valium). In {{addition to being}} used to treat anxiety or panic states, bromazepam {{may be used as}} a premedicant prior to <b>minor</b> <b>surgery.</b> Bromazepam typically comes in doses of 3mg and 6mg tablets. Bromazepam is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children. Prolonged use of bromazepam causes tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug, and as a result, it is a medication which is controlled by international law.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{under general}} {{anesthesia}} must undergo continuous physiological monitoring to ensure safety. In the US, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have established minimum monitoring guidelines for patients receiving general anesthesia, regional anesthesia, or sedation. This includes electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, inspired and expired gases, oxygen saturation {{of the blood}} (pulse oximetry), and temperature. In the UK the Association of Anaesthetists (AAGBI) have set minimum monitoring guidelines for general and regional anesthesia. For <b>minor</b> <b>surgery,</b> this generally includes monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and inspired and expired concentrations for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and inhalational anesthetic agents. For more invasive surgery, monitoring may also include temperature, urine output, blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, cardiac output, cerebral activity, and neuromuscular function. In addition, the operating room environment must be monitored for ambient temperature and humidity, {{as well as for}} accumulation of exhaled inhalational anesthetic agents, which might be deleterious to the health of operating room personnel.|$|E
