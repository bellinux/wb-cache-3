The PPI is administered at regular intervals to {{all students in the}} program, regardless of their level of training, and plots students' scores as they move through the program. Students typically score 20 percent on their first examination, and increase by five to seven percent with each successive examination. Students can monitor the changes in their scores and receive formative feedback based on a standardized score relative to the class mean. Due to the overwhelming success and research supporting the use of the PPI as an evaluation tool, it is now used in Canada, US, Europe, and Australia.|$|E

In this light it is important that prospective students make the right study choice. Since 2011 <b>Maastricht</b> <b>University’s</b> Bachelor in European Studies is using a procedure called ‘Matching’, which is meant to facilitate prospective students’ self-reflection about their study choice. This article explains how Matching complements existing arrangements related to transition to higher education, such as open days and induction weeks, and presents our experience to this point. We have so far only partly been able to meet the initial aims of Matching. Nevertheless, we believe that arrangements such as this can benefit both undergraduate programmes and their students, as it provides a better insight into study choice and into intervention that can improve transition to higher education...|$|R

This is the first article to study the effects of overconfidence on trading activity and performance in real estate. The article looks at Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), as their investments and divestments can be identified with precision. We look at the effect of CEO overconfidence on investment activity and separately investigate property acquisitions and dispositions. We find that REITs with overconfident CEOs tend to invest more; these REITs acquire more assets and are less likely to sell assets than their counterparts if they have enough discretionary cash. Valuable private information is not the main driver for CEOs to be net buyers of company shares: the shares of their companies perform relatively weakly. In addition, we find that overconfident managers have lower property investment performance measured by net operating income and gain on sale of real estate.

2500|$|In January 2008 the Terlouw Commission {{advised the}} Boards of Utrecht and Maastricht Universities to {{continue}} to use Peter Debye’s name for the chemistry and physics institute in Utrecht, and to continue awarding the science prize in Maastricht. The Commission concluded that Debye was not a party member, was not an anti-semite, did not further Nazi propaganda, did not cooperate with the Nazi war machine, was not a collaborator, and yet also was not a resistance hero. He was a rather pragmatic, flexible, and brilliant scientist, idealistic {{with respect to the}} pursuit of science, but only superficially oriented in politics. With respect to sending out the DPG letter, the Commission [...] concluded that Debye found the situation inescapable. The Commission pointed out that the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences also took away Albert Einstein's honorary membership, emphasizing [...] the circumstances in which these decisions had been taken. The Commission stated that now, seventy years later, no judgment can be made concerning the decision of Debye to sign this letter in the exceptionally difficult circumstances in which he then found himself. Nevertheless, the Commission describes the DPG letter as an extraordinarily unpleasant fact, forming a dark page in his life history. Finally, the Commission concluded that based on the NIOD report since no bad faith on Debye’s part has been demonstrated, his good faith must be assumed and recommended that the University of Utrecht retain the name of the Debye Institute of NanoMaterials Science and that the University of Maastricht continue to associate itself with the Peter Debye Prize. Utrecht University accepted the recommendation, <b>Maastricht</b> <b>University</b> did not. But in February 2008, the Hustinx Foundation (Maastricht), originator and sponsor of the Peter Debye Prize, announced that it will continue to have the prize awarded. The City of Maastricht, Debye's birthplace, declared that it sees no reason to change the names of Debye Street and Debye Square.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Studies that {{compare the}} effects of problem-based and {{conventional}} medical curricula on student performance generally show no significant differences. However, curriculum comparison studies are at best quasi-experimental, so they are prone to forms of selection bias. The {{purpose of this study}} was to reanalyze data from such comparisons by controlling for two potential biases: differential student attrition and differential exposure. METHOD: The authors reanalyzed 104 previously published comparisons involving a single, problem-based medical school in the Netherlands (<b>Maastricht</b> <b>University's</b> medical school), using student attrition and study duration data from this school and the schools with which it was compared. The authors removed bias by reequalizing the comparison groups in terms of attrition and study duration. RESULTS: The uncorrected data showed no differences between problem-based and conventional curricula: Mean effect sizes as expressed by Cohen d were 0. 02 for medical knowledge and 0. 07 for diagnostic reasoning. However, the reanalysis demonstrated medium-level effect sizes favoring the problem-based curriculum. After corrections for attrition and study duration, the mean effect size for knowledge acquisition was 0. 31 and for diagnostic reasoning was 0. 51. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of the Maastricht problem-based curriculum were masked by differential attrition and differential exposure in the original studies. Because this school has been involved in many studies included in influential literature reviews published in the past 20 years, the authors' findings have implications for the assessment of the value of problem-based learning put forward by these reviews...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with intermittent claudication, {{exercise in the}} form of walking is effective in reducing pain and maximising achievable walking distance. However, data are lacking on the implementation of walking exercise in these patients. AIMS: To explore the current behaviour and views of {{patients with}} intermittent claudication towards taking walking exercise. DESIGN OF STUDY: Postal questionnaire and focus group meetings. SETTING: Two academic general practice networks (Utrecht and <b>Maastricht</b> <b>Universities)</b> in The Netherlands. METHOD: Three hundred and seventy-five patients with intermittent claudication, selected from the files of general practitioners participating in two academic general practice networks, were sent a postal questionnaire; 216 (58 %) were returned. Nine of these responders also attended a focus group meeting. RESULTS: Seventy per cent (151 / 216) of the patients reported having received advice about walking exercise. If specified, the advice given most often recommended walking in the local neighbourhood (56 %, 84 / 151). Fifty-two per cent (113 / 216) of all patients actually performed walking exercise and only 32 %of them received any kind of supervision. Among the barriers for taking walking exercise, 'comorbidity', 'lack of (specific) advice' and 'lack of supervision' were often mentioned. Among the stimuli to start and continue walking, 'following the doctor's advice', 'relief of complaints' and 'a better general condition' were often mentioned by patients. CONCLUSIONS: Walking exercise was not carried out by almost half of patients with intermittent claudication in this study. Lack of specific advice and supervision were found to be important barriers to taking walking exercise...|$|R

The objective is to nd out if the Eumedion best practices are still state of the art. In part two compliance by Eumedion members with the Eumedion best practices is observed. The goal of part two is to nd out which best practices are the most important to Eumedion Members. Part three is about proposed Directive 2014 / 213 /EU. This Directive amends Directive 2007 / 36 /EC on shareholder rights.
