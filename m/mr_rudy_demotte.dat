5000|$|Paducah entered radio early, and {{the first}} station owner was {{concerned}} with pure promotion. The Commerce Department issued Kentucky's second radio license to J.A. Rudy & Sons at 115 South Third St. in Paducah [...] "during the week beginning 17 July 1922," [...] {{less than two years}} after KDKA in Pittsburgh made its groundbreaking broadcast of the 1920 Presidential election returns.
