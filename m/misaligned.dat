5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly <b>misaligned</b> with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{photometric}} and spectroscopic {{observations from}} 2005 to 2007 {{indicate that a}} new disk has formed around the equatorthus constituting a double disk phenomenon with disks at different angles. The inclination angle of the new disk is estimated at 60° whereas the previous disk was inclined at around 30°. Such a <b>misaligned</b> double-disk structure has never been observed before among Be stars. Thus, Pleione provides {{a rare opportunity to}} investigate the forming process of a new disk and the consequent interaction between the two.|$|E
5|$|The CLR {{employed}} the engineers James Henry Greathead, Sir John Fowler, and Sir Benjamin Baker {{to design the}} railway. The official opening of the CLR (now the Central line) by the Prince of Wales took place on 27 June 1900; it was {{opened to the public}} on 30 July. Oxford Circus station opened as part of the first section of the line, between Shepherd's Bush and Bank. As part of the 1935—40 New Works Programme, the <b>misaligned</b> tunnels of the central section on the Central line that slowed running speeds were corrected and the platforms lengthened to accommodate longer trains.|$|E

25|$|Harmful habits such as thumb sucking or tongue {{thrusting}} {{can result}} in or exaggerate an alveolar prognathism, causing teeth to <b>misalign.</b> Functional appliances {{can be used in}} growing children to help modify bad habits and neuro-muscular function, with the aim of correcting this condition.|$|R
50|$|In groups, {{it can be}} more {{difficult}} to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions <b>misalign.</b> Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.|$|R
5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the <b>misaligned</b> forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves to help ease the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{the museum}} pushed back the {{expected}} completion date by 18 months, {{due in part to}} issues with the boiler restoration. By January 2009, with further problems encountered including <b>misaligned</b> frames and a cracked right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further £250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010. In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following final testing it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer. In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the frame assembly, leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.|$|E

50|$|Self-Heal Property: While other zippers {{may become}} useless {{once they are}} impaired, nylon zippers have the {{tendency}} to self-repair. Even {{when some of the}} teeth <b>misaligns</b> and gets out of the regular positioning, moving the slider past that point will automatically reposition it to its original place.|$|R
50|$|Some {{chromosomal}} {{regions are}} more prone to rearrangement than others and thus are the source of genetic diseases and cancer. This instability is usually due to the propensity of these regions to <b>misalign</b> during DNA repair, exacerbated by defects of the appearance of replication proteins (like FEN1 or Pol δ) that ubiquitously affect the integrity of the genome.|$|R
50|$|Duplication occurs {{primarily}} through uneven crossing over events in meiosis of germ cells. (1,2) When two chromosomes <b>misalign,</b> crossing over - {{the exchange of}} gene alleles - results in one chromosome expanding or increasing in gene number and the other contracting or decreasing in gene number. The expansion of a gene cluster is the duplication of genes that leads to larger gene families.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{design of the}} {{suspended}} polymeric microfluidic platform is introduced that is fabricated with three polymeric layers. Changing the microchannel plane to be perpendicular to microcantilever plane, drastically decreases moment of inertia in that direction. In addition, the platform is made of polymer (around five orders of magnitude less compared to silicon). It causes {{significant increase in the}} sensitivity of the cantilever deflection. Next, although the dimensions of this platform are constant, by <b>misaligning</b> the embedded microchannels laterally in the suspended microfluidic platform, the sensitivity can be highly increased. The investigation is studied on four fluids including water, seawater, milk, and blood for flow ranges from low rate of 5 to 70 µl/min to obtain the best design with the highest sensitivity. The best design in this study shows the sensitivity increases around 50 % for water, seawater, milk, and blood at the flow rate of 70 µl/min by just <b>misaligning</b> the embedded microchannels in the suspended polymeric microfluidic platform...|$|R
5|$|Compared to the {{original}} source, Donald leans further forward towards the water, and Mickey less so. Mickey's face is more flushed, seemingly less from exertion, than embarrassment for and perhaps schadenfreude towards Donald. The composition incorporates some of the foibles of comic book printing, including <b>misaligning</b> the joining of {{the contours of the}} waves with the yellow sky to give rise to an area of white space.|$|R
5000|$|According to this critique, RBRVS <b>misaligns</b> incentives: {{because the}} medical {{value to the}} patient of a service is not {{included}} in how much is paid for the service, there is no financial incentive to help the patient, nor to minimize costs. Rather, payment is partly based on difficulty of the service (the [...] "physician work" [...] component), and thus a profit-maximizing physician is incentivized to provide maximally complicated services, with no consideration for effectiveness.|$|R
25|$|Rolls-Royce {{determined}} that the direct cause of the oil fire and resulting engine failure was a <b>misaligned</b> counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. The ATSB's preliminary investigation report confirmed Rolls-Royce's findings.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be used to inform drivers of {{problems}} with their car, such as headlamps left off after dark, burned out or <b>misaligned</b> lights, or misuse of high beam rather than low beam in traffic, or to berate a driver who poses a risk to traffic. Headlight flashing coupled with blowing the car's horn can help clear deer from a driver's path.|$|E
25|$|Tuna {{departed}} San Diego, California, on 19 May 1941 for Pearl Harbor and shakedown training. Operations in Hawaiian waters {{revealed that}} the submarine's torpedo tubes were <b>misaligned.</b> This problem necessitated her returning to Mare Island for repairs. During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Tuna lay in drydock at Mare Island. She set out for Pearl Harbor on 7 January 1942.|$|E
5000|$|Losses {{are less}} than a Faraday generator, and {{voltages}} are higher because there is less shorting of the final induced current. However, this design has problems because {{the speed of the}} material flow requires the middle electrodes to be offset to [...] "catch" [...] the Faraday currents. As the load varies, the fluid flow speed varies, <b>misaligning</b> the Faraday current with its intended electrodes, and making the generator's efficiency very sensitive to its load.|$|R
30|$|Similar to SC-FDMA uplink {{communication}} system, the received signal in SC-FDMA uplink {{suffers from}} multiple CFOs and multiple TOs. The combined effects of TOs and CFOs results in ISI, ICI, and MAI. The receiver has to estimate and compensate {{the effect of}} multiple TOs and multiple CFOs in order to decode information from each user. Similar to SC-FDMA uplink communication systems, the correction of one user’s frequency and timing at the receiver can <b>misalign</b> the other users.|$|R
30|$|Similar to {{the speed}} test, it was seen in Fig.  4, that the Shazam {{algorithm}} generally did not perform well as the various pitch changes were applied. Also, the confidences of the songs that matched were relatively low (approximately 0 – 10). This would {{be due to the}} similar reason {{to the speed}} test where the pitch is being altered, therefore, the frequencies would change causing the audio fingerprints to <b>misalign</b> since they are based on the time-frequency pairs for the hashes.|$|R
25|$|Anteversion {{refers to}} an {{anatomical}} structure being tilted further forward than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, {{there may be a}} need to measure the anteversion of the neck of a bone such as a femur. For example, a woman's uterus typically is anteverted, tilted slightly forward. A <b>misaligned</b> pelvis may be anteverted, that is to say tilted forward to some relevant degree.|$|E
25|$|The three C–H σ {{bonds of}} the methyl group(s) {{attached}} to the carbocation can undergo the stabilization interaction but {{only one of them}} can be aligned perfectly with the empty p-orbital, depending on the conformation of the carbon–carbon bond. Donation from the two <b>misaligned</b> C–H bonds is weaker. The more adjacent methyl groups there are, the larger hyperconjugation stabilization is because of the increased number of adjacent C–H bonds.|$|E
25|$|Older table-based pinsetters that pick up {{the pins}} between throws could {{malfunction}} if a pin were moved sideways when the ball is thrown, but remained standing. The pin would now be out of alignment with the setter pickup holes, and the table mechanism would collide with these misplaced pins. Failure of the device to detect pin drift can result in setter mechanism collision damage, pin crush damage, or lane damage from blunt force pressure of the setter pressing down on the <b>misaligned</b> pin.|$|E
40|$|A rst {{study on}} the eect of <b>misaligning</b> the {{downstream}} spectrometer of the Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE) upon the measurement of fractional emittance change is presented. This preliminary study has limited statistical accuracy, but already shows that the MICE spectrometer trackers need to satisfy alignment constraints on both trackers of 3 mm in positional and 1 mrad in rotational accuracy to achieve the MICE stated experimental goals of 1 % error on the fractional emittance change due to the cooling channel...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates rhythmic motion in-selected chorale preludes from J. S. Bach's Orgelbuchlein collection. It {{examines}} how layers of motion, produced from the contrapuntal layering of voices, interact within each selected chorale prelude. It shows how layers of motion either align and produce synchronous rhythmic motion or <b>misalign</b> and produce non-synchronous rhythmic motion. In particular, this thesis investigates how alternations between synchronous and non-synchronous layers of motion correspond to and articulate both phrase form and tonal structure in these works...|$|R
40|$|Current {{automatic}} genomic screens for noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) {{predict a}} large number of genomic regions containing potential structural ncRNAs because they rely on sequence-based multiple sequence alignments, which regularly <b>misalign</b> RNA structure and therefore do not support identification of structural similarities. The authors compute columnwise and global reliabilities of alignments based on sequence and structure similarity and provide a versatile tool for the manual and automatic analysis of ncRNAs. The ready-to-use software tool LocARNA-P produces structure-based multiple RNA alignments, a web server, and the software package...|$|R
25|$|The {{resulting}} end-to-end system {{achieves a}} drastic {{improvement in the}} state of the art on this end-to-end task, reaching the same level of performance as the best systems operating on aligned, closely cropped images (no outside training data). It also performs well on two newer datasets, similar to LFW, but more difficult: significantly jittered (<b>misaligned)</b> version of LFW and SUFR-W (for example, the model’s accuracy in the LFW “unaligned & no outside data used” category is 87.55±1.41% compared to state-of-the-art APEM (adaptive probabilistic elastic matching): 81.70±1.78%).|$|E
25|$|Players join {{as members}} of {{either of the two}} main factions– the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Although each faction is led by a benevolent or malevolent leader, it is {{emphasized}} that an individual member may possess a morality at any point along the light/dark spectrum. The project's key focus is to differentiate between the player's faction and morality. For instance, a member with ties to the Galactic Republic may belong to the Darkside while attempting to achieve their own ends, which may be <b>misaligned</b> or dissimilar from the Republic's vision.|$|E
25|$|Qantas Flight 32: an Airbus A380 {{flying from}} London Heathrow to Sydney (via Singapore) in 2010 had an {{uncontained}} failure in a Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. The failure {{was found to}} have been caused by a <b>misaligned</b> counter bore within a stub oil pipe leading to a fatigue fracture. This in turn led to an oil leakage followed by an oil fire in the engine. The fire led to the release of the Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT) disc. The airplane, however, landed safely. This led to the grounding of the entire Qantas A380 fleet.|$|E
50|$|The {{subsequent}} SUU-23/A {{uses the}} GAU-4/A self-powered Vulcan, {{with an electric}} inertia starter {{to bring it up}} to speed. Both pods ejected empty cases and unfired rounds rather than retaining them. Both pods contained 1,200 rounds of ammunition, with a loaded weight of 1615 and 1720 lb respectively. During service in the Vietnam War, the pods proved to be relatively inaccurate: the pylon mounting was not rigid enough to prevent deflection when firing, and repeated use would <b>misalign</b> the pod on its pylon, making matters worse.|$|R
30|$|Until now it {{is evident}} that {{utilitarian}} considerations orient themselves on the collective benefit as “good”, without thereby intrinsically assuming elementary standards of justice. This applies especially to the utilitarian reverse of the current burden of proof, which demands a justification obligation from those who require participation in the research, but who <b>misalign</b> this obligation to those who do not wish to make their data and specimens available to biomedical research. In this section, it is intended to demonstrate why communitarian requirements toward the limitation of the personal private sphere should also be observed critically.|$|R
