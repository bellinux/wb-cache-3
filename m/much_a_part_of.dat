5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed of men with whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Vangelis {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Ridley Scott, {{to write the}} score for the science fiction film Blade Runner. Critics have written that capturing the isolation and melancholy of Harrison Ford's character, Rick Deckard, the Vangelis score is as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the dystopian environment as the decaying buildings and ever-present rain.

There are no apartments in the city proper, and no buildings more than two stories high, allowing the skyline to be dominated by the domes of local minarets, mosques, and mausoleums, some more than 1,000 years old.|$|E

25|$|According to {{lawyer and}} human rights activist K. Balagopal, Kashmiris have a {{distinct}} sense of identity and this identity is certainly not irreligious, as Islam is very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the identity that Kashmiris feel strongly for. He opined that if only non-religious identities deserve support, then no national self-determination movement can be supported, {{because there is no}} national identity – at least in the Third World – devoid of the religious dimension. Balagopal says that if India and Pakistan cannot guarantee existence and peaceful development of independent Kashmir then Kashmiris may well choose Pakistan because of religious affinity and social and economic links. But if both can guarantee existence and peaceful development then most Kashmiris would prefer independent Kashmir.|$|E

25|$|The slave trade/Middle Passage {{was just}} as <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> life in the Atlantic as was the {{merchant}} shipping of goods. Many European powers had ties to the slaving trade by at least the eighteenth century; countries like Portugal, Sweden, Netherlands, France, and England all had outposts on the African coast. Slavers would conduct their business with the larger African tribes who would buy weapons from the Europeans and in turn use them to collect members of other tribes to sell to slave captains. Once {{in the hands of}} a slaver, the slave represented a substantial investment as Ian Baucom suggests, by the insuring of slaves purchased. Some European cities such as Liverpool would become successful from operating in this trade system, and would drive the free markets of slavery to handle as much business as was possible.|$|E
25|$|Mainly on {{the basis}} of their reunion {{behaviours}} (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, {{an island}} emerged about two {{thousand}} kilometers south-east {{of the country}} of Samoa. It was named New Austral Island because of its close proximity to Austral Island.

2500|$|Another {{driver for}} the {{adoption}} of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms.

Boom! is a character within the Dark Carnival which Bruce describes as a [...] "continuous explosion that stomps {{his way through the crowd}} blowing [...] evil souls [...] to Hell".

They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> who I am and will always be, and they put it right there on that track".

New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work.

So as long as they want me, I'm happy to stay. The Street is like home and they really are my family." [...] She confirmed her intention to remain on the show in 2010, when the character celebrated her 90th birthday. In May 2010, the News of the World reported that Driver had decided to retire, just prior to the actress's 90th birthday. Driver was distressed by the rumour, and assured producer Phil Collinson of her intention to remain with the soap, and was told that Betty was very <b>much</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> plans for the series' upcoming 50th anniversary celebrations.

The Devi-Mahatmya is not the earliest literary fragment attesting to the existence of devotion to a goddess figure, states Thomas B. Coburn – a professor of Religious Studies, but [...] "it is surely the earliest in which the object of worship is conceptualized as Goddess, with a capital G".|$|E
