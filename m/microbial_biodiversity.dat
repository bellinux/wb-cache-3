40|$|Abstract – Since March 2001, {{samples of}} the {{remaining}} oil from {{the wreck of the}} “Erika ” have been collected along the Atlantic coastline in order to assess the natural degradation rate. Four years after the sinking of the tanker, chemical analyses of the oil revealed the influence of environmental parameters on the degradation kinetics. Among the diverse parameters controlling the fate of oil in the environment, biodegradation by microorganisms is known to play an im-portant role. To investigate the role of microorganisms on “Erika ” oil degradation, microbial mats from the Guérande salt marches were maintained in slurries containing the pollutant. From these slurries experiments, a low biodegrada-tion rate of the “Erika ” oil was detected indicating the degradation capacities of <b>microbial</b> mats. <b>Biodiversity</b> studies were conducted to further understand the biodegradation processes.

Many {{studies have focused}} on the primary producers, namely the photosynthesizing cyanobacteria or eukaryotic algae (see Carbon cycle).

This review presents an analysis {{of the way in which}} the field of <b>microbial</b> <b>biodiversity</b> has exploited sampling, experimental design, and the process of hypothesis testing to meet this challenge. This review is based on a systematic analysis of 753 publications randomly sampled from the primary scientific literature from 1975 to 1999 concerning the <b>microbial</b> <b>biodiversity</b> of eight habitats related to water, soil, plants, and food.

40|$|Low {{bioavailability}} {{of organic}} carbon (C) and energy are key constraints to microbial biomass and activity. <b>Microbial</b> biomass, <b>biodiversity</b> and activity are all involved in regulating soil ecosystem {{services such as}} plant productivity, nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. A number of agricultural practices, of which tillage and fertiliser application are two examples, can increase the availability of soil organic C (SOC). Such practices often lead to reductions in soil aggregation and increases in SOC loss and greenhouse gas emissions. This review focuses on how the bioavailability of SOC and energy influence the ecology and functioning of microorganisms in agricultural soils. Firstly we consider how management practices affect the bioavailability of SOC and energy at the ecosystem level. Secondly we consider the interaction between SOC bioavailability and ecological principles that shape microbial community composition and function in agricultural systems. Lastly, we discuss and compare several examples of physiological differences that underlie how microbial species respond to C availability and management practices. We present evidence whereby management practices that increase the bioavailability of SOC alter community structure and function to favour microbial species likely {{to be associated with}} increased rates of SOC loss compared to natural ecosystems. We argue that efforts to restore stabilised, sequestered SOC stocks and improve ecosystem services in agricultural systems should be directed toward the manipulation of the microbial community composition and function to favour species associated with reduced rates of SOC loss.
