A form or position of the pipe and membrane is changeable in dependence of the pressure.

Additional small, time-independent bias field is applied perpendicular to the axis. It is found that the <b>magnet's</b> <b>switching</b> time is a non-monotonic function of {{the rate at which}} the field is swept from "up" to "down". Switching time exhibits a minimum at a particular optimal sweep time. This unusual behavior is explained by the admixture of a ballistic (precessional) rotation of the moment caused by the perpendicular bias field in the presence of a variable switching field. We derive analytic expressions for the optimal switching time, and for the entire dependence of the switching time on the field sweep time. The existence of the optimal field sweep time has important implications for the optimization of magnetic memory devices...|$|R

The first magnet element in this system is a pulsed <b>switching</b> <b>magnet</b> capable of <b>switching</b> beams of different energies and intensities to either transport system on a pulse-to-pulse basis. This magnet actually consists of five one-meter sections and is powered by pulsed high-voltage supplies (mod. ulators). Each magnet section is excited with two mpd. ulators because it must pulse in either polarity in order to switch the beam left or right; the pulse height should be continuously variable to accommodate any beam energy. The magnetic field in these magnets rises sinusoidally 360 times a second and has a peak value at 1700 gauss. In this paper the optical properties of pulsed magnet will be discussed briefly.

40|$|Two {{alternative}} current-induced switching geometries, {{in which}} the current flows parallel to the magnet/nonmagnet interface, are investigated theoretically using the nonequilibrium Keldysh theory. In the first geometry, the current is perpendicular to the polarizing magnet/nonmagnet interface but parallel to the nonmagnet/switching magnet interface (CPIP). In the second geometry, the current is parallel to both polarizing magnet/nonmagnet and nonmagnet/switching magnet interfaces (CIP). Calculations for a single-orbital tight-binding model indicate that the spin current flowing parallel to the switching magnet/nonmagnet interface can be absorbed by a lateral <b>switching</b> <b>magnet</b> as efficiently as in the traditional current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) geometry. The results of the model calculations are shown to be valid also for experimentally relevant Co/Cu CPIP system described by fully realistic tight-binding bands fitted to an ab initio band structure.

Polarization achieved using a lateral magnet in the CIP geometry is found to be about 25 % of that in the traditional CPP geometry.

The low resistance, magneto-metallic neurons operate {{at a small}} terminal voltage of ~ 20 mV, while performing analog computation upon photo sensor inputs. The static current-flow across the device terminals is limited to small periods, corresponding to <b>magnet</b> <b>switching</b> time, and, is determined by a low duty-cycle system-clock.

40|$|International audienceOBJECT: The aim of {{this study}} was to study the effects of MR imaging on the {{electrical}} settings of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems and their clinical consequences. METHODS: The authors studied the effects of 1. 5 -T MR imaging on the electrical settings of implanted DBS systems, including 1 or more monopolar or quadripolar leads, extension leads, and single- or dual-channel implantable pulse generators (IPGs). The IPG was switched off during the procedure and the voltage was set to 0. The impedances were checked before and after MR imaging. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy patients were treated with DBS for movement disorders and underwent brain MR imaging after lead implantation and before IPG implantation. None of the patients experienced any adverse events. Thirty-one of these patients underwent 61 additional MR imaging sessions after the entire DBS system had been implanted. The authors report neither local cutaneous nor neurological disorders during or after the MR imaging session. No change in the IPG settings occurred when the <b>magnet</b> reed <b>switch</b> function remained disabled during the procedure.

The ability to disable the <b>magnet</b> reed <b>switch</b> function of the IPG prevents any change in the electrical settings and thus any side effects.
