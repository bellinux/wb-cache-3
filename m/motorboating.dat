5000|$|Older audio {{amplifiers}} with capacitive (RC) or inductive (transformer) coupling between stages. [...] This design is mostly used in vacuum tube (valve) equipment. [...] <b>Motorboating</b> {{was a problem}} throughout the era of vacuum tube electronics but became rare as vacuum tube gear was replaced in the 1970s with modern solid state designs, which are direct-coupled. [...] The recent resurgence in popularity of traditional tube-type audio equipment in guitar amplifiers and home audio systems {{has led to a}} reappearance of <b>motorboating</b> problems. The problem is sometimes caused in older equipment by the evaporation of the electrolyte from old-style [...] "wet" [...] electrolytic capacitors used in the power circuits of legacy equipment, or in equipment of any age where an amplifier stage is sensitive to feedback via power supply rails, and can be remedied by replacing/upgrading the capacitors.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>motorboating</b> {{competition}} {{was established by}} Alfred Charles William Harmsworth in 1903. The Harmsworth Cup was envisioned as a contest between nations, rather than between boats or individuals.

5000|$|In electronics, <b>motorboating</b> {{is a type}} of low {{frequency}} parasitic oscillation (unwanted cyclic variation of the output voltage) that sometimes occurs in audio and radio equipment and often manifests itself as a sound similar to an idling motorboat engine, a [...] "put-put-put", in audio output from speakers or earphones. [...] It is a problem encountered particularly in radio transceivers and older vacuum tube audio systems, guitar amplifiers, PA systems and is caused by some type of unwanted feedback in the circuit. The amplifying devices in audio and radio equipment are vulnerable to a variety of feedback problems, which can cause distinctive noise in the output. The term <b>motorboating</b> is applied to oscillations whose frequency is below the range of hearing, from 1 to 10 hertz, so the individual oscillations are heard as pulses. Sometimes the oscillations can even be seen visually as the woofer cones in speakers slowly moving in and out.|$|E
50|$|If the inaudible radio {{frequency}} (RF) transmitter signal is inadvertently coupled into the receiver's audio signal path, it can trigger the AGC or squelch circuit {{to reduce the}} gain. Then, after a delay time set by the circuit's time constant, the circuit increases the gain again until the amplitude of the radio signal triggers another gain reduction. This repetitive cycle is heard as <b>motorboating.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Motorboating</b> {{can be seen}} {{in radio}} equipment, it can be {{regarded}} as a self-inflicted EMC problem. While this idea of self-imposed EMC effects could include all manner of unwanted feed back and crosstalk effects within an item of equipment, for reasons of brevity no discussion of internal feed back (which does not involve a signal leaving an item of equipment) will be included here.|$|E
5000|$|Camp Cherokee was {{established}} in 1965 as an [...] "outpost camp".

Their Shooting Sports ranges have 16 slots for fulfilling the Rifle merit badge requirements and has plenty of cover for Scouts, Leaders, and Parents to come and observe.|$|E
50|$|An example {{might be}} a 27 MHz Citizen's band radio in a car, {{connected}} to the car's 12 volt DC supply. If the decoupling capacitors which bypass radio noise from the power supply wires are missing or inadequate, or the long power leads pick up excessive RF from the antenna then {{it is possible for}} the RF transmitter signal to enter the radio's receiving circuits through the supply wires. This then causes the <b>motorboating</b> to occur.|$|E
