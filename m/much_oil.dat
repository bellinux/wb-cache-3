25|$|Catan: Oil Springs is an {{expansion}} by Erik Assadourian and Ty Hansen introduced in 2011 designed {{to draw attention}} to environmental issues. It is offered as a free download or for purchase from the Mayfair Games website. The scenario adds oil fields {{that can be used to}} make other resources and develop metropolises, but disasters can strike if too <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> is used. Oil can also be taken out of the game, for victory points and to prevent disasters.|$|E

When Blücher left Germany, she had about [...] of oil on board. She expended some of the fuel en route to Norway, and some was lost in the sinking, but she was constantly leaking oil. In 1991 the leakage rate increased to [...] per day, threatening the environment. The Norwegian government therefore decided to remove as <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> as possible from the wreck. In October 1994 the company Rockwater AS, together with deep sea divers drilled holes in 133 fuel tanks and removed [...] of oil; 47 fuel bunkers were unreachable and may still contain oil. After being run through a cleaning process, the oil was sold. The oil extraction operation provided an opportunity to recover one of Blüchers two Arado 196 aircraft. The plane was raised on 9 November 1994 and is currently at the Flyhistorisk Museum, Sola aviation museum near Stavanger.|$|E
2500|$|Strap {{parts of}} the saddle, such as the stirrup leathers, billets (on an English saddle) and latigo (on a western saddle) also need conditioning, but it varies by climate. [...] In a dry climate, failure to oil straps may result in {{cracking}} and weakening of the leather, and they can snap or break. [...] In a more humid climate, too <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> may weaken the leather. [...] Properly conditioned leather is neither brittle nor floppy in texture and flexibility.|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{definition}} of the shoreline, dividing state waters offshore and potential private land onshore, depends on state law. [...] Shifting shorelines {{in the vicinity of}} oil fields have been a thorny issue. [...] In the Goose Creek field along the coast in Harris County, Texas, so <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> was produced that the ground elevation sank ten or more feet, putting some privately owned oil-producing lands below sea level. [...] The state of Texas then declared that the newly submerged land, along with its oil revenue, was state property.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{mandates}} {{have been}} proposed over the years, such as gasoline will never exceed $1.00/gallon (Nixon), and the United States will never again import as <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> {{as it did in}} 1977 (Carter), but no comprehensive long-term energy policy has been proposed, although there has been concern over this failure. [...] Three Energy Policy Acts have been passed, in 1992, 2005, and 2007, which include many provisions for conservation, such as the Energy Star program, and energy development, with grants and tax incentives for both renewable energy and non-renewable energy.|$|E
2500|$|Colorado has {{significant}} hydrocarbon resources.

2500|$|Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{gave the}} Bel Air top marks for handling. Popular Mechanics reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with Powerglide as being 0-60mph in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride, and good visibility. On the other hand, the horn ring blocked {{some of the}} speedometer, regular gasoline made the engine knock, and the first V8 engines off the line burned too <b>much</b> <b>oil.</b> Front legroom was 43.1". Brakes were 11" [...] drums. A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was air conditioning, with outlets {{on each side of}} the dashboard; a heavy-duty generator was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{that the}} Galápagos green turtle is an {{endangered}} species, {{it has little}} economic significance for humans. They {{have in the past}} been harvested from egg to adult phases for various human uses. [...] The eggs and meat from all life stages was used in many areas as a food source for humans, and the meat is still considered a delicacy in some countries of South America. [...] They were also harvested for their hides and for the oils of their fat deposits used in cooking, but the Galápagos green turtle has less body fat than other green turtles, so not as <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> was yielded from their bodies. Now the green turtles have more of a negative impact on human economics due to their status as endangered. They are often involved as bycatch in many ocean fisheries and are protected through many acts of legislation.|$|E

2500|$|Perth was {{scheduled}} to remain in eastern home waters within the Anzac Area while [...] underwent refit. The War Cabinet agreed to meet a request by the United States for deployment of Perth to the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Area immediately and, in doing so, escort a convoy proceeding to ABDA. On 31 January 1942 Perth sailed from Sydney, reaching Fremantle on 10 February and on 15 February, relieved [...] as ocean escort for the convoy of four empty oil tankers and two cargo vessels (designated Convoy MS4) {{on a mission to}} claim as <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> from the Netherlands East Indies as possible before the Japanese invaded. After Singapore was captured (endangering the destination port of Palembang), all but Perth and the cargo vessel [...] were ordered to return to Fremantle. Although joined en route by the Dutch ships Swartenhondt and , the operation was cancelled on 21 February, when the ships were [...] from Sunda Strait. Perth escorted the three other vessels back to within [...] of Fremantle before turning north to join the ABDA force. She arrived at Tanjong Priok on 24 February, {{in the middle of a}} Japanese air raid.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman-Jewish {{historian}} Flavius Josephus {{states that}} three of the seven lamps were allowed to burn during the day also; however, according to one opinion in the Talmud (Rashi, Tractate Shabbat 22b), only the center lamp was left burning all day, into which as <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> was put as into the others. Although all the other lights were extinguished, that light continued burning oil, {{in spite of the fact}} that it had been kindled first. This miracle according to the Talmud (Tractate Menahot 86b) was taken as a sign that the Shechinah rested over Israel. It was called the ner hama'aravi (Western lamp) because of the direction of its wick. This lamp was also referred to as the ner Elohim (lamp of God), mentioned in I Samuel 3:3. The miracle of the ner hama'aravi ended about 40 years before the destruction of the Temple (c. 30 CE) according to the Talmud (Tractate Yoma 39a), [...] "Our Rabbis taught: During the last forty years before the destruction of the Temple (that is to say from around 30 CE) the lot [...] did not come up in the right ...hand; nor did the crimson-coloured strap become white; nor did the westernmost light shine" ...|$|E
2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

Waal, we can live on them alone, if need be, and an ounce or two of flour, made into cakes, {{will be enough to}} go with 'em. That way the flour would last us pretty nigh two months.

60|$|Mr. Tappitt {{admitted}} the argument, {{shook hands with}} the man, {{and then of course}} took him into his immediate confidence with more warmth than he would have done had there been no quarrel between them. And I think he found some comfort in this. He walked about the premises with Worts, telling him much that was true, and some few things that were not strictly accurate. For instance, {{he said that he had}} made up his mind to leave the place, whereas that action of decisive resolution which we call making up our minds had perhaps been done by Mrs. Tappitt rather than by him. But Worts took all these assertions with an air of absolute belief which comforted the brewer. Worts was very wise in his discretion on that day, and threw <b>much</b> <b>oil</b> on the troubled waters; so that Tappitt when he left him bade God bless him, and expressed a hope that the old place might still thrive for his sake.|$|E

60|$|Lifting {{the body}} from its couch, Nehushta carried it to the deck and laid it by the broken mast, closing the eyes and folding the hands.

Here a money-box was open, and in it gold and some jewels which this man had abandoned in his haste. These she took, adding them to her own store and securing them about her. This done she fired the cabin, and passing to the hold, broke a jar of oil and fired that also. Then she fled back again, knelt by her dead mistress and kissed her, took the child, wrapping it warmly in a shawl, and by the ladder of rope which the sailors had used, let herself down into the quiet sea.
