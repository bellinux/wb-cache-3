5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of the Living Dead. The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the <b>mainstreaming</b> of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

50|$|<b>Mainstream</b> {{economics}} {{has also}} been defined methodologically as work which <b>mainstream</b> economists are willing to engage, which requires conforming to the <b>mainstream</b> language of mathematical models, featuring calculus, optimization, and comparative statics.

5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, telling {{a story of a}} boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The <b>mainstreaming</b> of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct, including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with ulterior motives.|$|E

40|$|Most {{observers}} {{would agree}} that a healthy field of study needs diversity and a vibrant and open market for ideas. Thus, {{it would seem that}} calls for pluralism in economics, such as have been made by self-described heterodox economists, would be welcomed by the <b>mainstream</b> economics profession. They haven’t been; the calls have been essentially ignored by the <b>mainstream,</b> leading some heterodox economists to argue that the <b>mainstream</b> of economics is unpluralistic, closed-minded, and ideologically biased. In turn, heterodox calls for pluralism are seen by many in the <b>mainstream</b> as simply calls for the <b>mainstream</b> to listen to the heterodox economist’s particular point of view, and not as true calls for pluralism. Because it fails to achieve the desired ends, I find the rhetoric of pluralism unhelpful. Heterodox calls for pluralism do not increase openness or foster communication between heterodox and <b>mainstream</b> economists because such calls suggest that <b>mainstream</b> economists somehow do not favor openness to alternative views, and that the reason why <b>mainstream</b> economists are not open to heterodox ideas is because <b>mainstream</b> economists are closed minded.
