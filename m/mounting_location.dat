2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites and features a T-tail. The wing skins are made from a composite sandwich built over pultruded carbon fibre spars. Its [...] span, elliptical planform wing employs a 16% IMD 050 airfoil, has an area of [...] and mounts flaperons. The bubble canopy tips up for access and has a built-in vent. The landing gear consists of a retractable main monowheel gear, a fixed tail wheel and faired polymer wing tip wheels. The [...] electric motor is powered by two lithium polymer battery packs mounted near the aircraft's center of gravity, totalling a capacity of 4.3 kWh and weighing 15.5kg (34.2lbs). The nose-mounted propeller folds alongside the aircraft's nose when not powered to reduce drag and self-deploys when power is applied. The propeller <b>mounting</b> <b>location</b> {{eliminates the need for}} a retractable pylon and allows instant restarts of the engine without preparation, at any time in flight.|$|E

40|$|Gait {{assessment}} is frequently {{used as an}} outcome measure to determine changes in an individual 2 Ì† 7 s mobility and disease processes. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are quickly becoming commonplace in gait analysis. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine and compare the validity of shank and lumbar IMU <b>mounting</b> <b>locations</b> in the estimation of temporal gait features. Thirty-seven adults performed 20 walking trials each over a gold standard force platform while wearing shank and lumbar-mounted IMUs. Data from the IMUs were used to estimate step times using previously published algorithms and were compared with those derived from the force platform. There was an excellent level of correlation between the force platform and shank (r= 0. 95) and lumbar-mounted (r= 0. 99) IMUs. Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated high levels of agreement between the IMU and the force platform step times. Confidence interval widths were 0. 0782 s for the shank and 0. 0367 s for the lumbar. Both IMU <b>mounting</b> <b>locations</b> provided accurate step time estimations, with the lumbar demonstrating a marginally superior level of agreement with the force platform. This validation indicates that the IMU system is capable of providing step time estimates within 2...|$|R
25|$|To {{make the}} {{transition}} between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver <b>mounting</b> <b>locations</b> forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver {{is in the same}} vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect.
