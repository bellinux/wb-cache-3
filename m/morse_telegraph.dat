25|$|Contrary to the {{extensive}} definition used by Chappe, Morse {{argued that the}} term telegraph can strictly be applied only to systems that transmit and record messages at a distance. This is to be distinguished from semaphore, which merely transmits messages. Smoke signals, for instance, are to be considered semaphore, not telegraph. According to <b>Morse,</b> <b>telegraph</b> dates only from 1832 when Pavel Schilling invented {{one of the earliest}} electrical telegraphs.|$|E
25|$|In 1886–87 {{when the}} Royal E. House Telegraph was {{produced}} with the printing telegraph, the <b>Morse</b> <b>Telegraph</b> tried to enjoin them from infringing the Morse patents. Morse claimed the sole right of transmitting intelligence by electricity (which utilized the Morse code). The courts decided the House Company did not infringe the Morse patent {{in the slightest}} degree, as the messages using the House system were all printed on a slip of paper, while the Morse signals were embosed and in code (dots and dashes) which afterwards were translated into words.|$|E

50|$|The {{speed at}} which marks could {{be made on the}} paper was so high that hand {{signalling}} could not keep up with it, and so Bain devised a method of automatic signalling using punched paper tape. The concept was later used by Wheatstone in his automatic sender. Bain's chemical telegraph was tried between Paris and Lille, and attained a speed of 282 words in 52 seconds, a great advance on <b>Morse's</b> <b>telegraph</b> which could only give about 40 words per minute.|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraphs,</b> the receiver's armature made a clicking noise {{as it moved}} {{in and out of}} position to mark the paper tape. The telegraph operators soon learned that they could translate the clicks directly into dots and dashes, and write these down by hand, thus making the paper tape unnecessary. When Morse code was adapted to radio communication, the dots and dashes were sent as short and long tone pulses. It was later found that people become more proficient at receiving Morse code when it is taught as a language that is heard, instead of one read from a page.|$|R

This was the first electronic means of long distance communication in human history. The government tests corroborated Morse's invention and led to federal adoption of the technology and the subsequent establishment of the American telegraph communications system, which revolutionized communications and the economic development of the United States. Federal acceptance of the telegraph had {{a major impact on}} Abraham Lincoln's management of the Civil War as well.|$|R

He was re-elected to Congress in 1840 and 1842; but, because of his strong opposition to the annexation of Texas, he was defeated in 1844. His influence in Congress was largely responsible for the appropriation of $30,000 to test Samuel <b>Morse's</b> <b>telegraph.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 1 October 1874, Heiligenstadt got a <b>Morse</b> <b>telegraph</b> station, {{which was}} used until 1926. In 1907, a {{telephone}} exchange was opened. The first subscribers were the Hösch Inn and Schloss Greifenstein {{as well as the}} communities of Burggrub and Hohenpölz.|$|E

40|$|The Ancient Greeks {{dreamt of}} {{a device that}} would enable people to talk over long {{distances}} {{without the need for}} an interlocutor. They called such a device a ‘telephone’. The idea of direct communication over electric wire was then introduced with the arrival of <b>Morse’s</b> <b>Telegraph</b> in 1838. However, even when Bell finally invented the Electric Speaking Telephone in 1876, it still took some time to find a common use for the device. Even though its invention had been anticipated for a long time, it arrived without a clear and agreed purpose and was received simply as a curiosity. This monologue presents the history of society’s adoption of the fixed-line telephone, and the corresponding adoption of the mobile telephone. It highlights the differences and similarities of these histories, and poses some interesting questions for today’s mobile industry...|$|R
5000|$|Part of Samuel <b>Morse's</b> <b>telegraph</b> {{system was}} an {{automatic}} recorder of the dots and dashes of the code, inscribed {{on a paper}} tape by a pen moved by an electromagnet, with a clockwork mechanism advancing the paper. [...] In 1848-1850 a system of such registers was used by John Locke to improve the precision of astronomical observations of stars, providing timing precision much greater than previous methods. This method was adopted by astronomers in other countries as well. [...] William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin's syphon recorder of 1858 was a sensitive instrument that provided a permanent record of telegraph signals through long underwater telegraph cables. These recorders came {{to be referred to}} as pen registers, although this term later became part of law enforcement jargon referring to the use of such a register to record dialed telephone numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{argument}} {{offered by}} supporters of Morse claims that Morse originally devised a cipher code {{similar to that}} used in existing semaphore telegraphs, by which words were assigned three- or four-digit numbers and entered into a codebook. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words using this codebook. Morse spent several months compiling this code dictionary. It is said by Morse supporters that Vail, in public and private writings, never claimed the code for himself. According to one researcher, in a February 1838 letter to his father, Judge Stephen Vail, Alfred wrote, [...] "Professor Morse has invented a new plan of an alphabet, and has thrown aside the Dictionaries." [...] In an 1845 book Vail wrote describing <b>Morse's</b> <b>telegraph,</b> he also attributed the code to Morse.|$|R
