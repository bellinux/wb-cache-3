40|$|The {{responses}} of the isolated guinea-pig ileum to coaxial stimulation of its nerves, to histamine, acetylcholine, bradykinin, nicotine, tetramethylammonium, 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -phenyl-piperazinium iodide and 5 -hydroxytryptamine were studied, before and during anoxia, cooling, or exposure to hyoscine, phenoxybenzamine <b>hydrochloride,</b> <b>morphine</b> or hexamethonium. Dose ratios {{were used to determine}} the amount of block induced by these procedures. With the response to coaxial nerve stimulation as an indication of the excitability of the nervous tissue, it was found that anoxia or cooling abolished the response to single shocks. Under these conditions the response of the ileum to histamine, acetylcholine and bradykinin was hardly affected, indicating a direct action of these substances on the muscle fibres. The effects of nicotine, tetramethylammonium, dimethylphenylpiperazinium and 5 -hydroxytryptamine were reduced to various degrees, and we have concluded that their main actions are indirect, through stimulation of cholinergic nerve fibres. When these indirect actions were prevented, increasing the dose revealed a direct action, a larger increase in dose being required for 5 -hydroxytryptamine and dimethylphenylpiperazinium than for tetramethylammonium and nicotine. Exposure of the ileum to hyoscine and phenoxybenzamine showed that these direct actions of nicotine and tetramethylammonium were not only on acetylcholine receptors but also on receptors insensitive to hyoscine but sensitive to phenoxybenzamine. The main action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine was on nervous elements, yet treatment of the ileum with phenoxybenzamine gave a higher dose ratio for 5 -hydroxytryptamine than did treatment with morphine. The meaning of this result is discussed in relation to the general belief that receptors sensitive to morphine are in nervous tissue and receptors sensitive to phenoxybenzamine are in smooth muscle. We have concluded that morphine is only a partial antagonist of 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptors in nervous tissue and that phenoxybenzamine antagonizes more 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptors than those in smooth muscle...|$|R

The OLP has various manifestations, maybe asymptomatic or associated with significant discomfort. The treatment of symptomatic OLP is often prolonged, characterized by recurrent and often unsuccessful. In the present study, the topical application of <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in patients with painful, erosive and / or ulcerative OLP was first investigated. The aim was to consider questions regarding efficacy and curative effect of <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on painful oral lesions, depending on opioid concentration and to investigate the <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in terms of adverse events. Therefore a prospective, randomized, triple-blinded and placebo-controlled phase-II-trial was conducted. 45 healthy patients with clinical / histologically confirmed OLP were treated with <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or placebo. The patients were randomized into three groups: 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> in glycerol or placebo (glycerol with 0. 05 % caffeine). The initial examination was performed on day zero at the study center. The preparation had to be applied independently for the following five days {{three times a day}} by the patient. The patients filled in a pain diary by means of VAS and documented local and systemic adverse effects. The dimensions and shaping of the lesions were measured and documented with photos {{at the beginning and end}} of treatment. 43 patients were included - 15 patients in group I (0. 2 %), 16 patients in group II (0. 4 %) and twelve patients in group III (placebo). After the evaluation, no statistically significant difference could be shown with respect to both the relief of pain and the reduction of the lesion between group I, II and placebo. This suggested that the carrier substance glycerol and the caffeine in the placebo have a certain benefit on wound healing. Although no complete remission was achieved, the discomfort and reduction of lesion size decreased by topical treatment with <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and placebo. Only minor adverse events have been reported (dry mouth, burning sensation).

These findings support that the mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia may depend on the drug conditioning that was originally performed. The present procedure of mice may {{serve as a model for}} further understanding of the opioid and non-opioid mechanisms underlying placebo responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of pretreatment with ketoconazole [cytochrome P 450 3 A (CYP 3 A) + P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor], elacridar (selective P-gp inhibitor) and rifampicin (CYP 3 A + P-gp inducer) on oral morphine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics {{was investigated in}} experimental dogs. Seven beagles were used in a four-way crossover design. <b>Morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was administered orally (2. 5 mg/kg) alone (control group CON) or after pretreatment with ketoconazole (group KETO), elacridar (group ELA) or rifampicin (group RIF). Morphine plasma concentrations were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Sedation scores (none, mild, moderate or severe) were evaluated subjectively. Dogs were significantly (P < 0. 05) more sedated after ketoconazole pretreatment. There {{were no significant differences}} between group CON and the other pretreatment groups in pharmacokinetic parameters taking both sexes into account. Sex differences were apparent in some pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine. The area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC(0 -infinity)) was significantly higher, and the total body clearance was significantly lower in male compared to female dogs in all treatment groups. Ketoconazole, rifampicin and elacridar pretreatment had no significant effects on morphine pharmacokinetics, although dogs in the ketoconazole group showed higher sedation scores...|$|E
40|$|Relationship between {{permeation}} {{of ethanol}} and leaching of hemoglobin from capillary blood, {{as a possible}} index of skin irritancy, was examined in hairless rats. Ethanol solutions were applied in vivo on the abdominal skin for 5 h and then content of Fe, instead of hemoglobin, in the application site was measured. Permeation of ethanol through the skin was examined in vitro in the corresponding condition. The index, i. e. Fe content in the skin, shows correlation with cumulative amount of ethanol permeated or maximum flux of ethanol through the skin, while that wasn't correlated with concentration and content of ethanol in the applied solution. Since a slow and continuous permeation of ethanol for 8 h didn't damage the skin, the maximum flux is more important parameter for the effect of ethanol on the skin irritation than the cumulative amount of ethanol permeated. Relationship between permeation of ethanol and <b>morphine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (MPH) was also examined. The cumulative amount of MPH was correlated with the maximum flux of ethanol. A formulation containing ethanol should be designed carefully so as to attain effective skin permeation of drug while avoiding the occurrence of skin irritation...|$|E
