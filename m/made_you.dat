500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 985 feet long, {{was released}} on June 24, 1910. Advertisements played up {{the wreck of the}} $40,000 train car while a positive review in The Moving Picture World praised the well-managed production's prison and track wreck scenes, but remarked that the improbable story was purely fantastical. One of the more dramatic articles to appear in The Moving Picture World included reference to the film while playing up the dramatic element describe the footage and the filming of the wreck. It states: [...] "... The scenes were portrayals of a train crash and they give you startling before-and-after wreck views. They <b>made</b> <b>you</b> shiver when they showed you the fate that came to a car full of passengers - sudden, cruel and without warning. They <b>made</b> <b>you</b> shiver; ... And you thanked God that the thing before you was only a picture on the screen!" [...] Known advertisements for the film included theaters in Rhode Island and Indiana.

At his funeral, held at the Penney Memorial Church in Penney Farms, Goodman was eulogized by Executive Secretary of the Order of the Arrow William F.

500|$|The {{following}} month, Beiderbecke {{enrolled at}} the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, [...] "comical," [...] "fatuous," [...] and [...] "a parody." [...] Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken bar fight, he was expelled. That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: [...] "Look out, he's trouble. He drinks and you'll {{have a hard time}} handling him." [...] They were inseparable for {{much of the rest of}} Beiderbecke's career, with Trumbauer acting as a father figure to Beiderbecke. When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke's ability to drive the band. [...] "He more or less <b>made</b> <b>you</b> play whether you wanted to or not," [...] Russell said. [...] "If you had any talent at all he <b>made</b> <b>you</b> play better." ...|$|E

500|$|Pickett lamented his men, lost {{in great}} number at Gettysburg. Late in his life, Colonel John S. Mosby, {{who had served}} under General J. E. B. Stuart, was present when Lee and Pickett met briefly after the war. [...] He claimed their {{interaction}} was cold and reserved. Others present at the meeting disputed this, stating Lee only acted in his usual reserved and gentlemanly fashion. Pickett, Mosby said, complained bitterly after this meeting, saying to Mosby: [...] "That man destroyed my division." [...] Mosby allegedly replied [...] "Yes, but he <b>made</b> <b>you</b> immortal." [...] Most historians find the encounter as Mosby interpreted it unlikely.

500|$|The {{death of}} Maximian {{required}} {{a shift in}} Constantine's public image. He could no longer rely on his connection to the elder emperor Maximian, and needed {{a new source of}} legitimacy. In a speech delivered in Gaul on 25 July 310AD, the anonymous orator reveals a previously unknown dynastic connection to Claudius II, a 3rd Century emperor famed for defeating the Goths and restoring order to the empire. Breaking away from tetrarchic models, the speech emphasizes Constantine's ancestral prerogative to rule, rather than principles of imperial equality. The new ideology expressed in the speech made Galerius and Maximian irrelevant to Constantine's right to rule. Indeed, the orator emphasizes ancestry to the exclusion of all other factors: [...] "No chance agreement of men, nor some unexpected consequence of favor, <b>made</b> <b>you</b> emperor," [...] the orator declares to Constantine.|$|E

While recording [...] "Astray", he persuaded his drummer to play in the parking lot and record him live, which he recalled in an interview for The Huffington Post: [...] "I just had this feeling in my head like, 'man, I want this shit to feel big!'

500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I <b>made</b> <b>you</b> work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show up on time.
