A group could be almost anything, and if {{all you have to}} work with is the group operation, then there’s not a lot you can say about the group without doing a lot of work first. In fact, in many groups, it’s not even possible in practice to tell if two group elements are the same or not! So if you’ve got a group on your hands, the first thing you’d like to do is figure out how to describe the group elements in a way that <b>makes</b> <b>your</b> <b>life</b> easier. For example, if you could turn your group into a collection of matrices, then that would be great. Matrix multiplication is easy to do, and it’s easy to tell when two matrices are the same. Plus, matrices have determinants, traces, and eigenvalues, amongst other things, that make them easier to understand. The big idea of representation theory is to develop a systematic theory of how to turn groups into matrices. Of course, when we turn our group into a bunch of matrices, {{we want to make sure}} that the group multiplication corresponds to matri...|$|R
