5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable <b>moods,</b> <b>and</b> felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E
40|$|Individual {{differences}} in <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy may affect academic outcomes in higher education. With little previous research investigating this relationship {{it is not}} known whether <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy traits help or hinder academic performance. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by investigating ups (high <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy) <b>and</b> downs (low <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy) in a small sample of University students in their first year of a psychology degree. The results suggest that low <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy traits may be detrimental to academic performance. High <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy traits however, were not associated with academic performance. Implications of the findings, in particular those regarding low <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> energy, are that, unlike the trait itself, the behaviours associated with the trait (e. g., procrastination, distraction, low motivation) are amenable to change through psychological interventions. Several of these interventions are discussed.  </p...|$|R

This was a cross-sectional, population-based study with a probabilistic sample by conglomerates. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was used to assess <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. The prevalence of mental disorders in the sample (n = 1, 561) was of 26. 8 % of which 9. 7 % had comorbidities between <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. The prevalence of comorbidities on <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders is almost three times higher among women than men (p < 0. 001). Lower education levels, socioeconomic status (p < 0. 001) and a history of divorced parents (p < 0. 050) was associated with comorbidities between <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. The main conclusion is that social factors are highly associated with comorbidities between <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders.

5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Chamba {{is noted}} for its {{miniature}} Pahari paintings, where Basohli style of Pahari paintings took roots with Nikku, the artist of Basohli migrating from Guler to Chamba in the eighteenth century. Raja Udai Singh and Raja Jai Singh patronized this school of painting. During the reign of Raja Charhat Singh, folk art developed and had a lasting influence on local artists. The paintings of Chamba encompass both miniatures and murals and the Mughal influence is clearly discerned in these paintings. Distinguished artists of Chamba who have painted in this art form include Lehru, Durga and Miyan Jara Singh. The paintings were generally painted with Hindu religious themes, particularly the legends of Hindu mythology such as Radha Krishna, Shiva-Parvati, Rama Darbar, Yashoda and Krishna, Gopis, love scenes, deer, birds and women, Daya Saptashati and Krishna - Sudama. Romantic ambiance of the monsoon season in Chamba has also been painted by the artists of Pahari miniature art, in various <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> styles in Basholi colours. They are displayed in the museums at Chamba and also at Shimla and Dharamsala.|$|E
5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative <b>moods</b> <b>and</b> verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E

40|$|Background Research {{indicates}} that there are benefits to both the mother and infant of breastfeeding. Campaigns have been launched in the UK with some efficacy in increasing the numbers reporting an intention to breastfeed, however, breastfeeding continuation rates remain relatively low. It is known that women’s expectations of breastfeeding are important when considering breastfeeding continuation. It is also recognised, that for women there is the potential of impact on postnatal <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> wellbeing when expectations of breastfeeding are not met by experience. Aims The study aimed to explore the relationship between prenatal breastfeeding self-efficacy, <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being and breastfeeding expectations. It then aimed to explore {{the relationship between a}} discrepancy between breastfeeding expectation and experience <b>and</b> postnatal <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Method Participants (N= 63) were first time mothers attending NHS antenatal groups reporting an intention to breastfeed. They completed a measure of breastfeeding expectation, breastfeeding self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being prenatally. Participants were asked to complete further measures of breastfeeding experience, <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being around 12 weeks postnatally (N= 29). Results It was found that women’s prenatal breastfeeding self-efficacy correlated with their breastfeeding expectations. Breastfeeding social expectations were found to positively correlate with prenatal <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being, while breastfeeding expectations of self were found to be independent of prenatal <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well-being. Postnatally women’s experiences of breastfeeding were not found to differ significantly from their expectations. Conclusion Overall, the results suggest that women’s social expectations of breastfeeding may be associated with their <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> well being prenatally. It is considered that breastfeeding expectations of self, however, were not associated with current functioning. It was observed in the current study that breastfeeding expectations were being met by experience, and therefore why an impact on postnatal <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> wellbeing would not be expected is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of music is}} a visceral {{part of the human}} experience and its influence on cognitive function has become a growing area of research in psychology. In particular, perceptual properties of music (<b>mood</b> <b>and</b> arousal) have been shown to significantly affect performance. There has been minimal research in the field on the interaction of these perceptual properties and their influence on attentional processes. This research study focused on the effects of musical <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> musical arousal on visual attention. Given that music is a highly subjective experience, participants were asked to rate different music clips on independent dimensions of music and arousal. Following these ratings, the clips which participants rated highest and lowest on dimensions of <b>mood</b> (positive <b>and</b> negative) and arousal (low and high) were combined to produce individualized stimuli datasets for use in the next task. Participants were then asked to perform the Posner cueing paradigm while either exposed to silence or music clips. Results indicated that musical <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> musical arousal had no significant effect on performance in contrast to a significant interaction between the variables. Their combination produced the highest levels of performance for high arousal positive <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> lowest performance for low arousal negative mood. Intermediate performance was found for high arousal negative <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> low arousal positive mood conditions. Future studies could further delve into the modulatory effects of <b>mood</b> <b>and</b> arousal using different attention tasks...|$|R
