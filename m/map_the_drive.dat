40|$|Systems with conserved {{currents}} {{driven by}} reservoirs at the boundaries offer {{an opportunity for}} a general analytic study that is unparalleled in more general out of equilibrium systems. The evolution of coarse-grained variables is governed by stochastic hydrodynamic equations in the limit of small noise. As such it is amenable to a treatment formally equal to the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics, which reduces the problem of finding the full distribution functions to the solution of a set of Hamiltonian equations. It is in general not possible to solve such equations explicitly, but for an interesting set of problems (driven Symmetric Exclusion Process and Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti model) it can be done by a sequence of remarkable changes of variables. We show that at the bottom of this `miracle' is the surprising fact that these models can be taken through a non-local transformation into isolated systems satisfying detailed balance, with probability distribution given by the Gibbs-Boltzmann measure. This procedure can in fact also be used to obtain an elegant solution of the much simpler problem of non-interacting particles diffusing in a one-dimensional potential, again using a transformation that <b>maps</b> <b>the</b> <b>driven</b> problem into an undriven one...|$|R

In the case of Newton or Newton-like methods these areas are the basins of convergence corresponding to the considered solution.

All drive cycles are analysed to show how they diffe r and the effects this may have. Three modelling techniques are then used to create vehicle models. A spread sheet model, a more detailed backward facing Simulink model and then a forward facing model using AVL CRUISE are developed. A coast down technique was developed to calculate rolling and mechanical resistance and check vehicle mass and drag coefficients. The final step in the validation process sees the creation of SFC <b>maps.</b> <b>The</b> <b>drive</b> cycle data and vehicle models are then combined to study both {{the influence of the}} driver and vehicle technology. The driver study showed that aggressive driving can add a fuel economy penalty of up to 50 %; Up-shifting around 1800 RPM can save up to 20 % fuel economy; that drivers are particularly poor in Urban conditions and that road elevation can contribute up to a 30 % fuel economy penalty. The vehicle technology study showed that a 20 % reduction in rolling resistance, mass and drag coefficient would see fuel economy savings of 3. 5 %, 5 % and 4. 5 % respectively; Repositioning the power curve by a reduction of 100 to 200 RPM can yield a fuel economy improvement of over 4 % for Extra-Urban condit ions or over 20 % for Urban drive cycles; Adding a mechanical flywheel to a vehicle could save upwards of 25 % fuel economy.

40|$|Although {{it is not}} {{difficult}} to observe the healing of induced wounds in animal embryos, <b>mapping</b> <b>the</b> forces that <b>drive</b> lesion closure has proved challenging. Laser microsurgery, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and other techniques can provide local information at fixed times, but all are invasive and some disrupt further development. Video Force Microscopy (VFM) has been able to map driving forces during ventral furrow formation in Drosophila (fruit fly), but challenges arose when it was applied under the assumption that the only driving forces are intracellular pressures and forces (including purse string action) along cell edges. Other possible forces of relevance include far-field stresses and in-plane cellular contractions. <b>Mapping</b> <b>the</b> forces that <b>drive</b> wound closure is an important problem, and so far it has remained unsolved. To investigate the process of dorsal closure, this study used a cell-based finite element (FE) model to identify the mechanical signatures of a wide variety of possible driving forces. Geometric parameters were developed to characterize the associated cell shapes and tissue motions and to quantitatively compare FE simulations with each other and with experimental data. It was discovered that edge tensions and pressures were not sufficient to drive wound healing. Wound healing can only be achieved when far-field boundary motions, edge tensions and apical area tensions act together. This thesis shows that a suitable FE model can provide information about <b>the</b> forces that <b>drive</b> wound healing, and its simulations take us one step closer to understanding the mechanics of wound healing. It also contributes to our general understanding of <b>the</b> forces that <b>drive</b> morphogenetic movements and ultimately helps us to better understand cell-based processes important for human quality of life...|$|R
