40|$|A more {{productive}} variety of chamomile (Matricaria recutita L.), {{which is more}} efficient in machine processing with consistent quality traits, will benefit the viability of german products in the global market. Breeding of an enhanced chamomile variety {{is part of a}} german multi-network project called KAMEL whose research aims on Matricaria recutita L., Valeriana officinalis L. and Melissa officinalis L. The agronomic and qualitative improvement of these speciality crops are the basis for further economic prosperity of medicinal and aromatic plant cultivation in Germany. The main breeding goals of a new variety of chamomile are the increase of blossom product yield (<b>Matricariae</b> <b>flos)</b> to 6 dt/ha in up to three harvest stages through a homogenous flower horizon (pick height), an even flowering time, large flower heads and a high regeneration rate after each harvest stage. The upgrade of the content of essential oil content to a minimum of 0. 8...|$|E
30|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections {{are a common}} occurrence in children. Such infections are {{a significant source of}} illness and pose a substantial economic burden on health services and society, in general [1]. Since most of these infections are of viral origin, usefulness of antibiotic therapy following recent guidelines on {{respiratory tract}} infections [2, 3] is not an option and overuse of antibiotic therapy must be avoided anyway. Plant-based medicines are a therapeutic option, especially because of their good tolerability. Since over 50  years now, the phytotherapeutic medicine, Tonsilgon® N (known as Imupret® N in some countries), is used worldwide to treat acute and recurrent infections of the respiratory tract [4]. Tonsilgon® N is an ethanolic-aqueous extract of seven medicinal plants, namely marshmallow root (Althaeae radix), chamomile flower (<b>Matricariae</b> <b>flos),</b> yarrow herb (Millefolii herba), oak bark (Quercus cortex), walnut leaves (Juglandis folium), horsetail herb (Equiseti herba), and dandelion herb (Taraxaci herba). These medicinal plants have established pharmacological effects including immune modulating, antiseptic, antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties [4, 5].|$|E
40|$|Metal {{content in}} {{medicinal}} herbs - empirical and chemometric approach Abstract The content of metals: Cr (0. 01 - 13. 9 ppm), Zn (25 - 96 ppm), Fe (84 - 2240 ppm), Mn (20 - 91 ppm), Ni (0. 2 - 5. 4 ppm), Cu (1. 5 - 10 ppm) and Mg (0. 3 - 1. 3 %) was determined in dried medicinal herbs, namely folium Melissae, <b>flos</b> <b>Matricariae,</b> herba Urticae, folium Menthae piperitae, fructus Foeniculi amari, flos Tilie, herba Hyperici and herba Filipendulae ulmariae originated from the Czech Republic, Poland and France. The {{samples of the}} herbs were decomposed by microwave-assisted mineralization and the metal ions were determined by atomic-absorption spectrophotometry. The results were subjected to statistical analysis in order to point out metals {{that could serve as}} indicators of the country of origin of the drugs...|$|R
40|$|Background: Herbal {{preparations}} like STW 5 (Iberogast(R)) {{are widely}} used drugs {{in the treatment of}} dyspepsia and motility-related disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. STW 5 is a phytotherapeutic agent consisting of a fixed mixture of 9 individual plant extracts. The electrophysiological mechanisms of action of STW 5 remain obscure. Aim: The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether herbal extracts influence electrophysiological parameters of the small intestine. For this purpose, the resting membrane potential (RMP) and the slow wave rhythmicity of smooth muscle cells of mouse small intestine were observed. Methods: Intracellular recordings of smooth muscle cells of the circular muscle layer of mouse small intestine were performed using standard microelectrode techniques. After dissection of the mucosa, the small intestine was placed in an organ bath and a microelectrode was applied on a circular smooth muscle cell. The RMP and the amplitude of slow waves were measured in millivolts. Results: The RMP of smooth muscle cells was - 59 +/- 1. 3 mV. This RMP was significantly depolarized by STW 5 (9. 6 +/- 1. 6 mV); the depolarizing effects can be mainly attributed to the constituents of <b>matricariae</b> <b>flos,</b> angelicae radix and chelidonii herba. The basal frequency of small intestinal slow waves was 39. 5 +/- 1. 4 min(- 1) and the amplitude was 23. 1 +/- 0. 9 mV. STW 5 significantly reduced the amplitude and frequency of the slow waves (11. 7 +/- 0. 8 mV; 33. 5 +/- 3. 4 min(- 1)). This effect on slow waves represents the sum of the effects of the 9 phytoextracts. Whereas angelicae radix and <b>matricariae</b> <b>flos</b> completely blocked slow wave activity, Iberis amara increased the frequency and amplitude, chelidonii herba reduced the frequency and amplitude of the slow waves, mentae piperitae folium reduced the frequency and left amplitude unchanged and liquiritae radix, carvi fructus and melissae folium had no effects. Conclusion: Herbal extracts cause changes in smooth muscle RMP and slow wave rhythmicity, up to reversible abolition, by blockade of large conductance Ca 2 + channels and other not yet identified mechanisms. In herbal preparations like STW 5 these effects add up to a total effect and this study indicates that herbal preparations which {{are widely used}} in dyspepsia and motility-related disorders have characteristic, reproducible, reversible effects on small intestinal electrophysiology.
