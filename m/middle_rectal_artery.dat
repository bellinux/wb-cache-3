40|$|The {{records of}} 182 {{consecutive}} rectal carcinomas treated in this department between JAN 1978 and DEC 1990 were reviewed {{to assess the}} outcome of the patients presenting with lateral pelvic lymph node infiltration. Lateral lymph node dissection was carried out in 24 (42. 1 %) of the 57 Ra tumors and 63 (72. 4 %) of the 87 Rb tumors, but in none of the 38 cases of Rs tumors. Lymph node involvement was detected 0 % and 15. 9 % of the Ra and Rb tumors, respectively. In this series, none of the cases in which the tumors were confined to m, sm and pm had positive lymph nodes. However, 23. 3 % of the 43 cases in which invasion was beyond pm showed positive lymph node invasion. The main lymph nodes involved were located in the roots of the <b>middle</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>arteries.</b> Half of the patients presented with distant metastases within one year, with poorer prognosis considering the mean survival rate of 1. 8 years. In conclusion, we advocate that in Rb rectal tumors with circular invasion or invasion beyond the pm, careful lateral lymph nede dissection should be carried out. On the other hand, we suggest the use of preoperative radiation therapy which could improve the curability, the disease-free interval, and survival rates...|$|R

Methods During resection of the rectosigmoid colon we perform dissection or embolisation of the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> as the fi rst step. Than we resect the rectosigmoid colon. Results 74 procedures on the left colon and rectosigmoid colon were performed from January 1 st, 2002 to May 31 st, 2003 in the Hospital Podlesí. Complications included wound infections in 7 cases (9. 4 %) and failure of anastomosis in 2 cases (1. 5 %). The reason for this was ischaemia of the left colon during rectosigmoid resection. We had to perform a “second look ” revision and left colectomy with a terminal transversostomy. Conclusion Dissection or embolisation of the vessels leading to the tumor area {{is the first step}} during malignancies of the colon. In case of the rectosigmoid tumor it is the superior <b>rectal</b> <b>artery</b> that has to be dissected or embolised. During strict dissection or embolisation of this artery ischaemia of the left colon with failure of the descendensrectal anastomosis occurred as a complication.

40|$|Background: The {{internal}} iliac artery is {{the chief}} pelvic artery. It supplies to the all pelvic viscera, musculoskeletal part of the pelvis.

40|$|Abstract The {{internal}} iliac artery (IIA) {{is one of}} {{the branches}} of the common iliac artery and supplies the pelvic viscera, the musculoskeletal part of the pelvis, the gluteal region, the medial thigh region and the perineum. During routine cadaveric dissection of a male cadaver for undergraduate Medical students, we observed variation in the course and branching pattern of the left IIA. The artery gave rise to two common trunks and then to the <b>middle</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery,</b> inferior vesicle artery and superior vesicle artery. The first, slightly larger, common trunk gave rise to an unnamed artery, the lateral sacral artery and the superior gluteal artery. The second, smaller, common trunk entered the gluteal region through the greater sciatic foramen, below the piriformis muscle and presented a stellate branching pattern deep to the gluteus maximus muscle. Two of the arteries forming the stellate pattern were the internal pudendal artery and the inferior gluteal artery. The other two were muscular branches...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Many {{authors have}} {{discussed}} the presence {{and the importance of}} the lateral ligaments of the rectum. Our contribution aims at clarifying some aspects of surgical anatomy that help in the preservation of the urogenital functions and may influence the surgical practice. METHODS: From 1994 to 1998 we examined 27 fresh cadavers and five embalmed pelves. We performed all dissections with a technique similar to that used for the surgical mobilization of the rectum. RESULTS: The lateral ligaments of the rectum are trapezoid structures originating from mesorectum and are anchored to the endopelvic fascia; as lateral extensions of the mesorectum, they must be included in the surgical specimen. According to our results, three main structures can be recognized laterally to the rectum: 1) the lateral ligament, which does not contain important structures; 2) the inferior hypogastric plexus and the urogenital bundle; and 3) the lateral neurovascular pedicle of the rectum that comprises the nervi recti and the <b>middle</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery,</b> both running under the lateral ligament, although at different angles. CONCLUSION: At the point of insertion into the endopelvic fascia, the lateral ligaments run close to the urogenital bundle. Nevertheless, the dissection at its attachment is safe if the urogenital bundle is kept under visual control...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} superselective embolization therapy {{in the management of}} acute lower gastrointestinal (LGI) hemorrhage, including any bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June and August 2007, 20 patients with acute LGI bleeding underwent superselective transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) at the authors' institution. The bleeding had different causes. All patients were treated with use of microcatheters. The following embolic agents were used: microcoils (n = 16), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles (n = 2), and a combination of microcoils and PVA particles (n = 2). Outcome measures included technical success (complete cessation of bleeding as documented at completion angiography), clinical success (resolution of signs or symptoms of LGI bleeding within 30 days after TAE), and the rate of major and minor complications. RESULTS: The identified bleeding sources were as follows: jejunal branch, branch of middle colic artery, branch of ileocolic artery, ileal branch, branch of left colic artery, branch of sigmoid artery, branch of the superior rectal artery, and branch of the <b>middle</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery.</b> Technical success with effective control of active bleeding was achieved in all patients (100 %). Clinical success attributed to TAE was documented in 18 of the 20 patients (90 %). Major complications included death due to pulmonary embolism, heart infarction, and multiorgan failure in the 3 rd week after TAE; a procedure-related colonic infarction occurred in one patient. A minor complication occurred in one patient who developed a groin hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Superselective embolization may be used for effective, minimally invasive control of acute LGI bleeding...|$|E
40|$|Forty-six {{retrograde}} pelvic arteriographies {{were performed}} without catheter. The femoral artery was punctured, a tourniquet {{was applied to}} block the arterial supply to the lower extremity, and 40 m 1 of the contrast material was rapidly injected for radiography. The above method was first proved to be safe on the experimental animals, dogs and rabbits. 1) In 80 %, successful arteriograms were taken. No serious untoward effects were observed. In majority of cases, lumbar pain was complained {{at the time of}} injection of the contrast material because only local anesthesia was employed. 2) In bladder tumor, classification by stage was made possible with use of the serial radiographic apparatus; and the helpful informations were obtained as to diagnosis and treatment. 3) In prostatic hypertrophy, the prostatic angle, the angle on radiogram between the inferior vesical and <b>middle</b> <b>rectal</b> <b>artery,</b> was measured with relation to the weight of surgically removed adenoma. When the weight of one lobe was less than 10 gm, 10 to 20 gm, and over 20 gm; the angle was 45 to 60, 60 to 90, and over 90 degree respectively. 4) In carcinoma of the prostate, turtuosity of the periprostatic arteries made the measurement of the angle impossible. 5) In experimental animals, changes in intraaortic pressure and pulse rate at the time of pelvic arteriography were observed. Some noticeable changes were recorded when the amount of injected contrast material was 1 ml per kg body weight but no changes when 0. 5 ml was injected. 6) Retrograde pelvic arteriography of the author's method was proved to be simple and satisfactory enough to be clinically performed for differential diagnosis of intrapelvic diseases...|$|E
