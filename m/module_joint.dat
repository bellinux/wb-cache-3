40|$|Many {{recent studies}} in the {{development}} of floating concrete structures focused on a connection system made of modules. In the connection system, the modules are designed to be attached by pre-stressing (PS) while floating on the water, which exposes them to loads {{on the surface of the}} water. Therefore, the development of a pre-connection material becomes critical to ensure successful bonding of floating concrete modules. Micro-silica mixed aqua-epoxy (MSAE) was developed for this task. To find the proper MSAE mix proportion, 0 % to 4 % micro-silica was mixed in a standard mixture of aqua-epoxy for material testing. Also, the effect of micro-silica on the viscosity of the aqua epoxy was evaluated by controlling the epoxy silane at proportions of 0 %, ± 5 %, and ± 10 %. After completion of the performance tests of the MSAE, we evaluated the effect of MSAE in a connected structure. The plain unreinforced concrete <b>module</b> <b>joint</b> specimens applied with MSAE at thicknesses of 5, 10, and 20 mm were prepared to be tested. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MSAE-applied reinforced concrete (RC) module specimens connected by PS tendons, and these were compared with those of continuous RC and non-MSAE-applied beams. The results showed that the mix of micro-silica in the aqua-epoxy changed the performance of the aqua-epoxy and the mix ratio of 2 % micro-silica gave a stable failure behavior. The flexural capacity of concrete blocks bonded with MSAE changed according to the bond thickness and was better than that of concrete blocks bonded with aqua-epoxy without micro-silica. Even though MSAE insignificantly increases the load-carrying capacity of the attached concrete module structure, the stress concentration reduction effect stabilized the failure of the structure...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{development}} of a modular robotic system for generic industrial applications, including assembly. Design/methodology/approach – A library of robotic modules has been designed; they are divided into two categories: link modules, not actuated, and <b>joint</b> <b>modules,</b> actuated; the library is characterized by a relatively low number of elements, but allows the assembly {{of a wide variety of}} mediumsize serial robots. Findings – The prototypes of two <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> (a revolute <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> and a wrist module) and of some link modules have been realized. The behaviour of several serial robots composed of the designed modules has been assessed by multibody simulation. The results confirm the goodness of the proposed approach. Research limitations/implications – The two prototype modules are under test in combination with simplified modules. The further steps of the research programme will be the completion of the prototype library, and an experimental campaign on different serial chains. Practical implications – Modularity allows one to achieve a great variety of robots starting from a small set of modules, in order to match different operative requirements. Moreover, modularity dramatically reduces the time-to-repair of the robot and consequently improves its overall availability; this is a fundamental feature for modern industrial enterprises aiming at maximizing the resources availability.

40|$|Using {{manipulators}} with a fixed configuration {{for specific}} tasks is appropriate when the task requirements are known beforehand. However, in less predictable situations, {{such as an}} outdoor construction site or aboard a space station, a manipulator system requires {{a wide range of}} capabilities, probably beyond the limitations of a single, fixed-configuration manipulator. To fulfill this need, researchers have been working on a Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System (RMMS). Researchers have designed and are constructing a prototype RMMS. The prototype currently consists of two <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> and four link <b>modules.</b> The <b>joints</b> utilize a conventional harmonic drive and torque motor actuator, with a small servo amplifier included in the assembly. A brushless resolver is used to sense the joint position and velocity. For coupling the modules together, a standard electrical connector and V-band clamps for mechanical connection are used, although more sophisticated designs are under way for future versions. The joint design yields an output torque to 50 ft-lbf at joint speeds up to 1 radian/second. The resolver and associated electronics have resolutions of 0. 0001 radians, and absolute accuracies of plus or minus 0. 001 radians. Manipulators configured from these prototype modules will have maximum reaches in the 0. 5 to 2 meter range. The real-time RMMS controller consists of a Motorola 68020 single-board computer which will perform real time servo control and path planning of the manipulator. This single board computer communicates via shared memory with a SUN 3 workstation, which serves as a software development system and robot programming environment.

The link <b>modules</b> and <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> are modeled through beam elements and hinge elements, respectively, in a geometrically nonlinear finite-element solver, and subse-quently a beam-hinge ground structure model is proposed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed design, calibration, {{and control of}} a modular and reconfigurable robot (MRR) system. A MRR system not only includes modular mechanical hardware, but also modular electrical hardware, control algorithms and software. Also, those modular components can be easily constructed into various manipulator configurations to accomplish {{a wider range of}} tasks. MRRs represent the next generation of industrial manipulators that cope with the transition from mass to customer-oriented production. The main contributions of this thesis are: 1) mechanical design and calibration of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) <b>joint</b> <b>modules</b> of MRR, and 2) control design to handle multiple configuration and overcome disturbance due to dynamics uncertainty. From the mechanical design point of view, this thesis presents two main topics: 1) each joint is not only modularly designed, but also has multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) physical connection ports, which contributes to the concept of reconfigurability. Strictly speaking, single-input single-output (SISO) modular joint falls into the category of modular manipulator, and the robot reconfiguration is achieved by integrating different types of modules. For example, with single revolute MIMO <b>joint</b> <b>module,</b> both rotary and pivotal joint can be generated. On the other hand, {{if you would like to}} switch from rotary movement to pivotal movement with a SISO <b>joint</b> <b>module,</b> using another pivotal <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> is the only way to achieve this goal, and 2) for precise automation application, joints and links should be accurately connected and oriented when reconfigured. Our proposed modular joint has four connection ports which can be configured as either a rotary joint or a pivotal joint. In addition, key and keyway connection mechanism provides high accuracy in positioning the link onto the joint. Therefore, this structure reduces or eliminates MRRs system calibration time when reconfigured. Furthermore, zero link offset when used as a pivotal joint increases the robot dexterity, maximizes the reachability, and results in kinematics simplicity. The main challenge in the control of an MRR system with harmonic drives (HD) is the significant uncertainties due to friction, unmodelled dynamics, varying payload, gravitation, dynamic coupling between motions of joints, and the configuration changes. In order to compensate all unpredictable effects, we proposed a decentralized saturation-type robust control scheme based on direct-Lyapunov method and backstepping techniques. To better understand the system dynamics behavior, the HD flexspline compliance and friction calibration and results are also provided. The results are used for controller design.

Consider each <b>joint</b> <b>module</b> of the reconfigurable manipulator as a subsystem, and treat the fault as the unknown input of the subsystem. Firstly, by virtue of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, the decentralized proportional-integral observer (DPIO) is designed to estimate and compensate the sensor fault online; hereafter, the compensated system model could be derived. Then, the actuator fault is estimated similarly by another DPIO using LMI as well, and the sufficient condition of the existence of H∞ fault-tolerant controller in the dynamic output feedback is presented for the compensated system model. Furthermore, the dynamic output feedback controller is presented based on the estimation of actuator fault to realize active fault-tolerant control.
