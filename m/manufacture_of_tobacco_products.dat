2500|$|The {{conditions}} that {{made possible the}} Republican rise to power were above all economic. In {{the last quarter of}} the 19th century, a slow but vigorous industrialisation began in Portugal, concentrated in Lisbon and Porto. Although the people of the country remained mostly rural and Catholic, reflexively supporting the king and the Church, a new social class made up of industrial workers formed in Lisbon (and to a lesser extent in Porto and Beira) who shared most of the progressives' ideas. The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> and matches were the major industries in Lisbon at the time, but there were also textile, glass, rubber and canning factories, among many others. In total, at the end of the 19th century there would be tens of thousands of workers in various industries out of a total population of over 300,000 people. The first [...] "industrial zones" [...] of Lisbon were established in the Alcántara, Bom Sucesso and Santo Amaro neighbourhoods, thanks to the production of electricity coming from the Tejo Power Station in Belém. Living conditions for the new working class in Lisbon were miserable. Coming in large numbers from rural areas, they lived in tin shanties in large neighbourhoods with no infrastructure on the outskirts of town, their children often working long hours in the factories. Others came in large groups from the same village, and settled in abandoned lots, tents, and pátios in the former parish of Graça, located at the top of the Castelo hill and known for its courtyards. The first workers' districts appeared at this time, with dwellings built at minimal cost by entrepreneurs to attract the workforce. As the working poor struggled under deteriorating economic conditions and falling wages, the nation came increasingly under the control of an oligarchy of the rich.|$|E

Bitlis is connected to other urban centres by road, including Tatvan on Lake Van, 25 km to the northeast, and the cities of Muş (Mush), 100 km northwest, and Diyarbakır, 200 km to the west. The climate of Bitlis can be harsh, with long winters and heavy snowfalls. Summers are hot, and often humid.|$|E
50|$|The Port of Petersburg became renowned as a {{commercial}} center for processing cotton, tobacco and metal, then shipping products out of the region. The city became an important industrial center in a mostly agricultural state with few major cities. Flourishing businesses helped the city make improvements. Starting in 1813, the city paved its streets. A development company created a canal to bypass the Appomattox Falls, {{in order to promote}} traffic upriver. Next came railroad lines to link the city to all points of the compass. As travel technology developed in the mid-19th century, Petersburg became established as a railroad center, with lines completed to Richmond to the north, Farmville and Lynchburg to the west, and Weldon, North Carolina to the south. The last major line was completed in 1858 to the east, with the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad connecting to the ocean port of Norfolk. In 1851 the city introduced gaslights and by 1857 installed a new municipal water system.

30|$|Therefore, if we limit {{ourselves}} to analyse only the direct water use of each sector, {{we will consider}} the economic sectors with relatively low DWUC—such as Fishing and aquaculture (sector 2), <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> (sector 4), hotels and restaurants (sector 13), other manufacturing industries (8)—as sectors which do not give rise to any risk that can threaten water resources in Morocco, and therefore, do not deserve {{the attention of a}} sustainable water resources management policy. We will be led in fact to formulate erroneous conclusions because these sectors consomme indirectly a sufficiently important amount of water to threaten the sustainability of water supply in Morocco.|$|R
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results of the}} second scenario are summarized {{in the last two}} columns of Table  3. They show that an increase by 20 % of the final demand in sector 2 generates an important additional added value of 9253 Billion Dirham. This increase of the final demand in sector 4 {{had a significant impact on}} several other sectors. In fact, the additional added value created in the sector under study accounts for only 29.5 % of the total generated added value. The remaining 70.5 % is generated by the other economic sectors. This wide range of sectorial variations reveal a high integration <b>of</b> <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> sector in the national economy; in other words, this sector has a high “drag effect” on the total economic production.|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} water use, the second {{scenario}} {{leads to an}} increase of the total water use by 8 %. An interesting result that {{we should point out}} is that {{in the same way that}} added value, the sector 4 had a high “drag effect” on the water use of several other sectors. The total water use of sector 4 has risen by 18.13 %, which accounts for only 3 % of the cumulative effect on water use caused by the final demand scenario. The remaining 97 % is due to the increase of water demand in other sectors. The most sensitive sectors to this final demand scenario are: sector 1 (Agriculture, hunting and forestry), sector 2 (Fishing and aquaculture), sector 9 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> coke, refined petroleum products and nuclear fuel), sector 10 (Electricity, gas and water supply), and sector 6 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and chemical products) (in this other), with an increase in their corresponding water use of 8.53, 6.74, 1.8, 1.64 and 1.59 %, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison of the results provided by the two final demand scenarios reveals a relevant fact. Although the water use <b>of</b> sector 4 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products)</b> accounts for only 1.2 % of the total water use, compared with 87 % in sector 1 (Agriculture, hunting and forestry), an increase of 20 % in sector 1 final demand generates an increase in the total water use which is very close to the increase generated by a 20 % rise of the final demand in sector 4. This is due to the fact that sector 2 consumes a large amount of water indirectly. Indeed, its demand exerts a high influence on the production of the rest of economic sectors. This in turn leads to an increase in their water use. The meaning of these results is as follows. If we take into account only the direct water use <b>of</b> <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> sector in the processes of defining a policy aiming at improving its production by 20 %, we will believe only in an increase of 27.5  hm 3 in the total amount of water consumed by the economy as a whole. In reality, however, this production increase requires an additional amount of water for about 982.40  hm 3.|$|R
40|$|Tobacco {{causes a}} wide {{spectrum}} of diseases. Its use is the world′s leading cause of death accounting for four million deaths per year. There is a general concept among the younger generation that chewing tobacco (spit tobacco, smokeless tobacco) is safe or less harmful than smoking, which has led to an increase in tobacco chewing habit. Chewable tobacco is a greater health hazard having 24 - 30 % higher tobacco content. In addition to oral cancer chewing tobacco leads to impaired functions of heart, nerves, brain and altered hormonal activities. Users <b>of</b> <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> like gutkha, pan parag etc. also present with an increasing incidence of oral submucous fibrosis; of concern is that this is of early onset. In this context patients coming to the OP clinic of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Dental College, Trivandrum were screened for OSF during the period Jan 2003 - Oct 2003.

30|$|Further, {{from the}} {{quantitative}} results {{derived from the}} application of the model to Moroccan economy, {{we have been able to}} draw two relevant conclusions that we will briefly restate. First, the analysis of direct and indirect water uses at sectoral level reveals that, on the one hand, Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector exhibits high direct water use. On the other hand, secondary and tertiary sectors display low direct use and high indirect water use. Typical examples of sectors with high indirect water use are sector 4 (<b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products)</b> and sector 13 (Hotels and restaurants). In addition, we have demonstrated by means of the impact analysis that the economic sectors whose indirect water use coefficients is high have a significant influence on water resources by means of their “drag effect” on the water use of other sectors. So, we have concluded that it is very important to take into account in the processes of policy definition not only the direct water use but also the indirect water use because each change introduced into the production of a sector with high indirect water use will be inevitably reflected on water use of the other sectors and will have, undoubtedly, harmful consequence on the water resources in Morocco.|$|R
40|$|Professor Elliot {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in a panel [hosted in 2003 at the the Canaidan Institute for the Administration of Justice conference] because of a concern {{on the part of the}} conference organizers that, since there are obviously two sides to the dispute between a number of major Canadian and foreign companies engaged in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> and the Government of British Columbia about the constitutionality of British Columbia’s Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act, S. B. C. 2000, c. 30 it would be better for you to hear from representatives of both sides rather than just one. Ross Clark, counsel for one of the foreign companies, Philip Morris Inc., has succinctly summarized the position taken by his client on the issue with which it has been primarily concerned, which is whether the Act should be struck down because it offends the rule of law. [See D. R. CLARK, “British Columbia Tobacco Litigation and the Rule of Law” in in Hughes 2 ̆ 6 Molinari, eds., Participatory Justice in a Global Economy: The New Rule of Law (2004). Professor Elliot was involved on the Government’s side of this dispute for a number of years - in fact since the enactment of the current Act’s predecessor in 1997. He can therefore appropriately be viewed as the representative of that side. In that capacity, he attempts to summarize equally succinctly the position the Government has taken in response to Philip Morris’ submissions on that issue...|$|E
30|$|Second, {{by means}} of the {{economic}} benefits of water use analysis at sectoral level, we have found that the industrial and service sectors display relatively large economic benefits of water use than the agriculture. This leads us to conclude, on the one hand, that Morocco has an economic structure based on sectors that consume a large amount of water, both directly and indirectly. This structure is based mainly on Agriculture, hunting and forestry (sector 1), <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> (sector 4) and hotels and restaurants (sector 8). On the other hand, the greater water saving in Morocco could be made in the Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector. Given Morocco’s limited water resources, if we want to face a sustainable economic development, the agricultural sector should modify the use of water to a great extent by adopting alternative water-saving technology. However, we cannot claim that agricultural water use should give way to other uses relying solely on the added value per unit of water used because. In fact, considered in isolation, this indicator highly inflates the estimated benefit of transferring water from agricultural sectors (with low added value per unit of water used) to industrial sectors (displaying a high added value per unit of water used) (Young 2005). For this reason, affirming such conclusion requires a detailed and comprehensive study that encompasses economic, social and environmental aspects.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{from the}} second and the third columns of Table  4, which list the total {{economic}} benefits of water use coefficient and the economic benefits of water use multiplier (EBWMs), respectively, we can made two interesting observations. On the one hand, we can observe that the Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector had the highest EBWC despite having the lowest DEBC. Its EBWM is of 46.2, which means that for each 1  m 3 of water consumed directly, it generates indirectly 46.21 Dirham of added value. On the other hand and in an inverse way, the economic sectors that have the largest DEBCs show low EBWMs. This situation can be explained as follows: First, the Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector is weakly integrated in the economy, and therefore, it generates a high added value indirectly. As shown {{by means of the}} impact analysis conducted in the previous section, the Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector has an important indirect impact on the added value generated by <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> chemicals and chemical products (sector 6), Mining and quarrying (sector 3), <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> (sector 4), and Electricity, gas and water supply (sector 10). It must also be pointed out that the common feature of these sectors is that they have low DEBCs. Therefore, the high EBWM observed in sector 1 can be attributed to its high added value generated indirectly and to the high economic benefits of water used in those sectors on which it has a greater drag effect.|$|R
30|$|The same {{happens with}} those sectors whose EBWMs are very low, {{but in an}} inverse way. In fact, these sectors are less {{integrated}} in the economy or/and linked to other sector with low DEBCs. 3 An exceptional case, however, is the <b>Manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> sector whose EBWM is {{more than four times}} less than that in Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector although the first is more integrated in the economy then the later. 4 Two arguments can be advanced in order to explain this situation. First, the DEBC of sector 4 is far higher than that of sector 1. Second, if we {{take a closer look at}} sector 4 and at its intersectoral relationships, we will find that this sector is highly linked to sector 1 as purchaser of water from it. Through these results, two important facts arise that we should point out. Firstly, most primary sectors and section that the large share of the added value created indirectly by sector 4 is owned to sector 1. Since sector 1 consumes considerable water resource and its DEBC is tertiary sectors display high economic benefits of water use, except the sectors with relatively low DEBC above mentioned, and the fishery and aquaculture sector. Therefore, they are the sectors that should be encouraged while taking account, however, of their indirect water use. Secondly, Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector exhibits a low added value per unit of water used. Thus, the greater water saving could be made in this sector.|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, Morocco has been {{undergoing}} a strong and fast water demand increase due to demographic upsurge, irrigated agriculture expansion, flourishing foreign trade and changing standard of living and lifestyles. The continued increase of water demand has imposed a height pressure over national scare water resources. Despite this worrying situation, the imperative of sustainable water use and management has created a need for compulsory information to define and implement economic and water-saving policies in an integrated and informed manner. This paper uses an input–output model of water use to analyse the relationships between economic sectors and water resources use in Morocco (i.e. direct water use) {{as well as the}} intersectoral water relationships (i.e. indirect water use). The results show that, on the one hand, Agriculture, hunting and forestry sector exhibits high direct water use. On the other hand, secondary and tertiary sectors display low direct use and high indirect water use. Typical examples of sectors with high indirect water use are <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> food and <b>tobacco</b> <b>products</b> and hotels and restaurants sectors. Further by means of the impact analysis, we have demonstrated that the economic sectors whose indirect water use coefficients are high have a significant influence on water resources by means of their “drag effect” on water use of other sectors. The results highlight the added value of conducting an analysis of the intersectoral water relationships and suggest {{that it is important to}} take into account in the processes of policy definition not only the direct water use but also the indirect water use, because neglecting them could threaten our water resources.|$|R
40|$|In its 2000 {{study on}} the {{polarized}} nature {{of the debate over}} core tobacco policy issues, the American Council on Science and Health observed: A common feature of modern society is the convening of conferences and other forums where traditionally antipathetic parties come together to communicate in a genuine effort to understand one another and resolve lingering distrust and animosity. It is striking that the same cannot yet be said of {{the right and the left}} in the tobacco policy debate, where the opposing camps have engaged in little genuine dialogue. Three years later, the distrust and animosity persist. Important, yet reconcilable, differences on specific tobacco policy questions remain, but some in the industry and the public health community continue to focus on the differences rather than on how to resolve them. A proposal empowering the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to regulate all aspects <b>of</b> the design, <b>manufacture,</b> and distribution <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>products,</b> acknowledged by one of its critics as differing 2 ̆ 2 in only about five percent 2 ̆ 2 from a preferred proposal, is nonetheless excoriated by some leading tobacco control groups as 2 ̆ 2 worse than having no legislation at all, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 not requir[ing] any meaningful changes 2 ̆ 2 in behavior by the industry, and 2 ̆ 2 not even represent[ing] a starting point for further negotiations. 2 ̆ 2 Some in the industry lambaste the same piece of legislation as placing 2 ̆ 2 the future <b>of</b> <b>tobacco</b> farmers and their families at risk, and imposing 2 ̆ 2 a huge regulatory burden that would be difficult, if not impossible, for smaller manufacturers to sustain. 2 ̆ 2 Something here does not compute. How can a single policy option be completely meaningless and, at the same time, threaten to drive an entire industry out of business? We seem to have reached a point where the hostility and rancor developed during nearly fifty years of the so-called 2 ̆ 2 tobacco wars 2 ̆ 2 have reached such a fevered pitch that, even where there are policy solutions with the potential to benefit all parties to the debate, the existence of the battle itself and the desire to sustain it have become ends in themselves. My company, for one, sees no benefit in continued fighting, and would like to find common ground that will both advance public health and permit our tobacco businesses to conduct their operations in a respectful, responsible-and, yes, profitable-way. In this Commentary, I offer a view as to how the current impasse developed, and then explore the possibility of drawing back from the abyss. I first acknowledge the role that the tobacco industry has played in generating an unprecedented level of mistrust within the public health community.
