The reason for this problem is that the AWSM bolt-action is not specifically designed for the fat and long [...]338 Lapua Magnum cartridge. Because of this, ammunition manufacturers produce [...]338 Lapua Magnum cartridges that are loaded short enough (≈ 91.44 mm / 3.600 in) to fit in the AWSM magazines.

5000|$|The [...]450 Watts Magnum was {{designed}} by Watts and Anderson of Washington State.

While the case capacity is slightly more than that of the Lott cartridge, the <b>maximum</b> <b>overall</b> cartridge <b>length</b> is the same.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the {{variant of the}} classical Stable Marriage prob-lem where preference lists can be incomplete and may contain ties.

We also investigate the applicability of a local search algorithm for the problem. Finally, we examine the possibilities for giving an FPT algorithm or an FPT approximation algorithm for nding an egalitarian or a minimum regret matching. ...|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{cartridge}} specifications include neck size, {{bullet weight}} and caliber, <b>maximum</b> pressure, headspace, <b>overall</b> <b>length,</b> case body diameter and taper, shoulder design, rim type, etc. Generally, every {{characteristic of a}} specific cartridge type is tightly controlled and few types are interchangeable in any way. Exceptions do exist but generally, these are only where a shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge {{can be used in}} a longer chamber, (e.g., [...]22 Short in [...]22 Long Rifle chamber, and [...]38 Special in a [...]357 Magnum chamber). Centerfire primer type (Boxer or Berdan, see below) is interchangeable, although not in the same case. Deviation in any of these specifications can result in firearm damage and, in some instances, injury or death. Similarly, use of the wrong type of cartridge in any given gun can damage the gun, or cause bodily injury.|$|R
