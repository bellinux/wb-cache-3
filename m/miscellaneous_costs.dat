The projects record books and personal interviews of the NGOs and Fisheries officers were the main instruments of data collection. Statistical tools such as: range, mean, standard deviation and percentage were employed for analysis of data. The Cobb-Douglas production function model was used to estimate the values of co-efficients and related statistics of production function of fish culture in floodplains. Out of eleven explanatory variables, seven co-efficients had positive sign while only four co-efficients showed negative sign.

The crowdfunding project was intended to raise awareness about the Divan {{as well as to}} fund the restoration project. Before being acquired by the Petersen, this individual car spent many years mounted on a pole outside a Colorado body shop. According to the museum, the Divan's engine and suspension required complete rebuilding while the interior of the car was also in need of replacement. It expected the project to be labor-intensive and replacement parts to be difficult to procure. Chief curator Leslie Kendall notes that $10,000 of the $30,000 budget was to be allotted for bodywork and paint, $7,500 for the engine and other under-the-hood components, $5,000 for the interior, and $7,500 for [...] "other mechanical systems" [...] (including the transmission, suspension, and brakes) as well as <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs.</b> As {{one of only a handful}} of automakers based in Southern California, the Davis Motorcar Company and its vehicles are of particular interest to the museum.

On October 17, 1949, Osborn received a memorandum suggesting that GM ask for $950,000 for the whole train, including the locomotive, as GM was very keen {{to sell the}} whole train as a unit, with any amount offered over the asking price being donated to charity. On October 21, Osborn sent a letter to 29 railroad presidents offering them the opportunity to buy the train. Due to the short length of the Train of Tomorrow and its lack of an identical second train (which would be needed to effectively run an overnight service), purchasing the train was not practical for many railroads, many of which also simply did not have enough capital to make such a purchase. While Osborn's letter asked for all bids to be made to EMD by December 1, the train remained unsold by that date. On March 18, 1950, in an internal memorandum to the railroad's Executive Committee, Union Pacific president A. E. Stoddard recommended purchasing the train for $500,000 and spending another $100,000 on refurbishing it and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs,</b> with the intention of putting it into service between Portland and Seattle. According to the memorandum, GM had received a number of bids for the train but was willing to sell it for $500,000, which according to Morgan meant that [...] "either all the bids were lower or the other bidders were after individual pieces of the equipment and EMD decided not to sell cars individually."

They can cause morbidity and mortality for patients and controlling these costs substantial amounts of funds and resources. However, how much is unclear. This study sets out to provide a comparable overview of the costs of multiple outbreaks in a single academic hospital in the Netherlands. Methods Based on interviews with the involved staff, multiple databases and stored records from the Infection Prevention Division all actions undertaken, extra staff employment, use of resources, bed-occupancy rates, and other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>cost</b> drivers during different outbreaks were scored and quantified into Euros. This led to total costs per outbreak and an estimated average cost per positive patient per outbreak day. Results Seven outbreaks that occurred between 2012 and 2014 in the hospital were evaluated. Total costs for the hospital ranged between € 10, 778 and € 356, 754. Costs per positive patient per outbreak day, ranged between € 10 and € 1, 369 (95 % CI: € 49 -€ 1, 042), with a mean of € 546 and a median of € 519.

In the report, the evident distinction is made between discrete-time models and continuous-time models, but also between very specific models with long range dependence characteristics as opposed to the classical queueing models. First, an overview is given of the work of COST 257 on classical discrete-time queueing models. Some general relationships for discrete-time single-server queues with a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queueing discipline are introduced and four specific discrete-time models are presented. Three models are analyzed by means of a generating-functions approach, for the other model an iterative algorithm is used. Second, two classical continuous-time queueing models are discussed. Next, queueing problems related to long range dependent input processes are addressed. Also, the queueing analysis of some specific network elements is discussed.

30|$|Modeling of the WDS {{infrastructure}} {{is used to}} represent the physical WDS elements that allow water to be supplied from sources to consumers. An accurate representation of the critical elements of the actual WDS is required if costs and GHG emissions are to be estimated accurately. These elements are represented within the WDS infrastructure sub-component, and include the pumps that supply water to the system [W 1 – See Figure  1]; the pump rising mains [W 3] that connect the pumps to the distribution pipe network; the water storage systems [W 4], which can include either reservoirs or tanks; the gravity mains that distribute water from water storages to the demand nodes [W 5]; and the demand nodes, which represent the consumer demands placed on the WDS [W 6]. Water demand patterns [W 9] of the WDS being modeled are used within the hydraulic simulation process to consider the real-world water demands. A water demand profile [S 2] can represent multiple water demand patterns for different demand node requirements (e.g. residential, commercial and industrial). A combination of multiple water demand patterns {{can also be used}} to represent different water demand scenarios, such as different seasons in a year. While peak and average water demand flows are commonly used when simulating a WDS, it can be important to consider a range of operational conditions in order to obtain the most accurate estimate of operational costs and GHG emissions. Additionally, it can also be important to consider exceptional water demand circumstances, such as fire loadings and pipe breakages. As water demands drive the system hydraulics, an accurate representation of both water demands and the physical infrastructure can help to obtain an accurate estimation of the pumping operational energy required to meet the demands. Additionally, accurate representation of the physical {{infrastructure is}} important if design related costs and GHG emissions are to be accurately estimated. Other aspects of a WDS, such as infrastructure maintenance and replacement, <b>miscellaneous</b> running <b>costs</b> (e.g. electricity for lighting at pump stations) and labor costs are not usually able to be included as part of the hydraulic simulation and are therefore not represented by the WDS infrastructure sub-component of the conceptual framework presented in this paper.|$|R

While controversial, some feel that recent multicenter randomized controlled trials have codified clinical equipoise between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS). MethodsA retrospective analysis of hospital cost and 30 -day clinical outcomes was performed on patients undergoing CEA and CAS between January 1, 2008 and September 30, 2010 at a single tertiary referral institution. Cost, not charges, of the index hospitalization was divided into supply, labor, facility, and <b>miscellaneous</b> categories. All <b>costs</b> were normalized to 2010 values. ResultsA total of 306 patients underwent either CEA (n = 174) or CAS (n = 132). Mean hospital cost for CAS was $ 9426 ± $ 5776 while CEA cost was $ 6734 ± $ 3935 (P <. 0001). This cost differential was driven by the significantly higher direct supply costs for CAS ($ 5634) vs CEA ($ 1967) (P ≤. 0001). The higher costs for CAS were seen consistently in symptomatic, asymptomatic, elective, and urgent subgroups. Patients undergoing CAS who were enrolled in a trial or registry (53. 8 %) incurred significantly less cost ($ 7779 ± $ 3525) {{compared to those who}} were not ($ 11, 279 ± $ 7114; P =. 0004). Patients undergoing CEA trended toward a higher prevalence of being symptomatic (44. 8 %) compared to CAS (34. 0 %; P =. 058). Age was not significantly different between patients undergoing CEA and CAS (70. 2 vs 72. 0, respectively; P =. 36). Coronary artery disease was more common in patients undergoing CAS (60. 3 % vs 39 %; P =. 0001). The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes was not significantly different between cohorts. Thirty-day combined stroke/death/myocardial infarction rate was 2. 3 % (4 of 174) in the CEA group and 3. 8 % (5 of 132) in the CAS group, P =. 5. Overall length of stay (LOS) was 2. 1 days in both groups (P =. 9). LOS was higher for urgent interventions (7. 3 - 7. 5 days) and symptomatic status (2. 9 - 3. 5 days) when compared to patients treated electively (1. 3 - 1. 4 days). ConclusionsTreatment of carotid disease with CAS was 40 % more costly than CEA and did not provide better clinical outcomes or a reduction in LOS. These trends were consistent in symptomatic, asymptomatic, urgent, and elective subgroups At present, CAS cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment for carotid disease...|$|R
30|$|The cost of Ni(II) {{removal from}} {{wastewater}} originating {{from various sources}} in general is expensive; for comparison sake, activated carbon-based removal of nickel costs around $ 750 (average) per ton [34] using various waste. Its carbon derivatives for nickel removal depend on availability, and its removal efficiency, which is PPP here, was obtained freely as the pod is usually discarded as a waste. The cost of this adsorbent material can be fixed at $ 40 /ton after taking into account expenses on transportation, chemicals, electricity, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs.</b> The performance of the adsorbent was comparable with other low-cost absorbents cited in the literature (Table[*] 2).|$|E
40|$|Background: Acquired {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (AIDS) {{is caused}} by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is an RNA virus. The first case of AIDS in human beings was reported in 1981, and now spread of HIV infection is alarmingly high with around 20 million deaths. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the cost distribution of antiretroviral therapy among autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient attending the anti-retroviral therapy (ART) center of the tertiary care center. Methods: The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the cost distribution of antiretroviral therapy among AIDS patient attending the ART center of the tertiary care center. The study was retrospective, 20 patients included in different age groups and categories the cost incurred toward patients were divided under different heads: medication, laboratory diagnosis, transport, and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs.</b> Results: It was found that major part of the cost is spent on drugs. The cost of transport and lab diagnosis varied based on age and stage of the disease. <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>costs</b> were also high and were proportional to other costs. Conclusion: HIV infected population is more likely to have a lower socioeconomic status which has varied effect on the effectiveness of highly active ART. Some of the problems faced by them are access to health care, transport, economic instability, etc. all these factors have an impact on outcome of treatment. Overall it can be found that preventive measure than treating has better impact on quality of life. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2015; 4 (5. 000) : 951 - 955...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} the POMA-BROILER Model, a computer simulation developed {{to evaluate the}} optimal market age of broilers. This model {{was written in the}} Visual BASIC programming language and uses the windows operating system. The model was developed from a Sensitivity Analysis Method and is based on the concept that marginal cost must not exceed marginal return. It uses various input data including feed information (Crude Protein (CP), Metabolisable Energy (ME) and feeding stages) an equation for the feed conversion ratio, cost conditions (chicks, feed, labour, water and power, medical treatment, depreciation and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs)</b> and a growth regression equation. The model then compares the calculated results with the range for acceptable market weight. The marginal cost and marginal return are calculated every day to determine the decision-making point for maximum profit. These results could represent a valuable reference for use in adjusting the strategy for broiler production and management...|$|E

The purpose was to minimize the inter-cell movement and other <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs.</b> Machine replication, cell’s size, sequence of operations, and reconfiguration are considered as constraints of the model. Mehdizadeh and Rahimi (2016) proposed an integrated mathematical model to tackle the dynamic cell formation problem by simultaneous consideration of inter-/intra-cell layout problems with machine duplication and operator assignment. The presented mathematical formulation consists of three main objectives in which the first one aims to minimize the inter-/intra-cell part movements, the second objective minimizes machine and operator costs, {{and the last one}} increases consecutive forward flow ratio. Rabbania et al. (2017) {{presented a}} new dynamic cell formation problem, where some new concepts such as lucky parts were introduced. Lucky parts are parts which are allowed to be produced in a specific period. Moreover, purchasing and selling of machines taking into account their book values were taken into consideration.|$|E

All feedout groups were calculated for feedlot profit using standardized feed and yardage costs, yet using their actual health treatment costs and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>costs.</b> CVDOF is calculated using carcass weight gain per day during the feeding period and adjusting that for red meat yield using the percent retail product equation. This result is then put on a monetary basis by using a carcass price adjusted for carcass quality and yield grade. CVDOF when tested for its relationship to feedlot profitability was highly significant and accounted for 74 percent {{of the variation in}} profit. If one desires a ranking equation in the 4 -H beef performance carcass program that relates well to feedlot profitability then CVDOF proves to be quite effective...|$|E
