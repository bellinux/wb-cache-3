5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> real genius in getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (née Jenyns, spelt Jennings in {{most modern}} references; 5 June 1660 (Old Style)– 18 October 1744) rose {{to be one}} of the most {{influential}} women of her time through her close friendship with Queen Anne of Great Britain. Sarah's friendship and influence with Princess Anne was widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her in the hope that she would influence Anne to comply with requests. As a result, by the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government, and intimacy with the Queen, had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} was not recorded, {{but it probably}} involved replacing the blood {{with a mixture of}} turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

5|$|Fatale {{observes the}} actions of the New Champions as its newest member. She feels uncomfortable {{replacing}} a popular, deceased member and unworthy of belonging to a superhero group, but she proves herself to be highly competent and earns the respect of her teammates. Fatale's closest friend on the team is another new member, Lily, a reformed supervillain and former girlfriend of Dr. Impossible. Fatale contrasts Dr. Impossible's flashbacks by having no memory of her life before the accident in Brazil that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> cyborg, with her exposition coming from her new experiences with the other superheroes. During the investigation, she discovers that the corporation that transformed her into a cyborg was a front for Dr. Impossible during one of his previous plans.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E
5|$|In the Augustan History, Zenobia {{is said to}} {{have been}} a {{descendant}} of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the Souda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the Greek sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra. According to modern scholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legend, there is no evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra; it may have been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her. Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> legitimate successor to the Ptolemies' throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are apocryphal.|$|E

5|$|Pickford {{was born}} Gladys Louise Smith in Toronto and began acting {{on stage in}} 1900. She started her film career in the United States in 1909. Initially with the Biograph film company, {{she moved to the}} Independent Motion Picture Company (IMP) in 1911, then briefly to the Majestic Film Company later that same year, {{followed}} by a return to Biograph in 1912. After appearing in over 150 short films during her years with these studios she began working in features with Zukor's Famous Players Film Company, a studio which eventually became part of Paramount Pictures. By 1916 Pickford's popularity had climbed to the point that she was awarded a contract that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> partner with Zukor and allowed her to produce her own films. In 1919 Pickford teamed with D.W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, and Douglas Fairbanks to create United Artists, an organization designed to distribute their own films. Following the release of Secrets (1933) Pickford retired from acting in motion pictures. However, she remained active as a producer for several years afterwards. She sold her stock in United Artists in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|Triton had {{a number}} of {{attributes}} that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> potential NECPA platform. Her size allowed ample room for additional shipboard systems and personnel accommodations. Her designed speed provided the capability for rapid transit, and her nuclear power plant offered virtually unlimited endurance and range. The Combat Information Center (CIC) provided substantial command and control capabilities as did the communication buoy system that could receive and send radio transmissions while submerged. As she was a submarine, Triton offered superior protection against nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) contaminants over surface ships or an airborne command centre. However, the record remains unclear if such an explicit NECPA conversion was ever undertaken for Triton.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Audrey Hepburn (4 May 1929– 20 January 1993) was a British {{actress who}} had an {{extensive}} career in film, television, and on the stage from 1948 to 1993. Considered {{by some to be}} one of the most beautiful women of all time, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute. Hepburn is also remembered as both a film and style icon. Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film Dutch in Seven Lessons. Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals High Button Shoes (1948), and Sauce Tartare (1949). Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play Gigi. Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) opposite Gregory Peck <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> star. For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture– Drama. In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Sabrina opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In the same year Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play Ondine.|$|E
5|$|While escaping, Jack and Joanna are {{attacked}} by a dataDyne assault team assisted by Killian in a dropship. Joanna manages to kill Killian and escape with Sekhar, but Jack is captured by dataDyne. With the help of Sekhar, Joanna learns that her father has been taken to a mansion in China, where Zhang Li lives. Joanna infiltrates the mansion and finds her father in a cell. He has been tortured, and begins speaking gibberish to her, an after effect of the neurodrive. The pair fights {{their way out of}} the complex, but their extraction is interrupted by Zhang Li's daughter, Mai Hem, who kills Jack before Joanna escapes in a hovercraft. Joanna and Sekhar decide to pursue Zeigler's lead and seek out Dr. Caroll, who works aboard a research platform on the Pacific Ocean. Upon meeting with Joanna, Dr. Caroll uses a neurodrive to extract Zeigler's data from Joanna's memory, which she gained when she rescued her father. Soon after, Sekhar betrays Joanna and shoots Dr. Caroll, revealing that she decided to join dataDyne because Zhang Li had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> large offer. A team of Carrington Institute agents saves Joanna, but Sekhar ultimately escapes with the data.|$|E
