50|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>trains</b> {{were once}} {{prolific}} in New Zealand. Although express trains operated {{on the main}} lines, it was often not profitable to run dedicated passenger services on rural branch lines and they were served solely by <b>mixed</b> <b>trains.</b> On the more significant provincial routes, {{it was not unusual}} for a dedicated passenger express to operate during seasons of peak traffic volume and for <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> to provide service during off-peak periods, such {{as in the case of}} the Rotorua Express in the late 19th century, or for the provincial express to operate twice or thrice weekly while mixed services ran daily, as in the case of the Taneatua Express.|$|R
25|$|Other steam {{locomotives}} in GTW's fleet at {{the time}} included the Mikado type 2-8-2s built by Baldwin Locomotive Works and Alco primarily used in mainline freight service. 4-6-2 Pacific type and 4-8-2 Mountain type locomotives also built by Baldwin and Alco in the 1920s and 4-6-0 Ten-Wheelers built around 1900 began in mainline service but later were eventually both found mostly on branch lines and <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> service. GTW also had {{a variety of other}} models of steam engines including several 0-8-0 and 0-6-0 switching locomotives used to move rolling stock around rail yards.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{occurred when}} the layers of colloidal clay and gravel in the embankment that had been cut into the hill gave way. Shortly afterwards, a <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> consisting of a locomotive and ten cars came down the tracks, falling down the embankment and landing on the road below. Of the passengers and crew on board that night, 41 people were injured and at least 42 were killed or died later from injuries sustained in the crash. It is unclear how many died in the derailment {{compared to those who}} died in the blaze that followed it. Many of the passengers were burned alive as the unreinforced wooden cars caught fire, killing those who had survived the crash itself but were still trapped in the wreckage.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{traffic was}} sawn timber and firewood, with many sawmills located {{adjacent}} to the railway, or accessed by short tramways. Seasonally heavy potato traffic and a lime kiln added to revenue. Traffic grew to require up to 7 trains a day each way by the mid-1920s. The introduction of the Garratt locomotive allowed a new timetable with two trains each way between Colac and Beech Forest, and a third train each way to Gellibrand. The Crowes branch saw a single <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> daily. The arrival of the Great Depression and competition from motor vehicles saw traffic decline {{to a point where}} only one train each way operated over the line three days a week. Increased wartime loadings saw traffic increase to two trains each way daily, however this improvement was only temporary. By the time the railway closed, the timetable listed only one train each way a week, and most of the traffic was pulpwood.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>trains</b> {{were more}} {{prolific}} in the South Island {{as it had}} the majority of New Zealand's rural branch lines, but as private car ownership increased, passenger figures decreased and many rural trains ceased to cater for passengers in the 1930s, although some mixed services lasted into the 1960s in isolated regions with poor roads. In the North Island, the last <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> operated into the 1970s, such as the service provided on the North Auckland Line that ran until 1976. <b>Mixed</b> <b>trains</b> in a sense returned to the South Island {{for a few years}} in the 1990s, when a few wagons of express containerised freight were attached to the TranzCoastal express that operates between Christchurch and Picton. However, this was much unlike the <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> of previous decades that performed lots of shunting en route and operated slowly; the TranzCoastal did not perform shunting as it was expected to maintain its passenger timetable and convey its time-sensitive freight swiftly between Picton's port and Christchurch.|$|R

25|$|For {{approximately}} 53km kilometers {{the line}} {{run in the}} open, usually on embankments (in the Main valley) or in cuttings. The height of the embankments is limited to 15metres {{and the depth of}} the cuttings is limited to 20metres (under DB Directive836). Bridges and tunnels are built where these limits cannot be met. According to the introduction of 1997 EBA Directive Anforderungen des Katastrophenschutzes an den Bau und den Betrieb von Eisenbahntunneln ("requirements of disaster relief for the construction and operation of railway tunnels), railway tunnels that are at least 1000metres long am are used in mixed operation of passenger trains and freight trains must be operated as two separate single-track tubes. In coordination with the Federal Government, the states, the EBA and Deutsche Bahn, a concept was developed for the high-speed line with two tracks running through single tunnels, which allows a <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> operation to be carried out on the line. The ETCS train safety system that has been used since 1997 prohibits the operation of passenger and freight trains together as a fail-safe. According to the Federal Audit Office in 2014, {{it is not clear how}} this ban on trains meeting in tunnels should be implemented. Where necessary, measures mitigating tunnel boom are also built in the portal area.|$|E
500|$|Competition from interurbans, {{specifically}} the Cincinnati-Lebanon Interurban Railway and Terminal Company, took away passengers from the CL beginning in 1903. But the interurban began to decline, {{going out of}} business in 1922, and it was motor vehicles that would kill the CL's passenger service. The first line to go was the Middletown Branch, discontinued in 1917; the short branch to Montgomery became freight-only in 1926. All service north of Lebanon ended in 1928, and in 1931 only one <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> between Court Street and Lebanon was left on the schedule. The less-convenient Cincinnati Union Terminal replaced Court Street in 1933, as agreed upon by all railroads participating in its construction. CL trains reached the station via trackage rights on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (ex-M) south of East Norwood. This was never popular among CL riders, and the last scheduled passenger train on the former CL ran on January 31, 1934. With passenger service gone, and several cross-connections to other Pennsylvania lines, the CL was no longer needed as a through route. Several years after the Montgomery Branch was fully abandoned in 1933, the Pennsylvania discontinued freight service between Blue Ash and Mason and between Lebanon and Lytle; trains continued to reach Lebanon via the Little Miami Railroad and Middletown Branch. Service was resumed on the entire line during World War II, but the Lebanon-Lytle segment was torn up in 1952. After the Pennsylvania merged into Penn Central in 1968, a [...] piece north from Brecon was again abandoned, as was the short piece of the Middletown Branch east of the main line at Hageman, with Lebanon service now coming from the ex-New York Central at Middletown. The line through the Deer Creek Valley into Court Street was also abandoned, and the old freight depot was torn down in 1975.|$|E
500|$|The Stanhope and Tyne Railway, a [...] {{line between}} South Shields and Stanhope had opened in 1834. Steam {{locomotives}} worked the section east of Annfield, {{and in the}} western section inclines were worked by stationary engines or gravity, with horses hauling waggons over level track. The lime kilns and the line between Stanhope and Carrhouse closed in 1840, and with the Stanhope to Annfield section losing money, the insolvent railway company was dissolved on 5 February 1841. The northern section became the Pontop and South Shields Railway and the southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was bought by the newly formed Derwent Iron Company at Consett, renamed the Wear & Derwent Railway, and used to transport limestone from quarries in the Stanhope area to its works at Consett. The Weardale Extension Railway ran from Waskerley on the Wear & Derwent to Crook on the BA and included the Sunniside Incline worked by a stationary engine. Sponsored by the Derwent Iron Company, the [...] line was built by the S and opened on 16 May 1845. A passenger service started to Hownes Gill and Stanhope (Crawley) on 1 September 1845; the Stanhope service was withdrawn {{at the end of}} 1846. Travelling north from Crook the carriages and waggons were drawn up the Sunniside Incline, a locomotive hauled the <b>mixed</b> <b>train</b> to Waskerley Park Junction, then they were let down Nanny Mayor's Incline and a locomotive took them forward. When returning, regulations required that the carriages run loose down the Sunniside Incline and they were let to run into Crook station, controlled by the guard using the carriage brakes. Later, a [...] viaduct replaced the two inclines at Hownes Gill ravine on 1 July 1858. A deviation replacing Nanny's Mayor's Incline and a curve that allowed trains from Crook direct access to Rowley opened for freight on 23 May 1859 and for passenger traffic on 4 July 1859.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{passenger}} {{service on}} the Marton - New Plymouth Line was the New Plymouth Express between Wellington and New Plymouth. It was augmented by three slower <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> that ran south from New Plymouth daily. In 1926, patronage was sufficiently high to justify replacing one of the <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> with a dedicated passenger service between New Plymouth and Wanganui. This train {{came to be known}} as the Taranaki Flyer.|$|R
50|$|The 1911 {{timetable}} shows a {{more frequent}} but complicated service with most trains running as passenger only, {{the actual number}} of trains varying depending {{on the day of the}} week.

Sundays saw 5 passenger and 2 <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> to Barnoldswick with 6 passenger trains from but no <b>mixed</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|Passenger {{services}} {{were introduced in}} 1900 and replaced with <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> in 1917, with passenger trains only running during holiday periods.

The passenger trains were again replaced with <b>mixed</b> <b>trains</b> in 1951, in turn replaced with Vulcan Railcars in 1956. The railcar run was cut back to Alexandra in May 1958 and railcars ceased running on 25 April 1976.|$|R
500|$|The Toledo, Delphos and Burlington Railroad (TD), {{a growing}} [...] narrow gauge system with {{roots in the}} town of Delphos, would finally give Lebanon its rail line. Together with a group of {{suburban}} Cincinnati investors, the TD bought the unfinished grade at the foreclosure sale for $61,000 and incorporated the [...] narrow gauge Cincinnati Northern Railway as its successor on June 8, 1880. (The TD would also acquire the Dayton and South Eastern in February 1881.) At first the TD and Cincinnati-area residents shared stock and management equally, but soon this was changed so that the former party would control all the stock for ease in future consolidation, and the latter would locally manage the road. As the TD {{was in the process of}} building into Dayton from the north, it was decided that the new company would not use the grade all the way to Waynesville. Instead, the TD would construct a connection from the D at a point they called Lebanon Junction, now inside Dayton near the intersection of Woodman and Rainier Drives, to the small village of Dodds. There the Cincinnati Northern would begin, following the Miami Valley's route through Lebanon to Cincinnati. Construction resumed in late 1880, and proceeded rapidly thanks to funding from Ohio and Northeastern capitalists. <b>Mixed</b> <b>train</b> operations between Lebanon and Norwood, where connections could be made with the M, began on May 30, 1881, and on September 5 the line was opened south to a streetcar connection at Oak Street, just north of the tunnel. Service was extended through the tunnel to the Eden Park entrance on January 12, 1882, and on February 13 a temporary Cincinnati depot opened just north of Court Street. With the completion of the TD's branch from Lebanon Junction to Dodds in December 1881, the Cincinnati-Dayton line was finally complete; Jackson County coal was first shipped over it in February 1882. Two short branches to the suburbs of Montgomery and Avondalethe latter built separately as the Spring Grove, Avondale and Cincinnati Railway (SGA)opened on November 14, 1881 and July 1, 1882, respectively. C operations to Court Street began by April 1882, using the Cincinnati Northern south of a junction at Idlewild, and in October the Cincinnati Northern laid tracks across that street into its permanent depot at the southeast corner of the Broadway Street intersection.|$|E
