40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzed}} heterotypic schooling behavior and protective mimicry relationships involving {{species of the}} genus Haemulon and other coral reef fishes on coastal reefs at Tamandaré, Pernambuco State, Northeastern Brazil. The work was performed during 35 hours of direct observation using the "focal animal" method. The observed events involved 14 species of reef fish in eight different families. The phenomenon of <b>mixed</b> <b>schooling</b> appeared {{to be related to}} the large number of individuals of the genus Haemulon present in reef environments and to the tendency of individuals with limited populations to try to aggregate in schools (e. g. genus Scarus) ...|$|E
40|$|A presumed {{example of}} {{protective}} mimicry between the yellow goatfish, Mulloidichthys martinicus (Mullidae) and the smallmouth grunt, Haemulon chrysargyreum (Haemulidae) is described from Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, NE Brazil. The goatfish and the grunt share a similar overall shape and colour pattern. We {{found that these}} two species regularly form mixed schools around reefs. Additionally, when chased small groups of yellow goatfish join schools of smallmouth grunts and behave like them. The colour and shape resemblances between the two species enable their <b>mixed</b> <b>schooling,</b> and enhance the protection against visually oriented predators for both of them. Thus, we suggest that the protective association herein reported for the goatfish and the grunt may {{be considered as a}} &# 8220;social mimicry&# 8221;, since neither species is venomous, poisonous or strongly armed. Furthermore, we suggest that additional instances of social mimicry may involve the yellow goatfish and other striped Haemulon species...|$|E

The institution had undertaken the function of being the pilot school in the transition to a system of <b>mixed</b> <b>schooling</b> which had enabled for Muslim and Non-Muslim students to be educated together. As well as providing the children to read and write at a basic level during their education, it had contributed for them to become adequate individuals financially by receiving such an education that they had become craftsmen in popular occupations of the era as of leather trade, tailoring and shoemaking. Children who had committed crimes at an early age were prevented form being imprisoned together with adults and were detained in the reformatory with their peers. Thus, while they had served time, the environment had positively contributed to their growing up to be qualified adult...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} dissertation is to explore the Educate Together sector, the multidenominational primary school movement in the Republic of Ireland. This multilevel exploration looks at the role of Educate Together in a pluralist Ireland, the challenges presented by the accelerated growth of the sector, the values that underpin the schools in the sector {{and in particular the}} relevance of what is termed the Core Curriculum. The background to the research is the prior work conducted with the sector in 1998. The work presented here is an account of {{the second phase of the}} research, which attempts to examine in greater detail some of the key issues that arose in the earlier work. Through a co-operative inquiry that involves a wide range of Voices within Educate Together, the research identifies a number of key issues that have arisen for the sector between 2000 and 2006. The work examines the concept of <b>mixed</b> <b>schooling</b> that underpinned the Irish National School system in the 1830 ’s, the gradual erosion of this system and its replacement by denominational schools and the emergence of the Educate Together sector in the 1970 ’s. Using a form of co-operative inquiry the research identifies the importance of Educate Together in an intercultural Ireland, the impact of this form of inclusive education on the children who attend the schools and the design and development of “Learn Together: An Ethical Education Curriculum for Educate Together Schools”. The final section of the research examines the impact of this curriculum at national and international level and in particular the strengthening of the relationship between the Colleges of Education and Educate Together. The study offers a unique insight into an important partner in Irish education...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{begins with}} the {{question}} of whether socially and ethnically <b>mixed</b> <b>schooling</b> leads to mixed friendships. Located within a policy agenda promoting community cohesion and the benefits of mixed communities, this thesis examines the urban school as a key site of social mix, critically exploring mixing amongst urban youth. Challenging policy rhetoric's static concept of mixing and cohesion, a key contribution of this thesis is to explore mixing as a social process, attending to social class and gender as well as race in shaping young people's evolving friendship-making. Drawing on small-scale, discursively informed, interview-based, research with 16 - 19 year aids in two socially and ethnically mixed London schools, this thesis aims to examine the patterns of young people's friendships. This thesis investigates the socia-spatial, institutional and discursive processes which lead to differentiation, stratification or mixing in these friendships. The overarching contribution of this thesis is to understand friendship-making as a classed process. I argue that social mixing is a form of social capital/resource accumulation, a process in which some classed, raced and gendered bodies have more exchange value than others. To begin, I show how different demographics of schools constrain and enable the discursive production of the school as space for social mixing, and moreover how this is intimately connected to academic inclusivity or exclusivity. I then show how urban school-based subcultures are implicated in the production, maintenance and regulation of gendered, classed and racialised identities, which constrains the possibilities for mixing. Exploring the located, micro-politics of social mixing in urban schools - of those who mix across borders and boundaries of class and race- I show how certain favoured learner identities allow the acceptable minority ethnic Other more easily into privileged White middle class friendship groups in the school, while Black working class students are more constrained in sustaining White middle class friendships and hence, the promise of social mobility. Finally, through analysis of the 'misfits' -students who are outside of subculture in the school- I argue that, while a space of exclusion, this is a space of non-normative productions of race, gender and social class and is the hidden space where there is potential for 'real' mixing to take place. Here, I propose that, in this transgressive space of mixing, use-value comes to the fore, and has potential for the production of an alternative kind of self.
