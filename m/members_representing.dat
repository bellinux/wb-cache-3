5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution.

Its 53 <b>members,</b> <b>representing</b> the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations.

The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state {{would not be able}} to act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
