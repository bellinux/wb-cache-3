5|$|Unlike many Banksia species, B.telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B.telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why B.telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B.telmatiaea are not released immediately {{after the passage of}} a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{this most}} of the {{vineyards}} in Argentina are planted on ungrafted rootstock. There are many theories about why phylloxera has not yet reach {{this part of the}} world. The centuries-old tradition of flood irrigation where water is allowed to deeply saturate the soil <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> as is the high proportion of sand present in the soil. The relative isolation of Argentina is also cited as a potential benefit against phylloxera with the country's wine regions being bordered by mountains, deserts and oceans that create natural barriers against the spread of the louse. Despite the minimal risk of phylloxera, some producers are switching to grafted rootstock that provide better yield control.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a skilled}} swordsman, Sparrow prefers {{to use his}} {{superior}} intelligence during combat, exploiting his environment to turn the tables on his foes, reasoning [...] "Why fight when you can negotiate?" [...] He uses strategies of non-violent negotiation and turning his enemies against each other. He invokes parleys and tempts his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he does when he persuades Barbossa to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the Royal Navy. He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies, and {{it is suggested that}} his pacifism <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Barbossa and the crew of the Black Pearl mutinied.|$|E
500|$|Another side of West Coast jazz {{that also}} came under {{critical}} fire was {{music in a}} lighter style, intended for popular consumption. Manne made contributions here too. Best known is the series of albums he recorded with pianist André Previn and with members of his groups, based on music from popular Broadway shows, movies, and television programs. (The first and most successful of these was the My Fair Lady album based on songs from the musical, recorded by Previn, Manne, and bassist Leroy Vinnegar in 1956.) The recordings for the Contemporary label, with each album devoted to a single musical, are in a light, immediately appealing style aimed at popular taste, which did not always go over well with aficionados of [...] "serious" [...] jazz, which <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Manne has been frequently overlooked in accounts of major jazz drummers of the 20th century. Much of the music produced on the West Coast in those years, as Robert Gordon concedes, was in fact imitative and [...] "lacked the fire and intensity associated with the best jazz performances". But Gordon {{also points out that}} there is a level of musical sophistication, as well as an intensity and [...] "swing", in the music recorded by Manne with Previn and Vinnegar (and later Red Mitchell) that is missing in the many lackluster albums of this type produced by others in that period.|$|E
50|$|There <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{many reasons}} {{as to why}} age-hypogamous {{relationships}} are not very frequent. Sexual double standards in society <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> particular <b>reason</b> as to why women do not exhibit as many age-hypogamous relationships in comparison to age-hypergamous relationships. Women also experience a double standard regarding the effects of ageing. In comparison to male sexuality, it considered that ageing in women is associated with decreased sex appeal and dating potential.|$|R

2500|$|Researchers {{who believe}} that grammar is learned rather than innate, have {{hypothesized}} that language learning results from general cognitive abilities and the interaction between learners and their human interactants.

2500|$|The {{similarity}} with Endgame <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Beckett did {{not attempt}} to develop the play further and why he published it at a much later date among the ‘odds’. “Several passages make one suspect … that Beckett may have sensed that the dangers of repetition or self-parody were too great to allow him to complete or release the play [...] earlier.” Many scholars suggest that the room in which Endgame is staged is a post-war fallout shelter and that the nothingness observed outside is a result of a nuclear winter; [...] a similar view can be just as easily taken of Rough for Theatre I.|$|E

[...] Mao's personal physician, Li Zhisui, later recorded that doctors responsible for Kang's treatment at Beijing Hospital told him that Kang was suffering from schizophrenia.

2500|$|Since 1953, {{most of the}} faculties {{have been}} {{situated}} on Sparrow Hills, in the southwest of Moscow, 5km from the city center. The main building was designed by architect Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev. In the post-war era, Joseph Stalin ordered seven huge tiered neoclassic towers to be built around the city. It was built using Gulag labour, as were many of Stalin's Great Construction Projects in Russia. Located on Moscow's outskirts {{at the time of}} its construction, the location of the main building is now about half-way between the center of Moscow at the Kremlin and the city's current limits. The Journalism Department now occupies the university's original location in downtown Moscow across from the Manezh, steps from the Kremlin and other government buildings. [...] Indeed, frequent student unrest, including street protests, well pre-dating 1917 <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why Stalin's planners sited the university across the Moscow River, so far away.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} Prestwick {{was the only}} Scottish airport allowed to operate a transatlantic link, {{largely due to the}} benign weather conditions on the Ayrshire coast. Having a much lower incidence of fog than any other airport in the United Kingdom due to a geographical anomaly, Glasgow Prestwick has the reputation of being [...] "Britain's only fog-free airport". For this reason it is often used as a diversionary airport when weather conditions close aviation hubs elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Heavy snowfall in the severe winters of 2009 and 2010–2011 resulted in large numbers of intercontinental flights bound for London Heathrow and elsewhere being diverted to Prestwick. This <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> Prestwick managed to avoid total closure when it appeared that BAA were running down its operations. It was also partly a political decision to silence those that questioned why Glasgow needed two airports when Glasgow Corporation had already invested money building Glasgow International Airport.|$|E
