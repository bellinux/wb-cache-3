5|$|By {{relying on}} the written works of both Christian and Muslim authors, oral traditions, and modern methods of anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics, Mohammed Hassen, Associate Professor of History at Georgia State University, asserts that the largely non-Christian Oromo people have interacted and lived among the Semitic-speaking Christian Amhara people {{since at least the}} 14th century, not the 16th century as is {{commonly}} accepted in both traditional and recent Ethiopian historiography. His work also stresses Ethiopia's need to properly integrate its Oromo population {{and the fact that the}} Cushitic-speaking Oromo, despite their traditional reputation as invaders, were significantly involved in maintaining the cultural, political, and <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> of the Christian state.|$|E
5|$|Plunging {{itself through}} an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan adopted Western political, {{judicial}} and <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> and Western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization. The Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict {{to expand its}} sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.|$|E

5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and <b>military</b> <b>institutions.</b> As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E
5|$|While {{development}} is now tightly controlled {{in the vicinity}} of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.|$|E

25|$|In 1827, Ioannis Kapodistrias, from Corfu, {{was chosen}} by the Third National Assembly at Troezen as the first {{governor}} of the First Hellenic Republic. Kapodistrias established a series of state, economic and <b>military</b> <b>institutions.</b> Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent conference a year later, the Great Powers of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince Otto von Wittelsbach as monarch. One of his first actions was to transfer the capital from Nafplio to Athens. In 1843 an uprising forced the king to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.|$|E

25|$|Kingston's economy {{gradually}} {{evolved from}} an industrial to an institutional base after World War II. Queen's University grew from about 2,000 {{students in the}} 1940s to its present size of over 20,000 students, more than 90 per cent of which are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of St. Lawrence College was established in 1967, and the college has over 4,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, <b>military</b> <b>institutions,</b> and prison installations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{arguments}} {{have been}} made for and against space colonization. The two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human civilization and the biosphere {{in the event of}} a planetary-scale disaster (natural or man-made), and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society. The most common objections to colonization include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful, including major economic and <b>military</b> <b>institutions,</b> and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as wars, economic inequality, and environmental degradation.|$|E
25|$|An ongoing power {{struggle}} {{between church and}} state grew increasingly heated and lasted for decades. Originating as a feud between the Rev. Serra and Pedro Fages (the military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, who regarded the Spanish installations in California as <b>military</b> <b>institutions</b> first and religious outposts second), the uneasy relationship persisted for more than sixty years. Dependent upon one another for their very survival, military leaders and mission padres nevertheless adopted conflicting stances regarding everything from land rights, the allocation of supplies, protection of the missions, the criminal propensities of the soldiers, and (in particular) the status of the native populations.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{government}} and <b>military</b> <b>institutions,</b> {{a number of}} Canadian civilian organizations have association with the monarchy, either through their being founded via a Royal Charter (such as the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, the city of Saint John, New Brunswick, the Royal Kennebecasis Yacht Club, and McGill University), having been granted {{the right to use}} the prefix royal before their name (such as the Royal Quebec Golf Club and Royal Manitoba Winter Fair), or because at least one member of the Royal Family serves as a patron. Some of these organizations may use a royal crown in their logo or coat of arms, though this is a gift from the monarch showing royal support and/or association, and requires her approval before being added.|$|E
25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the key questions in Civil-Military Relations (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine under what conditions the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and <b>military</b> <b>institutions.</b> Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. civil-military relations case studies.|$|E
