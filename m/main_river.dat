5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the <b>main</b> <b>river</b> channel or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains. Murray cod larvae feed within the <b>main</b> <b>river</b> channel or, in times of spring flood, on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel/floodplain boundary, {{but not on the}} floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>main</b> <b>river</b> {{systems of}} the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima, Ghataprabha, Vedavathi, Malaprabha, and Tungabhadra, in the north, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati, Shimsha, Arkavati, Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini, in the south. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, {{reaching}} the sea at the Bay of Bengal.|$|E

5|$|A quick {{peace was}} {{essential}} to keep Russia from entering the conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the <b>Main</b> <b>River</b> (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E
5|$|Exmoor {{was one of}} {{the first}} British National Parks, {{designated}} in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. and is named after its <b>main</b> <b>river.</b> It was expanded in 1991 and in 1993 Exmoor was designated as an Environmentally Sensitive Area. The Quantock Hills were designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1956, the first such designation in England under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. The Mendip Hills followed with AONB designation in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The Dzong {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of the Pho Chhu (father) and Mo Chhu (mother) rivers in the PunakhaWangdue valley. The source of the Mo chu river is in the northern hills of Lighsi and Laya in Bhutan, and in Tibet. The Po Chu River is fed by glaciers in the Lunana region of the Punakha valley. After the confluence of these two rivers, the <b>main</b> <b>river</b> is known as Puna Tsang chu or Sankosh River and flows down through Wangdue Phodrang, crosses the BhutanIndia border at Kalikhola and eventually meets the Brahmaputra River.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the French Revolutionary Wars, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg {{remained}} as brigade commander of a small Austrian corps, approximately 10,000 men, under the overall command of Anton, Prince Esterházy. He was stationed in the Breisgau, a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine River. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the Swiss Cantons, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended Kehl, a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strassbourg, but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present-day Belgium, near the cities of Speyer and Trier, and at Frankfurt on the <b>Main</b> <b>River.</b>|$|E
5|$|The next lock is Conegar Lock, {{which was}} also called Stoke Conegar or Coneygear Lock. Just above it are some hatches which {{supplied}} water to the adjacent water meadows. They were built of dressed stone, and are the best-preserved of the original hatches. There is no modern sluice at Conegar Lock, and the change in level has resulted in fast-flowing rapids which have cut back the channel above the lock. A little further south at Fish House Bay, the navigation crossed the Barton River diagonally, as the mill stream made its {{way back to the}} <b>main</b> <b>river.</b> A footbridge on the eastern bank carried the towpath over the Barton River, but the navigation below this point is dry, with its line occupied by a vegetable garden.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the <b>main</b> <b>river</b> channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|French successes continued. With Charles {{absent from}} the north, Jourdan recrossed the Rhine and drove Wartensleben behind the Lahn. Pushing forward again, the Army of Sambre and Meuse {{defeated}} its opponents in the Battle of Friedberg (also called the First Battle of Limburg) on 10 July, while Charles was busy at Ettlingen. In this action, the Austrians suffered 1,000 casualties against a French loss of 700. Jourdan captured Frankfurt am Main on 16 July. Leaving behind François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers with 28,000 troops to blockade Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein, Jourdan pressed up the <b>Main</b> <b>River.</b> Following Carnot's strategy, the French commander continually operated against Wartensleben's north flank, causing the Austrian general to fall back. Jourdan's army numbered 46,197 men while Wartensleben counted 36,284 troops; Wartensleben felt no security in attacking the larger French force. Buoyed up by their forward movement and by the capture of Austrian supplies, the French captured Würzburg on 4 August. Three days later, the Army of Sambre and Meuse, under the temporary direction of Kléber, won another clash with Wartensleben at Forchheim on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{moved across}} the Rhine River at Worms, Germany on March 26, {{in the wake of}} the 3rd Infantry Division. The 44th relieved the 3rd on March 26–27 and crossed the Neckar River to attack and capture Mannheim, Germany on March 28–29. Shifting to the west bank of the <b>Main</b> <b>River,</b> the division crossed that river at Grosse Auheim in early April, and engaged in a three-week period of training. Returning to the lines, the division resumed its attack on April 18 in conjunction with the US 10th Armored Division, the 44th took Ehingen on April 23, crossed the Danube River. It then attacked southeast into Austria, taking Füssen, Berg, and Wertach as part of a drive to Imst. Pursuing the disintegrating German forces through Fern Pass and into Inn Valley, the 44th was in Imst by May 4. The city of Landeck surrendered on May 5. The 19th German Army had surrendered at Innsbruck the same day, and the division was involved in processing German prisoners until V-E Day on May 8. Dean's troops took 30,000 prisoners of war in the surrender of the German army. Dean was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Legion of Merit, and the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of the division during the war.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} sample all situations, {{different}} types of <b>rivers</b> were sampled: <b>main</b> <b>rivers,</b> their tributaries, medium rivers and streams (or creeks). Out of the 1 211 samples, 401 samples were collected {{on the banks of}} the <b>main</b> <b>rivers</b> (11 rivers are considered as main rivers: the large rivers such as Maroni, Mana, Comté, Approuague and Oyapock but also some of the large tributaries of these rivers such as Abounamy, Camopi, Tampok or Grand Inini). 327 samples were collected {{on the banks of the}} medium rivers (tributaries of the <b>main</b> <b>rivers,</b> 22 of which 8 have been gold mined); 241 were collected on the banks of gold-mined-streams and 242 on the banks of un-mined-streams.|$|R

5|$|The {{division}}'s {{drive to}} the Rhine River jumped off on 13 March 1945, and carried the division through Merzig from 17 March, to the Rhine by 21 March, and across the Rhine at Oppenheim on 25–26 March. The division was then reassigned to XII Corps. It {{took part in the}} house-to-house reduction of Hanau on 28 March, broke out of the <b>Main</b> <b>River</b> bridgehead, drove through Fulda on 1 April, and helped reduce Meiningen on 5 April. Moving southeast into Austria, the division assisted in the capture of Linz, 5 May. It had changed the direction of its advance, and was moving northeast into Czechoslovakia, across the Vlatava River, when the cease-fire order was received. One day later, the division overran the Gusen concentration camp in conjunction with the 11th Armored Division, liberating it from German forces. There, it discovered that the Germans had used forced labor to carve out an elaborate tunnel system with underground aircraft production facilities. SS officers at the camp allegedly planned to demolish the tunnels with the prisoners inside, but the movement of the 26th Infantry and 11th Armored Divisions prevented this.|$|E
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the river channel and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is Decoy Covert, a small wood which contained a duck decoy. The lock nearby is called Decoy Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its main supply has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in it, possibly dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the <b>main</b> <b>river,</b> and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the <b>main</b> <b>river.</b> It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E
