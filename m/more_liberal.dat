His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members, and at their insistence, the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary's president. Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796.|$|E

It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions expressed in the declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E

Her books have been criticised as being elitist, sexist, racist, xenophobic and {{at odds with the}} <b>more</b> <b>liberal</b> environment emerging in post-war Britain, but they have continued to be best-sellers since her death in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Garrard and {{the other}} elders of the church started {{numerous}} congregations in the state, including one {{as far away as}} Mason County. In 1789, Garrard and Eastin began working to reunite the more orthodox Regular Baptists in the area with the <b>more</b> <b>liberal</b> Separatist Baptists. Garrard's former church in Virginia had been a Regular Baptist congregation, and Garrard was considered a Regular Baptist despite his clear advocacy for religious toleration and his open expression of liberal views. Although he never succeeded in uniting the two factions, he was chosen moderator of the Elkhorn Baptist Association's annual meetings in 1790, 1791, and 1795 in recognition of his efforts.|$|E
