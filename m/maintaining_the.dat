5|$|A {{survey in}} 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the background}} of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> guns and manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar to those on the Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E

5|$|According to Elections Canada, from 1996 to 2008 the National Register of Electors allowed Elections Canada {{to avoid}} over $100 million in election-related expenditures. From 2000 to 2005, <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> National Register of Electors cost $19.4 million, and {{required}} 40 full-time employees.

5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide.

5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person.

5|$|Emission of {{neutrons}} {{during the}} fission of uranium {{is important not}} only for <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chain reaction, {{but also for the}} synthesis of the heavier actinides. Uranium-239 converts via β-decay into plutonium-239, which, like uranium-235, is capable of spontaneous fission. The world's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy, but for producing plutonium-239 for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Empresas Departamentales de Acueducto y Alcantarillado (ACUAS) or Departmental Water and Sewerage Companies were created, {{consisting}} of the departments, the municipalities and INSFOPAL, which took care of managing and <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure of the member communities.

5|$|Formica polyctena, {{among other}} ant species, {{constructs}} nests that maintain a relatively constant interior temperature that {{aids in the}} development of larvae.

30|$|Mobility {{management}} {{is an important}} research issue in enabling a ubiquitous wireless IP network. There have been many related works on mobility management.

50|$|The {{overlaps}} in the merged list of x-intervals can be <b>maintained</b> by storing <b>the</b> endpoints of {{the intervals}} in a kinetic sorted list. When points swap, {{the list of}} antipodal pairs are updated. The upper and lower envelopes can be <b>maintained</b> using <b>the</b> standard data structure for kinetic convex hull. The maximum distance between pairs of antipodal can be maintained with a kinetic tournament. Thus, using kinetic convex hull to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower envelopes, a kinetic sorted list on these intervals to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> antipodal pairs, and a kinetic tournament to <b>maintain</b> <b>the</b> pair of maximum distance apart, the diameter of a moving point set can be maintained.|$|R

Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Hitler and Mussolini {{resolved}} {{the problem of}} self-determination of Germans and <b>maintaining</b> <b>the</b> Brenner Pass frontier by an agreement in which German South Tyroleans were given the choice of either assimilation into Italian culture, or leave South Tyrol for Germany; most opted to leave for Germany.|$|E
