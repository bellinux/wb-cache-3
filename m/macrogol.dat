50|$|<b>Macrogol,</b> {{used as a}} laxative, {{is a form of}} {{polyethylene}} glycol. The name may {{be followed}} by a number which represents the average molecular weight (e.g. <b>macrogol</b> 3350, <b>macrogol</b> 4000 or <b>macrogol</b> 6000).|$|E
50|$|Oral <b>macrogol</b> is {{generally}} well tolerated. Possible side effects include headache, bloating, nausea, allergies, and electrolyte imbalance, mainly hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels) and hyperkalaemia (high blood potassium levels). Hyperkalaemia {{is not an}} effect of <b>macrogol</b> itself but of potassium salts which are usually part of <b>macrogol</b> formulations. With excessive use, it can cause diarrhea.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the earlier}} {{findings}} is that <b>macrogol</b> can aid in nerve repair.|$|E
50|$|Lower {{molecular}} weight <b>macrogols</b> {{are used as}} excipients in pharmaceutical products as solvents in oral liquids and soft capsules. Solid variants are used as ointment bases, tablet bindings, film coatings and lubricants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Macrogols</b> {{are also}} {{attached}} to biopharmaceutical drugs {{to slow down}} their degradation {{in the human body}} and increase their duration of action, as well as to reduce immunogenicity. This process is called PEGylation.|$|R
40|$|Symptoms of fecal {{incontinence}} and constipation {{are common in}} the general population. These can, however, be unreliably reported and are poorly discriminatory for underlying pathophysiology. Furthermore, both symptoms may coexist. In the elderly, fecal impaction always must be excluded. For patients with constipation, colon transit studies, anorectal manometry and defecography may help to identify patients with slow-transit constipation and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. The best documented medical treatments for constipation are the <b>macrogols,</b> lactulose and isphagula. Evolving drugs include lubiprostone, which enhances colonic secretion by activating chloride channels. Surgery is restricted for a highly selected group of patients with severe slow-transit constipation and for those with large rectoceles that demonstrably cause rectal evacuatory impairment. For patients with {{fecal incontinence}} that does not resolve on antidiarrheal treatment, functional and structural evaluation with anorectal manometry and endoanal ultrasound or magnetic resonance (MR) of the anal canal may help to guide management. Sacral nerve stimulation is a rapidly evolving alternative when other treatments such as biofeedback and direct sphincter repair have failed. Advances in understanding the pathophysiology {{as a guide to}} treatment of patients with constipation and fecal incontinence is a continuing important goal for translational research. The content of this article is a summary of presentations given by the authors at the Fourth Meeting of the Swedish Motility Group, held in Gothenburg in April 2007...|$|R
50|$|The {{doses of}} <b>macrogol</b> as an {{excipient}} {{are too low}} to have relevant contraindications.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>macrogol</b> can improve healing of spinal {{injuries}} in dogs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrogol</b> is also {{commonly}} used to fuse B-cells with myeloma cells in monoclonal antibody production.|$|E
40|$|Prevalence of {{childhood}} constipation {{has been estimated}} at 0. 7 % to 29. 6 % {{in the general population}} worldwide; most children have no obvious aetiological factors. One third of children with chronic constipation continue to have problems beyond puberty. Half of children with chronic faecal impaction and faecal incontinence have experienced an episode of painful defecation, and many children with chronic constipation exhibit withholding behaviour. We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for children with chronic constipation? What are the effects of treatments for clearing the bowel in children with faecal impaction? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We found 14 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anal dilatation, behavioural treatments (biofeedback, diaries, or toilet training), bulk-forming laxatives, enemas, faecal softeners, fibre, <b>macrogols,</b> oral fluids, osmotic laxatives, prebiotics, probiotics, stimulant laxatives, and surgical disimpactio...|$|R
50|$|A 2007 {{comparison}} {{showed that}} patients suffering from constipation {{had a better}} response to <b>macrogol</b> than to tegaserod.|$|E
50|$|Contraindications for <b>macrogol</b> taken orally as a {{laxative}} are intestinal perforation, bowel obstruction, ileus, inflammatory bowel diseases, {{and toxic}} megacolon.|$|E
5000|$|High-molecular-weight <b>macrogol</b> (e.g., 8000 g/mol) {{has been}} shown to be a dietary {{preventive}} agent against colorectal cancer in animal models.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrogol</b> 3350, {{often in}} {{combination}} with electrolytes, is used for short-term relief of constipation {{as well as for}} long-term use in constipation of various causes, including in multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease patients (an often-overlooked non-motor symptom) as well as constipation caused by pharmaceutical drugs such as opioids and anticholinergics. Whole bowel irrigation with <b>macrogol</b> is part of the bowel preparation before surgery or colonoscopy. Limited data also support its use for the treatment of fecal impaction.|$|E
50|$|Other ingredients: {{magnesium}} stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, stearic acid, pregelatinised maize starch, gelatin, hypromellose, <b>macrogol,</b> E127 (erythrosine), {{aluminium oxide}} and E171 (titanium dioxide).|$|E
50|$|Other ingredients: {{magnesium}} stearate, colloidal anhydrous silica, stearic acid, pregelatinised maize starch, gelatin, hypromellose, <b>macrogol,</b> E104 (quinoline yellow), aluminium oxide, E171 (titanium dioxide) and E172 (iron oxide yellow).|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrogol</b> is the {{international}} nonproprietary name for polyethylene glycol (PEG) used in medicine. Macrogols are commonly used as laxatives, i.e. to treat constipation, in both children and adults.|$|E
5000|$|The Chemoprevention Database shows <b>macrogol</b> is {{the most}} {{effective}} known agent for the suppression of chemical carcinogenesis in rats. Cancer prevention applications in humans, however, have not yet been tested in clinical trials.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macrogol</b> {{is being}} used in the repair of motor neurons damaged in crush or {{laceration}} incidents in vivo and in vitro. When coupled with melatonin, 75% of damaged sciatic nerves were rendered viable.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macrogol,</b> when {{labeled with}} a {{near-infrared}} fluorophore, {{has been used}} in preclinical work as a vascular agent, lymphatic agent, and general tumor-imaging agent by exploiting the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR) of tumors.|$|E
50|$|Allergy to <b>macrogol</b> is rare, {{and usually}} appears as an allergy to an {{increasing}} number of seemingly unrelated products, including cosmetics, drugs that use it as an excipient, and peri-procedural substances such as ultrasound gel.|$|E
50|$|Whole bowel {{irrigation}} (WBI) is {{a medical}} process involving the rapid administration of large volumes of an osmotically balanced <b>macrogol</b> solution (GoLYTELY, CoLyte), either orally or via a nasogastric tube, to flush out the entire gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
50|$|The {{interaction}} {{potential is}} low. Resorption of other pharmaceutical drugs {{can be reduced}} because oral <b>macrogol</b> accelerates intestinal passage, but this is seldom clinically relevant. For antiepileptic drugs, such a mechanism has been described in rare cases.|$|E
5000|$|The {{subcutaneous}} injection of <b>macrogol</b> 2000 in guinea pigs after {{spinal cord injury}} leads to rapid recovery through molecular repair of nerve membranes. The effectiveness of this treatment to prevent paraplegia in humans after an accident is not known yet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrogol</b> {{is used as}} an {{excipient}} in many pharmaceutical products. Lower-molecular-weight variants {{are used}} as solvents in oral liquids and soft capsules, whereas solid variants are used as ointment bases, tablet binders, film coatings, and lubricants. It is also used in lubricating eye drops.|$|E
50|$|It is {{dissolved}} in water {{to create a}} clear and odorless solution and is swallowed. While most consumers find the taste of <b>macrogol</b> itself to be very mild and unobjectionable, the electrolytes contained in formulations for purging and cleansing give the solution an extremely salty and bitter taste.|$|E
50|$|Several other {{laxatives}} {{are available}} for cleansing of the bowels prior to colonoscopy, surgery, or other procedures. Studies have shown some of these to be comparable to <b>macrogol</b> solutions in terms of effectiveness and better tolerated by patients due to the lower volume of laxative which must be ingested. Enemas are another option.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Macrogol</b> is sold as non-prescription {{preparation}} in powder form. When sold for gut cleansing (and as a laxative), {{it is usually}} in combination with salts such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride to help mitigate the possibility of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. Trade names include SoftLax, Purelax, Miralax, Laxido, Glycoprep, Movicol, Cololyt and Osmolax, and many others.|$|E
50|$|Whole bowel {{irrigation}} {{was originally}} developed to cleanse the large bowel before surgery or colonoscopy. Initially {{a solution of}} sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate was used but this electrolyte solution was shown to be absorbed by the body, sometimes leading to complications. To solve this problem a specialized irrigation fluid was developed consisting mainly of an iso-osmolar solution of <b>macrogol.</b> With the <b>macrogol</b> solution there is negligible fluid or electrolyte absorption and several studies have shown the overall safety of the procedure. Whole bowel irrigation was also suggested as a possible treatment for toxic ingestions. WBI {{has the effect of}} mechanically flushing the ingested poison out of the gastrointestinal tract before it can be absorbed into the body. A study in 1987 provided evidence that whole bowel irrigation is an effective and safe gastrointestinal decontamination procedure for acute poisoning. Its common administration for toxic ingestions has been largely replaced with that of activated charcoal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macrogol</b> is an osmotically acting laxative, {{that is an}} inert {{substance}} that passes through the gut without being absorbed into the body. It relieves constipation because it causes water to be retained in the bowel instead of being absorbed into the body. This increases the water content and volume of the stools in the bowel, making them softer and easier to pass, as well as improving gut motility.|$|E
50|$|When {{attached}} to various biopharmaceutical medications (which are proteins), <b>macrogol</b> {{results in a}} slowed clearance of the carried protein from the blood. This makes for a longer-acting medicinal effect and reduces toxicity, and it allows for longer dosing intervals. It also reduces the proteins' immunogenicity. Examples for PEGylated proteins include peginterferon alfa-2a and -2b, which are used to treat hepatitis C, pegfilgrastim, {{which is used to}} treat neutropenia, and pegloticase for the treatment of gout.|$|E
50|$|In a {{randomised}} controlled study, {{the scale}} is used to study the response to two laxatives: <b>Macrogol</b> (polyethylene glycol) and psyllium (Plantago psyllium and other species of the same genus) of 126 male and female patients {{for a period of}} 2 weeks of treatment; failing to show the most rapid response and increased efficiency of the former over the latter. In the study, they were measured as primary outcomes: the number weekly bowel movements, stool consistency according to the types of the Bristol stool scale, time to defecation, the overall effectiveness, the difficulty in defecating and stool consistency.|$|E
5000|$|PEGylation (often styled pegylation) is {{the process}} of both {{covalent}} and non-covalent attachment or amalgamation of polyethylene glycol (PEG, in pharmacy called <b>macrogol)</b> polymer chains to molecules and macrostructures, such as a drug, therapeutic protein or vesicle, which is then described as PEGylated (pegylated). PEGylation is routinely achieved by incubation of a reactive derivative of PEG with the target molecule. The covalent attachment of PEG to a drug or therapeutic protein can [...] "mask" [...] the agent from the host's immune system (reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity), and increase the hydrodynamic size (size in solution) of the agent which prolongs its circulatory time by reducing renal clearance. PEGylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic drugs and proteins.|$|E
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the modern {{conception}} of etiology, pathogenesis and diagnostics of chronic constipation in children. a classification of laxative medications was posed and the place of these drugs in management of constipation was shown in this work. An activity of <b>macrogol</b> in management of children with chronic constipation was evaluated. It was shown that <b>macrogol</b> 4000 is effective in treatment of constipation in children.

40|$|Background and Aims: Animal {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} <b>macrogol</b> laxatives may reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. This study aimed to investigate the association between <b>macrogol</b> prescribing and CRC risk. Methods: A case-control study nested within a cohort of laxative users was conducted {{using data from the}} UK General Practice Research Database. Six controls per case were identified and to account for the lead time of CRC, additional control sets were selected on the index date backdated by 1 to 5 years. Exposure to macrogols and covariate status before each of the backdated index dates was established. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the risk of CRC following <b>macrogol</b> prescribing adjusted for potential confounders...|$|E
40|$|The most usable {{medications}} in pediatric {{practice are}} laxative medicaments {{on the basis}} of polyethylene glycol (<b>Macrogol</b> 4000) and lactulose. <b>Macrogol</b> 4000 (Forlax) and lactulose have rela tively equal activity, but the first one has more predictable effect (has linear dependence dose–effect), has a beneficial activity in the presence of pain syndrome and mucoprotective activity, stimulates appetite. Significant feature of lactulose is its prebiotic activity, and this is the reason of indistinctive dose–effect dependence, presence of latency time and some adverse events; the rate of last ones is low. Authors make a conclusion that the specialist can make a choice of medication, paying attention to peculiarities of disease in every single patient.
