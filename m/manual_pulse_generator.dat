5000|$|A <b>manual</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> (MPG) is {{a device}} for {{generating}} electrical pulses (short bursts of low current) in electronic systems {{under the control}} of a human operator (manually), as opposed to the pulses automatically generated by software. MPGs are used on computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools, on some microscopes, and on other devices that use precise component positioning. A typical MPG consists of a rotating knob that generates pulses that are sent to an equipment controller. The controller will then move the piece of equipment a predetermined distance for each pulse.|$|E

The controller that runs on an external computer has di-rect access to the CNC controller for machine posi-tion sensing. The control signals to the machine are sent through purpose built circuitry via the machine’s <b>manual</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> (MPG) inputs. To demon-strate the accuracy and performance of the control system, {{it was used to}} visually track the profile of a mandrel used for shear spinning. The implemented system eliminates the parallax error and the need to use an accurate pixel resolution. The raw tracking data is processed by a curvature detection algorithm that detects linear and circular segments and segment transitions. The results show that the visual tracking system provides accurate tracking results that are well within the tolerances used in the industry...|$|E

The programmable <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> was programmed and controlled by an IBM compatible computer. Statis rams were utilized as the programmable <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s on board memory which were used to store the pulse sequences. Pulse widths can be programmed from 0. 2 microseconds to 14. 3 minutes. The JEOL RF section is unique in that it allows the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> to control the phase of the RF transmitted to the NMR probe and whether the sample will be decoupled. These two items set this programmable <b>pulse</b> <b>generator</b> apart from other <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> described in the literature and those systems which are commercially available.

For example, the pulse repetition rate and duration may be digitally controlled but the pulse amplitude and rise and fall times may be determined by analog circuitry in the output stage of the <b>pulse</b> <b>generator.</b> With correct adjustment, <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> can also produce a 50% duty cycle square wave. <b>Pulse</b> <b>generators</b> are generally single-channel providing one frequency, delay, width and output.|$|R

HPM generation by virtual cathode devices such as Vircators put high demands on the source. The rise time and the pulse length of the source voltage are two key issues in the generation of HPM radiation. This thesis describes the construction and tests of several inductive high power <b>pulse</b> <b>generators.</b> The <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> were designed {{with the intent to}} deliver a pulse with fast rise time and rectangular voltage. Therefore, the <b>pulse</b> <b>generators</b> are all based on discharges of transmission lines.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a delta telerobot that a human operator works on a given task through the eye and hand of the robot. The Delta robot is installed with eye in hand camera and controlled by an open architecture controller that is configured to control the robot to follow the motion of the selectable HMI devices. The evaluation task is a three dimensional “connect the dot ” game in which the robot is tele-operated with visual feedback to go point to point from position 1 to 6. The task performance is used to evaluate {{the performance of}} the total system that involves a robot, human factors, HMI, and environment. Three HMI devices including a <b>manual</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>generator,</b> Kinect camera, and a PHANToM OMNI Haptic Device are benchmarked. The result demonstrates that the Haptic with guided force is the best when compared to the others. In addition, the telerobot system can improve the time to completion by 30 % and positioning accuracy by 50 %, compared to human in the human scaled task. Then we investigate the effect of time delay of the delta telerobot with the Haptic. The result demonstrates that the time delay, that exceeds 100 ms, is proportion to both time to completion and positioning error in telerobot task, while the time delay below 100 ms gives no effect...|$|E
