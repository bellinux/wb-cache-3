40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{developing}} a statistical model to predict cutting force {{in terms of}} machining parameters such as cutting speed, cutting feed rate and axial depth of cut. Response surface methodology experimental design was used for conducting experiments. The work piece material was Aluminum (Al 7075 -T 6) and the tool was a shoulder mill with two carbide insert. The cutting forces were measured using three axis milling tool dynamometer. The second order mathematical model in terms of machining parameters was developed for predicting cutting force. The adequacy of the predictive models was tested by analysis of variance and found to be adequate. The direct and interaction effect was graphically plotted which helps to study {{the significance of these}} parameters with cutting force. The optimization of shoulder <b>mill</b> <b>machining</b> parameters to acquire minimum cutting force was done by genetic algorithms (GA).

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{algorithm}} for the {{ball-end mill}} relief using a five-axis {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) grinding machine and the simulation of the ball-end mill based on a CAM system is presented in this paper. In this study, In order to obtain an accurate normal relief angle, {{which is one of}} the key factors affecting tool cutting performance, a tool coordinate system based on the required relief angle and the cutting edge was established. Then, by the proposed tool coordinate system, an algorithm to determine the position between the grinding wheel and the tool is proposed, and then the relevant formulations are deduced. The coordinates of grinding point when the step of relief surface is grinded are calculated. Using the input data of a ball-end mill geometry, wheels geometry, wheel setting and machine setting, the NC code for machining will be generated. Then the code will be used as input to simulate the ball-end <b>mill</b> <b>machining</b> in 3 Dimension before real machining. The algorithm of ball-end mill relief can be authenticated by the 3 D simulation system...|$|E

The engine itself is composed of a combustion chamber, a nozzle, a cooling jacket, and an injector. This paper explores the design and manufacture of an effective and safe rocket engine that is capable of producing thrust. This was accomplished with complete heat transfer calculations of a bi-propellant chemical reaction, and properties of a material. Thermodynamic analyses were conducted {{in order to determine the}} pressures and pressure losses that occur throughout the engine. Bending and stress analysis was also carried out for the mounting fixture, as well as the thickness of the outer walls and bolt sizes.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the control and {{information}} integration capability of an NC machining system, this paper provides a new concept - an NC feature unit (NCFU), which is a feature-based and a basic control unit. First, as a feature-based control unit, NCFU possesses geometric form and control parameters, which are a subclass of high-level CAD/CAM features {{so that it can}} be used as an information exchange medium between NC machining systems and other manufacturing execution systems. Secondly, as a basic machining control unit, NCFU uses a geometrically defined closed and non-gouging machined area. On the one hand, through decomposition, a machined object can be divided into a combination of several NCFUs. On the other hand, since NCFUs are non-gouging, the algorithm for NCFU-based tool-path generation is simple enough to be executable in real-time. This paper discusses NCFU-based applications in 2 1 / 2 -D profile/pocket and 3 D surface <b>mill</b> <b>machining,</b> including the NCFU definition and the related algorithms for decomposition calculation and area interpolation. A next generation NC machining system based on NCFU, including an NCFU-based NCP and an NCFU-based CNC system, has been prototyped by China's State 863 /CIMS Design Automation Laboratory in Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. An NCFU is being used as the information exchange medium in an internet-integrated manufacturing system with NC machining at Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} represents {{more than}} ten years of collaborative research by labor, industry, and government to reduce respirable crystalline silica exposure during asphalt pavement milling in highway construction. The collaborative research began when the Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership was formed at the 2003 National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) Annual Meeting, and studies on <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> dust controls began later that year. The Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership is coordinated by NAPA and includes all U. S. and foreign manufacturers of heavy construction equipment that currently sell pavement-milling machines to the U. S. market. In addition to NAPA and the equipment manufacturers, the Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership includes numerous paving contractors, the International Union of Operating Engineers, the Laborers International Union of North America, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, and government organizations including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Federal Highway Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Based on the research of the Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership, NIOSH recommend engineering controls that include ventilation controls in addition to water-sprays used to cool the cutting teeth. <b>Milling</b> <b>machines</b> that adopt this well-designed dust control approach have been shown to control worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica from asphalt milling operations during 21 days of personal breathing zone sampling at 11 different highway construction sites [NIOSH 2013 b,c]. The 42 personal breathing zone air sampling results (21 days with 2 workers per day) were all below the NIOSH recommended exposure limit of 0. 05 mg/m 3 for respirable crystalline silica ranging from below the limit of detection up to 0. 024 mg/m 3. NIOSH and the Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership recommend ventilation controls be placed on all new half-lane and larger asphalt <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> to reduce worker exposure to respirable crystalline silica. It is also recommended that water-sprays be used to suppress dust on <b>milling</b> <b>machines</b> if ventilation dust controls are not available. The ventilation and water-spray dust controls described in this document represent the current knowledge of best practices developed by the Silica/Asphalt <b>Milling</b> <b>Machine</b> Partnership for controlling dust during asphalt pavement milling. This document should not limit manufacturers from implementing future improvements in dust control as new technologies or inventions become available. Manufacturers can use the procedures in Appendices A and B of this document to evaluate current and future dust controls. Appendix D is not included in the posted PDF version of this report.
