5|$|A delta fan made of eroded red ash {{sediment}} {{occurs at}} the mouth of Keyser Creek. The creek flows through rock formations such as the Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono Formation. conglomerate and limestone have been observed in the creek's vicinity. There are coal <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of the creek. There are pyroclastic materials in foundry slag and coal mining waste in the watershed. Large deposits of drift have been observed near the creek. Substantial till deposits are also present in its valley.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in storage facilities do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year.

Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control <b>measures</b> <b>in</b> storage facilities.|$|E

Rubens Barrichello who was caught up in the first lap accident was mathematically ruled out of clinching the title. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's eight-point advantage going into the race was reduced to four, with three races of the season remaining.
