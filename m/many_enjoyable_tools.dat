50|$|A loose {{motivation}} {{for much of}} Melvin Fitting's work can be formulated succinctly as follows. There are many logics. Our principles of reasoning vary with context and subject matter.

The common thread tying logics together is a concern for what can be said (syntax), what that means (semantics), and relationships between the two.

Ten computerized case studies emphasizing the prac-tical relevance of basic and medicinal chemistry principles to pharmacy practice have been developed utilizing Microsoft Visual Basic 3. 0. The cases introduce a patient or clinical situation, and require the student to make a therapeutic decision, a drug product selection, or provide drug informa-tion. Utilizing the mouse to indicate answer choices to structured questions, students are guided through the chemi-cal thinking processes required {{to arrive at the}} correct therapeutic decision(s). Wrong responses generate ques-tions which guide students in correcting their mistakes, while correct answers are positively reinforced. A tutorial program is loaded with each case study, and is accessible from a pull-down menu. Humor and graphics are utilized liberally to enhance student appeal.

As trainers we can positively contribute to higher self-reflection and responsibility of trainees with introductory appraisal–it is so nice when mentor knows the CV of the trainee in advance–and with repeating the appraisal in regular intervals. The importance of solid basic knowledge and continuous assessment of theoretical knowledge, practical skills and, above all, of attitude and behaviour is stressed.

40|$|Football {{may be a}} {{physical}} and sport activities able to improve motor and cognitive growth in children. Therefore {{the aim of this}} study was to assess whether a Football Training Program taken over 6 months would improve motor and cognitive performances in children. Motor skills concerned coordinative skills, running and explosive legs strength. Cognitive abilities involved visual discrimination times and visual selective attention times. Forty-six children with chronological age of ~ 9. 10 years, were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n= 24) attended a Football Exercise Program and Group 2 (n= 22) was composed of sedentary children. Their abilities were measured by a battery of tests including motor and cognitive tasks. Football Exercise Program resulted in improved running, coordination and explosive leg strength performances as well as shorter visual discrimination times in children regularly attending football courses compared with their sedentary peers. On the whole these results support the thesis that the improvement of motor and cognitive abilities is related not only to general physical activity but also to specific ability related to the ball. Football Exercise Programs is assumed to be a natural and <b>enjoyable</b> <b>tool</b> to enhance cognitive resources as well as promoting and encouraging the participation in sport activities from early development...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{innovations}} {{have been}} transforming {{the way we}} handle tourism. Virtual reality (VR), {{one of the most}} recent commercially available technologies, is an underexplored marketing opportunity for destination marketing organizations (DMOs) and for companies within the tourism industry. This emerging technology can help to build a closer relationship between DMOs and the traveler. Within this context, it is predicted that tourist may benefit from using VR applications in their travel planning phase, as they get the opportunity to pre- experience potential travel destinations, accommodations and other travel related activities before their actual trip. Virtual Reality can also serve DMOs to better promote travel destinations and services in an innovative way, rousing the travel intention in potential tourist. To explore this possibility, a survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model was used to collect data throughout a 43 -item questionnaire that participants had to complete after a virtual travel experience to a preferred destination. The results revealed significant effects on the behavioral intention to use virtual reality for travel planning. Based on these results it is suggested that Virtual Reality technology is a useful and <b>enjoyable</b> <b>tool</b> that will ease the process of planning a trip and help make better informed decisions...|$|R

In this paper we will introduce {{a new type of}} painted tree, (T ◦ Y) n where n is the number of interior nodes. We create these painted trees by composing binary trees on leveled trees. We define a coordinate system on these trees and take the convex hull of these points. We explore the resulting polytope and prove, using a bijection to tubings, that for n ≤ 4 the poset of the painted face trees with n+ 1 leaves is isomorphic to the face poset of an n-dimensional polytope, specifically KF 1,n, the graph-associahedron for a fan graph, F 1,n. iii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS My sincere thanks to Dr. Stefan Forcey for his guidance on my research and the <b>many</b> <b>enjoyable</b> hours I have spent learning from him.
