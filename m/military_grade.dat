5|$|Set in {{the year}} 2072, the protagonist—a nameless hacker—is caught while {{attempting}} to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. The hacker is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker {{in exchange for a}} confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the station. Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to sell it on the black market as a biological weapon. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the hacker a valuable <b>military</b> <b>grade</b> neural implant. After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface. Following the operation, the hacker is put into a six-month healing coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated, transformed into cyborgs, or killed.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} models {{analyzed}} in this study. The first two models {{attempt to determine}} whether academic rank, military rank, and major are predictive of NFO service selection and NFO assignment. The goal of the third model, which predicts NFO completion, is to determine whether academic and <b>military</b> <b>grades,</b> major, personality, gender, and race predict completion of NFO flight training. Logistic regression is {{used to analyze the}} effect of the explanatory variables on the dependent variables. The analysis shows that the first two models are not statistically significant predictors of NFO service selection and NFO service assignment. The NFO completion model displays the most interesting result of all three models. Military quality point rating is a highly significant predictor of completing NFO flight training. For midshipmen who select NFO as their first or second choice, the higher their <b>military</b> <b>grades</b> the more likely an Academy graduate will complete flight officer training. Further research is recommended to determine if military quality point rating is a significant predictor of completing one's initial training in other warfare communities. NAN...|$|R

500|$|Forensic chemists' {{analysis}} can provide leads for investigators, {{and they can}} confirm or refute their suspicions. [...] The identification of the various substances found at the scene can tell investigators {{what to look for}} during their search. [...] During fire investigations, forensic chemists can determine if an accelerant such as gasoline or kerosene was used; if so, this suggests that the fire was intentionally set. [...] Forensic chemists can also narrow down the suspect list to people who would have access to the substance used in a crime. [...] For example, in explosive investigations, the identification of RDX or C-4 would indicate a military connection as those substances are <b>military</b> <b>grade</b> explosives. [...] On the other hand, the identification of TNT would create a wider suspect list, since it is used by demolition companies {{as well as in the}} military. [...] During poisoning investigations, the detection of specific poisons can give detectives an idea of what to look for when they are interviewing potential suspects. For example, an investigation that involves ricin would tell investigators to look for ricin's precursors, the seeds of the castor oil plant.|$|E
500|$|Officer grades up to {{lieutenant}} colonel reflect progression {{in training and}} organizational seniority, rather than command authority. Because of this, {{it is not uncommon}} for senior members commanding groups and squadrons to have members of superior grades serving under them. Current, retired and former members of the United States Armed Forces may be promoted directly to the CAP grade equivalent to their <b>military</b> <b>grade,</b> although some choose to follow the same standards as non-prior-service members. Except for a few exceptional cases, senior members are only promoted to the grade of CAP colonel upon appointment as a Region Commander, responsible for overseeing multiple states, or Wing Commander, responsible for the administration of CAP units across an entire state. Former military enlisted personnel may choose to retain their grade as senior members, with grades E-5 (CAP Staff Sergeant) through E-9 (CAP Chief Master Sergeant) available. Former CAP National Commander, Maj Gen Carr, unveiled plans to restructure the CAP NCO program to allow individuals to 'enlist' as an NCO and progress through a specific professional development program. According to an AF.mil article on the subject, [...] "The current design of the NCO corps in the CAP only allows former active-duty NCOs to be a part of the corps, with no upgrade training for promotion within the ranks. The newly signed corps structure will mirror the Air Force NCO force structure with an established process to promote and develop NCOs.". Maj.Gen. Carr's plan did not follow through but in November 2016, a new NCO Professional Development program was implemented allowing NCO's to promote as you would in the officer ranks, furthering the ability of the CAP NCO corp.|$|E
