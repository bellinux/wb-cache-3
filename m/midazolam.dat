5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is a short-acting {{benzodiazepine}} {{in adults}} with an elimination half-life of 1.5-2.5 hours. In the elderly, {{as well as}} young children and adolescents, the elimination half-life is longer. <b>Midazolam</b> is metabolised into an active metabolite alpha1-hydroxymidazolam. Age-related deficits, renal and liver status affect the pharmacokinetic factors of <b>midazolam</b> {{as well as its}} active metabolite. However, the active metabolite of <b>midazolam</b> is minor and contributes to only 10 percent of biological activity of <b>midazolam.</b> <b>Midazolam</b> is poorly absorbed orally, with only 50 percent of the drug reaching the bloodstream. <b>Midazolam</b> is metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation. The therapeutic as well as adverse effects of <b>midazolam</b> are due to its effects on the GABAA receptors; <b>midazolam</b> does not activate GABAA receptors directly but, as with other benzodiazepines, it enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on the GABAA receptors (↑ frequency of Cl− channel opening) resulting in neural inhibition. Almost all of the properties {{can be explained by the}} actions of benzodiazepines on GABAA receptors. This results in the following pharmacological properties being produced: sedation, induction of sleep, reduction in anxiety, anterograde amnesia, muscle relaxation and anticonvulsant effects.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of <b>midazolam,</b> {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of <b>midazolam</b> leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of <b>midazolam.</b> <b>Midazolam</b> is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with <b>midazolam</b> results in a reduced elimination rate of <b>midazolam.</b> St John's wort decreases the blood levels of <b>midazolam.</b> Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given <b>midazolam</b> experience reduced therapeutic effects of <b>midazolam,</b> due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with <b>midazolam</b> {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if <b>midazolam</b> is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to <b>midazolam</b> occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is a Schedule IV drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the United Kingdom, <b>midazolam</b> is a Schedule 3/Class C {{controlled}} drug. In the United States, <b>midazolam</b> (DEA number 2884) {{is on the}} Schedule IV list of the Controlled Substances Act as a non-narcotic agent with low potential for abuse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> {{is known}} to cause {{respiratory}} depression. In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of <b>midazolam</b> may cause respiratory depression, which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When <b>midazolam</b> is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects of}} <b>midazolam</b> {{in the elderly}} are listed above. People {{experiencing}} amnesia as {{a side effect of}} <b>midazolam</b> are generally unaware their memory is impaired, unless they had previously known it as a side effect.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when <b>midazolam</b> is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of <b>midazolam</b> users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from <b>midazolam</b> administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of <b>midazolam,</b> vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including <b>midazolam</b> after the Supreme Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that <b>midazolam</b> might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the Netherlands, <b>midazolam</b> is a List II drug of the Opium Law.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> {{acts as a}} {{sedative}} {{to render}} the condemned prisoner unconscious, at which time the vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride are administered, stopping the prisoner's breathing and heart, respectively. Florida used <b>midazolam</b> to execute William Happ in October 2013. The usage of <b>midazolam</b> in executions has become controversial after condemned inmate Clayton Lockett apparently regained consciousness and started speaking midway through his execution when the state of Oklahoma attempted to execute him with an untested three-drug lethal injection cocktail using 100mg of <b>midazolam.</b> Prison officials reportedly discussed taking him to a hospital before he was pronounced dead {{of a heart attack}} 40 minutes after the execution began. An observing doctor stated that Lockett's vein had ruptured. It is not clear which drug or drugs caused his death or what quantities of vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride were released before the execution was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> {{first came}} into use in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Midazolam</b> is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale cost in the developing world of a vial is about 0.35 USD. In many countries, it is a controlled substance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water solubility, {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of <b>midazolam</b> were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, <b>midazolam</b> has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. <b>Midazolam</b> is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water solubility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders <b>midazolam</b> and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of <b>midazolam</b> is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. <b>Midazolam</b> is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence buccal and intranasal <b>midazolam</b> is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; <b>midazolam</b> {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. <b>Midazolam</b> infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from <b>midazolam</b> can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of <b>midazolam</b> after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if {{used in the}} elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or other drug-dependent individuals or those with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of <b>midazolam</b> and its active metabolites may occur. Kidney or liver impairments may slow down the elimination of <b>midazolam</b> leading to prolonged and enhanced effects. Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the benzodiazepines are {{schedule}} 4 controlled drugs, {{except for}} flunitrazepam, temazepam and <b>midazolam,</b> which are schedule 3 controlled drugs and carry stronger penalties for possession and trafficking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, <b>midazolam</b> is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, <b>midazolam</b> is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not responsive to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous <b>midazolam</b> is {{indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. <b>Midazolam</b> is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over <b>midazolam</b> when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is also {{sometimes}} used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although morphine is preferred, owing to its better safety profile for this indication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam</b> is {{available}} as a generic medication and is not very expensive. The wholesale price of a vial is about 0.35 USD.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam,</b> in {{combination}} with an antipsychotic drug, is indicated for the acute management of schizophrenia when it is associated with aggressive or out-of-control behaviour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam,</b> marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. <b>Midazolam</b> can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|<b>Midazolam,</b> {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using <b>midazolam</b> is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Oral <b>midazolam</b> is {{indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. <b>Midazolam</b> and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) buccal <b>midazolam</b> are used, with a preference for <b>midazolam</b> as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|A <b>midazolam</b> {{overdose}} {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of <b>midazolam</b> (or any other benzodiazepine) is flumazenil. While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
5|$|Short-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 1–12 hours. They have few residual effects if taken before bedtime, rebound insomnia may occur upon discontinuation, {{and they might}} cause daytime withdrawal symptoms such as next day rebound anxiety with prolonged usage. Examples are brotizolam, <b>midazolam,</b> and triazolam.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Jackson had been {{administered}} propofol, lorazepam, and <b>midazolam,</b> and the Los Angeles coroner decided to treat the death as a homicide. Law enforcement officials conducted a manslaughter investigation of his personal physician Conrad Murray, and charged him with involuntary manslaughter in Los Angeles on February 8, 2010. Jackson's body was entombed on September 3, 2009, at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the European Medicines Agency {{granted a}} {{marketing}} authorisation for a buccal application form of <b>midazolam,</b> sold under the trade name Buccolam. Buccolam was approved {{for the treatment}} of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age. This was the first application of a paediatric-use marketing authorisation.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, 2017, Arkansas {{carried out}} a double-execution of Jack Jones, 52, and Marcel Williams, 46. The state of Arkansas {{attempted}} to execute eight people before its supply of <b>midazolam</b> expired on April 30, 2017. Two of them were granted a stay of execution, and another, Ledell T. Lee, 51, was executed on April 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. <b>Midazolam</b> is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not <b>midazolam)</b> be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in securely fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations of <b>midazolam</b> or {{its major}} metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may be {{measured}} in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two substances in the bloodstream {{and the appearance of}} adverse depressant effects.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is <b>midazolam</b> placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
25|$|Management of {{breakthrough}} seizures is by benzodiazepine such as <b>midazolam.</b>|$|E
