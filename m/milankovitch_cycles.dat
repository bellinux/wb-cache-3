5|$|A recent theory {{claims that}} there are {{magnetic}} instabilities {{in the core of}} the Sun that cause fluctuations with periods of either 41,000 or 100,000 years. These could provide a better explanation of the ice ages than the <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles).</b>|$|E
5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles.</b> The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{conversion}} of productive drylands to desert conditions, known as desertification, can occur {{from a variety}} of causes. One is human intervention, including intensive agricultural tillage or overgrazing in areas that cannot support such exploitation. Climatic shifts such as global warming or the <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle</b> (which drives glacials and interglacials) also affect the pattern of deserts on Earth.|$|R
5|$|While {{there is}} a <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle</b> {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|R
50|$|Thus, as the {{continental}} ice sheets of Quaternary glaciations advanced south according to each <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle,</b> their northern edges were starved {{and it is}} believed that starvation caused them to retreat substantially southward by the time the southern limits of maximum glaciation were approached. Of course, in areas such as the Russian Far East, eastern Siberia and Beringia, glaciers were, in effect, starved before they could form at all.|$|R
5|$|Sedimentological {{data from}} the Mussentuchit Member {{indicates}} that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated {{between high and low}} water levels in <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|After the fortress's {{military}} importance decreased {{at the end}} of the 19th century, Tvrđa {{became a}} center of administrative, educational, cultural, and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region. The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707, to be later expanded and renewed, and the first printing press started working in 1735. The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates, Lavoslav Ružička and Vladimir Prelog, along with Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković (<b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles),</b> were all alumni (graduates) of the Tvrđa schools. The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the former general headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence. The Faculty of Food Technology has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek, from the mid-17th century until the beginning of the 1990s. Other present-day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium, Franjo Kuhač Music School (former Roman Catholic Seminary), Jesuit Classical Gymnasium (former logistics barracks built in the mid-18th century), and the Secondary School of Economics (former grammar school for girls).|$|E

25|$|Over {{long time}} scales, ice sheet mass balance {{is governed by}} the amount of {{sunlight}} reaching the earth. This variation in sunlight reaching the earth, or insolation, over geologic time is in turn determined by the angle of the earth to the sun and shape of the Earth's orbit, as it is pulled on by neighboring planets; these variations occur in predictable patterns called <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles.</b> <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> dominate climate on the glacial–interglacial timescale, but there exist variations in ice sheet extent that are not linked directly with insolation.|$|E
25|$|Over {{long time}} scales, climate is {{controlled}} by <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> changing the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth. The weakening and strengthening of the monsoon also plays an important role. Siroco et al. suggest that {{the strength of the}} monsoon in linked to the albedo in the Himalaya. Cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere winter lead to more sunlight reflected off snow and ice and weaker summer monsoons, leading to a drier climate in East Africa. The strength of the monsoon is also linked to <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> with a lag of around 8,000 years. Generally the maximum monsoons occur 2,500 years after a glacial minimum. This maximum corresponds to a minimum of sea surface temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> are {{a set of}} cyclic {{variations}} in characteristics of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Each cycle has a different length, so at some times their effects reinforce each other {{and at other times}} they (partially) cancel each other.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, the Serbian {{engineer}} Milutin Milankovitch, {{building on}} James Croll's theory, improved the tedious calculations of the varying distances and angles of the Sun's radiation as the Sun and Moon gradually perturbed the Earth's orbit. Some observations of varves (layers {{seen in the}} mud covering the bottom of lakes) matched the prediction of a <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle</b> lasting about 21,000 years.

40|$|The {{study of}} Planktonic Foraminifera abundances permits to obtain climatic curves {{on the basis}} of {{percentage}} ratio between tropical and temperate/polar forms. Climatic changes were controlled by several phenomena as: (i) <b>Milankovitch’s</b> <b>cycles,</b> produced by variations of astronomical parameters such as precession, obliquity and eccentricity; (ii) continental geodynamic evolution and orogenic belt; (iii) variations of atmospheric and oceanic currents; (iv) volcanic eruptions; (v) meteor impacts. But while astronomical parameters have a quasi-regular periodicity, the other phenomena can be considered as “noise signal” in natural systems.

25|$|Change in the {{direction}} of the axis rotation (precession) should not be pronounced. In itself, precession need not affect habitability as it changes {{the direction}} of the tilt, not its degree.

The term is named after Serbian geophysicist and astronomer Milutin Milanković.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{described}} based on resonant thermal diffusion {{waves in the}} sun that explains many details of the paleotemperature record for the last 5. 3 million years.

Other prior work suggesting a link between terrestrial paleoclimate and solar luminosity variations has not provided any specific mechanism. The particular mechanism described here has been demonstrated empirically, although not previously invoked in the solar context. The theory, while not without its own unresolved issues, also lacks most of the problems associated with <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle</b> theory. I. PALEOTEMPERATURE DATA The possibility that fluctuations in solar luminosity may be responsible for changes in global temperatures has not been overlooked by researchers,(Lean, 1997) although most explanations for periodicities in paleotemperatures are believed to involve factors unrelated to solar luminosity. (Zachos, 2001) Nevertheless, some researchers have suggested that periodic solar variability has been the cause of global temperature cycles, with periods ranging from the 11 year sunspot period to cycles as long as 2000 years. (Hu, 2003) Earlier reports, however, suggest no specific mechanism for long term solar periodicity...|$|R

Predicted changes in orbital forcing suggest that the next glacial period would begin at least 50,000 years from now, even in absence of human-made global warming (see <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles).</b> Moreover, anthropogenic forcing from increased greenhouse gases might outweigh orbital forcing for as long as intensive use of fossil fuels continues.|$|E
25|$|Earth's axis remains tilted in {{the same}} {{direction}} with reference to the background stars throughout a year (regardless of where it is in its orbit). This means that one pole (and the associated hemisphere of Earth) will be directed away from the Sun at one side of the orbit, and half an orbit later (half a year later) this pole will be directed towards the Sun. This is the cause of Earth's seasons. Summer occurs in the Northern hemisphere when the north pole is directed toward the Sun. Variations in Earth's axial tilt can influence the seasons and is likely a factor in long-term climate change (also see <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} facies changes and other lithological {{features}} in sequences of sedimentary rock have a cyclic nature.

On a larger time-scale, cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by Milankovitch cycles: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun.

25|$|A {{problem with}} {{the theory is that}} the astronomical cycles have been in {{existence}} for billions of years, but glaciation is a rare occurrence. Astronomical cycles correlate perfectly with glacial and interglacial periods, and their transitions, inside an ice age. Other factors such as the position of continents and the effects this has on Earth's oceanic currents, or long-term fluctuations inside the core of the Sun that caused Earth's temperature to drop below a critical threshold and thus initiate the ice age in the first place must also be involved. Once that occurs, <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> could act to force the planet in and out of glacial periods.|$|E
25|$|For {{the orbit}} of the Earth around the Sun, the time of apsis is often {{expressed}} in terms of a time relative to seasons, since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations. The variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the Sun, which {{is a result of the}} tilt of the axis of the Earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic. The Earth's eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant, but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system.

25|$|Slight {{variations}} in Earth's orbit lead {{to changes in}} the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of orbital variations are {{variations in}} Earth's eccentricity, changes in the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation, and precession of Earth's axis. Combined together, these produce <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycles</b> which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods, their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara, and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record.|$|E

40|$|Groundwater is {{essential}} to modern human survival during drought periods. There is also growing geological evidence of springs associated with stone tools and hominin fossils in the East African Rift System (EARS) during a critical period for hominin evolution (from 1. 8 Ma). However {{it is not known}} how vulnerable these springs may have been to climate variability and whether groundwater availability may have played a part in human evolution. Recent interdisciplinary research at Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has documented climate fluctuations attributable to astronomic forcing and the presence of paleosprings directly associated with archaeological sites. Using palaeogeological reconstruction and groundwater modelling of the Olduvai Gorge paleo-catchment, we show how spring discharge was likely linked to East African climate variability of annual to <b>Milankovitch</b> <b>cycle</b> timescales. Under decadal to centennial timescales, spring flow would have been relatively invariant providing good water resource resilience through long droughts. For multi-millennial periods, modelled spring flows lag groundwater recharge by 100 s to 1000 years. The lag creates long buffer periods allowing hominins to adapt to new habitats as potable surface water from rivers or lakes became increasingly scarce. Localised groundwater systems are likely to have been widespread within the EARS providing refugia and intense competition during dry periods, thus being an important factor in natural selection and evolution, as well as a vital resource during hominin dispersal within and out of Africa...|$|R
