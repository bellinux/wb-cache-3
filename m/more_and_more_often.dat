The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> <b>often</b> asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
25|$|Three {{months after}} the split, Byrne said {{that members of the}} group fought with one another <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> in the latter years leading up to the split and he felt that it was the right time to end their time together. Some media {{predicted}} a possible reunion in the future, but Westlife put an end to that speculation by vowing they would never reunite. However, on 22 July 2016, four years following the split, Filan told Lorriane that while there are currently no plans for a Westlife reunion, he would not rule it out for the future.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic (recombinant or cell-clone) human {{immunoglobulins}} {{can now be}} made, and {{for several}} reasons (including the risk of prion contamination of biological materials) {{are likely to be}} used <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often.</b> However, they are expensive to produce and are not in large-scale production as of 2013. In the future {{it might be possible to}} artificially design antibodies to fit specific antigens, then produce them in large quantities to induce temporary immunity in people in advance of exposure to a specific pathogen, such as a bacterium, a virus, or a prion. At present, the science to understand this process is available but not the technology to perform it.|$|E

For example, up until 2012, crack cocaine carried penalties one hundred times more severe than cocaine despite the fact that these drugs are essentially identical. Especially in urban black communities, convictions were nearly exclusively for crack, while cocaine use is statistically much higher among affluent whites.|$|R

25|$|Sheriff Walt Bannerman (played by Chris Bruno) — The {{relationship}} between Johnny and Walt is initially very rocky, as Johnny often feels that Walt stole Sarah from him. However, since then as Johnny displays his powers <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> {{in law enforcement}} situations, Johnny becomes an asset to Walt, and the two become friends. The name Walt Bannerman {{is a combination of}} the names George Bannerman and Walt Hazlett; in the novel, George Bannerman was the sheriff, and Walt Hazlett was the man Sarah married. At the beginning of season 6, Walt is killed in a fire at the Faith Heritage Chapel. However, he continued to pop up throughout the season in visions, flashbacks, and even briefly as a ghost.|$|E
500|$|Young sharks can {{be found}} in shallow inshore environments such as bays until at least three years of age, {{suggesting}} this species uses these sheltered habitats as nurseries. As the sharks grow older, they venture farther from land into deeper water, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often,</b> until they eventually disperse. This is a long-lived, slow-growing species; males grow faster and reach a smaller ultimate size than females. Sexual maturity is attained at around [...] long and 12 years of age for males, and [...] long and 13 years of age for females. The maximum lifespan is at least 26 years for males and 30 years for females.|$|E

2500|$|A paddle scoop, Marillier shot or ramp shot is {{a modern}} cricketing shot. Players use it <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> in One Day International and Twenty20 cricket matches, since it {{appeared}} in the early 21st century. The player makes the shot by positioning the body square-on with the ball, both feet pointing towards the bowler at a perpendicular angle. The player uses the bat to deflect the ball over the batsman's leg side shoulder, thus guiding the ball towards the fine leg region.|$|E
2500|$|Ukha is a warm watery fish dish, however {{calling it}} a fish soup would not be {{absolutely}} correct. [...] "Ukha" [...] as a name for fish broth was established only in the late 17th to early 18th centuries. In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths, and then later chicken. Beginning from the 15th century, fish was <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> used to prepare ukha, thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups.|$|E

Very roughly, kango are generally <b>more</b> formal, <b>often</b> restricted to writing, while yamato kotoba are <b>more</b> casual <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> used in speech, but both types of words are commonly used in both speech and writing.|$|R

After a short while Olga gets married to an American businessman, which soon goes wrong, and she returns to the Netherlands.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} medieval romances dealt heavily with themes from folklore, which diminished over time, though remaining a presence. [...] Many early tales had the knight, such as Sir Launfal, {{meet with}} fairy ladies, and Huon of Bordeaux is aided by King Oberon, but these fairy characters were transformed, <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often,</b> into wizards and enchantresses. Morgan le Fay never loses her name, but in Le Morte d'Arthur, she studies magic {{rather than being}} inherently magical. Similarly, knights lose magical abilities. [...] Still, fairies never completely vanished from the tradition. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late tale, but the Green Knight himself is an otherworldly being.|$|E
2500|$|Hogan often {{declined}} {{to play in}} the PGA Championship, skipping it <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> as his career wore on. There were two reasons for this. First, the PGA Championship was, until 1958, a match play event, and Hogan's particular skill was [...] "shooting a number"—meticulously planning and executing a strategy to achieve a score for a round on a particular course (even to the point of leaving out the 7-iron in the U.S. Open at Merion, saying [...] "there are no 7-iron shots at Merion"). Second, the PGA required several days of 36 holes per day competition, and after his 1949 auto accident, Hogan struggled to manage more than 18 holes a day.|$|E
2500|$|During {{months of}} {{exploration}} in the Pacific, the ship visited many islands in Polynesia. On their {{arrival in the}} Marquesas Islands, the crews found ways [...] "to socialise" [...] with the islanders. Dumont's moral conduct was irreproachable, but he provided a highly summarised description of some incidents of their stay in Nuku Hiva in his reports. [...] During the voyage from the East Indies to Tasmania some of the crew were lost to tropical fevers and dysentery (14 men and 3 officials); but for Dumont the worst moment during the expedition was at Valparaiso, where he {{received a letter from}} his wife that informed him of the death of his second son from cholera. [...] Adélie’s sorrowful demand that he return home, coincided with a deterioration in his health: Dumont was <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> hit by attacks of gout and stomach pains.|$|E

40|$|A {{challenge}} in evolutionary biology {{is to understand}} the operation of sexual selection on males in polyandrous groups, where sexual selection occurs before and after mating. Here, we combine fine-grained behavioral information (> 41, 000 interactions) with molecular parentage data to study sexual selection in replicated, age-structured groups of polyandrous red junglefowl, Gallus gallus. Male reproductive success {{was determined by the}} number of females mated (precopulatory sexual selection) and his paternity share, which was driven by the polyandry of his female partners (postcopulatory sexual selection). Pre- and postcopulatory components of male reproductive success covaried positively; males with high mating success also had high paternity share. Two male phenotypes affected male pre- and postcopulatory performance: average aggressiveness toward rival males and age. Aggressive males mated with <b>more</b> females <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> with individual females, resulting in higher sexual exclusivity. Similarly, younger males mated with <b>more</b> females <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> with individual females, suffering less intense sperm competition than older males. Older males had a lower paternity share even allowing for their limited sexual exclusivity, indicating they may produce less competitive ejaculates. These results show that—in these populations—postcopulatory sexual selection reinforces precopulatory sexual selection, consistently promoting younger <b>and</b> <b>more</b> aggressive males...|$|R

60|$|Yet it did come, {{and quite}} unexpectedly. Tarzan was hunting {{far to the}} north. He had wandered away from the tribe, as he did <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often</b> as he {{approached}} maturity, to hunt alone for a few days. As a child he had enjoyed romping and playing with the young apes, his companions; but now these play-fellows of his had grown to surly, lowering bulls, or to touchy, suspicious mothers, jealously guarding helpless balus. So Tarzan found in his own man-mind a greater and a truer companionship than {{any or all of}} the apes of Kerchak could afford him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} this {{incident}} of the drums that Rachel experienced the strangest days, or rather weeks of her life. Nya sent her into no more trances, {{and to all}} outward seeming nothing happened. Yet within her much did happen. Her madness had utterly left her and still she was not as other women are, or as she herself had been in health. Her mind seemed to wander and she knew not whither it wandered. Yet for long hours, although she was awake and, so Noie said, talking or eating or walking as usual, it was away from her, and afterwards she could remember nothing. Also this happened at night as well as during the day, and ever <b>more</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>often.</b>|$|E
60|$|The geese I have described, {{belonging}} to the three old women, could fly remarkably well, and eventually some of them, during their flights down stream, discovered {{at a distance of}} about eight miles from home the immense, low, marshy plain bordering the sea-like Plata River.
