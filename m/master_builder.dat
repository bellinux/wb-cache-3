5|$|Bornstellar and {{the humans}} awaken the Didact, a Warrior class {{who was one}} of the commanders of Forerunner {{military}} in the Forerunner-human war. He was exiled to stasis after coming into conflict with the <b>Master</b> <b>Builder,</b> the leader of the Forerunners. The <b>Master</b> <b>Builder</b> is responsible for the creation of the titular Halo superweapons. The Didact is married to the Librarian, one of the most powerful and influential Lifeworkers to have lived. She is a Lifeshaper, the highest rank a Lifeworker can achieve, and is responsible for indexing every species in the galaxy in the Ark.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} 13 September 1573, {{and it was}} {{complete}} by 1580. The fortress was built under the <b>master</b> <b>builder</b> Giannis Skordilis, {{and a total of}} 107,142 Cretans and 40,205 animals took part in its construction.|$|E
5|$|When {{attempting}} {{to visit the}} San 'Shyuum home world, the four are captured by Builders, commanded by the <b>Master</b> <b>Builder.</b> The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow the imprint of the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the <b>Master</b> <b>Builder</b> is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the <b>Master</b> <b>Builder,</b> who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E

5|$|During the Livonian War, Estonia {{became part}} of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a Lutheran {{congregation}} and was then called the Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the castle and the nearby land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold into a modern castle. Arent Passer, a well-known sculptor and <b>master</b> <b>builder,</b> was invited as a consultant.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Denison, {{a wealthy}} banker, {{purchased}} the estate in about 1787, and it {{remained in the}} Denison family until 1849, when it passed to Thomas Cubitt, a <b>master</b> <b>builder.</b> At the time, Cubitt was working on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and the mansion he designed to replace the old one was a more modest version of Osborne. It was still a substantial building though, in the Italianate style, with almost 100 rooms on three storeys.|$|E
5|$|About 1272, {{work began}} on {{building}} a new cathedral in Östra Aros near the Fyris River to the south. It was constructed {{on the site of}} the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity, located almost exactly where the cathedral's chancel now stands. It was here that Sweden's patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160. The name of Uppsala was kept, and the surrounding town Östra Aros soon changed its name accordingly. The relics of Saint Eric, the treasure of Uppsala, were moved from Gamla Uppsala to the new site in 1273, along with the formal move of the archbishopric. The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded. In 1287, a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by <b>master</b> <b>builder</b> Étienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at Uppsala. Étienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel, the transepts and probably the south portal, although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor. Progress was slow as a result of the cold climate, the plague and many financial difficulties. It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed, thanks in particular to the contribution of the <b>master</b> <b>builder</b> Nikolaus från Västerås who began construction of the nave.|$|E

On Wood Lane, off Cavendish Road, and built in a mock-Tudor style, the footprint and gardens cover , of which the house must occupy {{no more than one}} fifth and the plot may not be subdivided into more than one home under the rules of the building scheme. It was designed in 1913 by architect Theophilus Arthur Allen, who had been commissioned by local man Norman H. Johnson. Allen employed a local firm called Love & Sons in the construction of Kenwood. The hill was divided into lots around the Weybridge Golf Club, which was designed by Harry Colt in 1912. Many of the original houses on the estate were built by <b>master</b> <b>builder</b> Walter George Tarrant whose firm constructed the original external garage ca.1920 (demolished ca.1995).|$|E

5|$|In 1795, Jones {{surveyed}} Ancaster, Thorold, Grantham, Beverley, Southwold, Whitby, York, Scarboro, Pickering, {{the lands}} of Joseph Brant and Lake Simcoe. On December 24, 1795 Jones was directed by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe to survey and open a cart road from the newly planned settlement of York, Upper Canada to Lake Simcoe. Jones began the planning work the next day. On the 29th of that December, Jones was given the assistance of thirty of the Queen's Rangers for the road's construction. The work began January 4, 1796 on this road, which would become Yonge Street. Jones worked as the effective <b>master</b> <b>builder</b> {{in addition to his}} title as surveyor. The road reached Holland Landing on February 16, 1796, and Jones returned to York on February 20 to inform the Lieutenant Governor that the road was completed. This first incarnation of Yonge Street measured some 34 miles and 53 chains. For the rest of 1796, Jones spent his time surveying Newark, Flamborough, Grimsby, Saltfleet, Beverley, York and Coot's Paradise.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle {{to save the}} planet, several Halos are able to escape, their own AIs {{enacting}} failsafe protocols. Bornstellar manages to escape {{with the help of}} a young council member and a guard. They escape through the same portal as the Halos but lose power and drift for an unknown amount of time before being recovered by Lifeworkers. The portal has carried them to the Ark, the massive structure that serves as a construction site for Halos and also a haven for the Librarian's work. The trio are healed, and Bornstellar meets the Librarian, which brings up conflicting thoughts and feelings, due to his imprint from the Didact. She informs him that the <b>Master</b> <b>Builder</b> executed the Didact soon after Bornstellar was sent back to his family. With the news that the Didact is gone, Bornstellar resolves to take his place. The book ends with a narration from the Didact/Bornstellar, revealing that the escaped prisoner was the last Precursor, known as Timeless One. Through a conversation the Didact had long ago, it is learned that the Precursors created the Forerunners, only for the Forerunners to rise up and eradicate the Precursors, except this one, who now seeks revenge.|$|E
