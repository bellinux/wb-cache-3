5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|At the {{vernal equinox}} of 1930, Fortune {{declared}} that—with the 'Lesser Mysteries' and three degree system now properly established—she {{wanted to turn}} away from public work and focus on personal spiritual development. At the vernal equinox of 1931, Fortune stepped down as leader of the Fraternity, with Loveday being appointed Magus of the Lodge in her place. During the 1930s, Fortune's emphasis moved away from mediumship and towards ritual, {{while at the same time}} other Fraternity members embraced mediumship in order to channel the messages of the Masters. In late 1931, Fortune began mooting the idea of the construction of a permanent base, or Sanctuary, at the Chalice Orchard, and despite the economic obstacles of the Great Depression was able to raise sufficient funds. The group experienced a growth in the numbers attending its lectures, subscribing to its correspondence course, and using their private library; conversely, their Sunday services were not very popular, with a move from the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> evening seeing no effect. One significant individual who joined the Fraternity was Christine Campbell Thomson, who had been Fortune's literary agent since 1926. Fortune subsequently aided Thomson in separating from her abusive husband, after which she grew close to another Fraternity member, Colonel C. R. F. Seymour, in 1937. Although Seymour became a senior member of the Fraternity, relations between him and Fortune were strained, and during the Second World War he left London and settled in Liverpool, terminating his involvement with Fortune's Bayswater temple.|$|E

5|$|The {{target of}} the Confederate assault {{was the center of}} the Union Army of the Potomac's II Corps, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock. Directly in the center was the division of Brig. Gen. John Gibbon with the brigades of Brig. Gen. William Harrow, Col. Norman J. Hall, and Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb. (On the night of July 2, Meade correctly predicted to Gibbon at a council of war that Lee would try an attack on Gibbon's sector the following <b>morning.)</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> north of this position were brigades from the division of Brig.

25|$|Forest species, {{such as the}} slaty-breasted tinamou, {{maintain}} large home ranges {{through which}} they move in apparently random patterns. The male brushland tinamou maintains a home territory of , but will occasionally wander outside it into those of his neighbors. Females will wander throughout multiple males' territories. The ornate tinamou lives mainly upslope in hilly puna grassland but will move each <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the slopes to feed and drink. Granivorous species will move daily into grain fields with some, such as Darwin's nothura, remaining in the fields until there is no food left.

25|$|The galley from Napoli, which {{sailed to}} his left, was again {{showing signs of}} disorder, so he ordered it moved to the right, away from the {{approaching}} Turks. Loredan had his ships withdraw a while, in order to draw the Turks further from Gallipoli and have the sun in the Venetians' back. Once ready, Loredan led his own flagship to attack the leading Ottoman galley. Its crew offered determined resistance, and the other Ottoman galleys came astern of Loredan's ship to his left, and launched volleys of arrows against him and his men. Loredan himself was wounded by an arrow below the eye and the nose, and by another that passed through his left hand, {{as well as other}} arrows that struck him with lesser effect. Nevertheless, the galley was captured after most of its crew was killed, and Loredan, after leaving a few men of his crew to guard it, turned against a galleot, which he captured as well. Again leaving a few of his men and his flag on it, he turned on the other Ottoman ships. The fight lasted from <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second hour of the night. The Venetians defeated the Ottoman fleet, killing its commander and many of the captains and crews (tutti andarono pel fil di spada) and capturing six great galleys and nine galleots, according to Loredan's account, but 27 vessels in total according to Doukas. Loredan gives a detailed breakdown of the ships captured by his men: his own ship captured a galley and a galleot of 20 banks of oars; the Contarini galley captured a galley; the galley of Giorgio Loredan captured two galleots of 22 banks and two galleots of 20 banks; the Grimani galley of Negroponte captured a galley; the galley of Jiacopo Barbarini captured a galleot of 23 banks and another of 19 banks; the same for the Capello galley; the galley of Girolamo Minotto from Napoli captured the Ottoman flagship galley, which had been defeated and pursued before by the Capello galley; the Venieri and Barbarigo galleys of Candia took a galley. Venetian casualties were light, twelve killed—mostly by drowning—and 340 wounded, most of them lightly.|$|E

500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, she was glad she had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up this <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound of a bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{incident}}, Burroughs claimed the [...] "William Tell" [...] incident never happened, {{and that he}} had dropped his gun and it had accidentally fired. Burroughs spent 13 days in jail before his brother came to Mexico City and bribed Mexican lawyers and officials to release Burroughs on bail while he awaited trial for the killing, which was ruled culpable homicide. Vollmer's daughter, Julie Adams, went to live with her grandmother, and William S. Burroughs Jr. went to St. Louis to live with his grandparents. Burroughs reported every Monday <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> jail in Mexico City while his prominent Mexican attorney worked to resolve the case. According to James Grauerholz, two witnesses had agreed to testify that the gun had fired accidentally while he was checking {{to see if it was}} loaded, with ballistics experts bribed to support this story. Nevertheless, the trial was continuously delayed and Burroughs began to write what would eventually become the short novel Queer while awaiting his trial. Upon Burroughs's attorney fleeing Mexico in light of his own legal problems, Burroughs decided, according to Ted Morgan, to [...] "skip" [...] and return to the United States.

2500|$|Another such episode {{details the}} boy's {{trip on the}} {{outskirts}} of the village, sent over to provide food for the Romani day laborers hired by Ștefan and Smaranda. This episode sees the boy's unsupervised encounter with the village hoopoe (or [...] "Armenian cuckoo"). Miserable over having to wake up early every <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sound of the bird, Nică exercises his revenge by trapping the bird inside her nest, a time-consuming process which drives the awaiting and isolated laborers to despair. Met with much hostility by his father's employees when he ultimately reaches his destination, the boy makes his way back to the hoopoe's lime tree and easily ties up the exhausted bird, hiding her in the attic of his house, where it no longer can sing. His deed proves detrimental to the entire community, deprived of its alarm clock, and rumors quickly spread that Nică is responsible. While Smaranda decides whether she should trust these reports, the boy assesses that the his best choice is to sell the hoopoe at the fair. He proceeds to do so, but his entire scheme crumbles once a sly old man, pretending to assess the bird, releases it from its bonds. As the bird flies back to her nest, Nică angrily demands reparation. He is instead ridiculed by the old man, who informs him that Ștefan is also attending the fair and might be interested in the conversation, thus exposing the boy and prompting him to rush out of the market in fear of more severe repercussion.|$|E
