40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals with {{design of a}} new generation of coherence-controlled holographic microscope (CCHM). The microscope is based on off-axis holographic configuration using diffraction grating and allows the use of temporally and spatially incoherent illumination. In the theoretical section a new optical configuration of the microscope is proposed and conditions for different parameters of the microscope and its optical components are derived. The influence of different sources of noise on phase detection sensitivity is studied. In the next section design of experimental setup is described and automatable adjustment procedure is proposed. Last section describes experimental verification of the most important optical parameters of the experimental setup. When compared to previous generation of CCHM, the newly proposed configuration uses infinity-corrected objectives and common <b>microscope</b> <b>condensers,</b> allows more space for the specimens, eliminates the limitation of spectral transmittance and significantly simplifies the adjustment procedure so that automation of this procedure is possible...|$|E
50|$|Turning from astronomical work to {{the design}} and making of {{photographic}} lenses, he introduced improvements in both portrait and landscape lenses, in object-glasses for the <b>microscope</b> and in <b>condensers</b> for the optical lantern. An important invention was the Rapid Rectilinear camera objective. In connection with celestial photography he constructed photo-heliographs for the Wilna observatory in 1863, for the Harvard College Observatory in 1864, and, in 1873, several for the British government.|$|R
