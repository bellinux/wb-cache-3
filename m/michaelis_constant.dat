40|$|A {{study was}} made of the binding of 7 -ethoxy-, 7 -n-propoxy- and 7 -n-pentoxy-coumarin to {{cytochrome}} P- 450 (2) reconstituted into large unilamellar liposomes composed of a mixture of egg L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylethanolamine and dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (2 : 1 : 0. 06, by weight). The apparent spectral dissociation constants K(s) app. increased linearly with increasing proteoliposomal concentration. When both cytochrome P- 450 (2) and NADPH:cytochrome P- 450 reductase were reconstituted into liposomes, the apparent <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constants</b> K(m) app. for O-dealkylation of 7 -methoxy-, 7 -ethoxy- and 7 -n-propoxy-coumarin showed a similar dependence on the proteoliposomal concentration. The results were in accordance with models for kinetic or equilibrium processes in biphasic systems containing membrane-bound catalytic or acceptor sites, in which a linear solute partition in the bilayer membrane is postulated. The methyl, ethyl and n-propyl ether were readily dealkylated. However, the O-dealkylation rate of 7 -n-butoxycoumarin was low and became very small for longer alkyl ethers. Both the effective dissociation <b>constants</b> and effective <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constants</b> decreased with elongation of the alkyl side chain of the coumarins. From plots of the apparent dissociation <b>constants</b> and apparent <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constants</b> against the lipid volume fraction of the proteoliposomes, the membrane partition coefficients for several homologues were calculated. When protein-free liposomes were added to 7 -n-alkoxycoumarin solutions, the fluorescence intensity of the coumarins decreased and eventually became negligible in the presence of an excess of liposomal material. On the assumption that the overall fluorescence can be ascribed exclusively to the fraction of 7 -n-alkoxycoumarin molecules present in the aqueous phase, partition coefficients for liposomal accumulation of the test compounds could be determined directly. For several coumarin ethers, comparable values were derived for the membrane partition coefficients from binding, kinetic and fluorescence intensity measurements. The change in free energy per methylene group of the 7 -n-alkoxycoumarins for partitioning between n-octanol and buffer was significantly different from the value for liposome partitioning. status: publishe...|$|R

The reduction of pyruvate by NADH proceeded {{more rapidly than}} the reverse reaction, and the apparent <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constants</b> for pyruvate and NADH were lower than for d-lactate and NAD+.

5000|$|The <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constant</b> {{is equal}} to the {{substrate}} concentration at which the enzyme converts substrates into products at half its maximal rate and hence is related to the affinity of the substrate for the enzyme. The catalytic constant (...) is the rate of product formation when the enzyme is saturated with substrate and therefore reflects the enzyme's maximum rate. The rate of product formation is dependent on both how well the enzyme binds substrate and how fast the enzyme converts substrate into product once substrate is bound. For a kinetically perfect enzyme, every encounter between enzyme and substrate leads to product and hence the reaction velocity is only limited by the rate the enzyme encounters substrate in solution. Hence the upper limit for [...] {{is equal to}} rate of substrate diffusion which is between108 and 109 s−1M−1.|$|E
5000|$|Glutamate {{dehydrogenase}} (GLDH, GDH) is an enzyme, {{present in}} most microbes and the mitochondria of eukaryotes, as {{are some of}} the other enzymes required for urea synthesis, that converts glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, and vice versa. In animals, the produced ammonia is usually used as a substrate in the urea cycle. Typically, the α-ketoglutarate to glutamate reaction does not occur in mammals, as glutamate dehydrogenase equilibrium favours the production of ammonia and α-ketoglutarate. Glutamate dehydrogenase also has a very low affinity for ammonia (high <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constant</b> [...] of about 1 mM), and therefore toxic levels of ammonia would have to be present in the body for the reverse reaction to proceed (that is, α-ketoglutarate and ammonia to glutamate and NAD(P)+). In bacteria, the ammonia is assimilated to amino acids via glutamate and aminotransferases. In plants, the enzyme can work in either direction depending on environment and stress. Transgenic plants expressing microbial GLDHs are improved in tolerance to herbicide, water deficit, and pathogen infections. They are more nutritionally valuable.|$|E
5000|$|The {{activity}} of protein C may be down-regulated {{by reducing the}} amount either of available thrombomodulin or of EPCR. This may be done by inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β [...] ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Activated leukocytes release these inflammatory mediators during inflammation, inhibiting the creation of both thrombomodulin and EPCR, and inducing their shedding from the endothelial surface. Both of these actions down-regulate protein C activation. Thrombin itself may also {{have an effect on}} the levels of EPCR. In addition, proteins released from cells can impede protein C activation, for example eosinophil, which may explain thrombosis in hypereosinophilic heart disease. Protein C may be up-regulated by platelet factor 4. This cytokine is conjectured to improve activation of protein C by forming an electrostatic bridge from protein C's Gla domain to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) domain of thrombomodulin, reducing the <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constant</b> (KM) for their reaction. In addition, Protein C is inhibited by protein C inhibitor.|$|E

Altering the amine growth substrate enabled tailored and targeted oxidase upregulation, facilitating catalytic differentiation and isolation.

Two oxidases possessed a copper dependent redox co-factor with broad specificity towards monoamines. <b>Michaelis</b> <b>constants</b> (KM) ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 9 mM for common C 1 –C 5 aliphatic monoamines and < 0. 2 mM {{for a range of}} aromatic amines.
