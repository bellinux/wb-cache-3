5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I {{was at the time}} {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" [...] In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Kneale's play Mrs Wickens in the Fall, {{transmitted}} by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the CBS {{network in the}} United States, retitled The Littlest Enemy. Broadcast on 18 June as part of The United States Steel Hour anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale's only involvement with American television, {{and he was not}} pleased with the result. [...] "I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> I would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America," [...] he later commented.|$|E
500|$|Fossett {{said he did}} not {{participate}} in any of the [...] "interesting things" [...] he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: [...] "There was a period of time where I wasn't doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to start getting back into things." [...] He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado in 1990. Fossett later sold most of his business interests, although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006.|$|E

They felt so badly I just cried over both of them--howled. But I knew {{there was only one}} man in the world I could ever marry. I had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> for once and it was real easy, too. It's very delightful to feel so sure, and know it's your own sureness and not somebody else's." ...|$|R
500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Brown, {{the coach}} of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> he'd be with my club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; but I did not do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." [...] Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that: ...|$|E

A {{cloud of}} wrath {{was on my}} brain, like the cloud of copper fog on the houses and gardens round. My decision was violent and simple; yet the thoughts {{that led up to}} it were so complicated and contradictory that I could not retrace them now. I knew Hawkins was a kind, innocent gentleman; and I would have given ten pounds for the pleasure of kicking him down the road. That God should allow good people to be as bestially stupid as that-- rose against me like a towering blasphemy.|$|R

500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were his kind of people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that we needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan {{did not look up}} Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E

6000|$|Of course I write--and feel--as a discontented man; and [...] what I {{say to you}} I {{would not}} say to any other human [...] being.

[...] But I meant to earn my bread honestly, and give it up, [...] --as I did before, when I could not keep it with a clear [...] conscience. I knew that I was hustled out of the object [...] of my poor {{ambition}} by that unfortunate man who has [...] been hurried to his fate. In such a position I ought to [...] distrust, and do, partly, distrust my own feelings. And I [...] am aware that I have been soured by prison indignities. [...] But still the conviction remains with me that [...] parliamentary interests are not those battles of gods [...] and giants which I used to regard them. Our Gyas with [...] the hundred hands is but a Three-fingered Jack, and I [...] sometimes think that we share our great Jove with the [...] Strand Theatre. Nevertheless I shall go back,--and if they [...] will make me a joint lord to-morrow I shall be in heaven! ...|$|R
6000|$|... that he [the deacon] {{had many}} relics of saints at home, {{and that he}} [...] would give them to me if I would furnish him with the means of [...] {{returning}} to Rome; he had observed that I had two mules, and if I would [...] let him have {{one of them and}} would despatch with him a confidential [...] servant to take charge of the {388} relics, he would at once send them [...] to me. This plausibly expressed proposition pleased me, and I <b>made</b> <b>up</b> [...] <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to test the value of the somewhat ambiguous promise at [...] once;[100] so giving him the mule and money for his journey I ordered [...] my notary Ratleig (who already desired to go to Rome to offer his [...] devotions there) to go with him. Therefore, having left Aix-la-Chapelle [...] (where the Emperor and his Court resided at the time) they came to [...] Soissons. Here they spoke with Hildoin, abbot of the monastery of St. [...] Medardus, because the said deacon had assured him that he had the means [...] of placing in his possession the body of the blessed Tiburtius the [...] Martyr. Attracted by which promises he (Hildoin) sent with them a [...] certain priest, Hunus by name, a sharp man (hominem callidum), whom [...] he ordered to receive and bring back the body of the martyr in [...] question. And so, resuming their journey, they proceeded to Rome as [...] fast as they could. (Cap. i. 3.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although I had {{one of my best}} years in 1905.

So I just up and quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carrington told Woolcombe he had wavered on {{the site}} of the town after making two forays up the Waitara River, where he {{discovered}} beautiful country. [...] "I once had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to have the town there," [...] he wrote, [...] "but the almost constant surf upon the bar has caused me to prefer this place ... the New Plymouth Company has the garden of this country; all we want is labour and particularly working oxen." ...|$|E

He had his mouth open to [...] answer, and I had my ears open, as you may guess, to listen, and [...] see what happens, and tell me if it wasn't a rare sell! Off the old [...] woman goes into a faint all of a sudden. He catches hold of her and [...] sings out for help. Down I ran to the door as hard as I could, [...] slammed it as though I had just come in, and came running up the [...] path. 'Anything the matter?' I called out, as though I didn't know [...] my way. 'A lady fainted,' he shouts; 'come and help me carry her [...] into the house;' so up I went, and together we carried her inside [...] and laid her on a couch in one of the queerest-furnished rooms I [...] ever saw. There was servants with lighted lamps running about, and [...] another woman who seemed to be a relation, and such a fuss they all [...] made, and no mistake. However, Mr. M---- cooled them all down [...] again pretty soon, for he could see that it was only an ordinary [...] faint, and then he began to look at me curiously. I had <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> [...] <b>mind</b> to stay until the old woman came round, but he was too many [...] for me, for he got up and took me to the door himself. Of course, [...] he was awfully polite and all that, and was very much obliged for [...] my help, but I twigged it in a moment. He wanted me gone, so off I [...] skedaddled.|$|R
60|$|Do {{you mean}} to have a short preface upon the {{construction}} of the sonnet? Though I have written so many, I have scarcely <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mind</b> upon the subject. It should seem that the sonnet, like every other legitimate composition, ought to have a beginning, a middle, and an end; in other words, to consist of three parts, like the three propositions of a syllogism, if such an illustration may be used. But the frame of metre adopted by the Italians does not accord with this view; and, as adhered to by them, it seems to be, if not arbitrary, best fitted to a division of the sense into two parts, of eight and six lines each. Milton, however, has not submitted to this; in the better half of his sonnets the sense does not close with the rhyme at the eighth line, but overflows into the second portion of the metre. Now it has struck me that this is not done merely to gratify the ear by variety and freedom of sound, but also to aid in giving that pervading sense of intense unity in which the excellence of the sonnet has always seemed to me mainly to consist. Instead of looking at this composition as a piece of architecture, making a whole out of three parts, I have been much in the habit of preferring the image of an orbicular body,--a sphere, or a dew-drop. All this will appear to you a little fanciful; and I am well aware that a sonnet will often be found excellent, where the beginning, the middle, and the end are distinctly marked, and also where it is distinctly separated into two parts, to which, as I before observed, the strict Italian model, as they write it, is favourable. Of this last construction of sonnet, Russell's upon 'Philoctetes' is a fine specimen; the first eight lines give the hardship of the case, the six last the consolation, or the per-contra.|$|R
6000|$|To turn then {{to what is}} more amusing, {{the battle}} of last night. [...] After much {{consideration}} and conference with Herbert (who has had an [...] attack of bilious fever and could not come down, though much better, [...] and soon, I hope, to be out again, but who agreed with me), I [...] determined that I ought to vote last night with Disraeli; and <b>made</b> [...] <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> accordingly, which involved saying why, at some period of [...] the night. I was anxious to do it early, as I knew Graham would [...] speak on the other side, and did not wish any conflict even of [...] reasoning with him. But he found I was going to speak, and I suppose [...] may have had some similar wish. At any rate, he had the opportunity [...] of following Stafford who began the debate, as he {{was to take the}} [...] other side. Then there was an amusing scene between him and Peel. [...] Both rose and stood in competition for the Speaker's eye. The [...] Speaker had seen Graham first, and he got it. But when he was [...] speaking I felt I {{had no choice but to}} follow him. He made so very [...] able a speech that this was no pleasant prospect; but I acquired the [...] courage that proceeds from fear, according to a line from Ariosto: [...] Chi per virtù, chi per paura vale [one from valour, another from [...] fear, is strong], and made my plunge when he sat down. But the [...] Speaker was not dreaming of me, and called a certain Mr. Scott who [...] had risen at the same time. Upon this I sat down again, and there [...] was a great uproar because the House always anticipating more or [...] less interest when men speak on opposite sides and in succession, [...] who are usually together, called for me. So I was up again, and the [...] Speaker deserted Scott and called me, and I had to make the best I [...] could after Graham. That is the end of the story, for there is [...] nothing else worth saying. It was at the dinner hour from 7 to [...] 7¾, and then I went home for a little quiet. Peel again replied [...] upon me, but I did not hear that part of him; and Disraeli showed [...] the marvellous talent that he has, for summing up with brilliancy, [...] buoyancy, and comprehensiveness at the close of a debate. You have [...] heard me speak of that talent before when I have been wholly against [...] him; but never, last night or at any other time, would I go to him [...] for conviction, but for the delight of the ear and the fancy. What a [...] long story! ...|$|R
2500|$|An anti-imperialist writer, Orwell {{promotes}} the idea that, through imperialism, both conqueror and conquered are destroyed. Orwell clearly states his displeasure with colonial Britain: [...] "I had already <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that imperialism was an evil thing... I {{was all for}} the Burmese and all against their oppressors, the British." [...] The narrator perceives that the conqueror is not in control, but it is rather {{the will of the}} people that governs his actions. As ruler, he notes that it is his duty to appear resolute, with his word being final.|$|E
