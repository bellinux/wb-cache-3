5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney had hoped {{to spend some time}} tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, {{an angry}} crowd {{surrounded}} the Indiana Statehouse, listed their grievances, demanded the military leave the city, and threatened <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> if their demands were not met. Ralston addressed {{the crowd to}} promise concessions if the workers would return to work. His speech was credited by the press with ending the strike. After three days of peace, the military withdrew from the city. The Indiana General Assembly met later that month and enacted Indiana's first minimum wage laws, regular working hours, workplace safety requirements, and began projects to improve the city's tenement slums.|$|E

5|$|According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census, the Nakhichevan uyezd of the Erivan Governorate had a {{population}} of 100,771, of which 34,672 were Armenian (34.4%), while Caucasian Tatars (Azerbaijanis) numbered 64,151 or 63.7% of the total population. The proportion of Armenian was around 40% prior to World War I. Nakhichevan was disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 1918 to 1920 during the countries' brief independence. The Armenian population of Nakhichevan largely fled the area during the Ottoman invasion in 1918. By June 1919, after the British troops left the area, Armenia succeeded in establishing control over Nakhichevan. Some of the Nakhichevan Armenians returned to their homes in summer 1919. Again, <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> erupted in 1919 leaving some 10,000 Armenians dead and some 45 Armenian villages destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, {{both of whom}} he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include <b>more</b> <b>violence.</b> In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which were shown to veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E
5|$|When Colorado state troops {{arrived in}} Cripple Creek {{early on the}} morning of June 6, <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> had already broken out. The deputies were exchanging gunfire with the miners on Bull Hill. Gen. Brooks quickly moved his troops from the train station to the foot of Bull Hill. As Sheriff Bowers and Gen. Brooks began to argue about what course of action to take next, the deputies took {{advantage}} of the lull and attempted to charge the miners. The miners sounded the whistle at the Victor mine, alerting Gen. Brooks. Soldiers of the state militia quickly intercepted the deputies and stopped their advance. Brooks ordered his men to occupy the top of Bull Hill, and the miners offered no resistance.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days before}} the program's approval, Nathaniel Davis, the Assistant Secretary of State, told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he {{believed}} maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible. Davis correctly predicted the Soviet Union would respond by increasing involvement in the Angolan conflict, leading to <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> and negative publicity for the United States. When Ford approved the program, Davis resigned. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying that success required {{the expansion of the}} program, but its size already exceeded what could be hidden from the public eye. Davis' deputy, former U.S. ambassador to Chile Edward Mulcahy, also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on 13 May 1975. Mulcahy believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the communist MPLA, refuse to take sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA. He warned however that supporting UNITA would not sit well with Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire.|$|E

It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without <b>more</b> <b>violence.</b>|$|E
25|$|With these assurances of support, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns renewed raiding the Overmountain {{settlements}} that summer. These remained only sporadic {{until the}} fall, when an incident between {{one of the}} settlers, James Hubbard, and a noted Cherokee leader in the Overhill Towns, Noonday, brought the younger Overhill warriors into the fight and incited them all to <b>more</b> <b>violence.</b> This {{could be considered the}} start of a Southwest Indian War, fought by the Cherokee and later the Muscogee too.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Semitism, {{like all}} forms of racism, distorts the truth {{in order to put}} a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the {{historical}} objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> against any other human being.|$|E

25|$|In January 1925, Capone was ambushed, {{leaving him}} shaken but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was {{returning}} from a shopping trip {{when he was shot}} several times. After recovering, he effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, he was able to use <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> to increase revenue. An establishment that refused to purchase liquor from him often got blown up, and as many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw Capone as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.|$|E
25|$|In 1699, the Khalsa {{was founded}} by Guru Gobind Singh, the last guru. A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of {{punishing}} those who had persecuted the Sikhs. After the guru's death, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became {{the leader of the}} Sikh army and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire. He was executed by the emperor Jahandar Shah after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam. The decline of Mughal power during the 17th and 18th centuries, along with the growing strength of the Sikh Empire resulted in a balance of power which protected the Sikhs from <b>more</b> <b>violence.</b> The Sikh empire was absorbed into the British Indian empire after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849.|$|E
25|$|During the Civil Rights Movement, {{trust between}} the {{department}} and the predominantly African-American city residents became increasingly strained, as blacks pressed for social justice and fair treatment. In the 1960s, racial riots erupted in other cities due to police brutality. Mistreatment of black residents {{at the hands of}} several White officers resulted in <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> in Baltimore. The police force was being studied by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) as the department was considered severely troubled. The IACP report said that the BPD was the most corrupt and antiquated in the nation, and that it had developed almost no positive relationship with the city's African-American community. African-American citizens were subject to both excessive force from police officers, and retaliation from community members for any interaction with city police officers.|$|E

25|$|Sociobiologists and {{evolutionary}} psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape {{may be a}} mating strategy in humans, {{as a way for}} males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations. Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are women of childbearing age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to <b>more</b> <b>violence,</b> and that married women and women of childbearing age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women. Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.|$|E
25|$|By mid-June 1919, however, Armenia {{succeeded in}} {{establishing}} control over Nakhchivan {{and the whole}} territory of the self-proclaimed republic. The fall of the Aras republic triggered an invasion by the regular Azerbaijani army {{and by the end}} of July, Armenian troops were forced to leave Nakhchivan City to the Azeris. Again, <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> erupted leaving some ten thousand Armenians dead and forty-five Armenian villages destroyed. Meanwhile, feeling the situation to be hopeless and unable to maintain any control over the area, the British decided to withdraw from the region in mid-1919. Still, fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued and after a series of skirmishes that took place throughout the Nakhchivan district, a cease-fire agreement was concluded. However, the cease-fire lasted only briefly, and by early March 1920, more fighting broke out, primarily in Karabakh between Karabakh Armenians and Azerbaijan's regular army. This triggered conflicts in other areas with mixed populations, including Nakhchivan.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues surrounding this peace process is whether the Palestinian Authority in fact met its obligations to promote tolerance. There is specific evidence that the Palestinian Authority actively funded and supported many terrorist activities and groups. Palestinians stated that any terrorist acts stemmed from Israel not having conceded enough land and political power to win support among ordinary Palestinians. Israelis stated that these acts of terrorism were because the Palestinian Authority openly encouraged and supported incitement against Israel, and terrorism. There was increasing disagreement and debate among Israelis {{about the amount of}} positive results and benefits produced by the Oslo process. Supporters said it was producing advances leading to a viable Palestinian society which would promote genuine acceptance of Israel. Opponents said that concessions were merely emboldening extremist elements to commit <b>more</b> <b>violence</b> in order to win further concessions, without providing any real acceptance, benefits, goodwill, or reconciliation for Israel in return.|$|E
