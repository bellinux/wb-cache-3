40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{outbreak}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H 7 N 7 {{started at the}} end of February, 2003, in commercial poultry farms in the Netherlands. Although the risk of transmission of these viruses to humans was initially thought to be low, an outbreak investigation was launched to assess the extent of transmission of influenza A virus subtype H 7 N 7 from chickens to humans. METHODS: All workers in poultry farms, poultry farmers, and their families were asked to report signs of conjunctivitis or influenza-like illness. People with complaints were tested for influenza virus type A subtype H 7 (A/H 7) infection and completed a health questionnaire about type of symptoms, duration of illness, and possible exposures to infected poultry. FINDINGS: 453 people had health complaints [...] 349 reported conjunctivitis, 90 had influenza-like illness, and 67 had other complaints. We detected A/H 7 in conjunctival samples from 78 (26. 4 %) people with conjunctivitis only, in five (9. 4 %) with influenza-like illness and conjunctivitis, in two (5. 4 %) with influenza-like illness only, and in four (6 %) who reported other symptoms. Most positive samples had been collected within 5 days of symptom onset. A/H 7 infection was confirmed in three contacts (of 83 tested), one of whom developed influenza-like illness. Six people had influenza A/H 3 N 2 infection. After 19 people had been diagnosed with the infection, all workers received <b>mandatory</b> <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> and prophylactic treatment with oseltamivir. More than half (56 %) of A/H 7 infections reported here arose before the vaccination and treatment programme. INTERPRETATION: We noted an unexpectedly high number of transmissions of avian influenza A virus subtype H 7 N 7 to people directly involved in handling infected poultry, and we noted evidence for person-to-person transmission. Our data emphasise the importance of adequate surveillance, outbreak preparedness, and pandemic planning. (aut. ref. ...|$|E
40|$|Improvement in {{the immune}} {{response}} to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{in the elderly}} represents the primary unmet need in <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> We have shown that topical application of immunostimulating (IS) patches containing heat-labile enterotoxin of Escherichia coli (LT) enhances immune responses to injected vaccines. We extend these findings and show that LT-IS patch application enhances the antibody responses to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> in both young and aged mice. LT-IS patches markedly increased influenza virus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG), hemagglutination inhibition antibody, mucosal antibody, and T-cell responses. The magnitude of the immune responses in aged mice receiving an LT-IS patch was equivalent {{to or greater than}} that of the immune responses in young mice given vaccine alone. These results suggest that addition of an LT-IS patch may compensate for the deficient immune function seen in the aged in response to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Therefore, use of an LT-IS patch could be a new, safe, and simple immunization strategy that may significantly improve the outcome of <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The {{vaccination}} program against the 2009 pandemic H 1 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> (2009 H 1 N 1) provided {{a unique opportunity}} to determine if immune responses to the 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccine were affected by a recent, prior <b>vaccination</b> against seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus.</b> In the present study, we studied the immune responses to the 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccine in subjects who either received the seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> within the prior 3 months or did not. Following 2009 H 1 N 1 vaccination, subjects previously given a seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> exhibited significantly lower antibody responses, as determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay, than subjects who had not received the seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> This result is compatible with the phenomenon of “original antigenic sin,” by which previous <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> hampers induction of immunity against a new variant.

40|$|Background: Vaccinating {{children}} against <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> {{may reduce}} infections in immunised children and household contacts, {{thereby reducing the}} household-based cost associated with respiratory illnesses. Objective: To evaluate the impact of <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> of daycare children on costs of respiratory illnesses {{of the children and}} their household contacts from the household and societal perspective. Study design: Cost analysis of data from a randomised controlled trial covering the period November to April of 1996 - 7 and 1998 - 9. Children (127 in 1996 - 7 and 133 in 1998 - 9) from daycare centres in Californian (USA) naval bases received <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine (inactivated) or hepatitis A <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Outcome measures: Direct and indirect costs (1997 and 1999 US dollars) of respiratory illnesses in households of vaccinated and not vaccinated daycare children, excluding the cost of vaccination. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in household costs of respiratory illness between households with or without influenza virus-vaccinated children ($US 635 vs $US 492 : p = 0. 98 [1996 - 7]; $US 412. 70 vs $US 499. 50 : p = 0. 42 [1998 - 9]). In 1996 - 7, adult and 5 - to 17 -year-old contacts of vaccinated children had lower household costs than contacts of unvaccinated children ($US 58. 50 vs $US 83. 20, p = 0. 01 and $US 32. 80 vs $US 59. 50, p = 0. 04, respectively), while vaccinated children 0 - 4 years old had higher household costs than unvaccinated children in the same age group ($US 383 vs $US 236, p = 0. 05). In 1998 - 9, there were no differences within individual age groups. Results from societal perspective were similar. Conclusions: Overall, from both the household and societal perspectives, there were no economic benefits to households from vaccinating daycare children against <b>influenza</b> <b>virus.</b> However, we found some over-time inconsistency in results; this should be considered if changing recommendations about routine <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> of healthy children.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of a new <b>influenza</b> A <b>virus</b> (H 1 N 1) variant in 2009 led to a worldwide vaccination program, which was prepared in {{a relatively short period of}} time. This study investigated the humoral immunity against this virus before and after vaccination with a 2009 <b>influenza</b> A <b>virus</b> (H 1 N 1) monovalent MF 59 -adjuvanted vaccine, as well as the persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies. Our prospective longitudinal study included 498 health care workers (mean age, 43 years; median age, 44 years). Most (89 %) had never or only occasionally received a seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine, and 11 % were vaccinated annually (on average, for > 10 years). Antibody titers were determined by a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay at baseline, 3 weeks after the first vaccination, and 5 weeks and 7 months after the second vaccination. Four hundred thirty-five persons received two doses of the 2009 vaccine. After the first dose, 79. 5 % developed a HI titer of ≥ 40. This percentage increased to 83. 3 % after the second dose. Persistent antibodies were found in 71. 9 % of the group that had not received annual vaccinations and in 43. 8 % of the group that had received annual vaccinations. The latter group tended to have lower HI titers (P= 0. 09). With increasing age, HI titers decreased significantly, by 2. 4 % per year. A single dose of the 2009 vaccine was immunogenic in almost 80 % of the study population, whereas an additional dose resulted in significantly increased titers only in persons over 50. Finally, a reduced HI antibody response against the 2009 vaccine was found in adults who had previously received seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> More studies on the effect of yearly seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> on the immune response are warranted...|$|R

40|$|Systems biology {{has been}} {{recently}} applied to vaccinology {{to better understand}} immunological responses to the influenza vaccine.

40|$|The {{immunogenicity}} {{of current}} <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines is assessed by measuring {{an increase of}} influenza virus-specific antibodies in a hemagglutination inhibition assay. This method exclusively measures antibodies against the hemagglutinin head domain. While this domain is immunodominant, {{it has been shown}} that hemagglutination inhibition titers do not always accurately predict protection from disease. In addition, several novel <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines that are currently under development do not target the hemagglutinin head domain, but rather more conserved sites, including the hemagglutinin stalk. Importantly, antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk do not show activity in hemagglutination inhibition assays and will require different methods for quantification. In this study, we tested human serum samples from a seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> trial and an avian H 5 N 1 <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> trial for antibody activities in multiple types of assays, including binding assays and also functional assays. We then performed serum transfer experiments in mice which then received an H 1 N 1 virus challenge to assess the in vivo protective effects of the antibodies. We found that hemagglutinin-specific antibody levels measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) correlated well with protection from weight loss in mice. In addition, we found that weight loss was also inversely correlated with the level of serum antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) as measured in a reporter assay. These findings indicate that protection is in part conferred by Fc-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, ELISAs can be used to measure hemagglutinin-specific antibody levels that could serve as a surrogate marker of protection for universal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccines...|$|R
40|$|SummaryProtective {{vaccines}} elicit high-affinity, neutralizing antibodies by {{selection of}} somatically hypermutated B cell antigen receptors (BCR) on immune complexes (ICs). This implicates Fc-Fc receptor (FcR) interactions in affinity maturation, which, in turn, {{are determined by}} IgG subclass and Fc glycan composition within ICs. Trivalent <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> elicited regulation of anti-hemagglutinin (HA) IgG subclass and Fc glycans, with abundance of sialylated Fc glycans (sFc) predicting quality of vaccine response. We show that sFcs drive BCR affinity selection by binding the Type-II FcR CD 23, thus upregulating the inhibitory FcγRIIB on activated B cells. This elevates the threshold requirement for BCR signaling, resulting in B cell selection for higher affinity BCR. Immunization with sFc HA ICs elicited protective, high-affinity IgGs against the conserved stalk of the HA. These results reveal a novel, endogenous pathway for affinity maturation that can be exploited for eliciting high-affinity, broadly neutralizing antibodies through immunization with sialylated immune complexes...|$|R

Thus, there has been considerable emphasis on understanding broadly protective immunological mechanisms for <b>influenza</b> <b>virus.</b> Recent studies have implicated memory CD 4 T cells in heterotypic immunity in animal models and in human challenge studies. Here we examined how <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> boosted CD 4 T cell responses in younger versus aged humans. Our results demonstrate that while the magnitude of the vaccine-induced CD 4 T cell response and number of subjects responding on day 7 did not differ between younger and aged subjects, fewer aged subjects had peak responses on day 14. While CD 4 T cell responses were inefficiently boosted against NA, both HA and especially nucleocaspid protein- and matrix-(NP+M) specific responses were robustly boosted. Pre-existing CD 4 T cell responses were associated with more robust responses to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> NP+M, but not H 1 or H 3.

Sixty-eight healthy children and 62 children with recurrent wheezing took part in this study. Seroconversion rates, seroprotection rates, geometric mean titers (GMTs), and geometric mean titer ratios (GMTRs) were measured by a hemagglutination inhibition assay for the assessment of immunogenicity.

Patients and methods: Breast cancer patients received influenza vaccination during FEC (5 -fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) -containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were randomised for early (day 4) or late (day 16) vaccination during the chemotherapy cycle. Influenza virus-specific antibody titres were determined before and 3 weeks after vaccination by haemagglutination inhibition. Results: We included 38 breast cancer patients (20 in the early and 18 in the late group) and 21 healthy controls. The overall patient group had significant lower responses to the vaccine compared with healthy controls. Patients vaccinated at day 4 tended to have higher antibody titres as compared with patients vaccinated at day 16, although the difference in post-vaccination titres is not statistically significant. Geometric mean titres post-vaccination for day 4 versus day 16 were 63. 7 versus 29. 5 (H 3 N 2), 28. 2 versus 19. 6 (H 1 N 1) and 29. 8 versus 16. 0 (B/Brisbane), respectively.

40|$|Vaccine strategies, such as <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> of the elderly, {{are highly}} {{effective}} at preventing disease but provide protection {{for only the}} responding portion of the vaccinees. Adjuvants improve the magnitude and rates of responses, but their potency must be attenuated to minimize side effects. Topical delivery of strong adjuvants such as heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (LT) induces potent immune responses. We hypothesized that LT delivered alone in an immunostimulating (LT-IS) patch placed on the skin {{at the site of}} injection could augment the immune response to injected vaccines. This was based on the observation that topically applied LT induces migration of activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the skin to the proximal draining lymph node (DLN), and that APCs loaded with antigen by injection in the same anatomical region also migrate to the same DLN. We observed that when <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine is injected and an LT-IS patch is placed to target the same DLN, the <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> antibody response is enhanced. Similarly, influenza virus-specific T cells isolated from the lungs show increased levels of gamma interferon and interleukin- 4 production. An LT-IS patch placed near an injected vaccine also leads to increased levels of hemagglutination inhibition titers, enhanced mucosal immunoglobulin A responses, and enhanced antigen presentation.

An irreducible minimum exists since mice vaccinated with less than ten intranasal lethal doses do not develop sufficient immunity to overcome intranasal infection with virus of the same strength.

Plasma samples were tested using endpoint enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) and hemagglutination (HA) inhibition (HAI) assays to subtypes H 3, H 4, H 5, H 6, H 7, H 8, and H 12 pro-teins. Detectable antibodies were found against influenza HA antigens in 77 % of individuals, while 65 % of individuals tested had measurable T cell responses (gamma interferon [IFN-] enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay [ELISPOT]) to multiple HA antigens of avian origin. To begin defining the observed antibody specificities, Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that ELISA responses, which measure both head- and stalk-binding antibodies, do not predict HAI reactivities, which measure pri-marily head-binding antibodies. This result suggests that ELISA titers can report cross-reactivity based on the levels of non-head-binding responses. However, the strongest positive correlate of HA-specific ELISA antibody titers was receipt of seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Occupational exposure was largely uncorrelated with serological measures, {{with the exception of}} individuals exposed to poultry, who had higher levels of H 7 -specific antibodies than non-poultry-exposed individuals.

40|$|Our {{objective}} was to evaluate the efficacy of influenza andmeningococcal vaccinations in healthy subjects exposed to the anti-interleukin- 17 A (IL- 17 A) monoclonal antibody (MAb) secukinumab. We used an open-label, parallel-group, randomized single-center study of 50 healthy subjects. Subjects received a single 150 -mg dose of secukinumab or no treatment, followed by vaccina-tion with inactivated trivalent subunit <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> and conjugate group Cmeningococcal vaccine (Agrippal andMenjugate, respectively) 2 weeks later. Primary efficacy variables were responses of> 4 -fold increases in antibody titer (hemagglutination inhibition [HI; for influenza virus] and serum bactericidal assay [SBA; forNeisseria meningitides]) for meningococcus and influ-enza (at least {{two out of three}} serotypes), both at 4 weeks postvaccination. All subjects randomized to secukinumab (n 25) or the control (n 25) completed the study. Antibody responses to vaccinations measured at 4 weeks were comparable in both groups, with> 4 -fold increased responses following <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> of 20 / 25 (80 %) for both groups and following meningococcal vaccination of 19 / 25 (76 %) for the secukinumab group and 18 / 25 (72 %) for the control group. Differences be-tween groups were 0 % (90 % confidence intervals [CI], 19 and 19 %) and 4 % (90 %CI, 16 and 24 %) for <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> andmenin-gococcal vaccines, respectively. Antibody responses were comparable between the 2 groups at different time points. Headache was the most frequently reported adverse effect. No deaths or serious adverse events were reported. Blockade of IL- 17 A by secukinumab does not appear to interfere with efficacy of influenza andmeningococcal vaccinations, as assessed by the achieve-ment of protective antibody levels.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) {{is a primary}} immunodeficiency characterized by the deficiency of humoral immunity. Hence, cellular immune response becomes more important for these patients. However, {{little is known about}} the non-humoral immune responses to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> in XLA patients. Here, we examined the APC function and T-cell immune responses to <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses</b> in XLA patients. Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (imMDDCs) from XLA patients had normal maturation upon inactivated <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> stimulation in terms of surface molecule expressions and cytokine productions. The T-cell stimulatory capacity of influenza virus-treated imMDDCs determined by mixed lymphocyte reactions from XLA patients was also similar as that from normal controls. There were no obvious side effects in XLA patients after administration of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). TIV significantly induced influenza virus-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell responses in XLA patients. The frequencies of influenza virus-specific memory/effector CD 4 and CD 8 T cells in XLA patients are comparable to that in normal controls during 6 months of observation after vaccination.

Guidelines published in 2004 advocate vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae and <b>influenza</b> <b>virus.</b> We sought to examine trends in hospitalizations for vaccine preventable pneumonias among IBD patients since the availability of published guidelines, and to identify whether Haemophilus influenzae is a causative organism for pneumonia hospitalizations among IBD patients. Methods: This cross-sectional study on the Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify admissions for pneumonias in patients with IBD between 2004 and 2009. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed comparing IBD patients to controls, accounting for potential confounders. Results: There were more admissions for S. pneumoniae pneumonia than <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> or H. <b>influenzae</b> (787, 393, and 183 respectively). Crohn’s disease (CD) as well as ulcerative colitis (UC) patients did not demonstrate increased adjusted odds of hospitalization for S. pneumoniae pneumonia (1. 08; confidence interval [CI] 0. 99 – 1. 17 compared to 0. 93; CI 0. 82 – 1. 06 respectively). Increased adjusted odds for hospitalization for pneumonias due to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> were seen among UC patients in the bottom quartile of income (1. 86; CI 1. 46 – 2. 37). Adjusted odds for H. influenzae pneumonia admission in patients with UC and CD patients were increased compared to controls (1. 42; CI 1. 13 – 1. 79 and 1. 28; CI 1. 06 – 1. 54, respectively). Conclusion: The study identified lowest income UC patients as having higher adjusted odds, and these patients should be targeted for <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Additionally, H. <b>influenzae</b> may be another vaccine preventable cause for pneumonia among IBD patients.

40|$|The Abs made by B {{lymphocytes}} {{on first}} encountering an antigen bind it with low intrinsic affinity, and, over time, the average affinity of the Abs made against that antigen gradually increases. These changes, known as affinity maturation, were found initially for serum antibodies that recognized small, chemically well-defined epitopes (e. g., 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl). That similar affinity increases occur in responses to protein antigens, which elicit most immune responses to infections or vaccination, has been generally assumed but {{difficult to prove}} (1) {{largely because of the}} complexity and multiplicity of epitopes (antigenic determinants) on even small, single-chain proteins (2). Though some protein epitopes are linear stretches of amino acids, they usually are configurational clusters of noncontiguous residues best delineated crystallographically in antibody–antigen complexes (3); and more often than not, the diverse antibodies elicited to a protein antigen bind to different epitopes on that protein (4), confounding efforts to convincingly demonstrate affinity maturation. There are at least five epitopes on the <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> hemagglutinin (HA) that binds the virions to host cells (5). By comparing the binding properties and structures of affinity matured Abs to one of the HA epitopes with those of their progenitor Abs, the elegant study by Schmidt et al. reported in PNAS (6) provides clear evidence for affinity maturation of Abs. The study is notable, moreover, for its focus on the human immune response to <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> with a conventional influenza seasonal vaccine (FLUZON flu shot). By bringing together diverse approaches (crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and kinetic studies), the authors shed intriguing light on how the affinity enhancement of affinity matured antibodies is achieved...|$|R

40|$|Non-replicating vaccines, such {{as those}} based on {{recombinant}} proteins, require adjuvants and delivery systems, which have thus far depended on mimicking pathogen danger signals and strong pro-inflammatory responses. In search of a safer and more efficacious alternative, we tested whether vaccinations with influenza recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) mixed with a novel vegetable oil in water emulsion adjuvant (Natural Immune-enhancing Delivery System, NIDS), based on the immune-enhancing synergy of vitamins A and E and a catechin, could protect against intra-nasal challenge with live <b>influenza</b> <b>virus.</b> <b>Vaccinations</b> of inbred Brag Albino strain c (BALB/c) mice, with HA mixed with NIDS compared to other adjuvants, i. e., a squalene oil in water emulsion (Sq. oil), and the Toll Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3) agonist Poly (I:C), induced significantly lower select innate pro-inflammatory responses in serum, but induced significantly higher adaptive antibody and splenic T Helper 1 (TH 1) or TH 2, but not TH 17, responses. Vaccinations with NIDS protected against infection, as measured by clinical scores, lung viral loads, and serum hemagglutination inhibition titers. The NIDS exhibited a strong dose sparing effect and the adjuvant action of NIDS was intact in the outbred CD 1 mice. Importantly, vaccinations with the Sq. oil, but not NIDS, induced a significantly higher Serum Amyloid P component, an acute phase reactant secreted by hepatocytes, and total serum IgE. Thus, the NIDS {{may be used as}} a clinically safer and more efficacious vaccine adjuvant against influenza, and potentially other infectious diseases...|$|R

We studied {{cross-reactive}} antibodies against {{avian influenza}} H 5 N 1 and 2009 pandemic (p) H 1 N 1 in 200 serum samples from US military personnel collected before the H 1 N 1 pandemic. Assays {{used to measure}} antibodies against viral proteins involved in protection included a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and a neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay. Viral neutralization by antibodies against avian influenza H 5 N 1 and 2009 pH 1 N 1 was assessed by influenza (H 5) pseudo-typed lentiviral particle-based and H 1 N 1 microneutralization assays. Some US military personnel had cross-neutralizing antibodies against H 5 N 1 (14 %) and 2009 pH 1 N 1 (16. 5 %). The odds of having cross-neutralizing antibodies against 2009 pH 1 N 1 were 4. 4 times higher in subjects receiving more than five inactivated whole <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccinations</b> than those subjects with no record of vaccination. Although unclear if the result of prior vaccination or disease exposure, these pre-existing antibodies may prevent or reduce disease severity.

40|$|Influenza H 3 N 2 A viruses {{continue}} to circulate in swine and occasionally infect humans, resulting in outbreaks of variant influ-enza H 3 N 2 [A(H 3 N 2) v] virus. It {{has been previously}} demonstrated in ferrets that A(H 3 N 2) v viruses transmit as efficiently as seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>viruses,</b> raising concern over the pandemic potential of these viruses. However, A(H 3 N 2) v viruses have not acquired the ability to transmit efficiently among humans, which may be {{due in part to}} existing cross-reactive immunity to A(H 3 N 2) v viruses. Although current seasonal H 3 N 2 and A(H 3 N 2) v viruses are antigenically distinct from one another, histori-cal H 3 N 2 viruses have some antigenic similarity to A(H 3 N 2) v viruses and previous exposure to these viruses may provide a mea-sure of immune protection sufficient to dampen A(H 3 N 2) v virus transmission. Here, we evaluated whether prior seasonal H 3 N 2 <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> <b>vaccination</b> or infection affects virus replication and transmission of A(H 3 N 2) v virus in the ferret animal model. We found that the seasonal trivalent inactivated <b>influenza</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine (TIV) or a monovalent vaccine prepared from an anti-genically related 1992 seasonal influenza H 3 N 2 (A/Beijing/ 32 / 1992) virus failed to substantially reduce A(H 3 N 2) v (A/Indiana/ 08 / 2011) virus shedding and subsequent transmission to naive hosts. Conversely, ferrets primed by seasonal H 3 N 2 virus infec-tion displayed reduced A(H 3 N 2) v virus shedding following challenge, which blunted transmission to naive ferrets. A higher level of specific IgG and IgA antibody titers detected among infected versus vaccinated ferrets was associated with the degree of pro-tection offered by seasonal H 3 N 2 virus infection. The data demonstrate in ferrets that the efficiency of A(H 3 N 2) v transmission is disrupted by preexisting immunity induced by seasonal H 3 N 2 virus infection...|$|R
