40|$|Abstract: The {{conventional}} <b>marking</b> {{and identification}} <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> {{can be done}} in several different ways. With the application of modern informatics and electronics solutions, it is possible to substitute conventional ways with the different types <b>of</b> the electronic <b>marking</b> and identification. All types of electronic identification for transferring data are using the technology of the radio frequency (RFDI). With application <b>of</b> electronic <b>marking,</b> it is possible to achieve a great number of advantages of which the most important are the high precision of reading the data, individual supervision for every <b>animal,</b> automatic input <b>of</b> data, processing and keeping the information as a permanent actualization of data base. It is necessary to remove all existing defects and in future to work on the improvement of existing types <b>of</b> the electronic <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{population}} {{abundance of}} large mammals generally requires substantial time and effort, and low-investment alternatives are needed. We present a novel {{application of a}} capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method, using vocalization frequency to estimate the size of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populations. The technique involves walking along fixed transects to disturb all animals present on a study plot, potentially provoking a vocal response. Those animals heard to vocalize (whether observed or not) are then considered {{the total number of}} 'marked' individuals in the population. The proportion of 'marked' individuals in the population is estimated from the proportion <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> that vocalize in the subsample of individuals observed (the vocalization frequency). Population size is estimated by dividing the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> individuals by the vocalization frequency, correcting for bias, which is directly analogous to the Lincoln-Petersen (L-P) estimate for CMR. We used this method to estimate population size for roe deer inhabiting a 150 -ha forest plot for 8 separate surveys, and we used the L-P estimator to compare our estimates to mark-resight estimates. We estimated deer density as 23. 45 ± 7. 80 deer/ 100 ha by CMR and 19. 87 ± 7. 92 deer/ 100 ha by the vocalization frequency (VF) method (x¯ ± SE). If the assumptions are met, this method provides estimates of absolute population size at low cost and with little material investment, because physical capture and <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> is not necessary. Further research is required to validate the assumption that visually observed animals have the same probability of vocalizing as those disturbed but not seen...|$|R

" Earthwatch-funded projects involve volunteers who assist scientists {{to carry out research}} projects of high conservation value. Our project focuses on the spotted skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, an abundant, medium-sized viviparous species which inhabits relatively undisturbed habitats in the World Heritage Wilderness in Central Tasmania, but is also distributed along the east coast where populations are highly impacted by human activity. Due to their specific reproductive adaptations, these animals are potentially threatened by climate change: alpine populations of spotted skinks could face reproductive failure if the weather at the end of summer is unseasonably poor. The project aims to evaluate whether potential climate change or local habitat alteration, including possible effects of persistent agricultural chemicals, may affect the lizards' ability to cope with short term stressors, and/or their patterns of reproduction and development. In our first field season (Summer 2004), we focused on measuring plasma corticosterone concentrations and obtaining preliminary data on diurnal activity patterns in lizards from disturbed and undisturbed sites at the Central Plateau and East Coast. The Earthwatch volunteers assist in numerous ways such as helping with capture and <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals,</b> observing behaviours in the field, or assisting with vegetation surveys.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> small <b>animals</b> for {{long-term}} ecological studies requires unambiguous and permanent techniques that cause minimal harm. Toe-clipping is frequently {{used to identify}} small lizards in the field, {{but it has been}} suggested that passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) should be preferred. Here, we evaluate the costs and benefits of new miniature PIT tags to mark the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara). Our protocol enables permanent <b>marking</b> <b>of</b> lizards as small as 1. 3 grams with maximal implantation success in the abdominal cavity. Tag injection caused no observable increase in plasma corticosterone levels over five days and no negative effects on long-term growth and survival. However, tag injection had negative effects on locomotor activity during at least 7 days, possibly implying pain. Continuous research to improve tag implantation is needed because negative effects may be caused by anaesthesia and injection rather the tag retention itself. This study demonstrates the utility of combining physiological, behavioural and life history measurements to assess marking stress and pain in animals...|$|R

40|$|Summary. We {{present a}} {{hierarchical}} {{extension of the}} Cormack–Jolly–Seber (CJS) model for open population capture–recapture data. In addition to recaptures <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>animals,</b> we model first captures <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> and losses on capture. The parameter set includes capture probabilities, survival rates, and birth rates. The survival rates and birth rates are treated as a random sample from a bivariate distribution, thus the model explicitly incorporates correlation in these demographic rates. A key feature of the model is that the likelihood function, which includes a CJS model factor, is expressed entirely in terms of identifiable parameters; losses on capture can be factored out of the model. Since the computational complexity of classical likelihood methods is prohibitive, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo in a Bayesian analysis. We describe an efficient candidate-generation scheme for Metropolis–Hastings sampling of CJS models and extensions. The procedure is illustrated using mark-recapture data for the moth Gonodontis bidentata...|$|R

40|$|Estimating wild life {{population}} size, such as for {{the black}} bear; estimating the prevalence of unreported cases of a disease, such as childhood diabetes and heart attacks; estimating the number of iPhones sold by Apple. How it works: Suppose you want to estimate {{the size of a}} population but you can’t directly count its members. This problem is common for wild life biologists who need to estimate the population of an endangered species. Statistics provide a surprisingly simple yet effective strategy. First capture a sample <b>of</b> the <b>animals,</b> <b>mark</b> them, and then release them back into the wild. Let those animals mix back in {{with the rest of the}} population and then capture a second sample <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> The fraction <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> <b>marked</b> in the second sample gives us a good idea of how big the total population is. If a large fraction of the second sample are marked then the total population is small since you must have captured a big fraction of the total population in the first sample. On the other hand, if the fraction <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>animals</b> in the second sample is small then the total population is large because you must have captured only a small fraction of the total population in the first sample. The method relies on the assumption that the ratio <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> to unmarked <b>animals</b> in the second sample is very close to the ratio of the number <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in the first sample to the total population <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Interesting fact: Serial numbers on objects in a sample from a large batch of objects can be used in a similar way to estimate the tota...|$|R
40|$|In {{this pilot}} study, we {{estimate}} roe deer Capreolus capreolus density in a fragmented landscape, using radio-tracking and direct observation in a Petersen- Lincoln framework with the joint hypergeometric maximum likelihood estimator. We used radio-tracking {{to obtain a}} direct count of the number <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>animals</b> potentially observable in a given sample area, thus avoiding edge effects. We then carried out a coordinated observation survey, including drive beating, to ascertain the proportion <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> roe deer in the population sampled and thus generate a population estimate. Surveys were repeated three times in four sample blocks within the fragmented landscape, and estimates were compared to a sample block of a central forest in the same area. In general, roe deer are difficult to observe and census, but our experimental set-up in the fragmented landscape enabled us to observe on average 75 % <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> <b>animals</b> present in a given survey (compared to 21. 5 % in the central forest). The variability in capture probability between individuals was low as three quarters <b>of</b> all <b>marked</b> individuals were observed in all, or all but one, of the surveys. Density estimates were largely similar across the sample blocks of the fragmented landscape (4. 0 - 7. 9 deer/ 100 ha), but lower than in the central forest (34. 3 deer/ 100 ha). The variability of daily population estimates was quite low and similar in the fragmented landscape (CV of 25. 9 %) and the central forest (CV of 25. 3 %).
