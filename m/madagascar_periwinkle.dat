5|$|The {{place of}} plants in {{medicine}} was radically altered in the 19th century by {{the application of}} chemical analysis. Alkaloids were isolated from a succession of medicinal plants, starting with morphine from the poppy in 1806, and soon followed by ipecacuanha and strychnos in 1817, quinine from the cinchona tree, and then many others. As chemistry progressed, additional classes of pharmacologically active substances were discovered in medicinal plants. Commercial extraction of purified alkaloids including morphine from medicinal plants began at Merck in 1826. Synthesis of a substance first discovered in a medicinal plant began with salicylic acid in 1853. Around {{the end of the}} 19th century, the mood of pharmacy turned against medicinal plants, as enzymes often modified the active ingredients when whole plants were dried, and alkaloids and glycosides purified from plant material started to be preferred. Drug discovery from plants continued to be important through the 20th century and into the 21st, with important anti-cancer drugs from yew and <b>Madagascar</b> <b>periwinkle.</b>|$|E
40|$|Vinblastine and {{vincristine}} are secondary metabolites from <b>Madagascar</b> <b>periwinkles</b> {{that have}} a very high economic value as chemotherapy drugs. These compounds are naturally produced in a very low quantity in planta. One promising alternative method for vinblastine and vincristine production is to use a treatment that can trigger plant stress response in vitro. This study has been done to evaluate the effect of drought stress using polyethylene glycol (PEG) on vinblastine and vincristine production in the C. roseus callus culture, which were grown on medium Zenk supplemented with plant growth regulators (PGR) 1 μM NAA + 10 μM Kinetin to induce laticifer and idioblast differentiation. 13 -week-old callus cultures were then treated with 0 %, 6 %, 9 %, and 12 % (w/v) PEG 4000 each for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Biochemical analysis was performed using HPLC to determine the levels of vinblastine and vincristine, while the presence of differentiated cells (idioblasts and laticifers) was determined using a histochemical method. Protein profiles of the culture were determined by SDS-Page. The results showed that drought treatment with PEG 4000, until the concentration was 12 % (w/v), did not significantly affect the production of vinblastine and vincristine, but might affect terpenoid production. Histochemical analysis confirmed the presence of idioblasts, non-elongated laticifers, and laticifers that were producing and accumulating terpenoids highest in the 12 % PEG treatment. PEG treatments also did not change the protein profile of callus...|$|R
40|$|Extract] In a world being rapidly {{transformed}} by human activities, an alarming {{possibility is that}} many species might disappear before {{we have a chance}} to study or even scientifically describe them. This possibility goes beyond a simple desire to document biodiversity, because unknown species could have important benefits for humanity. For instance, who might have imagined that an obscure herb endemic to <b>Madagascar,</b> the rosy <b>periwinkle</b> (Catharanthus roseus), would yield the only known treatment for childhood leukemia? How prevalent are undescribed species, and where do they occur? Are they largely concentrated in areas that we already consider conservation priorities, or are they often found elsewhere—meaning that we may need to identify additional priority areas? These questions motivated the study by Joppa et al. in PNAS. With considerable pluck in the face of data limitations and important uncertainties, they attempt to estimate the number of undescribed flowering plant species across much of the terrestrial world...|$|R

The devil s claw, Harpagophytum procumbens, now widely used to treat rheumatism and arthritis, represented south-west Africa. West Africa sent the baobab tree used for skin care as its ambassador, and the island continent of <b>Madagascar</b> sent its <b>periwinkle</b> catharanthus roseus, a source of alkaloids used in treatments against leukaemia and Hodgkins disease.

50|$|Vinblastine may be {{isolated}} from the <b>Madagascar</b> <b>Periwinkle</b> (Catharanthus roseus), along with several of its precursors, catharanthine and vindoline. Extraction is costly and yields of vinblastine and its precursors are low, although procedures for rapid isolation with improved yields avoiding auto-oxidation have been developed. Enantioselective synthesis has been of considerable interest in recent years, as the natural mixture of isomers is not an economical source for the required C16’S, C14’R stereochemistry of biologically active vinblastine. Initially, the approach depends upon an enantioselective Sharpless epoxidation, which sets the stereochemistry at C20. The desired configuration around C16 and C14 can then be fixed during the ensuing steps. In this pathway, vinblastine is constructed {{by a series of}} cyclization and coupling reactions which create the required stereochemistry. The overall yield may be as great as 22%, which makes this synthetic approach more attractive than extraction from natural sources, whose overall yield is about 10%. Stereochemistry is controlled through a mixture of chiral agents (Sharpless catalysts), and reaction conditions (temperature, and selected enantiopure starting materials).|$|E
