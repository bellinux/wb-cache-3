40|$|Abstract. The {{improvement}} and optimization of air-distribution systems in <b>drying</b> <b>kilns</b> {{contributes to the}} preservation of the quality, safety and shelf life of perishable products. The present study reports on the numerical solution of airflow within a two dimensional <b>drying</b> <b>kiln</b> enclosure loaded with wooden pallets. The performance of air flow field is examined with and without supply of wooden pallets. Different arrangements of the supplied wooden pallets are investigated as well as the use of a screen in order to improve the airflow filed. The steady state RANS equations that formulate the flow problem are solved along with a turbulence model that is the standard k-εor the rng k-ε. The effect of the turbulence modeling is distinguished through direct comparisons of the derived airflow patterns. The results obtained show the presence of stagnant zones inside the pallets columns and above of them and the presence of recirculation regions in different zones of the <b>drying</b> <b>kiln</b> with the two turbulence models. ...|$|R

To dry the Sugi round timbers for preservative injection, three drying methods including microwave <b>drying,</b> <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> and air drying were compared in this study. Using microwave drying, the timbers were dried within one day, but the other two drying methods required a much longer time. During most of the microwave drying process, the wood temperature appeared to be higher in the inner layer than in the outer layer. As a result, the inner layer moisture contents were significantly reduced by microwave <b>drying,</b> while <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> produced almost no decline in the inner layer moisture contents. In addition, although significant surface checks often occurred in timbers <b>dried</b> by <b>kiln</b> <b>drying</b> and air drying, microwave drying caused few surface checks. In contrast, internal checks were only observed in timbers treated by microwave drying. These results suggested that the microwave drying technique can improve the effectiveness of preservative injection in Sugi round timbers...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium and Zinc (Al-Zn) alloy {{coated steel}} sheet (JIS G 3141) {{was used as}} a heat {{reflector}} in timber <b>dry</b> <b>kiln.</b> After six months continuous service at 110 oC in moist condition, the heat reflector is corroded. Failure analysis method was used to analyze this corrosion phenomena. Macroscopic and microscopic examination with some characterization have been performed to determine the elemental composition and corrosion products. The elemental composition of corroded heat reflector that were detected by SEM-EDS are sulphur, chloride, calcium, and potassium. XRD analysis revealed the zinc aluminium carbonate hydroxide hydrate (Zn 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 CO 3. 4 H 2 O) known as black rust staining and iron oxide (Fe 3 O 4), as corrosion products. Environmental condition in timber <b>dry</b> <b>kiln</b> with the existence of acid and alkaline elements cause the corrosion process occur. Those elements come from the dried timber and steam that adhered on the heat reflector surface attacked the Al-Zn coating and base metal.

40|$|During wood drying, the {{formation}} of limescale deposits on conventional <b>drying</b> <b>kiln</b> components frequently causes difficulties, especially on nozzles for dispersion of water mist, {{as a result of}} the use of “hard water” and technologically unprepared water. Frequently inadequate cleaners for the removal of limescale are used, which have harmful effects on the equipment and people. In order to reduce costs incurred due to the use of inadequate cleaners for the removal of limescale and to eliminate potentially harmful effects on the health of employees, the use of citric acid has been researched in procedures of removal of limescale from the moisturizer nozzles of the conventional <b>drying</b> <b>kilns.</b> Used and unused metal moisturizer nozzles of the conventional <b>drying</b> <b>kilns</b> have been treated with different concentrations of water solution of citric acid at ambient temperature and in boiled state for 5 and 10 minutes. It has been determined that the water solution of citric acid at ambient temperature does not give positive results, while the treatment of nozzles in the boiled water solution of citric acid gives very good results already at minimum concentration of citric acid, both for the cleaning of limescale and for the cleaning of corrosion, resulting in fully renewed functionality of nozzles. No adverse effects of citric acid on the body of metal nozzles have been recorded...|$|R
