5|$|During World War I, 97 F {{was used}} for convoy, patrol, escort and <b>minesweeping</b> tasks, and anti-submarine operations. In 1917, one of her 66mm guns was placed on an {{anti-aircraft}} mount.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} briefly {{retained}} by the Reichsmarine after the war, and was reactivated for service on 1 August 1919. According to Articles 182 and 193 of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany {{was obliged to}} keep sufficient vessels in commission to sweep mines from large areas in the North and Baltic Seas. Schwaben was therefore converted into a depot ship for F-type minesweepers to assist in meeting Germany's treaty obligations, which entailed removal of her remaining weaponry and construction of platforms to hold the minesweepers. She {{was assigned to the}} 6th Baltic <b>Minesweeping</b> Half-Flotilla, though this service did not last long, as the <b>minesweeping</b> work was completed by 19 June 1920. The old battleship was stricken from the naval register on 8 March 1921. She was sold for 3,090,000marks and broken up for scrap that year in Kiel-Nordmole.|$|E
5|$|HMS Algerine was {{the lead}} ship of her namesake class of minesweepers built for the Royal Navy during World War II, the Algerine-class minesweepers. Initially {{assigned}} to the North Sea, she was transferred to lead the 12th <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla. The Flotilla were posted to the Mediterranean to assist with Operation Torch. In 1942, after a successful mine clearing operation off Bougie, she was torpedoed by the , causing Algerine to sink, leaving only eight survivors.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. The ship was patched up to keep her afloat, and she helped to defend Gotenhafen from the advancing Red Army in March 1945. She then carried a group of fleeing German civilians, reaching Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for <b>minesweeping</b> forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, Agamemnon {{supported}} the main landings {{as part of}} the 5th Squadron, and after that she patrolled to protect Allied <b>minesweeping</b> and netlaying vessels operating in the Dardanelles. In action against Ottoman field batteries, she took two hits between 28 April and 30 April, and she provided fire support for Allied troops during a Turkish counterattack on 1 May. Agamemnon bombarded Ottoman artillery batteries on 6 May prior to the Second Battle of Krithia.|$|E
5|$|Pelorus {{was named}} after Pelorus Jack, a Risso's dolphin that often escorted ships through French Pass in New Zealand. The ship was ordered on 1 January 1942 from Lobnitz of Renfrew, Scotland and laid down on 8 October. She was {{launched}} on 18 June 1943 and completed two months later on 7 October. The ship {{was assigned to the}} newly formed 7th <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla upon completion and served as the flotilla leader. The flotilla was tasked with clearing mines off the east coast of England until June 1944 when they were assigned to sweep the minefields protecting Juno Beach during the Normandy landings. Pelorus led the flotilla on 6 June and was thus the leading ship of the entire invasion fleet. While sweeping the approaches to Cherbourg, she struck a mine that damaged the port engine and propeller. The ship was under repair for three months and was transferred to the 6th <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla at Plymouth when they were completed.|$|E
5|$|The E {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1931 Naval Construction Programme, the F class {{following}} in 1932. These ships were based on the preceding D class with minor changes to the hull and armament. Two of the ships were modified to accommodate 60 mines. The F class were repeats of the E's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) <b>minesweeping</b> gear.|$|E
5|$|The G {{class were}} ordered {{as part of}} the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class {{following}} in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G's with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) <b>minesweeping</b> gear.|$|E
5|$|In a heavy fog in October 1944, Leipzig {{collided}} with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; the damage was so severe that the navy decided complete repairs were unfeasible. Instead, they repaired Leipzig enough to keep her afloat, and in that state, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Gotenhafen against the advancing Red Army in March 1945. As the Germans continued to retreat in the east, Leipzig was then used to transport a group of fleeing German civilians. She reached Denmark by late April. After {{the end of the}} war, Leipzig was used as a barracks ship for <b>minesweeping</b> forces and was scuttled in July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Nautilus {{spent her}} peacetime career {{conducting}} training exercises {{with the main}} fleet and <b>minesweeping</b> experiments before being placed in reserve in 1911. Reactivated {{at the start of}} World War I, she initially laid both defensive and offensive mine fields in the North and Baltic Seas. She was permanently transferred to the Baltic in 1916, and the following year she supported Operation Albion, the conquest of the Gulf of Riga. After Germany's defeat, Nautilus was demilitarized and used as a hulk from 1921 to 1928 before being sold for scrap and broken up in Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1939, {{with the}} Second World War imminent, Commodator was requisitioned by the Admiralty once more, and {{converted}} to a <b>minesweeping</b> trawler, becoming HMT Commodator (FY634). The hire rate was £84.6.0d per month– approximately £2,500. In 1943, she was sold to Mrs E D Breen of Edinburgh, though she remained in use by the Admiralty. In June 1945, {{after the end of}} the war in Europe, she was sold to Grimsby Merchants Amalgamated Fishing Co Ltd and gained pennant number GY57 but remained under military command. On 4 October 1945, she was re-classed at Glasgow and returned to her owner.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of 1917 the Admiralty became more {{concerned}} about German efforts in the North Sea to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict {{the actions of the}} High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German <b>minesweeping</b> forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their escorting light cruisers. Based on intelligence reports the Admiralty decided on 17 November 1917 to allocate two light cruiser squadrons, the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st BCS (less Renown) and, more distantly, the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron to the operation.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} based on the {{preceding}} B class, but were enlarged to increase their endurance and to allow for the inclusion of a QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun. This class introduced a director control tower for British destroyers. The 'C' class were unique in having a split bridge, with the compass platform and wheelhouse separated from the chartroom and director tower. This unusual layout was not repeated. As per Admiralty policy in alternating Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) <b>minesweeping</b> gear and ASDIC (sonar) capability between destroyer flotillas, the C class lacked ASDIC and were designed to carry only six depth charges. The D class were repeats of the C's, except that the TSDS was replaced by storage for up to 30 depth charges and ASDIC.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was {{becoming}} more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British-laid minefields intended to restrict {{the actions of the}} High Seas Fleet and German submarines. A preliminary raid on German <b>minesweeping</b> forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed 10 small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts. Based on intelligence reports, the Admiralty allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917, with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E

5|$|With an around-the-clock {{effort by}} the {{shipyard}} workers, Maryland was repaired in 34 days, departing on 13 August. She then embarked for the Solomon Islands with a large task force, anchoring in Purvis Bay off Florida Island for two weeks before steaming for the Palau Islands on 6 September. She then joined Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Western Fire Support Group (Task Group 32.5; TG 32.5). Firing first on 12 September to cover <b>minesweeping</b> operations and underwater demolition teams {{at the opening of}} the Battle of Peleliu, Maryland again conducted shore bombardment supporting the landing craft as they approached the beaches on 15 September. Four days later, organized resistance collapsed, permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty Islands at the end of the month.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, 76T {{was part of the}} 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla. During the war, 76T was used for convoy, escort and <b>minesweeping</b> tasks, anti-submarine operations, and shore bombardment missions. She also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian coast. On 24 May 1915, 76T and seven other 250t-class boats were involved in the shelling of various Italian shore-based targets known as the Bombardment of Ancona, with 76T involved in the operation against Ancona itself. In late November 1915, the Austro-Hungarian fleet deployed a force from its main fleet base at Pola to Cattaro in the southern Adriatic; this force included six of the eight T-group torpedo boats, so it is possible that one of these was 76T. This force was tasked to maintain a permanent patrol of the Albanian coastline and interdict any troop transports crossing from Italy.|$|E

5|$|Caradoc {{was back}} in action by 17 November when she participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. This was a {{successful}} attempt by the British to intercept German <b>minesweeping</b> forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships {{for most of the}} battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Caradoc, being the rear ship in her squadron, fired the least. She did not score any hits on her opponents, nor did they damage her.|$|E
5|$|Final {{preparations}} for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945. After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps' movement from Australia to Morotai, General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June. The 9th Division's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May. The 24th Brigade Group was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan, and the 20th Brigade Group was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island. Both brigades were to land simultaneously {{on the morning of}} 10 June. The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units, as well as three days of <b>minesweeping</b> operations in the bay itself.|$|E
5|$|From mid-1944, the USNavy {{pressed for}} B-29s {{to be used}} to lay naval mines in Japan's home waters to {{strengthen}} the blockade of the country. Arnold and his staff were unenthusiastic about these proposals, however, as they believed that such missions would divert too many Superfortresses away from precision bombing attacks. In response to repeated requests from the Navy, Arnold decided in November 1944 to begin mine-laying operations once sufficient aircraft were available. In January 1945, LeMay selected the 313th Bombardment Wing to be the Twentieth Air Force's specialist mine-laying unit, and the Navy provided assistance with its training and logistics. LeMay designated the aerial mining campaign Operation Starvation. As the United States had only occasionally used mines up to this time, the Japanese military had placed relatively little emphasis on keeping its <b>minesweeping</b> force up to date. As a result, the IJN was unprepared for the large-scale USAAF offensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 {{the ship}} was sold to the South African Navy, {{together}} with her sister ship, Rosamund, and departed England on 22 November after a refresher course at the <b>minesweeping</b> school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. The sisters arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route. She was rechristened by {{the mayor of the}} city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship Maritzburg, but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate , they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, Pietermaritzburg became the largest South African warship to visit Knysna in September 1953. The ship and her sister were placed in reserve for a time in the late 1950s.|$|E
5|$|She {{supported}} Allied efforts around New Georgia-Rendova Vangunu from 29 June to 25 August. Assigned to Task Unit 36.2.2, she, Preble and Gamble laid mines off Shortland Harbor, Bougainville. She then {{supported the}} occupation and defense of Cape Torokina conducting <b>minesweeping</b> duties there from 1 to 8 November. She later supported the Leyte landings from 12 to 24 October 1944. She was subsequently among the ships {{to support the}} Lingayen Gulf landings from 4 to 18 January 1945. She supported the Battle of Iwo Jima from 7 February to 7 March. She undertook mine duties supporting the Battle of Okinawa between 25 March and 30 June. In her final act of the war, she steamed {{in support of the}} United States Third Fleet near mainland Japan between 5 and 31 July. In August and September 1945 Breese swept mines in the East China Sea and Kyūshū-Korean area following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese military's {{efforts to}} defend Singapore from air attack were unsuccessful. Due to the weak {{state of the}} island's air defences, only nine B-29s were shot down during the American campaign, all of them during {{daylight}} raids. <b>Minesweeping</b> operations were also slow, and it took three weeks to declare the port safe after each Allied minelaying raid. The surviving crew members of the American bombers that were shot down met varying fates; a small number linked up with resistance movements such as the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army, while others were captured by the Japanese and held in harsh conditions. Those who were captured by the IJN and held at the Naval Base were beheaded. After the war, the Japanese personnel believed responsible for atrocities against these prisoners were tried during the Seletar War Crimes Trials and those found guilty were executed or served long prison sentences.|$|E
5|$|The Kaiman {{class were}} high-seas torpedo boats {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1904 and 1910. A total of 24 boats were built by three {{shipbuilding}} companies. Yarrow Shipbuilders built the lead ship, Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino of Trieste built 13 boats, and Ganz & Danubius constructed the remaining 10 boats at their shipyards at Fiume. The class {{was considered to be}} a very successful design, and all boats saw extensive active service during World War I, undertaking a range of tasks, including escort duties, shore bombardments and <b>minesweeping.</b> All survived, although several were damaged by naval mines and collisions. One was torpedoed and badly damaged by a French submarine, and two sank an Italian submarine. All the boats were transferred to the Allies and scrapped {{at the end of the}} war, except for four that were allocated to the navy of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. These were discarded and broken up between 1928 and 1930.|$|E
5|$|At 23:56, {{the convoy}} passed south of Zembra Island towards Kelibia on Cap Bon, {{to avoid the}} minefields between Africa and Sicily, still out of formation. Three <b>minesweeping</b> destroyers sailed ahead, {{followed}} by the cruisers Kenya, Manchester and two freighters. Charybdis and the destroyers Eskimo and Somali from Force Z were still some hours behind and Ashanti was steaming fast to overhaul the main body. Three destroyers remained with nine of the merchantmen and Bramham was en route after Deucalion had been sunk. The {{main part of the}} convoy was attacked at 00:40 by four boats of the German III Squadron and 13 torpedo boats of the Italian 18° MAS, 2° MS and 20° MAS, which made fifteen attacks; the long line of merchant ships and the reduced number of escort ships providing an easy target. The 18° MAS detected the convoy on radar, south-east of Pantellaria and attacked the escorts {{at the head of the}} procession, coming under fire as they fired torpedoes to no effect. The Italian boats then attacked the merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{cessation}} of hostilities, YDG-11 saw little or no active service before being berthed with the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California. She was retained on an inactive, in service, status until the winter of 1946 and 1947, when she was placed out of service, in reserve. On 1 November 1947 she was re-designated ADG-11. The ship remained inactive until July 1951, when she was again placed in service. Assigned to the Far East, ADG-11 was based at Yokosuka, Japan until sometime in 1954. After that, her home port was Sasebo, Japan. On 1 February 1955, she was renamed Ampere. The ship was placed out of service in February 1957. Her equipment was transferred to USS Surfbird, a <b>minesweeping</b> vessel which was redesignated a degaussing ship on 15 June 1957. She remained in reserve in the Far East until the summer of 1961, when {{the decision was made}} to dispose of her. Her name was struck from the Naval Register on 1 July 1961, and she was sold on 21 June 1962, to the Philippine President Lines of Manila. Her final disposition is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage. König was briefly grounded in the northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a <b>minesweeping</b> unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to the North Sea. König conducted her last exercise in the Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff, {{the second}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was ordered in March–April 1916 as part of the Repeat War Programme. The ship was laid down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at their Govan {{shipyard}} on 22 July 1916. She was launched on 12 April 1917 and completed on 25 June 1917. She became flagship of the 6th Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet the following month. Cardiff participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917. This was a successful attempt by the British to intercept German <b>minesweeping</b> forces that were clearing British minefields in the North Sea. The 6th LCS screened the two light s of the 1st Cruiser Squadron during the battle together with the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron. The British lost the German minesweepers in the smoke screen laid by the four German light cruisers and pursued the latter ships for most of the battle, although they inflicted little damage in the poor visibility caused by the German smoke. Cardiff fired the most of any ship in her squadron, but did not hit any German ships. She was, however, hit four or five times herself, killing seven crewmen and wounding thirteen, but was only lightly damaged. Based at Scapa Flow and Rosyth during 1918, the ship spent the remainder of the war escorting convoys and training in the northern portion of the North Sea. By 21 November 1918 the war was over, and Cardiff had the honour of leading the German High Seas Fleet to the Firth of Forth to be interned.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the war in August 1945, Bathurst was again assigned to the 21st <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla, and carried out <b>minesweeping</b> operations in the Hong Kong area.|$|E
25|$|The Bathursts were {{equipped}} with modified Type 128 asdic equipment, redesigned {{to be used}} without a gyroscopic stabiliser. <b>Minesweeping</b> equipment also varied across the class: ships {{equipped with}} the newer 'LL' <b>minesweeping</b> gear were distributed as evenly as possible throughout major Australian ports.|$|E
25|$|In mid-September 1943, Guysborough {{sailed to}} Baltimore where she {{underwent}} a refit that took {{six weeks to}} complete. In February 1944, she {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom as part of Canada's contribution to the invasion of Normandy. Upon arrival she was assigned to the British 14th <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla and swept Channel 2 in the American sector of the invasion route of mines during the night of 5–6 June. The 14th <b>Minesweeping</b> Flotilla resumed <b>minesweeping</b> activities an hour after the assault began on 6 June. They swept Baie de la Seine until 13 June. The 14th flotilla continued <b>minesweeping</b> activities in the invasion area until 21 June. She remained in UK waters until December when she returned to Canada to undergo another refit, this time at Lunenburg.|$|E
25|$|<b>Minesweeping</b> {{version for}} the JMSDF, two built.|$|E
25|$|YMS-402 earned one battle {{star for}} her post-World War II <b>minesweeping</b> activities.|$|E
25|$|Bandicoot and Wallaroo were {{primarily}} operated as a supplementary <b>minesweeping</b> force. In this role, they were {{equipped with a}} Klein Type 590 sidescan sonar array, along with a Mini-Dyad magnetic influence sweep array, an AMASS influence sweep array, or mechanical <b>minesweeping</b> gear. The vessels were also used as berthing tugs, primarily for foreign warships.|$|E
