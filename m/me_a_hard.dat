2500|$|Winter {{was born}} to John Winter II and Edwina Winter on December 28, 1946, in Beaumont, Texas. Both he {{and his older brother}} Johnny were born with albinism, and both were {{required}} to take special education classes in high school. Winter states, [...] "In school I had a lot of friends. I wore a lot of white shirts to, like, blend in I guess. No one really gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time about being albino or taking special education classes. Then again, I wasn't really popular." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison's first {{assignment}} {{under her}} new Fox contract {{was as a}} [...] "Biker Chick" [...] in Men Against Evil, a TV pilot which became the TV series Felony Squad. [...] "I had three words, [...] "Go, man, go!" [...] I was all of 20, and dressed in this really racy motorcycle outfit. Those were my first words! This was still the era of stardom and premieres. When you were put under a studio contract, every minute of your life was so exciting, because you were doing something so unique and special." [...] (Three years later, Harrison co-starred as Felony Squad star Dennis Cole's love interest in the NBC TV series Bracken's World.) Harrison's next assignment was in the campy Batman TV series; she appeared briefly as one of three high school cheerleaders in the Batman episodes [...] "The Joker Goes to School" [...] and [...] "He Meets His Match, The Grisly Ghoul", which aired in early March 1966. To prepare Harrison for her few seconds onscreen, her Fox dance coach worked Harrison and her fellow cheerleaders {{early in the morning}} and on through the day. Linda, a former high school cheerleader, complained, [...] "You're going to use up all my energy, so when the shot comes, I won't have any." [...] Her coach complained that [...] "Linda Harrison gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time." [...] After the brief late afternoon shot, Harrison's overworked leg muscles failed on her way home, and Richard D. Zanuck had to carry her upstairs to their Wilshire-Westwood apartment.|$|E

60|$|Hip. You ask <b>me</b> <b>an</b> <b>hard</b> question: I can die For you; perhaps I cannot woo so well.|$|R
5000|$|I sold {{that fucking}} movie {{for a period}} of ten years and with it bought myself some shelter from the storm. It was an agonizing decision, and one that made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> person, but it had to be done. I hated the fact that I made it {{possible}} for someone to go into a video store and rent it. But selling that film gave me some control over my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ask <b>me</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> thing," [...] {{he remarked}} when Wyndham stopped. [...] "However, if Flora agrees, I suppose I cannot refuse. It's obvious I owe you much." ...|$|R
6000|$|He gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> look. [...] "I guess there's wilder cats in it. It {{must come}} to this, George. I say, you mustn't tell Madam," [...] he adds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah-huh! Thought you'd {{give me the}} slip, eh?" [...] croaked Girty, striding forward, and as {{he looked}} at Wingenund his little, yellow eyes flared like flint. [...] "Does a wolf befriend Girty's captives? Chief you hev led <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> chase." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Col. Zane, I'd {{been here}} days before, but I run into some Shawnees, {{and they gave}} <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> chase. I have to report that Girty, with four hundred Injuns and two hundred Britishers, {{are on the way}} to Ft. Henry." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{might have}} been my mere fancy--but it was my fancy--that he looked at <b>me</b> <b>a</b> trifle <b>harder.</b> [...] "How on earth can I tell what you're talking about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Midden," [...] Nod answered, [...] "it {{needed no}} asking--that. It may be we shall never reach the Valleys. For {{now we must}} plunge into the water-cavern on our {{floating}} rafts, and all is haste and danger. But I mind no danger now, Midden. That Mulla-mulgar, my father Seelem, chose to wander, and not to sit fat and idle with Princes. So, too, would I. Tell <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> wish. Ask anything, Water-midden, and my Wonderstone shall give it you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You ask <b>me</b> rather <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> question," [...] she said. [...] "A {{few months}} ago I think that I should have said yes. To-day--I am not sure. What has happened? Is {{anything}} wrong with him?" ...|$|R
60|$|The lamp {{having been}} lighted, and fixed {{in its place}} between the two front windows of the carriage, Mrs. Macallan {{produced}} her son's letter. There is no folly like the folly of love. It cost <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> struggle to restrain myself from kissing the paper on which the dear hand had rested.|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY. Thank God--at last! Isn't it hell--all these fools! I couldn't get to you. What did Old Lady Grundy {{have to say}} to you? I saw her giving <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> look. Was {{it about}} us--the old stuff? (Eileen nods with downcast eyes.) What did she say? Never mind now. You can tell me in a minute. It's my turn next. (His eyes glance towards the scales.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{look at her}} beside of Wrestling Brewster, or Faith Carver. They are {{flesh and}} blood, and she looks {{as if she had}} been made out of sunshine. 'Tis a sweet babe as ever was; but fitter for the kingdom of heaven than our rough life--deary <b>me!</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time we have had of it. I suppose it's all best, but I don't know." ...|$|E
50|$|The Nordic Reich Party (Nordiska rikspartiet, NRP) was a Neo-Nazi {{political}} party in Sweden, founded in 1956 as the National Socialist Combat League of Sweden (Sveriges nationalsocialistiska kampförbund) by Göran Assar Oredsson. Oredsson {{was also the}} party leader {{except for a few}} years during the 1970s while he wrote his autobiography Prisat vare allt som gjort mig hårdare ("Blessed be everything that has made <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> man"). During that time, his wife Vera Oredsson took on the role as party leader and became Sweden's first female party leader.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see, Ben. Just the same, {{why should}} he give <b>me</b> such <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> look? Of course, I haven't been in his place of {{business}} for a good while. But he can't expect me to buy all my furnishing goods from him." ...|$|R
60|$|The old worldling {{left the}} window, took a chair exactly {{opposite}} to mine, {{and looked at}} <b>me</b> steadily, with <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> and vicious smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, as I told Glenn," [...] soliloquized Carley, [...] "every time I'm almost {{won over}} a little to Arizona she gives <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> jolt. I'm getting near being mushy today. Now let's see what I'll get. I suppose that's my pessimism or materialism. Funny how Glenn keeps saying its the jolts, the hard knocks, the fights that are best to {{remember}} afterward. I don't get that at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bungall did, and I'm here as his representative. But you'd better {{let that}} pass by just at present. If {{we can agree}} as to the {{management}} of the business, you won't find <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> man to deal with as to our relative shares." [...] Hereupon Tappitt scratched his head, and tried to think. [...] "But I don't see how we are to agree about the management," [...] he continued. [...] "You won't be led by anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{the saloon}} {{passengers}} also I sustained my part without a hitch. It is true I came little in their way; {{but when we}} did encounter, there was no recognition in their eye, although I confess I sometimes courted it in silence. All these, my inferiors and equals, took me, like the transformed monarch in the story, for a mere common, human man. They gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> dead look, with the flesh about the eye kept unrelaxed.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't say {{so if you}} {{had seen}} him chasing <b>me</b> upstairs with <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> leather strap," [...] he said; [...] "I haven't {{forgotten}} it in sixteen years." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{he began}} to tell <b>me</b> how <b>hard</b> <b>a</b> soldier's life was, how hard the soldier was drilled.|$|R
50|$|I was not {{destined to}} {{continue}} in the manner of Transfigured Night or Gurre-Lieder or even Pelleas and Melisande. The Supreme Commander had ordered <b>me</b> on <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> road. But <b>a</b> longing to return to the older style was always vigorous in me, {{and from time to time}} I had to yield to that urge.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that is the}} way I saw {{the woman}} first time. The wind was fair. I put up small sail. The canoe went very fast, it flew like a bird over the high waves. The woman was much afraid. 'What for you come Klondike much afraid?' I ask. She laugh at <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> laugh, but she is still much afraid. Also is she very tired. I run canoe through rapids to Lake Bennett. Water very bad, and woman cry out because she is afraid. We go down Lake Bennett, snow, ice, wind like a gale, but woman is very tired and go to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, you've asked <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> one. I haven't {{the faintest}} notion.... And yet... let me think. How {{is this for}} a conjecture? Sir Ivor is {{interested}} in steel rails, I believe, and in railway plant generally. I'm almost sure I've seen his name in connection with steel rails in reports of public meetings. There's a new Government railway now being built on the Nepaul frontier--one of these strategic railways, I think they call them--it's mentioned in the papers we got at Aden. He MIGHT be going out for that. We can watch his conversation, and see what part of India he talks about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, all of ye, that I {{never was}} hard on you," [...] {{continued}} Thady, [...] "when, God knows, {{the money was}} wanted bad enough at Ballycloran. You know I've waited longer for what was owed than many a one has done who has never felt {{what it was to}} want a pound. Did I ever pull the roof off any of you? And though queer tenants you've most of you been, an't the same set on the land now mostly that there was four years ago? There's none of you can call <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> man, I think; and when I've stuck to you so long, it isn't now I'll break away from you." ...|$|E
60|$|Harry. You wouldn't say {{so if you}} {{had seen}} him walloping <b>me</b> with <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> leather strap. (Walking up garden.) I haven't {{forgotten}} it in sixteen long years. (Rat-tat-tat twice.) Hullo, Dad. (Bessie intensely expectant. Rat-tat-tat.) Hullo, Dad--let me in. I am your own Harry. Straight. Your son Harry come back home--a day too soon.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed I cannot, my honest friend,' said I; 'and if {{you will}} go with <b>me</b> to <b>a</b> house <b>hard</b> by, I {{would be glad to}} have a night with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{do as you}} list, Sir Robert," [...] replied Lindesay, [...] "I {{have neither}} time nor temper to waste on such vanities. She has cost <b>me</b> many <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> ride, and must not now take offence at the threadbare cloak and soiled doublet that I am arrayed in. It is the livery to which she has brought all Scotland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excepting only you," [...] says Sally, {{putting her}} heavy arm very clumsily, but very gently {{at the same}} time, round Mary's feet, and looking hard at the pale, still face on the pillow. [...] "Excepting you, she's the only soul in this house as never swore at me, or give <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> word that I can remember. When you made puddings on Sundays, and give her half, she always give me a bit. The rest of 'em calls me Dusty Sal. Excepting only you, again, she always called me Sally, as if she knowed me in a {{friendly}} way. I ain't no good here, but I ain't no harm, neither; and I shall take my turn at the sitting up--that's what I shall do!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{deserved}} some reward (he {{was kind}} enough to say) for the service I had done him, and some compensation (he was so obliging as to add) for what I had suffered. He was quite willing--generous scoundrel!--to make me a handsome yearly allowance, payable quarterly, on two conditions. First, I was to hold my tongue--in my own interests as well as in his. Secondly, I was not to stir away from Welmingham without first letting him know, and waiting till I had obtained his permission. In my own neighbourhood, no virtuous female friends would tempt me into dangerous gossiping at the tea-table. In my own neighbourhood, he would always know where to find <b>me.</b> <b>A</b> <b>hard</b> condition, that second one--but I accepted it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have managed}} that affair for you, Marshall," [...] he said; [...] "and have {{arranged}} it {{in a way}} that I am sure will be satisfactory to us both. You must look upon me now as your creditor instead of Morrison, and you won't find <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> one. Here is your cancelled bill for four hundred and fifty. I got it for three hundred, so that a third of your debt is wiped off at once. As to the rest, you can pay me as you intended to pay him, but I don't want you to stint yourself unnecessarily. Pay me ten or fifteen pounds at a time at your convenience, and don't let us say anything more about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{certainly}} struck <b>me</b> as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> crowd; but seamen don't rob cargo-shippers nowadays. Then it's {{difficult to}} imagine that you told them what's in the cases. In fact, the way they obeyed your mate suggested that there's not much liking between men and officers on board this packet. If there was any trouble, I don't know that they'd take your side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talk on {{any other}} topic that you like, Mrs. Eyrecourt. I request you--don't oblige <b>me</b> to use <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> word--I request you to spare Father Benwell and myself any further {{expression}} of your opinion on controversial subjects." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the game, the Grey Cup {{was damaged}} after Edmonton Quarterback Tom Wilkinson accidentally dropped the trophy after being bumped by some rowdy fans. Eskimo linebacker Danny Kepley caught it, but he too got knocked and the mug {{dropped to the}} turf and broke. “I shouldn’t have dropped the Grey Cup. The Alouettes hit <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot <b>harder</b> than that,” said Wilkinson. (Quote taken from CFL website.) ...|$|R
