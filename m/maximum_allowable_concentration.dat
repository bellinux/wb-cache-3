25|$|Pyridine has a {{flash point}} (the lowest {{temperature}} {{at which it}} can vaporize to form an ignitable mixture in air) of only 17°C and is, therefore, highly flammable. Its ignition temperature is 550°C, and mixtures of 1.7–10.6vol% of pyridine with air are explosive. The thermal modification of pyridine starts above 490°C, resulting in bipyridine (mainly 2,2′-bipyridine {{and to a lesser}} extent 2,3′-bipyridine and 2,4′-bipyridine), nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in aquatic systems. The permitted <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>concentration</b> of pyridine was 15–30 parts per million (ppm, or 15–30mg·m−3 in air) in most countries in the 1990s, but was reduced to 5ppm in the 2000s.

50|$|Most people {{associate}} fluoride {{with the}} practice of intentionally adding fluoride to public drinking-water supplies {{for the prevention of}} tooth decay. However, fluoride can also enter public water systems from natural sources, including runoff from weathering of fluoride-containing rocks and soils and leaching from soil into groundwater. Fluoride pollution from various industrial emissions can also contaminate water supplies. In a few areas of the United States, fluoride concentrations in water are much higher than normal, mostly from natural sources. In 1986, EPA established a <b>maximum</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>concentration</b> for fluoride in drinking water of 4 milligrams per liter (mg/L). After reviewing research on various health effects from exposure to fluoride, the Committee on Fluoride in Drinking Water of the National Research Council concluded in 2006 that EPA's drinking water standard for fluoride does not protect against adverse health effects. Just over 200,000 Americans live in communities where fluoride levels in drinking water are 4 mg/L or higher. Children in those communities are at risk of developing severe tooth enamel fluorosis, a condition that can cause tooth enamel loss and pitting. It can also increase the risk of bone fractures.
