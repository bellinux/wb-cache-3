5|$|One of {{the most}} popular {{arguments}} against wider sentence spacing is that it was created for <b>monospaced</b> fonts of the typewriter, and is no longer needed with modern proportional fonts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monospaced</b> typefaces {{function}} {{better for}} some purposes because their glyphs {{line up in}} neat, regular columns. No glyph is given any more weight than another. Most manually operated typewriters use <b>monospaced</b> fonts. So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only <b>monospaced</b> fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in <b>monospaced</b> cells) in their configuration. <b>Monospaced</b> fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see. <b>Monospaced</b> fonts may also {{make it easier to}} perform optical character recognition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Monospaced</b> fonts are typefaces {{in which}} every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the w and m are wider than most letters, and the i is narrower). The first <b>monospaced</b> typefaces were {{designed}} for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, <b>monospaced</b> fonts are still important for computer programming, terminal emulation, and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents; {{they may also be}} particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of <b>monospaced</b> typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most <b>monospaced</b> fonts are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.|$|E

25|$|A {{proportional}} typeface contains glyphs {{of varying}} widths, while a <b>monospaced</b> (non-proportional or fixed-width) typeface uses a single standard width for all glyphs in the font. Duospaced fonts {{are similar to}} <b>monospaced</b> fonts, but characters can also be two character widths instead of a single character width.|$|E
25|$|In the {{publishing}} industry, {{it was once}} the case that editors read manuscripts in <b>monospaced</b> fonts (typically Courier) for ease of editing and word count estimates, and it was considered discourteous to submit a manuscript in a proportional font. This has become less universal in recent years, such that authors need to check with editors as to their preference, though <b>monospaced</b> fonts are still the norm.|$|E
25|$|The figure dash (‒) is {{so named}} {{because it is the}} same width as a digit, at least in fonts with digits of equal width. This is true of most fonts, not only <b>monospaced</b> fonts.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{although}} {{various studies}} have been conducted on the readability of proportional vs. <b>monospaced</b> fonts, the studies typically did not decrease sentence spacing when using proportional fonts, or did not specify whether sentence spacing was changed.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 he {{designed}} the Unicode font, Everson Mono, a <b>monospaced</b> typeface {{with more than}} 4,800 characters. This font was the third Unicode-encoded font to contain {{a large number of}} characters from many character blocks, after Lucida Sans Unicode and Unihan font (both 1993). In 2007 he was commissioned by the International Association of Coptic Studies to create a standard free Unicode 5.1 font for Coptic, Antinoou, using the Sahidic style.|$|E
25|$|Any {{two lines}} of text with {{the same number of}} {{characters}} in each line in a <b>monospaced</b> typeface should display as equal in width, while the same two lines in a proportional typeface may have radically different widths. This occurs because in a proportional font, glyph widths vary, such that wider glyphs (typically those for characters such as W, Q, Z, M, D, O, H, and U) use more space, and narrower glyphs (such as those for the characters i, t, l, and 1) use less space than the average.|$|E
5000|$|Formatting text is possible: [...] creates bold text, [...] creates italic text, [...] applies <b>monospace</b> font and [...] creates {{strikethrough}} text. Writing [...] at {{the beginning}} of a message will disable any formatting in the message. Placing two exclamation points and a space (...) {{at the beginning}} of a message will send the entire message in <b>monospace</b> font. A more convenient way to disable formatting for small pieces of text, is to use [...] instead of [...] Turning off formatting permanently can be achieved with the command [...]|$|R

25|$|Modern {{computer}} fonts {{include all}} of the ASCII, European Roman glyphs and Cyrillic glyphs and often Persian, Hebrew and Arabic. Most uniquely, however, their native character set's glyphs are designed to fit within a square. This is somewhat similar to <b>monospaced</b> type faces, but allows for vertical, horizontal, right-to-left and left-to-right orientation. They also include a set of Extended Latin characters with glyphs and metrics redesigned for the square {{in addition to the}} standard variety. This commonly results in complex, often conflicting rules and conventions of mixing languages in type.|$|E
500|$|However, {{proportional}} fonts existed {{together with}} wide sentence spacing for centuries before the typewriter, and remained for decades after its invention. [...] When the typewriter was first introduced, typists were most commonly taught to use three spaces between sentences. This gradually shifted to two spaces, while the print industry remained unchanged in its wide em-spaced sentences. [...] Some sources now state it is acceptable for <b>monospaced</b> fonts to be single spaced today, although other references continue to specify double spacing for <b>monospaced</b> fonts. The double space typewriter convention has been taught in schools in typing classes, and that remains {{the practice in}} many cases. Some voice concern that students will later be forced to relearn how to type.|$|E
500|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{computer}} age, typographers began deprecating double spacing, even in <b>monospaced</b> text. [...] In 1989, Desktop Publishing by Design stated that [...] "typesetting requires only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons", and identified single sentence spacing as a typographic convention. Stop Stealing Sheep & Find Out How Type Works (1993) and Designing with Type: The Essential Guide to Typography (2006) both indicate that uniform spacing should be used between words, including between sentences.|$|E

500|$|Many {{people are}} opposed to single {{sentence}} spacing for various reasons. [...] Some state that the habit of double spacing is too deeply ingrained to change. Others claim that additional space between sentences improves the aesthetics or readability of text. Proponents of double sentence spacing also state that some publishers may still require double-spaced manuscript submissions from authors. [...] A key example noted is the screenwriting industry's <b>monospaced</b> standard for screenplay manuscripts, Courier, 12-point font, although some works on screenwriting indicate that Courier is merely preferred—proportional fonts may be used. Some reliable sources state simply that writers should follow their particular style guide, but proponents of double spacing caution that publishers' guidance takes precedence, including those that ask for double sentence spaced manuscripts.|$|E
500|$|Technological {{advances}} began affecting sentence spacing methods. [...] In 1941, IBM {{introduced the}} Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing—which {{had been used}} in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. [...] This innovation broke the hold that the <b>monospaced</b> font had on the typewriter, reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic phototypesetting systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2.1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools. By the late 20th century, literature on the written word had begun to adjust its guidance on sentence spacing.|$|E
500|$|The ROM hacking entailed assembly-level {{changes to}} the game code. Young equated the process to {{teaching}} someone another language by slowly altering their DNA bit by bit, through trial and error. Some of the technical changes included proportional fonts, graphics hacks, and custom software. The game was coded {{in such a way}} that there was not enough system memory available to display the requisite onscreen text. Since Japanese characters all occupy the same amount of space (<b>monospaced),</b> the team had to custom-code the new English characters to fit properly. Tomato said that [...] "no text display routine wound up untouched", such that the fixes for variable width fonts were useless until the team manually made room for the characters. Graphics hacks included the new intro screen and images imported from the English EarthBound, so as to preserve continuity of features. For example, an octopus statue pun from Mother 2 was converted to a pencil statue in the EarthBound English localization and was changed accordingly in the Mother 3 localization. The team also built custom software to aid in the translation, such as a cross-assembler and tools for handling the script and patching. Members of the hacking team included Tomato, Jeffman, byuu, and sblur, among others.|$|E

50|$|The term modern is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym for <b>monospace</b> generic font family. The term modern {{can be used for}} a fixed-pitch generic font family name used in OpenDocument format (ISO/IEC 26300:2006) and Rich Text Format.|$|R
2500|$|ASCII art usually {{requires}} a <b>monospaced</b> font for proper viewing, {{with the exception}} of Shift JIS art which takes advantage of the proportional characters in the MS PGothic font. [...] In a web page, the <tt> </tt>, <code> </code> or <pre> </pre> HTML tags most commonly specify <b>monospaced</b> fonts. [...] In LaTeX, the verbatim environment or the Teletype font family (e.g., \texttt{...} or {\ttfamily ...}) uses <b>monospaced</b> fonts (in TeX, use {\tt ...}).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Monospaced</b> fonts {{that mimic}} {{the look of}} a {{typewriter}} have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the <b>monospaced</b> width they have available.
