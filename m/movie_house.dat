5|$|The square, {{originally}} called Zion Circus, {{was named}} for the Zion Cinema (also called Zion Hall), a 400-seat silent <b>movie</b> <b>house</b> which occupied a hut on the site from 1912 to 1920. After the hut collapsed under a heavy snowfall, the cinema was reconstructed as a 600-seat theater for film screenings and live opera performances.|$|E
5|$|The 300-seat {{theater was}} {{designed}} by Charles A. Duke in 1913 and opened in 1915 as The Clinton. Its main entrance faced 26th Avenue until 1922. The venue {{became known as the}} 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a variation of its original name on May 30, 1975. At that time, a five-person collective bought the theater. The <b>movie</b> <b>house</b> had been showing X-rated films, which the collective replaced {{with a wide variety of}} movies including foreign films, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and older films like The African Queen.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton Street Theater is {{a theater}} located in {{southeast}} Portland, Oregon. It {{is believed to}} be the second oldest operating <b>movie</b> <b>house</b> in the city and one of the oldest continually operating cinemas in the United States. The theater was designed by Charles A. Duke in 1913, built in 1914, and opened as The Clinton in 1915. It became known as the 26th Avenue Theatre in 1945 and the Encore in 1969, before reverting to a resemblance of its original name in 1976.

5|$|The Trylon {{closed for}} three months in summer 2017 as Kryshka {{supervised}} a major renovation and expansion of the theater, at a projected cost of $175,000. MSR Design of Minneapolis worked pro bono to create updated architectural plans. As part of the renovation, the entrance was moved from Minnehaha Ave to 33rd Street.

The auditorium was expanded from 50 to 92 seats, and a new screen and sound system were added.

5|$|RKO, and {{the movie}} {{industry}} as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best Years of Our Lives, was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade. But {{the legal status of}} the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO that the company was liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent <b>movie</b> <b>house</b> access to first run films—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40% of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dore Schary, who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.|$|E
