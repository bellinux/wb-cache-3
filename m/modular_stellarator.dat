40|$|Abstract — The Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) <b>modular</b> <b>stellarator</b> {{is in the}} {{assembly}} phase at the Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik in Greifswald, Germany. The design of the “basic machine”, i. e. without in-vessel components, diagnostics and periphery, is largely completed, structural parameters such as bolt preload, initial conditions for contact elements, etc. are defined, {{and most of the}} components are manufactured and partly assembled. Therefore, the focus of structural analysis was shifted towards fast analyses of nonconformities, changes in {{the assembly}} procedure, and exploration of operational limits. Assembly-related work is expected to continue until commissioning of the machine, however, with decreasing intensity. In parallel the analysis requirements for in-vessel components, diagnostics and periphery will increase. This paper focuses on the most remarkable results, on special problems which had to be solved, on strategic issues like parameterization, complex finite element model structuring and benchmarking with alternative models in different codes, on assumptions of reasonable safety margins and expected tolerances, and on confirmation of analysis results by tests. Finally it highlights some lessons learned so far, which might be relevant also for other large fusion machines, and gives an outlook on future work...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} results, {{mainly from}} heliotron/torsatron devices and an advanced stellarator, are reviewed. An international helical system data {{base on the}} energy confinement time has been compiled; the confinement time scaling {{is similar to the}} tokamak L-mode. Improved confinement regimes, i. e., high T_i mode, pellet mode, H-mode, and re-heat mode, have also been investigated. In L-mode and improved confinement regimes the energy confinement scaling has a favorable density dependence, and the operating density limit by radiation collapse in helical devices has a much steeper magnetic field dependence than in tokamaks. The maximum attainable beta of about 2 % is not limited by MHD instabilities but by the absorbed heating power. Investigations of divertor configurations, including local island divertors and natural island divertors, showed that next generation devices will have a good prospect for steady state operations. Based on these results next generation devices (LHD and WVII-X) with a major radius in the range, 4 - 5. 5 m, have been either under construction or approved for construction. A small Heliac has started its operation, and another has been under construction. A small <b>modular</b> <b>stellarator</b> with a quasi-helical symmetry has also been under construction. ...|$|E
40|$|Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X), a <b>modular</b> {{advanced}} <b>stellarator,</b> {{is presently}} under construction at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald. Part {{of the inner}} plasma vessel (PV) surface is covered by graphite tiles which are bolted onto water-cooled CuCrZr heat sink plates. This so-called heat shield shall protect in-vessel components and the PV wall from plasma-edge-radiation and convective heat loads. Numerous diagnostics (e. g. Diamagnetic loops, Rogowski coils, etc.) are located in between the heat shield and plasma vessel wall. They are loaded by thermal radiation from the hot heat shield backside, stray radiation from the electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), and plasma radiation through remaining gaps between the tiles. In {{order to keep the}} temperatures of the diagnostics within their specified limits, additional shielding is required. The paper presents the design of such a shielding for the diamagnetic loops and Rogowski coils. Several options of copper shields and loosely attached Sigraflexr-layers, and combinations thereof, are compared with respect to their abilities to reduce the temperatures of the sensitive parts of the diagnostics. To increase the confidence in the results, a sensitivity study with widely varying radiative material properties has been carried out. The advantages and disadvantages of the potential solutions are discussed. As a result two copper shield variants which also reduce the load onto the plasma vessel are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{misalignment}} of modular coils on neoclassical transport in CHS-qa is discussed in this paper. In order to calculate the effective helical ripple that characterizes the neoclassical transport of the stellarator configura-tion, NEO code is used which gives the effective helical ripple numerically. A displacement is put artificially on the modular coils of the CHS-qa, {{and the effect of}} this on the profile of the effective helical ripple is evaluated quantita-tively. One objective {{of this study is to}} obtain useful information to determine the acceptable error level for the assem-bly of modular coils from the viewpoint of engineering. The calculation results of the NEO code show that if the level of displacement is smaller than a few centim eters, it has only a very small effect on the neoclassical transport. The a mount of change in the effective helical ripple is small. Therefore the displacement of the modular coils caused by the electromagnetic force at a 1. 5 T operation of CHS-qa does not lead to significant problems in terms of neoclassical transport.

40|$|The new American-German {{collaboration}} on the W 7 -X stellarator in Greifswald, Germany, is in {{its first}} year as an ICC project. Los Alamos, Princeton, and Oak Ridge have organized an effort centered on applications of 3 D magnetic fields to improve the performance and design of toroidal confinement devices. In particular, presently we have three focus areas: providing copper error correction coils (trim coils) to be mounted externally on the W 7 -X cryostat, developing a scraper element for the divertor, and working control issues under the theme of 3 D Diverted Plasmas. The trim coils must be designed and built on a fast schedule, to meet assembly timelines. The LANL effort involves theoretical modeling of whether the stellarator bootstrap current depends on the radial electric field, and an experimental investigation (IR imaging) of the heat loading and wall interactions in the W 7 -X 3 -dimensional divertor.

A hot hydrogen plasma of ultra-low density is confined in a plasma vessel by an electromagnetic field generated by specially shaped superconducting coils. Such coils, embedded in a cryostat working at 4. K, are kept by a central support ring and joined together by welded lateral support elements (LSEs).

40|$|The fivefold {{symmetric}} <b>modular</b> <b>stellarator</b> Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) {{is currently}} {{under construction in}} Greifswald, Germany. The superconducting coils of the magnet system are bolted onto a central support ring and interconnected with five so-called lateral support elements (LSEs) per half module. After welding of the LSE hollow boxes to the coil cases, cracks {{were found in the}} vicinity of the welds that could potentially limit the allowed number N of electromagnetic (EM) load cycles of the machine. In response to the appearance of first cracks during assembly, the Stress Intensity Factors (SIFs) were calculated and corresponding crack growth rates of theoretical semi-circular cracks of measured sizes in potentially critical position and orientation were predicted using Paris’ law, whose parameters were calibrated in fatigue tests at cryogenic temperature. In this paper the Dual Boundary Element Method (DBEM) is applied in a coupled FEM-DBEM approach to analyze the propagation of multiple cracks with different shapes. For this purpose, the crack path is assessed with the Minimum Strain Energy density criterion and SIFs are calculated by the Jintegral approach. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is adopted to model, using the commercial codes Ansys or Abaqus;, the overall component whereas the submodel analysis, in the volume surrounding the cracked area, is performed by FEM (“FEM-FEM approach”) or alternatively by DBEM (“FEM-DBEM approach”). The “FEM-FEM approach” considers a FEM submodel, that is extracted from the FEM global model; the latter provide the boundary conditions for the submodel. Such approach is affected by some restrictions in the crack propagation phase, whereas, with the “FEM-DBEM approach”, the crack propagation simulation is straightforward. In this case the submodel is created in a DBEM environment with boundary conditions provided by the global FEM analysis; then the crack is introduced and a crack propagation analysis has been performed to evaluate the effects of the crack shape and of the presence of nearby cracks on the allowed number of EM load cycles...|$|E
