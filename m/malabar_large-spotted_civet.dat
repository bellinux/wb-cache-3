500|$|These hill ranges {{serve as}} {{important}} wildlife corridors and forms {{an important part}} of Project Elephant and Project Tiger reserves. The largest population of tigers outside the Sundarbans is in the Western Ghats where there are seven populations with an estimated population size of 336 to 487 individuals occupying [...] forest in three major landscape units spread across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The Western Ghats eco-region has the largest Indian elephant population in the wild with an estimated 11,000 individuals across eight distinct populations. The endemic Nilgiri tahr which was on the brink of extinction has recovered and has an estimated 3,122 individuals in the wild. The Critically Endangered endemic <b>Malabar</b> <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet</b> is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no sub-population greater than 50 individuals.

50|$|The <b>Malabar</b> <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet</b> (Viverra civettina), {{also known}} as the Malabar civet, is a viverrid endemic to the Western Ghats of India. It is listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN as its {{population}} size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 individuals.In the 1990s, isolated populations still survived in less disturbed areas of South Malabar but were seriously threatened by habitat destruction and hunting because they lived outside protected areas.|$|E

The largest population of tigers outside the Sundarbans is in the Western Ghats where there are seven populations with an estimated population size of 336 to 487 individuals occupying 21435 km2 forest in three major landscape units spread across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

50|$|The <b>Malabar</b> <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet</b> is dusky gray. It has a dark {{mark on the}} cheek, large {{transverse}} dark {{marks on}} the back and sides, and two obliquely transverse dark lines on the neck. These dark marks are more pronounced than in the large Indian civet. Its throat and neck are white. A mane starts between the shoulders. Its tail is ringed with dark bands. The feet are dark.It differs from the large-spotted civet by the greater nakedness of the soles of the feet. The hairs on the interdigital webs between the digital pads form submarginal patches; the skin of the plantar pad is naked in front and at the sides. There are remnants of the metatarsal pads on the hind foot as two naked spots, the external a little above the level of the hallux, the internal considerably higher. A male individual kept in the Zoological Gardens of Trivandrum in the 1930s measured 30 in in head and body with a 13 in long tail and weighed 14.5 lb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Large-spotted</b> <b>civets</b> {{are found}} in Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and China. In China, the last {{sighting}} occurred in 1998. They inhabit evergreen, deciduous, and dry dipterocarp forests below altitudes of 300 m. In Thailand, they occur in several protected areas {{as far south as}} the Ranong Province.|$|R
50|$|The <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet</b> is {{threatened}} due to habitat degradation, habitat loss, and hunting with snares and dogs. The population {{is thought to}} have been steadily declining throughout the range countries, and in China and Vietnam in particular may have been reduced significantly.In Chinese and Vietnamese markets, it is in demand as food.|$|R
50|$|The {{masked palm civet}} is {{considered}} a delicacy and is hunted and farm raised. In 2003, the coronavirus that caused the SARS epidemic was traced to masked palm civets. Several larger civets such as the <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet,</b> Malayan civet and large Indian civet are also hunted and trapped for their meat. The small Indian civet is trapped and farm raised to harvest musk, {{which is used to}} make perfume and traditional Chinese medicine. Other civets species include the Asian palm civet, small-toothed palm civet, and Owston's palm civet.|$|R
50|$|Threatened {{animal species}} in the park include elephant, tiger, leopard, clouded leopard, black crested gibbon, Fran√ßois' langur, giant muntjac, gaur, pygmy slow loris, dhole, Asian black bear, sun bear, banteng and <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet.</b> Phou Xang He's large area and {{relatively}} pristine state make the park important in conserving these species in an undisturbed habitat. Other park species include macaque and douc langur.|$|R
50|$|Many other {{threatened}} species have {{their home in}} Botum Sakor National Park, in fact {{over a quarter of}} the mammalian species here are of conservation interest due to their global status. These include large-toothed ferret-badger (Melogale personata), hairy-nosed otter (Lutra sumatrana), smooth-coated otter (Lutra perspicillata), sambar deer, <b>large-spotted</b> <b>civet</b> and more.

White bands on the tail are mostly restricted to the sides and lower surface but very seldom form complete rings. Adults measure 30-30.5 in in head and body with a 13-15.5 in long tail.
