5|$|The mysticete ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound {{frequencies}} as low as 7 Hz and as high as 22 kHz. It is largely unknown how sound is received by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory <b>meatus</b> is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in the tympanic bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that vibrations passing through the bone is important. Sinuses may reflect vibrations towards the cochlea. It is known that when the fluid inside the cochlea is disturbed by vibrations, it triggers sensory hairs which send electrical current to the brain, where vibrations are processed into sound.|$|E
25|$|In the midline of the nose, the septum is a {{composite}} (osseo-cartilaginous) structure that divides the nose into two (2) similar halves. The lateral nasal wall and the paranasal sinuses, the superior concha, the middle concha, and the inferior concha, form the corresponding passages, the superior <b>meatus,</b> the middle <b>meatus,</b> and the inferior <b>meatus,</b> on the lateral nasal wall. The superior <b>meatus</b> is the drainage area for the posterior ethmoid bone cells and the sphenoid sinus; the middle <b>meatus</b> provides drainage for the anterior ethmoid sinuses and for the maxillary and frontal sinuses; and the inferior <b>meatus</b> provides drainage for the nasolacrimal duct.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to describe, macroscopically and with light microscopy, the {{respiratory}} organs of the brown-nosed coati (Nasua nasua). Five animals were euthanized, fixed in 10 % formaldehyde solution and stored for dissection. The respiratory tracts of the coati were examined, measured and photographed. For the light microscopy study, fragments were collected from the respiratory organs, processed using standard techniques for histology and stained with HE and toluidine blue. The nose of the coati is pointed and turned upward. Internally it has ethmoidal, dorsal nasal and ventral nasal conchae that are separated by the dorsal and ventral nasal <b>meatuses.</b> The larynx has four cartilaginous structures: arytenoid, cricoid, epiglottis and thyroid. The trachea contains 34 tracheal rings and tracheal ligaments that are covered with ciliated pseudostratified epithelial tissue. The lungs are divided into lobes by interlobular fissures. The right lung is divided into four lobes and is larger than the left lung, whereas the left lung has only two lobes. Microscopically, the primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi have epithelial tissue that is similar to the trachea. We conclude that the respiratory tract of the brown-nosed coati resembles the respiratory tracts described for domestic carnivores...|$|R

Close contact with domes­tic animals, history of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), and completely resolved pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in remote past, were nota­ble parts of her past medical history. Due to clinical, paraclinical and radio­graphic findings and because of recent hospitalization, she was admitted to internal medicine ward with the diagnosis of health care associated pneumo­nia (HCAP). Despite the application of broad-spectrum antibiotics and ap­propriate supportive care, she had a poor response to the treatment. During the daily visit in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), numerous white larvae were de­tected in both nostrils. Further investigation of oropharynx and tracheal tube aspiration, showed no more larvae in mentioned parts. An hour later, nasal spontaneous bleeding occurred. Otorhinolaryngology consultation was per­formed and led to surgical procedure.

25|$|The {{nasal septum}} is {{composed}} of the quadrangular cartilage, the vomer bone (the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone), aspects of the premaxilla, and the palatine bones.

Lateral to the turbinates is the medial wall of the maxillary sinus. Inferior to the nasal conchae (turbinates) is the <b>meatus</b> space, with names that correspond to the turbinates, e.g. superior turbinate, superior <b>meatus,</b> et alii. The internal roof of the nose is composed by the horizontal, perforated cribriform plate (of the ethmoid bone) through which pass sensory filaments of the olfactory nerve (Cranial nerve I); finally, below and behind (posteroinferior) the cribriform plate, sloping down at an angle, is the bony face of the sphenoid sinus.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{potential}} {{demand for}} hearing aids is increasing {{in accordance with}} aging of populations in many developed countries. Because certain patients cannot use air conduction hearing aids, they usually use bone conduction hearing aids. However, bone does not transmit sound as efficiently as air, and bone conduction hearing aids require surgery (bone anchored hearing aid) or great pressure to the skull. The first {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the efficacy of a new sound conduction pathway via the cartilage. The second purpose is to develop a hearing aid with a cartilage conduction transducer for patients who cannot use regular air conduction hearing aids. Design/methodology/approach: We examined the hearing ability of a patient with atresia of both external auditory <b>meatuses</b> via three kinds of conduction pathways (air, bone, and cartilage). After the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer was found, audiometric evaluation was performed for his left ear with an insertion earphone (air conduction), a bone conduction transducer, and a cartilage conduction transducer. Then we made a new hearing aid using cartilage conduction and got subjective data from the patients. Findings: The tragal cartilage was the best position for the cartilage conduction transducer. The patient’s mean hearing levels were 58. 3 dBHL, 6. 7 dBHL, and 3. 3 dBHL for air conduction, bone conduction, and cartilage conduction respectively. The hearing ability of the patients obtained from the cartilage conduction hearing aid was comparable to those from the bone conduction hearing aid. Practical implications: Hearing levels using cartilage conduction are very similar to those via bone conduction. Cartilage conduction hearing aids may overcome the practical disadvantages of bone conduction hearing aids such as pain and the need for surgery. Originality/value: We have clarified the efficacy of the cartilage conduction pathway and developed a prototype ‘cartilage conduction hearing aid’, which is the first hearing aid to use sound transmission via cartilage...|$|R

2500|$|This type of {{fractured}} mandible {{can involve}} one condyle (unilateral) or both (bilateral). Unilateral condylar fracture may cause restricted and painful jaw movement.

If the bones fracture and overlie each other there may be shortening of {{the height of the}} ramus. This results in gagging of the teeth on the fractured side (the teeth meet too soon on the fractured side, and not on the non fractured side, i.e. [...] "open bite" [...] that becomes progressively worse to the unaffected side).

6000|$|In all the skulls of {{the large}} {{lop-eared}} rabbits, the bony auditory <b>meatus</b> is conspicuously larger than in the wild rabbit. In a skull 4.3 inches in length, and which barely exceeded in breadth the skull of a wild rabbit (which was 3.15 inches in length), the longer diameter of the <b>meatus</b> was exactly twice as great. The orifice is more compressed, and its margin on the side nearest the skull stands up higher than the outer side. The whole <b>meatus</b> is directed more forwards. As in breeding lop-eared rabbits {{the length of the}} ears, and their consequent lopping and lying flat on the face, are the chief points of excellence, there can hardly be a doubt that the great change in the size, form, and direction of the bony <b>meatus,</b> relatively to this same part in the wild rabbit, is due to the continued selection of individuals having larger and larger ears. The influence of the external ear on the bony <b>meatus</b> is well shown in the skulls (I have examined three) of half-lops (see figure 5), in which one ear stands upright, and the other and longer ear hangs down; for in these skulls there was a plain difference in the form and direction of the bony <b>meatus</b> on the two sides. But it is a much more interesting fact, that the changed direction and increased size of the bony <b>meatus</b> have slightly affected on the same side the structure of the whole skull. I here give a drawing (figure 11) of the skull of a half-lop; and it may be observed that the suture between the parietal and frontal bones does not run strictly at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the skull; the left frontal bone projects beyond the right one; both the posterior and anterior margins of the left zygomatic arch {{on the side of the}} lopping ear stand a little in advance of the corresponding bones on the opposite side. Even the lower jaw is affected, and the condyles are not quite symmetrical, that on the left standing a little in advance of that on the right. This seems to me a remarkable case of correlation of growth. Who would have surmised that by keeping an animal during many generations under confinement, and so leading to the disuse of the muscles of the ears, and by continually selecting individuals with the longest and largest ears, he would thus indirectly have affected almost every suture in the skull and the form of the lower jaw! ...|$|E

60|$|The {{five other}} skulls of common {{domestic}} rabbits, {{some of which}} approach in size the above-described largest skulls, whilst the others exceed but little those of the wild rabbit, are only worth notice as presenting a perfect gradation in all the above-specified differences between the skulls of the largest lop-eared and wild rabbits. In all, however, the supra- orbital plates are rather larger, and in all the auditory <b>meatus</b> is larger, in conformity with the increased size of the external ears, than in the wild rabbit. The lower notch in the occipital foramen in some was not so deep as in the wild rabbit, but in all five skulls the upper notch was well developed.|$|E
60|$|Acoustic (?) Organs.--A {{little way}} beneath the basal {{articulation}} of the first cirrus (Pl. IX, fig. 4 d, and Pl. IV, fig. 2 e), on each side, there may be seen a slight swelling, and on the under side of this, a transverse slit-like orifice, 1/20th of an inch in length in Conchoderma, but often only half that size. In Ibla this orifice is seated lower down (Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´, e), between the bases {{of the first and}} second cirri, which are here far apart: in Alepas cornuta it is placed rather nearer to the adductor scutorum muscle, namely, beneath the mandibles. The orifice leads into a rather deep and wide meatus; the external integument is turned in for a short distance, widening a little, and then ends abruptly. The <b>meatus,</b> enlarging upwards, is lined by thick pulpy corium, and is closed at the upper end; from its summit is suspended a flattened sack of singular and different shapes in the different genera. This, the so-called acoustic sack of Conchoderma virgata, is figured Pl. IX, fig. 6. The deep and wide notch faces towards the posterior end of the animal; the inferior lobe, thus almost cut off, is flattened in a different plane from the upper part; the lobe is lodged in a little pouch of corresponding form, leading from the open <b>meatus</b> in which the upper part is included. In Conchoderma aurita, the top of the acoustic sack is narrower and more constricted, the whole more rounded, and the lobe more turned down. In Lepas fascicularis the notch is not so deep or wide, and the lobe larger. In Ibla Cumingii the sack is of the shape of a vase, with one corner folded over. In Scalpellum vulgare it is small, oval, with the lower end much pushed in, and furnished with a little crest. Lastly, in Pollicipes mitella it is simply oval. In all cases the sack is empty, or contains only a little pulpy matter: it consists of brownish, thick, and remarkably elastic tissue, formed, apparently, of transverse little pillars, becoming fibrous on the outside, and with their inner ends appearing like hyaline points. The mouth of the acoustic sack (removed in the drawing) is closed by a tender diaphragm, through which I saw what I believe was a moderately-sized nerve enter; I have not yet succeeded in tracing this nerve. The first pair of cirri seem, to a certain extent, to serve as antennæ, and therefore the position of an acoustic organ at their bases, is analogous to what takes place in crustacea; but there are not here any otolites, or the siliceous particles and hairs, as described by Dr. Farre, in that class. Nevertheless, the sack is so highly elastic, and its suspension in a <b>meatus</b> freely open to the water, seems so well adapted for an acoustic organ, that I have provisionally thus called it. In the larva, as I have shown, a pouch, certainly serving for some sense, I believe for hearing, is seated in quite a different position at the anterior end of the carapace. I may mention that I found sessile Cirripedes very sensitive of vibrations in objects adjoining them, though not, apparently, of noises in the air or water. In a group of specimens, I could not touch one even most delicately with a needle, without all the adjoining ones instantly withdrawing their cirri; it made no difference if the one touched had its operculum already closed and motionless.|$|E
6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter sound vibrations of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and external auditory <b>meatus</b> (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the sound vibrations of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E

Vivere quidem Spongias adhærendo Aristoteles censet: absolute vero minime: sensumque aliquem habere, vel eo argumento (inquit) credantur, quod difficillime abstrahantur, nisi clanculum agatur: Atq; ad avulsoris accessum ita contrahantur, ut eas evellere difficile sit, quod idem etiam faciunt quoties flatus tempestatésque urgent. Puto autem illis succum sordidum quem supra diximus carnis loco à natura attributum fuisse: atque meatibus latioribus tanquam intestinis aut interaneis uti. Cæterum pars ea quæ Spongiæ cautibus adhærent est tanquam folii petiolus, à quo veluti collum quoddam gracile incipit: quod deinde in latitudinem diffusum capitis globum facit. Recentibus nihil est fistulosum, hæsitantque tanquam radicibus. Superne omnes propemodum <b>meatus</b> concreti latent: inferne verò quaterni aut quini patent, per quos eas sugere existimamus. From which Description, they seem {{to be a kind of}} Plant-Animal that adheres to a Rock, and these small fibres or threads which we have described, seem to have been the Vessels which ('tis very probable) were very much bigger whil'st the Interstitia were fill'd (as he affirms) with a mucous, pulpy or fleshy substance; but upon the drying were shrunk into the bigness they now appear.|$|E

(A <b>meatus</b> is a passage or opening in the body, especially one which is open to the exterior).|$|E
