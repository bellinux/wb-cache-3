5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> worked with Team Bondi management, the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> {{came to understand that}} this was a terrible idea.|$|E

5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice. The CCRC referred {{the case to the}} Court of Appeal in March 2001 on the grounds that new DNA testing on the silencer constituted fresh evidence. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> examined the case, the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> thought the jury had been right.|$|E

5|$|After the Democrats' electoral {{victories}} in 1951 and 1955, {{they hoped to}} further solidify their hold on city offices by ousting the few Republicans left in power. At the same time, however, they were faced with growing divisions within their own party. Democrats had won in 1951 by combining with reform-minded Republicans and independents. By 1954, however, some Democrats led by Council President James Hugh Joseph Tate tried to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees {{to become involved in}} electioneering once <b>more.</b> <b>They</b> fell just short of the two-thirds vote in Council to put their amendments on the ballot, but in 1956, Tate's faction again proposed charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections and this time found the required vote to put it on to the ballot for popular approval. The referendum failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5|$|Ruffed lemurs, on average, spend 28% {{of the day}} feeding, 53% resting, and 19% traveling, {{although}} {{differences in}} resting and feeding durations have been observed between males and females, with females resting less and feeding <b>more.</b> <b>They</b> are diurnal; although peak activity occurs during the early morning and late afternoon or evening, resting usually occurs around midday. When resting, ruffed lemurs often sit hunched or upright. They are also frequently seen lying prone over a branch or sunbathing in a supine position with the limbs outstretched. When feeding, they will often hang upside-down by their hind feet, a type of suspensory behavior, which allows them to reach fruits and flowers.|$|E

In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between Michaelmas 1178 and {{the start}} of 1179, Reginald retired from public life and became a monk at Lewes Priory, which had been founded by his family. When he retired, the Exchequer began to {{pressure}} him to repay his debts to the king, which for the previous decade or <b>more</b> <b>they</b> had ignored. Reginald died in 1179, and his heir was his son William de Warenne. Besides his son, Reginald also had several daughters. One was Gundrada who married three times– first to Peter de Valognes, son of Roger de Valognes, second to William de Courcy, son of William de Courcy and Avice de Rumilly the daughter of William Meschin, and third to Geoffrey Hose, the son of Henry Hose. Another daughter was Alice who married Peter, constable of Mealton. A possible third daughter was Muriel, who was a nun at Carrow Abbey.

5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries.

They could also order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E

5|$|Theoretically, {{all life}} forms {{are said to}} deserve full {{protection}} {{from all kinds of}} injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life.

The more senses a being has, the <b>more</b> <b>they</b> care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.|$|E
