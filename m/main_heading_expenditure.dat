30|$|Alona kaingang sp. nov. is {{a member}} of the pulchella-group because its posteroventral corner of the {{carapace}} is armed with many short and thin spinules not arranged in groups, three <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, marginal denticles of postabdomen merged and developed, lateral fascicles developed, IDL with three setae, seven setae on the exopodite of limb III, fourth setae of limb III well-developed, gnathobase of limb V reduced, and limb VI absent. Alona kaingang sp. nov. also has the fourth seta on the exopodite of limb III geniculated, like many species of the pulchella-group (except in Alona archeri). As an alternative to identification, the pulchella-group may be separated into two groups based on the morphology of the <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores: one group contains species with interrupted connection (including those species with <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pore isolated) and the other contains species with complete connection. Thus, A. kaingang sp. nov., having a complete connection between the <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, could be differentiated from species belonging to do the first group: Alona capensis (Rüher, 1914), Alona setulosa (Megard, 1967), Alona cambouei (Guerne & Richard, 1893), Alona aguascalientensis Sinev & Silva-Briano, 2013, Alona nigra Smirnov, 1996, Alona setuloides Smirnov & Timms, 1983, Alona azorica Frenzel & Alonso 1989, Alona anastasia Sinev Alonso, Miracle & Suhaquillo, 2012, and Alona nuragica Margaritora, 1971. Regarding species with complete connection between <b>main</b> <b>head</b> pores, A. kaingang sp. nov. is distinguished by the presence of spinules on apical setae of antenna and proximal spines on IDL setae. Besides, A. kaingang sp. nov. has single morphological traits such as the slight depression in the middle portion of the exopodite of the limb V.|$|R

30|$|As {{pointed out}} previously, {{there are many}} {{researches}} on the factors determining expenditures on health care but then {{it is very difficult}} to analyze all of the literature. For this reason, our work reviewed works that are relevant to the subject matter under study. Jerrett et al. (2003) used cross-sectional statistics for forty-nine countries in Ontario Canada to examine the link between health expenditures and the quality of environment represented by air pollutants and government spending for protecting the environment. On one hand, they argued that countries with more pollutant emissions were found to have higher per <b>head</b> <b>expenditure</b> on health and those that spent enough for environmental protection have lesser expenditures on health. Air pollution has a direct and statistically significant impact on child hospitalization as a result of Asthma (Neidell 2004).|$|R
