He continues to perform clarinet in ensembles such as 45th Parallel, Martingale Ensemble and other projects.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to Germany, Lody settled in Berlin, living in what he {{described}} as [...] "well to do circumstances". He stayed in the Adlon, the city's most fashionable luxury hotel, while his sister Hanna lived with her doctor husband in the prosperous suburb of Westend in Charlottenburg. As tensions grew across Europe {{in the first half of}} 1914, German naval intelligence – the Nachrichten-Abteilung, or [...] "N" [...] – set out to recruit potential agents. Lody already had links with the service. During his time with the Imperial German Navy, Lody had served under Arthur Tapken, who later became N's first director. The German Imperial Admiralty Staff, or Admiralstab, listed Lody as a possible recruitment target before the outbreak of war. The naval authorities regarded Hamburg America Line (HAL) employees such as Lody as ideal recruits because of their expertise in naval matters and presence in ports worldwide. The HAL had collaborated with the Admiralstab since the 1890s. The relationship became so close that in July 1914, just before the outbreak of the war, the HAL's director Albert Ballin told the Admiralstab that he would [...] "place <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> organisation subordinate to me at your Excellency's disposal as best as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, Tessa {{demonstrates}} great courage, {{for example}} in [...] "", where she is abducted by three mountain men led by Immortal Caleb Cole, who wants to marry her. Tessa refuses to submit and spreads doubt among them, resulting in Cole finally killing {{one of his own}} men before MacLeod rescues her. Reviewer Rob Lineberger of DVDVerdict.com commented that [...] "...this episode shows the tough stuff Tessa is made of." [...] Tessa is a very selfless character, although it has, occasionally, been known to put her into rather sticky situations, for example, in the episode [...] "See No Evil", Tessa's friend, Natalie, is attacked by serial killer Michael Tanovsky and Tessa uses herself as bait: [...] "Nobody's watching over his next victim, Duncan... and she's going to die if you and I don't stop him." [...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life must feel when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved." [...] Tessa has a reputation for speaking frankly and for refusing to tolerate any nonsense. In [...] "", when MacLeod refuses to take her where an evil Immortal is, she says, [...] "I know why you don't want me there. You're afraid that what happened to Lucas [...] could happen to you." [...] Tessa has no self-pity and [...] "...doesn't like euphemisms". For example, in [...] "For Tomorrow We Die", MacLeod calls her [...] "contrary by nature" [...] Tessa parks her car without regard to interdictions, can drive a speedboat, is a poor chess player and dislikes war.|$|E

2500|$|In 1856, Semmelweis's {{assistant}} Josef Fleischer {{reported the}} successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity {{institutions in the}} Viennese Medical Weekly (Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift). The editor remarked sarcastically {{that it was time}} people stopped being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled [...] "The Etiology of Childbed Fever". Two years later, he published a second essay, [...] "The Difference in Opinion between <b>Myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever". In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers (German for [...] "The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever"). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: [...] "Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected".|$|E

2500|$|On 1 January 1917, Haig {{was made}} a field marshal. The King (George V) wrote him a {{handwritten}} note ending: [...] "I hope you will look upon this as a New Year's gift from <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country". Lloyd George, who had become Prime Minister in December 1916, infuriated Haig and Robertson by placing the BEF {{under the command of}} the new French Commander-in-Chief Robert Nivelle, at a stormy conference at Calais. The failure of the Nivelle Offensive in April 1917 (which Haig had been required to support with a British offensive by the Third and First Armies at Arras) and the subsequent French mutiny and political crisis, discredited Lloyd George's plans for Anglo-French co-operation for the time being. During the second half of 1917, Haig conducted an offensive at Passchendaele (the Third Battle of Ypres). Haig hoped to break through and liberate the North Sea coast of Belgium from which German U-Boats were operating, provided that there was assistance from the French, support from Britain and that Russia stayed in the war.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, [...] Kovel was {{appointed}} Alger Hiss Chair of Social Studies, a non-tenured position, at Bard College. In February 2009, he {{was informed that}} his position would not be renewed after the contract ended on June 20, 2009 {{and that he would}} be moved to [...] "emeritus" [...] status at that time. Kovel argued in a letter sent to the faculty of Bard College that his contract was not renewed due to his political views. He reiterated his argument in a statement posted on his official website that the [...] "termination of service is prejudicial and [...] motivated neither by intellectual nor pedagogic considerations, but by [...] political values, principally stemming from differences between <b>myself</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bard administration on the issue of Zionism". The college president, Leon Botstein, responded in a letter sent directly to Kovel by arguing that his termination was not political but part of a larger move by Bard to reduce part-time faculty. Botstein stated: [...] "To take what is self-evidently a result of economic constraint {{and turn it into a}} trumped-up case of prejudice and political victimization insults not only your intelligence but the intelligence of your readers." [...] While Kovel called his dismissal illegitimate and vowed to fight the decision, he did leave Bard permanently per the university's decision in 2009.|$|E
