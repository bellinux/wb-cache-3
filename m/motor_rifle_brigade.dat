5|$|The {{following}} day, {{the corps}} shifted northwest to capture Otrada, cutting the MtsenskOryol highway in the Vysokoye area. In the evening, the 52nd <b>Motor</b> <b>Rifle</b> <b>Brigade</b> crossed the Oka River, capturing a bridgehead near Novaya Slobodka. By {{the end of}} 21 July, the corps arrived to assist the 12th Tank Corps and the 91st Separate Tank Brigade in the crossing of the Optushka River, delayed by intense German air attacks and tank counterattacks. On the next morning, all three units began crossing the river. The 195th Tank Brigade's commander, Vasily Lomakin, was killed in action while leading his unit on 22July. Both Chigin and Lomakin were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. On 23 July, the German defenses on the Optushka were broken, and the pursuit began. By {{the end of the}} day, the corps had reached the line of Semendyaevsky, Karpovsky, Aleksandrovka, Safonovo, and Neplyuevo.|$|E
5|$|The corps was {{reformed}} in May 1942 at the Moscow Armored Training Center, {{nearly a}} year after Germany had abandoned the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Major General Vasily Koptsov took command of the formation, which included the 96th and 113th Tank Brigades, the 105th Heavy Tank Brigade, the 17th <b>Motor</b> <b>Rifle</b> <b>Brigade,</b> and the 5th Reconnaissance Battalion. On 25May it {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Tank Army, and on 2 June included 30 KV tanks, 60 T-34 tanks, and 60 T-60 light tanks, for a total of 150. In early June, the corps concentrated in the Tula area {{with the rest of the}} army, conducting intensive training exercises. After Axis forces launched the Case Blue summer offensive in southern Russia in late June, Stavka believed that an attack by Army Group Centre on the Oryol axis was possible, and ordered the army to concentrate in the Yefremov area. On 6 July, the army was ordered to concentrate to the west in the Chern area, moving closer to the front. The relocation was completed by 9 July, and the 15th Tank Corps was positioned in the area of the Agnichnoye State Farm, Dupny, Bolshoy Kon, Gremyachevo, Yasnyy Lug, and Korotky, where they engaged in combat training and created a defensive line in readiness to repulse a German attack. In late July, the 96th Brigade was transferred to the Bryansk Front, and it was replaced by the 195th Tank Brigade between 10 and 12 August.|$|E
5|$|The renewed attack {{began on}} 2 September and was delayed due to German air attacks, and a {{regiment}} from the 264th Rifle Division {{was unable to}} cross the Vytebet River and capture the village of Ozhigovo, which was necessary for the 15th Corps to exploit the breakthrough, forcing Koptsov to commit the 17th <b>Motor</b> <b>Rifle</b> <b>Brigade</b> and the 113th and 195th Brigades' motor rifle battalions to the battle. The motor rifle units crossed the Vytebet River after a short artillery preparation and captured Ozhigovo {{by the end of}} the day. The 195th Brigade's tank battalions moved across the Vytebet River and attacked Perestryazh on the next day, but were unable to capture the village because they were first halted by a ravine covered by German artillery, and then were counterattacked on their left flank by 40 German tanks. Although they repulsed the counterattack and destroyed 13 tanks, the 195th's advance was stopped. On 4 September, after the 3rd Tank Corps was pulled out of the line due to losses and the main forces of the 264th arrived to hold Ozhigovo, the 15th's 17th and 113th Brigades were moved to the Volosovo area, having received orders to advance on Trostyanka alongside the 342nd Rifle Division. From 5 to 9 September the corps attempted to advance, but was repeatedly repulsed, sustaining casualties and suffering fuel and ammunition shortages. The Kozelsk Offensive ended on 9 September with the combined Soviet tank units from all three armies left with only 200 tanks out of the 700 they originally fielded.|$|E
