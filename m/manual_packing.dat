Group 1 (155 knees) was treated with ir-rigation of the bone surfaces with a syringe and <b>manual</b> <b>packing</b> of the bone cement. Group 2 (sixty-one knees) had high-volume, high-pressure lavage of the bone sur-faces and <b>manual</b> <b>packing</b> of the cement. Group 3 (147 knees) had high-volume, high-pressure lavage and pressure injection of low-viscosity methylmethacrylate cement. Radiolucency was evaluated at each follow-up interval, and the findings were subjected to chi-square analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis...|$|E
40|$|The MPI Standard {{supports}} derived datatypes, {{which allow}} users to describe noncontiguous memory layout and communicate noncontiguous data {{with a single}} communication function. This feature enables an MPI implementation to optimize the transfer of noncontiguous data. In practice, however, few MPI implementations implement derived datatypes {{in a way that}} performs better than what the user can achieve by manually packing data into a contiguous buffer and then calling an MPI function. In this paper, we present a technique for improving the performance of derived datatypes by automatically using packing algorithms that are optimized for memoryaccess cost. The packing algorithms use memory-optimization techniques that the user cannot apply easily without advanced knowledge of the memory architecture. We present performance results for a matrix-transpose example that demonstrate that our implementation of derived datatypes significantly outperforms both <b>manual</b> <b>packing</b> by the user and the existing deriveddatatype code in the MPI implementation (MPICH) ...|$|E

40|$|MPI derived datatype is a {{powerful}} method to define arbitrary collections of non-contiguous data in memory and to enable non-contiguous data communication in a single MPI function call. It can be expected that MPI derived datatypes could become a key aid in application development. In practice, however, users prefer packing and unpacking data in contiguous buffers manually. This usage actually defeats the purpose of having derived datatypes in the MPI standard. In this paper, we employ MPI datatypes in four NAS benchmarks (MG, LU, BT, and SP) to transfer noncontiguous data. Comprehensive performance evaluation was carried out on two clusters: an Itanium- 2 Myrinet cluster and a Xeon InfiniBand cluster. Performance results show that using datatypes can achieve performance comparable to manual packing/unpacking in the original benchmarks, though the studied MPI implementations also perform internal packing and unpacking on non-contiguous datatype communication. In some cases, better performance can be achieved because of the optimizations in the MPI packing/unpacking implementations which are easily overlooked in <b>manual</b> <b>packing</b> and unpacking by users. In addition, our results also show that using datatypes can reduce application development effort significantly. Our case study demonstrates that user packing and unpacking are prone to performance degradation. MPI datatype is an easy-to-use and efficient way to transfer noncontiguous data in MPI applications. We expect that with further improvement of datatype processing and datatype communication such as [9, 22], datatypes can outperform the conventional methods of non-contiguous data communication. Our modified NAS benchmarks {{can be used to}} evaluate datatype processing and datatype communication in MPI implementations...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about educating the packing {{engineers}} at Scania to their best potential. The education {{is made by}} developing an E-course adapted specially for the packing engineers at Scania. Content of the E-course was defined through analysis of literature, science articles and interviews with the packing engineers it was also decided from analysis. Reason why the packing engineers needed this education is because the packing engineers decisions has {{a big impact on}} the company. So it is therefore important that the packing engineers consider different parameters when deciding how the final package should look. One way to improve the packing engineers work is by the virtual packing software Pack-Assistant which is used to pack CAD-files, which is much more quicker then <b>manual</b> <b>packing</b> and efficient. The main purpose with this thesis is to investigate which parameters has to be taken in to consideration for the most efficient packing (and what is efficient from different perspectives). How do packaging influence logistic and vice versa and how to adapt the E-course in the most optimal way. The projects main purpose was to study different E-course educational methods, analysis of how Pack-Assistant works, observation of packages in Scania, experiments was conducted to see how real packages differ when the same parts was simulated in Pack-Assistant. Where it was concluded that Pack-Assistant was a more pack efficient {{for the majority of the}} tested parts. From the comparison it was also concluded that Scania could save 13 % of their freight cost, container cost and internal handling cost just from packing in Pack-Assistant. One other major result from the analysis is that packing engineers prefer to pack the number of parts with even “nice” numbers like 10, 20, 50, 100, etc. Which is a great problem economically for Scania, sometimes it is more efficient to pack with 11 parts instead of 10 parts. It was also observed how the setting in Pack-Assistant had for effect on the packing and also in which circumstances to use the different packing structures in the software. When the course was finish the main subjects is The packaging working process, number of parts in the package, package handle ability and packing structure. The course consist of two parts:Part 1 : Which different parameters to consider in the making of packing instructions. Part 2 : How to use the software Pack-Assistant and what in the software is of great importance for the packing engineer at Scania. Validerat; 20151214 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|Data packing {{before and}} after {{communication}} can make {{up as much as}} 90 % of the communication time on modern computers. Despite MPI’s well-defined datatype interface for non-contiguous data access, many codes use <b>manual</b> <b>pack</b> loops for performance reasons. Programmers write accesspattern specific pack loops (e. g., do manual unrolling) for which compilers emit optimized code. In contrast, MPI implementations in use today interpret datatypes at pack time, resulting in high overheads. In this work we explore the effectiveness of using runtime compilation techniques to generate efficient and optimized pack code for MPI datatypes at commit time. Thus, none of the overhead of datatype interpretation is incurred at pack time and pack setup is as fast as calling a function pointer. We have implemented a library called libpack {{that can be used to}} compile and (un) pack MPI datatypes. The library optimizes the datatype representation and uses the LLVM framework to produce vectorized machine code for each datatype at commit time. We show several examples of how MPI datatype pack functions benefit from runtime compilation and analyze the performance of compiled pack functions for the data access patterns in many applications. We show that the pack/unpack functions generated by our packing library are seven times faster than those of prevalent MPI implementations for 73 % of the datatypes used in a scientific application and in many cases outperform <b>manual</b> <b>pack</b> loops. 1...|$|R
25|$|In 1940 Commonwealth {{troops in}} Egypt and North Africa were issued {{commercial}} model Lend-Lease Colt- and Savage-manufactured M1928s. Section leaders carried them instead of pistols or rifles. Many of the Colt models had French-language <b>manuals</b> <b>packed</b> {{with them as}} they had been abruptly diverted to England after the fall of France. They soon discovered that the weapon was prone to jamming due to sand. To fix this, the armorers removed the Blish Lock and replaced it with a hex bolt to keep the cocking handle and bolt together. The 20-round Type XX magazines had their peep-holes welded shut to keep sand out and the 50-round Type L drums were discontinued. Ammunition was scarce as it was either in small lots of Lend-Lease commercial ammo or obtained from adjacent American troops. It was later replaced by the 9mm Sten gun and Lanchester SMG.|$|R

However, species-specific reference intervals are required for maximal information {{to be gained from}} any haematological assessment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the haematological characteristics for a population of southern brown bandicoots (isoodon obesulus), a small marsupial common, across southern Australia.

Southern brown bandicoots were found to have similar leukocytes and erythrocytes to those previously described for other species of bandicoots, and the measured values for the haematological analytes were similar to those previously published for the species. For most analytes there were no statistically significant differences observed between males and females, and lactating and non-lactating animals. The observed values for each of the analytes in the current study may be used to aid in the detection of disease and monitoring of health in wild and captive populations of bandicoots...|$|R
40|$|Haematological {{assessment}} often {{forms an}} important part of the diagnosis of disease in wildlife, as animals may not exhibit clinical signs until late in the disease process to avoid appearing vulnerable to predators.

The blood was assessed by microscopy, <b>manual</b> techniques (<b>packed</b> cell volume, total solids and fibrinogen) and using an automated haematology analyser. Most (6 / 8) animals had evidence of an inflammatory response, in the form of an increased concentration of leukocytes. However, a few (2 / 8) animals had an increased concentration of fibrinogen, indicating that this is an inconsistent marker of inflammation in bandicoots. Anaemia was present in 2 / 8 animals and these both had a regenerative response evident.

40|$|The {{design work}} that precedes the {{automation}} {{of a process}} {{is not an easy}} job. Each one of the variables and possible risks involved in process must be carefully considered before implement the final design as well the requirements in performance and cost. However automate a dangerous, inefficient or just uncomfortable task entails many benefits that make up for the long period of design process. A well automated line will benefit the production with quality, productivity and capacity among other profits. In this project the immediate objective is to automate the “SANDFLEX Hacksaw blades” packaging process in the plant that SNAEurope owns in Lidköping. Actually the <b>packing</b> is completely <b>manual.</b> One operator <b>packs</b> the blades into the boxes meanwhile one more operator loads and unloads the packing station with empty and full boxes respectively. The task is both, tiring and uncomfortable for the operators as well inefficient for the company since the production rate is limited. Analyzing and observing carefully product and process, different theories and strategies to achieve the goal were developed. Three are the possible solutions to solve the problem, with different levels of automation and technologies. The robotic solution uses an articulated robot to perform all the tasks; the hybrid solution uses pneumatic devices to pack the blades and an articulated robot to support the station loading and unloading the boxes. Finally the pneumatic solution uses only pneumatic devices, which hold, open and close, push box and blades using airpower; a few sensors detect positions and states, since a PLC coordinates and controls all process. By means of discussing these solutions with the company’s engineers and workers, after a deep literature study and two test of performance, was it possible to select the most suitable solution to accomplish the packaging task. The pneumatic solution is cheap and simple, {{but at the same time}} robust and reliable. This design performs the packaging task efficiently and fast. And more important, the operator passes from pack manually the blades to monitor the process...|$|R
