25|$|My {{sense of}} duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown {{pathological}} state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines.

2500|$|Regarding {{the general}} notion of {{consistency}} of political positions over time, McCain said in June 2008: [...] "My principles and <b>my</b> <b>practice</b> and my voting record are very clear.

Look, none of my principles or values have changed. Have I changed position on some specific issues because of changed circumstances? I would hope so! I would hope so!" [...] It is often reported that McCain has grown more conservative throughout his tenure in the Senate, according to various studies.|$|E
2500|$|The nirmānakāya of an awoken-field {{is what is}} {{generally}} known and understood as a mandala. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: maṇḍala) is an active prayer.

2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up until I had my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made <b>my</b> <b>practice</b> very rich.|$|E
2500|$|Ngũgĩ {{describes}} {{the book as}} [...] "a summary {{of some of the}} issues in which I have been passionately involved for the last twenty years of <b>my</b> <b>practice</b> in fiction, theatre, criticism, and in teaching of literature..." [...] Decolonising the Mind is split into four essays: [...] "The Language of African Literature," [...] "The Language of African Theatre," [...] "The Language of African Fiction," [...] and [...] "The Quest for Relevance." [...] Several of the book's chapters originated as lectures, and apparently this format gave Ngũgĩ [...] "the chance to pull together in a connected and coherent form the main issues on the language question in literature...." [...] The book offers a distinctly anti-imperialist perspective on the [...] "continuing debate...about the destiny of Africa" [...] and language's role in both combatting and perpetrating imperialism and the conditions of neocolonialism in African nations. The book is also Ngũgĩ's [...] "farewell to English," [...] and it addresses the [...] "language problem" [...] for African authors. Ngũgĩ focuses on questions about the African writer's linguistic medium (should one write in one's indigenous language, or a hegemonic language like French or English?), the writer's intended audience, and the writer's purpose in writing.|$|E

The period of time that I write about (1973 - 1985) and the location (Toronto) is one where thinking, action and art making appeared to collide with a pronounced ontological need—a moment whose paradoxes make it a compelling site for <b>my</b> own artistic <b>practice</b> to ground itself...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore {{the ways in}} which my {{intellectual}} immersion in Paul Ricoeur’s distinctive critical hermeneutics has shaped <b>my</b> teaching <b>practice.</b> Like many academics, <b>my</b> teaching <b>practice</b> has evolved through practice rather than the application of formal schemas, and the principles underlying {{it for a long time}} remained implicit. As changing student demographics have brought the need for more explicit attention to fundamental academic language and learning skills to the fore, my efforts to embed ALL skills have prompted a reflection on the principles which have informed <b>my</b> intuitive <b>practices.</b> This reflection has brought to light both the Ricoeurian hermeneutical principles which have already, albeit implicitly, shaped my teaching, and those which might profitably be incorporated. I draw out some implications for teaching to be drawn from his reworking of the ‘hermeneutical circle’ into the notion of the ‘conflict of interpretations’, his notion of the interplay of innovation and tradition, and his take on the relation between understanding and being...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 	This thesis {{contains}} {{research on}} my artistic challenge to find deeper connectivity through full-body resonant listening {{as an actor}} in Joan Littlewood’s play Oh What a Lovely War. It documents my research on <b>my</b> mind/body artistic <b>practice,</b> Joan Littlewood, Mindfulness, The Great War, Charlie Chaplin, corporal resonance, and the further development of my visceral approach to theatre. Selected journal entries demonstrate the application of my research in rehearsals and performances. They reflect <b>my</b> <b>practices,</b> processes, observations, and applications (successful and unsuccessful) during my research. My anticipated outcome is the attainment of full-body listening and a deeper connection with others and my immediate environment. After a detailed investigation of my artistic challenge in multiple applications, I was able to achieve a state of what I refer to as a porous presence and availability. I believe I was successful in finding deeper attunement and connection when listening with resonant full-body awareness...|$|R
