25|$|There {{is concern}} that insertional {{mutagenesis}} due to {{integration into the}} host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia. This concern remained theoretical until gene therapy for ten SCID-X1 patients using Maloney <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> resulted in two cases of leukemia caused by activation of the LMO2 oncogene due to nearby integration of the vector.|$|E
25|$|Retroviruses {{are one of}} the mainstays {{of current}} gene therapy approaches. The {{recombinant}} retroviruses such as the Moloney <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> have the ability to integrate into the host genome in a stable fashion. They contain a reverse transcriptase that allows integration into the host genome. They have been used in a number of FDA-approved clinical trials such as the SCID-X1 trial.|$|E
40|$|Although xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> cannot productively infect {{cells of}} {{laboratory}} mice, cells from various wild-derived mice can support replication of these viruses. Although the virus-sensitive wild mice generally lack {{all or most}} of the xenotropic proviral genes characteristic of inbred strains, susceptibility to exogenous infection is unrelated to inheritance of these sequences. Instead, susceptibility is controlled by a single dominant gene, designated Sxv, which maps to chromosome 1. Sxv is closely linked to, but distinct from Bxv- 1, the major locus for induction of xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> in laboratory mice. Genetic experiments designed to characterize Sxv show that this gene also controls sensitivity to a wild mouse virus with the interference properties of mink cell focus-forming <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses,</b> and that Sxv-mediated susceptibility to xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> is restricted by the mink cell focus-forming virus resistance gene Rmcf. These data, together with genetic mapping of the mink cell focus-forming virus cell surface receptor locus to this same region of chromosome 1, suggest that Sxv may encode a wild mouse variant of the mink cell focus-forming virus receptor that allows penetration by xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distinct type-specific antigens were {{detected}} on cells infected with cloned mink cell focus-inducing (MCF) <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> {{by means of}} cell surface immunofluorescence absorption assays with rabbit antisera raised against naturally-occurring AKR MCF viruses. The MCF type-specific antibodies were present in high titer and not absorbable by cells infected with ecotropic, xenotropic, or wild mouse amphotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses,</b> or combinations of ecotropic and xenotropic viruses. Three MCF subtype-specific reactions were identified. One subspecificity (operationally designated MCFA- 1) defined antigenic determinant(s) distributed among MCF viruses in general. Another (MCFA- 2) specified determinant(s) induced by all naturally occurring MCF isolates not of Friend or Moloney origin. A third subspecificity (MCFA- 3) was induced by some MCF isolates, and not by others; {{the presence of this}} antigen did not correlate with the source of any presently known biological property of the viruses. In addition, type-specific antigenic determinants of ecotropic and xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> were expressed on MCF virus-infected cells. The serological profile of MCF viruses thus supports the contention that they are env gene recombinants between ecotropic and xenotropic <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses.</b> However, new, distinct MCF-specific determinants are also generated, and these could be useful markers in studying MCF viruses...|$|R

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster abl and the murine v-abl genes encode {{tyrosine}} protein kinases (TPKs) whose {{amino acid}} sequences are highly conserved. To assess functional conservation {{between the two}} gene products, we constructed Drosophila abl/v-abl-chimeric Abelson <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses.</b> In these chimeric Abelson <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses,</b> the TPK and carboxy-terminal regions of v-abl were replaced with the corresponding regions of D. melanogaster abl. The chimeric Abelson <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>viruses</b> were able to mediate morphological and oncogenic transformation of NIH 3 T 3 cells {{and were able to}} abrogate the interleukin- 3 dependence of a lymphoid cell line. We also found that a virus that contained both TPK and carboxy-terminal Drosophila abl regions had no in vitro transforming activity for primary bone marrow cells and lacked the ability to induce tumors in susceptible mice. A virus that replaced only a portion of the v-abl TPK region with that of Drosophila abl had low activity in in vitro bone marrow transformation and tumorigenesis assays. These results indicate that the transforming functions of abl TPKs are only partially conserved through evolution. These results also imply that the TPK region of v-abl is a major determinant of its efficient lymphoid cell-transforming activity...|$|R

50|$|Myricetin {{has been}} seen to {{demonstrate}} antiviral activity against a number of viruses including Moloney <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus,</b> Rauscher <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus,</b> and the human immunodeficiency virus. Its effects against the proliferation of viruses {{is thought to be}} a consequence of myricetinâs ability to inhibit the proper functioning of reverse transcriptase. Myricetin was identified as a competitive inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase of Rauscher <b>murine</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>virus</b> and a partial competitor with respect to the human immunodeficiency virus. Investigations into the activity of the HIV-1 strain when introduced to myricetin suggest the antiviral effects are derived from the inhibition of HIV-1 integrase, however, there are suspicions that the inhibition is non-specific. Structural analysis of myricetin and other flavonoids with observed antiviral effects indicate that the 3,4â free hydroxyl groups likely are responsible for inhibition.|$|E

Cell-free filtrates prepared from the spleens of these animals were injected into newborn dogs, mice, and rats. The canine recipients developed antinuclear antibody (ANA) and positive lupus erythematosus (LE) cell tests: ANA and, in some cases, antinative DNA antibodies were produced by the murine recipients: no abnormalities were detected in the rats. Serial passage of spleen cells or cell-free filtrates of spleen tissue in syngeneic mice reduced the time required for appearance of ANA from 9 to 4 mo.
