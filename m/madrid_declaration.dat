Amongst bewilderment of the Right he decided to defend the monarchist cause standing in the forthcoming Cortes elections as a Jaimist candidate in Madrid. His campaign confronted the anti-clerical and anti-religious tide head on: Larramendi referred to the Church as to a truly popular structure, with priests and friars [...] "la sangre del pueblo más humilde de España". With his propaganda machine reduced to some 30 members of the Madrid Círculo Jaimista [...] he gathered some 7,500 votes, compared to 134,000 votes for the leading candidate and 36,000 for the last candidate elected.|$|R
50|$|Florida withdrew to privacy, {{in public}} noted for charity and glamour of aristocratic societé. Resident of Madrid, he was {{spending}} strings at his La Florida property in Teruel and in estates in Valencia. Fascinated by cars he managed a Sitges circuit, excelled in Real Automovil Club and co-ran a tourist review; owner of a new Buick, he was fined for excessive driving until his car was stolen. Excluding landholding properties, he lived off a number of enterprises; apart from construction company {{he was president of}} Sociedad Española de Talcos and Compañia de Seguros Omnia. During dictablanda Dolz renewed political endeavors. In May 1930 he was received by Alfonso XIII. Against the rising Republican tide he stood on monarchist ground, cultivating old-style patriotism. Having joined Unión Monárquica Nacional, in April 1931 he ran on its ticket in elections for the <b>Madrid</b> ayuntamiento.Upon <b>declaration</b> of the Republic Florida tried to transfer his capital abroad. Apprehended by the customs service he was detained and possibly suffered forfeiture of some of the assets smuggled. At unspecified time he returned to Carlist loyalty by entering Comunión Tradicionalista, which in 1932 re-joined the former Jaimistas, Integristas and Mellistas. In 1933 he was appointed its Jefe Regional of Castilla La Nueva. Despite holding a theoretically prestigious position, Florida did not seem particularly active; he was seldom recorded as speaking at party meetings and historians almost do not mention his name when discussing Carlist activities during the Republic. It is not clear what his position was on controversial question of alliances with other monarchist and Right-wing groupings or on internal leadership rivalry between Conde de Rodezno and Manuel Fal. In 1935 the latter triggered his nomination to Junta de Hacienda, a body entrusted with organizing funds for the Comunión.|$|R

40|$|The {{reporting}} {{of child sexual}} abuse (CSA) and physician-patient sexual relationships (PPSR) are currently the focus of professional, legal and media attention in several countries. This paper briefly reviews mental health policies on these issues and reports on a WPA survey of them. While the WPA <b>Madrid</b> <b>Declaration</b> permits breaching confidentiality for mandatory {{reporting of}} CSA and clearly prohibits PPSR, it is not known how or to what extent these policies are implemented in WPA Member Societies’ countries. It is also not known whether policies or laws exist on these topics nationally or to what extent psychiatrists and the public are aware of them. Representatives of WPA Member Societies were e-mailed a survey about issues pertaining to CSA and PPSR. Fifty-one percent of 109 countries replied. All reporting countries had laws or policies regarding the reporting of CSA, but this was often voluntary (63 %) and without protection for reporting psychiatrists either by law (29 %) or by Member Societies (27 %). A substantial number of psychiatric leaders did not know the law (27 %) or their Society’s policy (11 %) on these matters. With respect to PPSR, some reporting countries lacked laws or policies about PPSR with current (17 %) or past (56 %) patients. Fewer than half of responding representatives believed that their Society’s members or the public were well informed about the laws and policies pertaining to CSA or PPSR. There is clearly a wide range of laws, policies and practices about CSA and PPSR in WPA Member Societies’ countries. There is a need in some countries for laws or supplemental policies to facilitate the protection of vulnerable child and adult patients through clear, mandatory reporting policies for CSA and PPSR. Mechanisms to protect and support reporting psychiatrists should also be developed where they do not already exist. There is also a need in some countries to develop strategies to improve the education of psychiatrists, trainees, and the public on these issues...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{from the}} Convention on Rights for Persons with Disabilities, our {{research}} seeks to outline {{the accessibility of}} academic settings and language for all students. Although the aforementioned Convention ratifies (article 24) that “States Parties shall ensure an inclusive education system at all levels and lifelong learning”– in order to realize the right of persons with disabilities to be educated “without discrimination and {{on the basis of}} equal opportunity”, not all the Italian universities can state being inclusive and promoting the accessibility for disabled students. For this reason, we are researching the Italian academic commitment (Santi & Ghedin, 2012) towards inclusiveness (italics our), focusing our attention on the universities of the region Lazio. The main purpose is proposing solution which could make the university an inclusive environment, because – following the 2002 <b>Madrid</b> <b>Declaration</b> – we believe “that education system ensures personal development and social inclusion to make children and young people as independent as possible” (Caldin & Friso, 2016 : 35, our own translation). This is obviously very important to ensure an independent life in all kind of situations and contexts. Inclusion seems therefore to be the correct path to be followed in order to reduce distance between people and prevent phenomena of exclusion, even though sometimes the research of inclusion creates itself events of macro/micro-exclusion (D’Alessio, 2013). Hence, the solution is rethinking academic settings – and more generally education and social system – from a new point of view and not from a ‘medicalized’ one. Disability Studies’ perspective (and more specifically Disability Studies in Education and the Independent Living Movement) seems to be the right path to an inclusive education, since it perceives disability not in the person but in the society and in the way society is constructed. Moreover, Disability Studies in Education postulates the idea of building a priori the context {{in a way that it}} can be enjoyed by all students, because of the possibility to meet disabled people or all that part of population identified as Special Educational Needs. Here fits our research that aims to a) outline the current situation about accessibility of the academic settings and language used in the Italian university and b) propose solutions to make university an inclusive environment...|$|E
40|$|The present {{doctoral}} work {{finds its}} motivation in a deficiency and an intent. The deficiency (and, in certain countries, even absence) regards {{the availability of}} Tactile Illustrated Books (TIB); tactile picture books, created for children of pre-school age {{who are blind or}} with visual impairment. The Baby Infant Tactile Illustrated Books (BITIB) Group attempts to address such shortage by developing prototypes of some such books. One of these book prototypes was entrusted to the University for evaluation of some of its characteristics, with the aim of receiving feedback useful to determine necessary adjustments in view of a large publication run. The aim of the present research is, therefore, to contribute to the qualitative improvement of this editorial product (which it is desired should transcend the specialist editorial niche to become a book for all) further elaborating operative instructional details for its reading as a joint activity between child and adult (whether educator or parent). The indicator used for research are the questions formulated by children of pre-school age who are blind or with visual impairment during reading. Therefore, the present research explore the joint activity of reading a TIB by an adult and child, understood as context for the manifestation of questions {{on the part of the}} child. The First Part contextualises the research within a wider framework, composed of references originating in scientific literature, in legislation as well as from reflections expressed by professionals working with blind or visually impaired children on a daily basis. Starting from an unavoidable introduction to visual impairment, we analysed how reading and books contributed to the developing literacy of children who are blind or with visual impairment, elaborating a role of cognitive and affective mediation. The interesting thematic of mental images in subjects with visual impairment introduces the importance of reading tactile illustrated books, especially if realised within the transactional format of joint reading between adult and child. There follows then the focus of the research, namely the thematic (scarcely explored in the literature) of the questions formulated by children in general, and children with visual impairment in particular; conscious that "there is no better introduction to a child's logic than the study of his spontaneous questions" (Piaget). In the second section we report the research results, involving 33 children aged between 2 and 6 years who are blind or with partial sight/visual impairment, their educators and parents in the reading of a TIB, which took place on the premises of the Fondazione Hollman in Padua and Cannero Riviera. First, the differences between subgroups defined by a selection of variables from the reference group (extent of visual impairment, presence or absence of additional impairments, sex) were explored; such differences regard the percentage/proportion of questions expressed and their distribution, in the succession of video recordings and the different categories by content (analysis of variables) Secondly, an analysis of content relating to some of the elements present in the TIB (tactile illustration, character, writing in traditional print and Braille) was carried out, with the purpose to also return to the BITIB Group and the publisher Les Doigts Qui RÃªvent some useful reflections for the purpose of adjusting the content of the book in view of its wider publication. The analysis results for single variables highlight that children in subgroups further compromised by their disability (blind versus visually impaired, children with additional disability versus those without) ask a higher proportion of questions compared to children less compromised by their disability (visually impaired versus blind, children without additional disability versus those with). It emerges, further, that rereading the book after a six months interval reignites the questioning behaviour in the subgroups further compromised by their disability (blind versus visually impaired, children with additional disability versus those without), but not in those in subgroups less compromised by their disability (visually impaired versus blind, children without additional disability versus those with). Finally, in the analysis of distribution of codes in the content categories, we found that children more compromised by their visual impairment (blind) formulate proportionally more questions than less compromised children (visually impaired), mostly in the Information and Relationship categories. Considering, instead, additional disability; children with additional disability formulated proportionally more questions than children without additional disability, mostly in the Information and Relationship categories. Further exploration, obtained by cross tabulation of the two variables "visual deficit" and "additional deficit", highlighted that the overall percentage of questions was highest for blind children without additional disability, to then decrease in the subgroup of visually impaired children with additional disability, blind children with additional disability and, lastly, visually impaired children without additional disability. Analyses of the distribution of questions between the four subgroups, in the four video recordings, led us to the hypothesis that, in the absence of additional disability, the variable level of gravity of visual impairment may influence the number of questions asked, but have not much influence on their distribution in the four video recordings. From the analysis of contents, there emerged several pointers for the revision of the book, destined to the BITIB Group and the publisher Les Doigts Qui RÃªvent: the main one is always to research the maximum possible level of correspondence between the adjectives used in the text to define the materials of which the images are composed ("rough", "cold", "spiky") and the actual tactile sensation they transmit to the children. The children should be involved in the research, giving them the means to express opinion and disagreement, also through the formulation of questions. To conclude, from the present research arises the following intent: to paraphrase the <b>Madrid</b> <b>Declaration</b> of 2002, "no tactile books for visually impaired children without the contribution of visually impaired children". Such contribution can be achieved also through the questions, which represent a valuable form of active participation of the child to the reading of the TIB which, in its guise of mediator, facilitates the relational exchange with the adult...|$|E
