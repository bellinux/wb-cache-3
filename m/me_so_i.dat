Gomez {{did not attend the}} scheduled pre-fight press conference, prompting Khan to deride him, and promoter Frank Warren accused Gomez of failing to show respect to Khan and the media.|$|E
500|$|People {{have been}} wanting me to release {{something}} specifically for country radio for years, but I didn't {{want to just}} release something that has a steel guitar on it [...] I wanted to release something I'm proud of, and we finally found that song. It's my favorite kind of country music; it's like 1980s, 1990s country music, that throwback, two-steppin' style. And I'm freakin' stoked I got Vince Gill to sing on it with <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> win 'cause he's like {{one of my favorite}} people.|$|E
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, I was extremely happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E

500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Nader {{was fired}} from All My Children in July 1999, due to budget considerations, and Dimitri was killed off. This led to a fan outcry from viewers who campaigned for the actor's return. To {{partially}} appease them, the show's executive producer, Jean Dadario Burke, offered Nader his job back on a recurring basis. He rejected this offer because [...] "after being a major character for so long, it didn't {{make any sense to}} <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> declined. But if the network was interested in seriously discussing Dimitri's return on a contract basis I would love to go back." ...|$|E
500|$|Although vocals {{would usually}} take many {{alternate}} takes to complete, Hoppus completed {{much of the}} vocal track for [...] "Adam's Song" [...] in a single take. [...] "It's in a pretty high register for <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> just blasted it out one night after dinner. That's, like, 90 per cent of what's on the final track," [...] he told Kerrang!. The idea to include piano in the track came without much forethought; [...] "We realized, 'Well, this part here could sound rad if we put piano in here.' So we tried it out, and it sounded rad," [...] said Hoppus. The piano was performed by session musician Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., {{best known for his}} work with Beck.|$|E

[...] Da Brat responded to Minaj by tweeting: [...] "Nicki nor Mariah has ever disrespected <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> would not disrespect either of them."

500|$|Shostakovich's musical {{response}} to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece, [...] "To the victims of fascism and war", ostensibly {{in memory of the}} Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman [...] "I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> had better write one myself." [...] Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky, were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent.|$|E
500|$|Subsequent to the announcement, John's husband, David Furnish, opined on his {{personal}} Facebook page that [...] "Madonna winning Best Original Song truly shows how these awards {{have nothing to do}} with merit".

He's brilliant and I adore him so he'll win another award. I don't feel bad!"

500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to <b>me,</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea.

500|$|During the 1980s, many Japanese {{corporations}} {{relied on}} investments to bolster dwindling profits, particularly in its exports {{which had been}} eroded by a strong yen. Toshiro Shimoyama, Olympus president from 1984 to 1993, admitted to the Nikkei industrial daily newspaper in 1986: [...] "When the main business is struggling, we need to earn through zaitech" [...] (meaning [...] ). Olympus invested in financial derivatives and other risky investments to boost profits. However, Shimoyama said he [...] "does not remember" [...] any attempt to conceal losses (tobashi) during his tenure as president: [...] "As president it wasn't the case where all financial reports would come to <b>me,</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have no memory. During that time Masatoshi Kishimoto was the treasurer ... I wouldn't have heard financial details." [...] Kishimoto, Olympus president from 1993 to 2001, in turn denied involvement in tobashi, and instead suggested possible implication of Hideo Yamada, whom he said he supervised poorly.|$|E
500|$|He {{signed a}} new one-year deal with Vale in July 2011, after Micky Adams {{returned}} to the club as manager. After scoring five goals in his first nine games he admitted that [...] "He [...] is the only manager that can control <b>me</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> think he gets {{the best out of}} me." [...] However, on 19 September he was given a fourteen-day suspension by the club for 'a serious breach of club discipline', after he missed a day of training without any warning and then 'reported in unfit to carry out his duties' the following day; Adams said [...] "I'm bitterly disappointed in him." [...] He was also placed on the transfer list, as Adams stated [...] "he's got a lot to do" [...] before Roberts could think about a return to the first team. He made his return on 24 October, when Adams named him on the bench for a league clash with Bristol Rovers.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about <b>me.</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C.

500|$|After 15 {{months of}} training, he began auditioning in Los Angeles. His first paid role was a {{television}} commercial for Pizza Hut, featuring a dancing Elvis Presley (who died 20 years prior.). He found guest roles on television shows but his first break came in 1999, {{after he was}} cast in a leading role on the short-lived but well-reviewed NBC television series Freaks and Geeks, which ran for 18 episodes and was canceled due to low viewership. Later, the show became a cult hit among audiences. He has since described the series as [...] "one of the most fun" [...] work experiences that he has had. In another interview, Franco said: [...] "When we were doing Freaks and Geeks, I didn’t quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn’t on <b>me...</b> <b>So</b> <b>I</b> was improvising a little bit back then, {{but not in a}} productive way."

I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences."
