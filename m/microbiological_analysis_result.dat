40|$|Background : Water is a {{fundamental}} human need. This {{is the basis for}} target 10, goal 7 of the Millennium Development Goals which sets to reduce the proportion of people without access to safe water by half by 2015. This study assessed the access to safe water supply in 22 riverine communities in the Niger delta region of Nigeria. Materials and Method : The study was carried out using a descriptive cross-sectional study design, with the data collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, field observations and focused group discussions. The questionnaire was administered to female heads of household, and used to collect information on the main source of drinking water, the time it took for the round trip to the main water sources, and methods used for the treatment of water of suspicious quality. An inventory of all the community water facilities in the communities was also taken, and information collected on the functionality of the facilities, and how they were constructed, operated and maintained. A sample of the water from each of the facilities was also collected in a sterile container for <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> : A total of 456 questionnaires were administered and retrieved. The most common source of drinking water was surface water (37. 9 %), and most (61. 2 %) of the water drawers spent less than 15 minutes to complete the round trip to the water sources. There were an average of 17 community water supply facilities, but only 23. 8 % of the facilities were functional during the study. Most of the functional facilities were being managed by community members. More than two third (67. 9 %) of the samples tested were found to contain significant numbers of Escherichia coli. Conclusion : The communities had easy access to water supply, but most of the facilities were either contaminated or nonfunctional.

40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} the microbial etiology and associated risk factors among patients with blebitis following trabeculectomy. Materials and Methods : A retrospective analysis of all culture-proven blebitis {{was performed in}} patients who underwent trabeculectomy between January 2004 and December 2008. A standardized form was filled out for each patient, documenting sociodemographic features and information pertaining to risk factors. Swabbing of the infected bleb surface was performed for all suspected cases and further subjected to <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> : A total of 23 patients with culture-proven blebitis were treated during the study period, {{with a mean age}} of 59. 2 years (59. 2 ± SD: 12. 8; range, 30 - 81 years). Duration of onset was early (≤ 36 months) in six (26 %) cases and late (> 36 months) in 17 (74 %) cases with a range between 15 and 144 months (mean, 82. 91 months; SD: 41. 89). All 23 blebs were located superiorly and of which, 21 (91 %) were microcystic avascular, 1 (4 %) diffuse avascular, and 1 (4 %) vascular flattened. The predominant risk factor identified was bleb leak (35 %; 8 of 23) followed by thin bleb (22 %; 5 of 23) and blepharitis (17 %; 4 of 23). Bleb leaks (100 %) were recorded only in patients with late onset (≥ 9 years) of infection (P< 0. 001), while the incidence of ocular surface disease (100 %) occurred early (≤ 3 years) (P< 0. 001). Use of topical steroids was associated frequently with cases of thin blebs (80 %; 4 of 5) (P< 0. 001), while topical antibiotics showed bleb leaks (88 %; 7 of 8) (P< 0. 001). Coagulase-positive staphylococci were frequently recovered from blebitis with thin blebs (71 %; 5 of 7) (P = 0. 001), Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) with bleb leak (100 %; 8 of 8) (P< 0. 001), Corynebacterium with blepharitis (100 %; 3 of 3) (P = 0. 001), and Streptococci with releasable sutures (75 %; 3 of 4) (P = 0. 001). Conclusion : Bleb leak is the principal risk factor responsible for late-onset blebitis, while early-onset blebitis could be ascribed to ocular surface diseases. Streptococci were mainly responsible for early onset of infection, while the late onset was due to CoNS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Simvastatin {{increases}} {{the expression of}} bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) in osteoblasts, therefore {{it is important to}} investigate the influence of statins on bone formation, fracture healing and implant integration. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effect of Simvastatin, locally applied from intramedullary coated and bioactive implants, on bone integration using biomechanical and histomorphometrical analyses. Methods Eighty rats received retrograde nailing of the femur with titanium implants: uncoated vs. polymer-only (poly(D,L-lactide)) vs. polymer plus drug coated (either Simvastatin low- or high dosed; “SIM low/ high”). Femurs were harvested after 56 days for radiographic and histomorphometric or biomechanical <b>analysis</b> (push-out). <b>Results</b> Radiographic <b>analysis</b> revealed no pathological findings for animals of the control and SIM low dose group. However, n= 2 / 10 animals of the SIM high group showed osteolysis next to the implant without evidence of bacterial infection determined by <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis.</b> Biomechanical <b>results</b> showed a significant decrease in fixation strength for SIM high coated implants vs. the control groups (uncoated and PDLLA). Histomorphometry revealed a significantly reduced total as well as direct bone/implant contact for SIM high- implants vs. controls (uncoated and PDLLA-groups). Total contact was reduced for SIM low vs. uncoated controls. Significantly reduced new bone formation was measured around SIM high coated implants vs. both control groups. Conclusions This animal study suggests impaired implant integration with local application of Simvastatin from intramedullary titanium implants after 8 weeks when compared to uncoated or carrier-only coated controls. </p...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the prevalence and distribution of Salmonella serotypes in 7 slaughterhouses, located in different areas of Naples province (Regione Campania, Italy). Meat samples collected from the slaughterhouses were submitted for standardized <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis</b> in 2015. <b>Results</b> of routine testing for Salmonella spp. were analyzed and then compared to biochemical and molecular evaluations. Salmonella spp. were detected in 12 % of 320 samples examined (39 / 320) and the isolation rates ranged from 87 % (32 samples) for raw poultry meat to 13 % (7 samples) for pork meat. Biochemical serotyping showed that approximately 50 % of the isolates belonged to Salmonella enterica serotype Choleraesuis. Rapid detection methods, such as molecular analysis (polymerase chain reaction and gel electrophoresis), able to confirm food matrices contamination, represent a valid support to the fast identification of Salmonella species. A further aspect of the study consisted, indeed, on analyzing isolated strains through molecular evaluations. By amplifying bacterial DNA-using invA primers, selective for Salmonella-it was possible, in less than 3 h, to classify the isolates as Salmonella spp., confirming the results of microbiological outcomes. <b>Results</b> of distribution <b>analysis,</b> supported by rapid molecular approaches, showed the difficulty of reducing Salmonella risk on food chain. This emphasized the importance of periodic surveillance to prevent outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Recently {{food-grade}} microemulsions {{have been}} of increasing interest to researchers and exhibited great potential on their industrial applications. The microbiological and quality characteristics of NuoMiGao, a traditional Chinese steamed rice cake, affected by a prepared food-grade monolaurin-containing microemulsion have been evaluated in this study. <b>Microbiological</b> <b>analysis</b> indicated that 0. 05 % microemulsion was comparable to 0. 01 % sodium dehydroacetate, extending the shelf-life by two days. The quality analysis showed that {{the addition of the}} microemulsion effectively prevented the hardening phenomena in rice cake; the lightness and yellowness were fairly stable while redness increased slightly (P< 0. 05); the lowered pH value and the prevention of moisture drop in rice cake were in agreement with the <b>microbiological</b> <b>analysis</b> and hardness trends...|$|R
