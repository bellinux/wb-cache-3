40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articlequires that a spirometric test be done as a regular health checkup for employees exposed to pulmonary hazards in the workplace, such as dust, <b>metal</b> fumes, oil <b>mist,</b> or organic solvents that can lead to some ventila-tory disorders like occupational asthma, chronic ob-structive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung disease. Some parameters measured during a FVC, and peak expiratory flow (PEF) [1]. A spirometric test is an effective and reliable diagnostic tool for asses-sing obstructive ventilatory disorders such as asthma or COPD by using FEV 1 /FVC and PEF, and restrictive ventilator disorders such as lung parenchymal disease by using FVC. For the interpretation of a spirometric test, a normal pulmonary function reference value is necessary for determining the normal range, and this value is calculated using spirometric reference equa-tions. The job fitness of employees and work-relatedness of reduced pulmonary function are judge...|$|R
40|$|This case-referent study {{investigated}} the lung cancer risk from occupational exposure to diesel exhaust, mixed motor exhaust, other combustion products, asbestos, <b>metals,</b> oil <b>mist,</b> and welding fumes. All cases of lung cancer in males aged 40 – 75 years among stable residents of Stockholm County, Sweden, were identified from 1985 to 1990. Referents were selected as a stratified (age, inclusion year) random sample. Information on lifetime occupational history, residency, and tobacco smoking {{was obtained from the}} study subjects or from next of kin. Response rates of 87 % and 85 % resulted in 1, 042 cases and 2, 364 referents, respectively. Occupational exposures were assessed by an occupational hygienist who coded the intensity and probability of each exposure. Risk estimates were adjusted for tobacco smoking, other occupational exposures, residential radon, and environmental exposure to traffic-related air pollution. For the highest quartile of cumulative exposure versus no exposure, the relative risk was 1. 63 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 14, 2. 33) for diesel exhaust, 1. 60 (95 % CI: 1. 09, 2. 34) for combustion products, and 1. 68 (95 % CI: 1. 15, 2. 46) for asbestos. Dose-response analyses indicated an increase in lung cancer risk of 14 % per fiber-year/ml for asbestos exposure. No increased risk was found for the other exposure factors. An overall attributable proportion of 9. 5 % (95 % CI: 5. 5, 13. 9) was estimated for lung cancer related to diesel exhaust, other combustion products, and asbestos.

50|$|He {{began his}} career in 1988 playing bass for the Brazilian thrash <b>metal</b> band The <b>Mist,</b> who had just changed their name from Mayhem {{following}} a number of line-up changes. On their first album Phantasmagoria released in 1989, they most notably featured Chakal singer Vladimir Korg on vocals and boasted a twin guitar line-up displaying a progressive mix of aggressive thrash and gothic atmosphere. For their second album, 1991's The Hangman Tree, former Sepultura guitarist Jairo Guedz took over full guitar duties for the band, reducing the band to a four-piece whilst further expanding the unique sound of the debut. Vocalist Korg left after the second album, further reducing the line-up to a trio for which Marcelo took over vocal duties for their third album, Ashes To Ashes, Dust To Dust released in 1993 which showed the band adopting a more contemporary groove-metal sound. Following this release, Marcelo left the band {{and was replaced by}} Cassiano Gobbet on both bass and vocals for their final album, 1995's Gottverlassen before splitting in 1997.|$|R
5000|$|In 1989 Guedz {{joined the}} thrash <b>metal</b> band The <b>Mist</b> as a {{substitute}} for the guitarists Reinaldo [...] "Cavalão" [...] Bedran and Roberto [...] "Beto" [...] Lima. He took part in the recording of the band's second album The Hangman Tree which came out in 1991 and enjoyed a fair amount of success in Brazil. In the same year, the band was offered a record deal from the British record label Music For Nations but turned it down, a decision Guedz later admitted to regret. After the departure of the singer, Vladimir Korg, The Mist carried on as a three piece and recorded in 1993 the EP Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust. In 1995 the band released the album Gottverlassen and embarked on the No Gods Tour where they played a series of headline shows and a number of opening shows for Kreator. In 1997 the remaining members decided {{to put an end to}} The Mist. Meanwhile, Guedz was invited by Overdose to fill in for their guitarist Sérgio Cicohvicz and went on tour with the band in Europe and America, opening for Mercyful Fate.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{offers a}} rhetorical {{analysis of the}} album Maranatha by Swedish Black <b>Metal</b> artist Funeral <b>Mist.</b> Its main {{focus is on the}} intertextuality between the song "Blessed Curse" and the biblical book Deuteronomy, especially Deut 28 from which it has sampled a large portion of text. In the analysis I uncover the similarities and differences between the two texts in order to explain how the biblical fragments constitute new meanings when rearranged and taken out of their original context. The analysis concludes with relating the material to its new context i. e. the album Maranatha and the Black Metal scene by explaining other intertexts and references to the Bible and discussing which genre is best suited to describe the album as a whole. The results of the study show that the biblical quotations in the lyrics convey radically different messages and meanings compared to their original content in Deut 28. This in turn acknowledge how dependent linguistic symbols are on their context. I finish off my thesis with a few reflections on the moral and ethical implications of this use of biblical material concerning the anti-christian agenda supported by members of the Black Metal scene and specifically how Daniel Rostén of Funeral Mist view his own work and agenda...|$|R
40|$|Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) {{seedlings}} {{were exposed}} repeatedly at a field site or in a greenhouse to acidic mist containing the major sulfur and nitrogen pollutants of wet deposition {{in the eastern}} U. S. : sulfate alone, nitrate alone or with ammonium ion, and {{a combination of these}} ions. Acidities and ion concentrations ranged from below the mean to above the maximum concentration for cloudwater in the eastern U. S. Effects on elements in current-year foliage were examined after continuous or intermittent overnight exposures to mist performed over periods of 6 to 19 weeks. Principal findings from five experiments conducted over a three-year period were that acidic mist 1) increased the foliar S and/or N content when exposures were intermittent with repeated opportunities for drying of liquid on foliage; 2) decreased foliar calcium, and/or magnesium content, especially when exposures to acidic mist were continuous rather than intermittent; and 3) gave inconsistent results for foliar iron and aluminum probably because of deposition of soil particles and contamination with <b>metals</b> from the <b>mist</b> delivery system. These results indicate that long-duration exposures to cloudwater with pH below 3 may alter foliar nutrient composition and change relationships between N, S, Ca, and Mg, with potential consequences for growth and resistance to natural stress factors...|$|R
40|$|The {{metal working}} {{industry}} needs {{to reduce the}} waste associated with scrap, worn tools, degradation of metal working fluids, and etc. One task in this project concerned metal working fluids (MWF), which typically consists of surfactants, anti-microbial agents, lubricating agents, complexing agents, {{and a number of}} other components. The waste stream volume from the MWF can be reduced by judiciously (1) recycling, (2) selective replacement of expended components, and (3) protecting against microbial contamination. This activity consists of developing an analytical method, amenable to automation, which addresses all three of the methods of extending the MWF lifetime, thereby reducing the waste stream. The technology for determining key components in MWF on-line (at the machine tool) did not exist. The Y- 12 Plant`s collaboration was selected for this particular endeavor because of its ongoing machining operations and expertise in automation. In addition, concerns have been raised regarding chronic exposure of machine shop personnel to <b>metal</b> working fluid <b>mists</b> generated during routine machining operations. The chemical composition of metal working fluids is fairly well known, however, the chemical and physical characteristics of the resulting aerosols (mists) are not as well known. Machinists exposed to these aerosols by inhalation and skin contact sometimes develop unpleasant reactions. The second task involved efforts to characterize mists generated from candidate cutting fluids...|$|R
