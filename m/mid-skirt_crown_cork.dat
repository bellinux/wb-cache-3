50|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> (also {{known as}} a crown seal, crown cap or just a cap), the first form of bottle cap, was invented by William Painter in 1892 in Baltimore. The company making it was {{originally}} called the Bottle Seal Company, but it changed its name with the almost immediate success of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> to the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company. It still informally goes by that name, but is officially <b>Crown</b> Holdings. <b>Crown</b> <b>corks</b> {{are similar to the}} Pilfer proof caps, as usage of both products is to seal the bottle.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, after {{a merger}} with New Process <b>Cork</b> Company, <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company was {{established}} in New York City. <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> International Corporation {{was established in}} the subsequent year in order to assist subsidiaries engaged in bottle <b>crown</b> and other <b>cork</b> business outside the United States.|$|R

5000|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, soda bottles had ordinary cork bottle stoppers and often had rounded bottoms so they could not be stored standing upright. The reason for this is corks have a tendency to dry out and shrink, which allows the gas pressure in the bottle to cause the cork to [...] "pop." [...] Storing bottles on their side prevents the corks from drying out and [...] "popping." [...] After {{the invention}} of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle stopper, this problem was eliminated, and soda bottles could be stored standing upright.|$|R

5000|$|William Painter (November 20, 1838 [...] - [...] July 15, 1906) was an American {{mechanical}} engineer, inventor and {{the founder}} of Crown Holdings, Inc., a Fortune 500 company. He most notably invented the <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> bottle cap and bottle opener.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crown</b> <b>corks</b> are {{collected}} by {{people around the}} world who admire the variety of designs and relative ease of storage. Collectors tend to prefer the term <b>crown</b> cap over <b>corks.</b> In Mexico, these are called corcholatas. In Spain and South America, the names chapas or chapitas are used. (In northern Chile, the name calas is used.) In the Philippines, the term tansan is employed.|$|R
40|$|As U. S. Industries work {{to become}} more {{competitive}} in a global market, employers have at various time turned to processes for involving employees in decision-making and harnessing valuable employee insight in areas related to workplace efficiency and plant safety, among others. However, these mechanisms risk running afoul of the National Labor Relations Act, Section 8 (a) (2), which prohibits employer domination or interference with labor organizations. In a line of decisions between 1992 and 2001, the NLRB has developed a doctrine for employee involvement based around Section 8 (a) (2) and the scope of “dealing with” under Section 2 (5). This Comment analyzes the recent trends in the “dealing with” doctrine, focusing on changes to the “delegated managerial authority” exception analysis after the Board’s decision in <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal Co. This Comment criticizes the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal test as imprecise and potentially unbalancing, and recommends that the Board either narrow its application of <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> 2 ̆ 6 Seal to similarly comprehensive employee participation programs or apply a test for managerial authority that conforms to its “managerial employee” test, as developed in Bell Aerospace and Yeshiva University...|$|R

50|$|The <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> was {{patented}} by William Painter on February 2, 1892 (U.S. Patent 468,258). It had 24 teeth and a cork seal {{with a paper}} backing to prevent contact between the contents and the metal cap. The current version has 21 teeth. To open these bottles, a bottle opener is generally used.|$|R
50|$|Until {{many years}} after the {{invention}} in 1892 of <b>crown</b> <b>corks,</b> beer bottles were stopped with corks. The increasing popularity of bottled beer created {{a need for a}} faster corkscrew. This led to the invention of a variety of “automatic” corkscrew mechanisms patented in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States, England and several European countries.|$|R
5000|$|Invented at {{the same}} time as the <b>crown</b> <b>cork,</b> it is the {{original}} [...] "bar blade".

It is class 2 fulcrum type.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{approximately}} 99% of {{beer bottles}} are reusable deposit bottles and are either 330 ml or 500 ml. At any given time, an estimated 2 billion beer bottles are in circulation in Germany, {{each of which}} sees an average of 36 reuses. The deposit for beer bottles sealed with <b>crown</b> <b>corks</b> is €0.08; for bottles with flip-top closures, the deposit is €0.15.|$|R
5000|$|Göss {{quickly became}} the largest brewery in Upper Styria and by 1892 was {{producing}} ca. 60,000 barrels per year. In the 1920s the brewery began selling pasteurized beer in <b>crown</b> <b>corked</b> glass bottles permitting Gösser to market their beer outside of Austria. By 1930 the company was producing ca 340,000 barrels per year and had exceeded 850,000 barrels per year by 1973.|$|R
5000|$|J Spout, {{manufactured}} by <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> & Seal Company, was launched right after Continental Can Co.’s low profile {{version of the}} cone top. It is named “J Spout” because the thin neck resembles the letter J. It was Crown’s official move to canning beer instead of solely producing crown caps. The design was phased out during the beginning of World War II.|$|R

He would go on in 1956 to become chairman of the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company, a position he held {{until his death in}} 1990 at age 85. During his lifetime, Connelly saw the foundation award over $74 million in grants to both religious and secular organizations in education, health and human services and cultural activities.|$|R
50|$|This common wine opener {{consists}} of a flat housing (often plastic covered) similar to a Swiss army knife with a corkscrew and lever (which doubles as <b>crown</b> <b>cork</b> opener) with either a knife or auto-foiler to remove the foil top of wine bottles and then the cork. Designed to be screwed in to within 1 full rotation {{before the end of}} the screw (more will pierce the bottom of the cork and result in extra flotsam on the surface of your wine) before levering out the cork.|$|R
25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The <b>crown</b> <b>cork,</b> the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|R
50|$|In 1990 Tipperary {{surrendered}} their Munster <b>crown</b> to <b>Cork</b> for {{the first}} time in four years. This defeat followed Babs Keating's infamous remark about Cork that 'donkeys don't win derbies'.|$|R
50|$|While {{working as}} a {{salesman}} for the <b>Crown</b> <b>Cork</b> and Seal Company in the 1890s, Gillette saw bottle caps, with the cork seal he sold, thrown away after the bottle was opened. This made him recognize the value in basing a business on a product that was used a few times, then discarded. Men shaved with straight razors that needed sharpening every day using a leather strop. As existing, relatively expensive, razor blades dulled quickly and needed continuous sharpening, a razor whose blade could be thrown away when it dulled would meet a real need and likely be profitable.|$|R
50|$|A flip-top, swing-top, or Quillfeldt stopper (after the inventor, Charles de Quillfeldt) {{is a type}} {{of closure}} {{frequently}} used for bottles containing carbonated beverages, such as beer or mineral water. The mouth of the bottle is sealed by a stopper, usually made of porcelain or plastic, fitted with a rubber gasket and held in place by a set of wires. The bottle can be opened and resealed repeatedly and without the use of a bottle opener, with the wires acting {{in the same way as}} a latch clamp. The flip-top was the dominant method of sealing beer and mineral water bottles prior to the invention of the <b>crown</b> <b>cork.</b>|$|R
