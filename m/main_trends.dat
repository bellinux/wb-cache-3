25|$|In poetry {{there were}} two <b>main</b> <b>trends,</b> one {{represented}} by Venmani Nampoodiris(venmani Poets) and the other by Kerala Varma. The latter's poetry was modeled on the old Manipravalam style abounding in Sanskrit words and terms, {{but it had a}} charm of its own when adapted to express new ideas in that masterly way characteristic of himself. His translation of Kalidasa's Abhijnanasakuntalam in 1882 marks an important event in the history of Malayalam drama and poetry. Also Kerala Varma's Mayura-sandesam is a Sandesakavya (messenger poem) written after the manner of Kalidasa's Meghadutam. Though it cannot be compared with the original, it was {{still one of the most}} popularly acclaimed poems in Malayalam.|$|E

40|$|The {{storage volume}} of {{internet}} data center {{is one of}} the classical time series. It is very valuable to predict the storage volume of a data center for the business value. However, the storage volume series from a data center is always “dirty,” which contains the noise, missing data, and outliers, so it is necessary to extract the <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of storage volume series for the future prediction processing. In this paper, we propose an irregular sampling estimation method to extract the <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of the time series, in which the Kalman filter is used to remove the “dirty” data; then the cubic spline interpolation and average method are used to reconstruct the <b>main</b> <b>trend.</b> The developed method is applied in the storage volume series of internet data center. The experiment results show that the developed method can estimate the <b>main</b> <b>trend</b> of storage volume series accurately and make great contribution to predict the future volume value...|$|R

2500|$|Rallying {{himself with}} the <b>main</b> <b>trends</b> of Jewish existentialism, the poet {{remained}} critical of other existentialist schools, {{such as those of}} Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, believing them to be overly reliant on dialectics, and therefore on rational thought; likewise, citing Kierkegaard as his reference point, Fondane criticized Jean Wahl for not discussing existential philosophy as an act of faith. His dislike for secular existentialism was also outlined in a text he authored shortly before his 1944 arrest, where he spoke of the Bible as being, [...] "whether or not it wants to", the original reference for all existential philosophy. Geneviève Tissier-Fondane later recalled that her husband was [...] "profoundly Jewish" [...] to his death, but also that he would not abide by any formal regulation within the Halakha tradition. This approach also implied a measure of ecumenism: Jacques Maritain, who cultivated his relationship with Fondane across the religious and philosophical divides, described his friend as [...] "a disciple of Shestov but one inhabited by the Gospel"; Fondane himself explained to Maritain that Shestov and himself were aiming for a new Judaic philosophy that would be equally indebted to the Christianity of Kierkegaard, Martin Luther and Tertullian. He was critical of Maritain's worldview, but remained a passionate reader of his work; in contrast, Geneviève attested that the Maritains' beliefs shaped her own, leasing her back into the Church.|$|E
