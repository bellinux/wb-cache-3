The students individually present their proposal, using technology(ies) of choice, to their peer group. The Feedback for this component had 2 parts: {{the first was a}} FlipVideo file of their performance, the second was an MP 3 file from me giving feedforward on their performance as well as their proposal. The intention was to post the MP 4 file to the student along with the audio feedforward. Posting the MP 4 files proved undoable within WebCt. Students easily accessed the audio feedforward but very few sought to download, from me, a copy of their video file. Later on in the trimester the students take part in an assessed 1 week editorial brief that is in-part delivered/submitted professionally through the web in digital form. I took the opportunity to again give audio feedback for its timeliness and appropriateness of form as well as reinforcing the use of variable technologies for the students. ...|$|R

40|$|Revisionist <b>proposals</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a {{substantial}} part of moral philosophy. Philosophers who favour a particular theory often propose we should act in accordance with this theory, and when we claim they demand too much they often argue that we have no substantial arguments for those claims. In order to create a better understanding of why we think some proposals demand too much, I will give two examples that show that when we propose revisionist changes we often ask things of people that they find too demanding. It will become clear that in both these cases the reactions of people to those changes show signs of indignation in addition to claiming that these proposals demand too much. This indignation is much more complex than often assumed. We show indignation because the commitments that shape our lives are threatened and because the frameworks we use to interpret the actions of others and shape our own actions with are breached. When we experience indignation because the proposed changes threaten to alienate us from our commitments, thereby not adhering to the ‘Principle of Minimal Psychological Realism’, we should not dismiss rejections claiming that too much is demanded as easily as philosophy is wont to do...|$|R
