2500|$|Seismic {{tomography}} is {{a technique}} that uses seismic waves produced by earthquakes to gather information on {{the composition of the}} crust and mantle below a volcanic system. Different layers and structures in the Earth have different propagation speeds of seismic waves and attenuate them differently, resulting in different arrival times and strengths of waves travelling in a certain direction. From various measurements 3D models of the geological structures can be inferred. Results of such research indicate that a highly hydrated slab derived from the Nazca Plate – a major source of melts in a collisional volcanism system – underlies the Western Cordillera. Below the Altiplano, low-velocity zones indicate the presence of large amounts of partial melts that correlate with volcanic zones south of 21° S, whereas north of 21° S thicker lithospheric layers may prevent the formation of melts. Next to the Eastern Cordillera, low-velocity zones extend farther north to 18.5° S. A thermally weakened zone, evidenced by strong attenuation, in the crust is associated with the APVC. This indicates the presence of melts in the crust. A layer of low velocity (shear speed of [...] ) [...] thick is assumed to host the APVC <b>magma</b> <b>body.</b> This body has a volume of about [...] Other seismological data indicate a partial delamination of the crust under the Puna, resulting in increased volcanic activity and terrain height.|$|E

40|$|International audienceShallow magma {{reservoirs}} {{exist in}} the crust beneath volcanoes and mid-ocean ridges, yet there are no reports of extensive <b>magma</b> <b>bodies</b> within the uppermost mantle. Indeed the buoyancy of magma should cause it to intrude into the crust, preventing it from ponding in the mantle below. The Dabbahu magmatic segment in Afar, Ethiopia, marks the late stages of continental rifting. This segment has been active since 2005 and has experienced repeated magma intrusions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here we use magnetotelluric data to image <b>magma</b> <b>bodies</b> beneath it. We identify a 30 -km-wide region of very high electrical conductivity that reaches down to about 35 [*]km depth. We interpret this region as a large volume of magma of at least 500 [*]km 3 that extends well into the mantle and contains about 13 % melt fraction. The magma volume is orders of magnitude larger than that intruded during a typical rifting episode, implying that the magma reservoir persists for several {{tens of thousands of}} years. This is in marked contrast to the situation beneath mid-ocean ridges, where melt supply is thought to be episodic 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
