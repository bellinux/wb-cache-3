5|$|Through another genetic {{engineering}} application known as site-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> researchers {{can alter the}} protein sequence and hence its structure, cellular localization, and susceptibility to regulation. This technique even allows the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins, using modified tRNAs, and may allow the rational design of new proteins with novel properties.|$|E
5|$|Proteins may be {{purified}} {{from other}} cellular components {{using a variety}} of techniques such as ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and chromatography; the advent of genetic engineering has made possible a number of methods to facilitate purification. Methods commonly used to study protein structure and function include immunohistochemistry, site-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> is a {{molecular}} biology method {{that is used}} to make specific and intentional changes to the DNA sequence of a gene and any gene products. Also called site-specific <b>mutagenesis</b> or oligonucleotide-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> it is used for investigating the structure and biological activity of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules, and for protein engineering.|$|E
25|$|<b>Mutagenesis</b> experiment: The {{direct method}} to {{investigate}} the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which {{has already been done}} in viruses, bacteria, yeast, and Drosophila. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In Escherichia coli, one study used transposon <b>mutagenesis</b> to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of Tn10. In yeast, a combined <b>mutagenesis</b> and deep sequencing approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA sequence data analysis can provide valuable information about these mutations.|$|E
25|$|Experimental genetic {{manipulation}} or <b>mutagenesis</b> {{is used to}} determine the function of genes in living organisms.|$|E
25|$|Combined, 'semi-rational' {{approaches}} are being investigated {{to address the}} limitations of both rational design and directed evolution. Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focussed libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the <b>mutagenesis</b> step of DE. A focussed library contains fewer variants than a traditional random <b>mutagenesis</b> library and so does not require such high-throughput screening.|$|E
25|$|At {{the level}} of {{individual}} genes, molecular clones are used to generate probes that are used for examining how genes are expressed, and how that expression is related to other processes in biology, including the metabolic environment, extracellular signals, development, learning, senescence and cell death. Cloned genes can also provide tools to examine the biological function and importance of individual genes, by allowing investigators to inactivate the genes, or make more subtle mutations using regional <b>mutagenesis</b> or site-directed <b>mutagenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> {{is used to}} {{generate}} mutations that may produce a rationally designed protein that has improved or special properties (i.e.protein engineering).|$|E
25|$|Michael Smith (awarded Nobel {{prize in}} 1993), for his {{fundamental}} {{contributions to the}} establishment of oligonucleotide-based, site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> and its development for protein studies.|$|E
25|$|Two main {{strategies}} have been employed to identify essential genes on a genome-wide basis: directed deletion of genes and random <b>mutagenesis</b> using transposons. In the first case, individual genes (or ORFs) are completely deleted from the genome {{in a systematic}} way. In transposon-mediated <b>mutagenesis</b> transposons are randomly inserted in as many positions in a genome as possible, aiming to inactivate the targeted genes (see figure below). Insertion mutants that are still able to survive or grow are not in essential genes. A summary of such screens {{is shown in the}} table.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of methods are {{available}} to effect site-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> although {{most of them are}} now rarely used in laboratories since the early 2000s, as newer techniques allow for simpler and easier ways of introducing site-specific mutation into genes.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{breeding}} relies {{largely on}} homologous recombination between chromosomes to generate genetic diversity. The classical plant breeder may also {{make use of}} a number of in vitro techniques such as protoplast fusion, embryo rescue or <b>mutagenesis</b> (see below) to generate diversity and produce hybrid plants that would not exist in nature.|$|E
25|$|As {{the cost}} of DNA oligonucleotides {{synthesis}} falls, artificial synthesis of a complete gene is now a viable method for introducing mutation into gene. This method allows for extensive <b>mutagenesis</b> over multiples sites, including the complete redesign of the codon usage of gene to optimise it for a particular organism.|$|E
25|$|Molecular biology allows {{scientists}} {{to understand a}} gene’s function using microbial culturing and <b>mutagenesis.</b> Searching for similar genes in other organisms and in metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data allows us to understand what processes could be relevant and important in a given ecosystem, providing insight into the biogeochemical cycles in that environment.|$|E
25|$|There {{is concern}} that insertional <b>mutagenesis</b> due to {{integration}} into the host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia. This concern remained theoretical until gene therapy for ten SCID-X1 patients using Maloney murine leukemia virus resulted in two cases of leukemia caused by activation of the LMO2 oncogene due to nearby integration of the vector.|$|E
25|$|Alignment of ENaC subunit {{sequences}} with ASIC1 sequence {{reveals that}} TM1 and TM2 segments and palm domain are conserved, and the knuckle, finger and thumb domains have insertions in ENaC. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> studies on ENaC subunits {{provide evidence that}} many basic features of the ASIC1 structural model apply to ENaC as well.|$|E
25|$|Model organisms {{have been}} used in the study of S100B function. A {{conditional}} knockout mouse line, called S100btm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi was generated as part of the International Knockout Mouse Consortium program — a high-throughput <b>mutagenesis</b> project to generate and distribute animal models of disease to interested scientists — at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.|$|E
25|$|Because non-retroviral {{approaches}} have demonstrated such low efficiency levels, researchers {{have attempted to}} effectively rescue the technique with {{what is known as}} the PiggyBac Transposon System. Several studies have demonstrated that this system can effectively deliver the key reprogramming factors without leaving footprint mutations in the host cell genome. The PiggyBac Transposon System involves the re-excision of exogenous genes, which eliminates the issue of insertional <b>mutagenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alignment of ENaC subunit {{sequences}} with ASIC1 sequence {{reveals that}} TM1 and TM2 segments and palm domain are conserved, and the knuckle, finger and thumb domains have insertions in ENaC. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> studies on ENaC subunits {{provide evidence that}} many basic features of the ASIC1 structural model apply to ENaC as well. Yet, ENaC is an obligate heterotrimer composed of three subunits as an αβγ or a βγδ trimer.|$|E
25|$|BPTI {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} studied proteins in terms of structural biology, experimental and computational dynamics, <b>mutagenesis,</b> and folding pathway. It was one of the earliest protein crystal structures solved, in 1970 in the laboratory of Robert Huber, and was the first protein to have its structure determined by NMR spectroscopy, in the laboratory of Kurt Wuthrich at the ETH in Zurich in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Comparative oncogenomics uses cross-species {{comparisons}} to identify oncogenes. This research involves studying cancer genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes in model organisms such as mice, identifying potential oncogenes and referring back to human cancer samples {{to see whether}} homologues of these oncogenes are important in causing human cancers. Genetic alterations in mouse models {{are similar to those}} found in human cancers. These models are generated by methods including retroviral insertion <b>mutagenesis</b> or graft transplantation of cancerous cells.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 and galectin-3 {{have been}} found, surprisingly, to {{associate}} with nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes including the spliceosome. Studies revealed that galectin-1 and -3 are required splicing factors, since removal of the galectins by affinity chromatography with lactose resulted in loss of splicing activity. It appears that the splicing capability of galectins is independent of their sugar-binding specificities. Site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> studies to the carbohydrate recognition domain removes glycan binding but does not prevent association with the spliceosome.|$|E
25|$|Early {{findings}} on Notch signaling in Central Nervous System (CNS) development were performed mainly in Drosophila with <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments. For example, {{the finding that}} an embryonic lethal phenotype in Drosophila was associated with Notch dysfunction indicated that Notch mutations {{can lead to the}} failure of neural and Epidermal cell segregation in early Drosophila embryos. In the past decade, advances in mutation and knockout techniques allowed research on the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian models, especially rodents.|$|E
25|$|When {{assaying}} epistasis {{within a}} gene, site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> {{can be used}} to generate the different genes, and their protein products can be assayed (e.g. for stability or catalytic activity). This is sometimes called a double mutant cycle and involves producing and assaying the wild type protein, the two single mutants and the double mutant. Epistasis is measured as the difference between the effects of the mutations together versus the sum of their individual effects. This can be expressed as a free energy of interaction.|$|E
25|$|Directed {{evolution}} is a mimic {{of the natural}} evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of <b>mutagenesis,</b> selection or screening, and amplification. Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{of plants}} has, {{over the centuries}} {{increased}} yield, improved disease resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects {{on the characteristics of}} crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced <b>mutagenesis</b> efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.|$|E
25|$|Applications of Phyre and Phyre2 include protein {{structure}} prediction, function prediction, domain prediction, domain boundary prediction, evolutionary classification of proteins, guiding site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> and solving protein crystal structures by molecular replacement. In the CASP8 blind {{protein structure}} prediction experiment, Phyre_de_novo (the predecessor of Phyre2) was ranked 4th out of 71 automatic structure prediction servers. In CASP9, Phyre2 was ranked 5th on all template-based modelling (TBM) targets and 2nd {{on the more}} difficult TBM/FM (free modelling) targets out of the 79 participating servers.|$|E
25|$|Humanised {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by grafting murine hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. Humanised antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent murine monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold. Increases in antibody-antigen binding strength have been achieved by introducing mutations into the complementarity determining regions (CDR), using techniques such as chain-shuffling, randomization of complementarity-determining regions and antibodies with mutations within the variable regions induced by error-prone PCR, E. coli mutator strains and site-specific <b>mutagenesis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{sequence}} analysis: With {{rapid development}} of DNA sequencing technology, {{an enormous amount}} of DNA sequence data is available and even more is forthcoming in the future. Various methods have been developed to infer the DFE from DNA sequence data. By examining DNA sequence differences within and between species, we are able to infer various characteristics of the DFE for neutral, deleterious and advantageous mutations. To be specific, the DNA sequence analysis approach allows us to estimate the effects of mutations with very small effects, which are hardly detectable through <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments.|$|E
25|$|Rational {{design of}} a protein relies on an {{in-depth}} knowledge of the protein structure, {{as well as its}} catalytic mechanism. Specific changes are then made by site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this is that even when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE {{is that there is no}} need to understand the mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.|$|E
25|$|When {{functional}} proteins {{have been}} isolated, {{it is necessary}} that their genes are too, therefore a genotype-phenotype link is required. This can be covalent, such as mRNA display where the mRNA gene is linked to the protein at the end of translation by puromycin. Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by compartmentalisation in living cells or emulsion droplets. The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of <b>mutagenesis.</b> The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.|$|E
25|$|The recent spurt in {{information}} on various plant-related processes {{has largely been}} {{a result of the}} revolution in molecular biology. Powerful techniques like <b>mutagenesis</b> and complementation were made possible in Arabidopsis thaliana via generation of T-DNA containing mutant lines, recombinant plasmids, techniques like transposon tagging etc. Availability of complete physical and genetic maps, RNAi vectors, and rapid transformation protocols are some of the technologies that have significantly altered the scope of the field. Recently, there has also been a massive increase in the genome and EST sequences of various non-model species, which, coupled with the bioinformatics tools existing today, generate opportunities in the field of plant evo-devo research.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to infer the {{distribution}} of fitness effects (DFE) using <b>mutagenesis</b> experiments and theoretical models applied to molecular sequence data. DFE, as used to determine the relative abundance of different types of mutations (i.e., strongly deleterious, nearly neutral or advantageous), is relevant to many evolutionary questions, such as the maintenance of genetic variation, the rate of genomic decay, the maintenance of outcrossing sexual reproduction as opposed to inbreeding and the evolution of sex and genetic recombination. In summary, the DFE {{plays an important role in}} predicting evolutionary dynamics. A variety of approaches have been used to study the DFE, including theoretical, experimental and analytical methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and {{it is recommended that}} use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, abortion, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis and <b>mutagenesis.</b> Caution is also advised during breast feeding as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk.|$|E
25|$|The λ-red {{system has}} also been {{optimized}} for scarless recombination; however, this is a two-step system consisting of selection and counterselection. In this case, a gene cassette with a dual selectable marker {{can be incorporated into}} the DNA at the specific location of <b>mutagenesis.</b> After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of hybrid library: random libraries and cDNA-based libraries. A cDNA library is constituted by the cDNA produced through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cells {{of types of}} cell. This library can be ligated into a construct {{so that it is}} attached to the BD or AD being used in the assay. A random library uses lengths of DNA of random sequence in place of these cDNA sections. A number of methods exist for the production of these random sequences, including cassette <b>mutagenesis.</b> Regardless of the source of the DNA library, it is ligated into the appropriate place in the relevant plasmid/phagemid using the appropriate restriction endonucleases.|$|E
