5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were <b>making</b> <b>things</b> more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty rear shock absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E

25|$|Fire: The fire {{signs are}} Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius. A native with mainly fire signs will be energetic, {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic, with {{a need to}} be {{in the center of the}} action <b>making</b> <b>things</b> happen. They can be egotistical, headstrong and sometimes arrogant, but also can be generous, warm-hearted, and spontaneously kind. Fire subjects are independent and prefer to have control over their own lives, but they can also be sometimes autocratic. A subject lacking fire signs will be fearful or over-cautious, pessimistic and shy, and will lack enthusiasm, confidence and faith in the future. Planets in the 1st, 5th and 9th houses and an emphasis on cardinal signs in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E

25|$|Magliocco became {{interested}} in studying the American Pagan movement in the mid-1990s, following the culmination of her fieldwork research in a Sicilian village. From 1995 through to 1997, she began studying the Pagan community in the San Francisco Bay Area, joining a Wiccan group, the Coven Trismegiston, which was led by the high priest Don Frew and high priestess Anna Korn. Becoming involved with the faith, Magliocco noted that she no longer remained an objective outsider, but became an active participant after experiencing altered states of consciousness during several Pagan rituals. In 2002 she published her first book on the subject, Neo-pagan Sacred Art and Altars: <b>Making</b> <b>Things</b> Work, which {{was followed by the}} more general Witching Culture two years later.|$|E

Resourceful and possessing an encyclopedic knowledge of the physical sciences, he solves complex problems by <b>making</b> <b>things</b> out of ordinary objects, along with his ever-present Swiss Army knife, duct tape, and occasionally matches.

25|$|Because of {{this growing}} trend, {{companies}} such as Sanrio came out with merchandise like Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty was an immediate success and the obsession with cute continued to progress in other areas as well. More recently, Sanrio has released kawaii characters with deeper personalities that appeal to an older audience, such as Gudetama and Aggretsuko. These characters have enjoyed strong popularity as fans are drawn to their unique quirks {{in addition to their}} cute aesthetics. The 1980s also saw the rise of cute idols, such as Seiko Matsuda, who is largely credited with popularizing the trend. Women began to emulate Seiko Matsuda and her cute fashion style and mannerisms, which emphasized the helplessness and innocence of young girls. The market for cute merchandise in Japan used to be driven by Japanese girls between 15 and 18 years old. No longer limited to teenagers, the spread of <b>making</b> <b>things</b> as cute as possible, even common household items, is embraced by people of all ages.|$|E

[...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and <b>making</b> <b>things</b> bigger.

500|$|As {{is typical}} for the series, the {{synthesized}} orchestral {{score of the}} episodes was written alternately by Jay Gruska and Christopher Lennertz, with the former working on [...] "Part One" [...] and the latter scoring [...] "Part Two". Because he had worked on the pilot episode of the series—where he introduced a recurring musical theme for scenes related to the villain Azazel—Lennertz was happy {{to be the one}} to score the episode featuring the demon's death, allowing him to [...] "close that chapter". With the opening of the gateway to Hell at the episode's end, Lennertz felt that the music [...] "became much larger in scope" [...] than previous episodes, deeming it [...] "an issue of <b>making</b> <b>things</b> larger than life".

[...] "an {{essential part of}} Marvel Studios' bigger plans for the future", explaining that [...] "the series has {{become more and more}} connected to the larger MCU since Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it's always been in a reactive role. Stuff happens in the movies, and Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. deals with the fallout. Not anymore. This show is <b>making</b> <b>things</b> happen, and these events will clearly impact the future of the MCU because we know there's an Inhumans movie planned for 2019." [...] Sava also mentioned that introducing the Inhumans [...] "on a personal level rather than a cosmic level" [...] via the television series makes [...] "the whole idea a bit easier to swallow" [...] for the general MCU audience.|$|E
