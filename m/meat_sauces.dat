40|$|Objective: To assess {{if there}} is a {{difference}} in salt intake (24 -h urine collections and dietary recall) and dietary sources of salt (sodium) on week days and weekend days. Design : A cross-sectional study of adults who provided a 24 -h urine collection and one telephone administered 24 -h dietary recall. Setting : Community dwelling adults living in the State of Victoria, Australia. Subjects: 598 adults who participated in a health survey (53. 5 % women, mean age 57. 1 (95 % CI 56. 2, 58. 1) years). andnbsp; Results : The mean (95 % CI) salt intake (dietary recall) was 6. 8 (6. 6, 7. 1) g/d and 24 -h urinary salt excretion was 8. 1 (7. 8, 8. 3) g/d. Mean dietary and 24 -h urinary salt (age-adjusted) were 0. 9 (0. 1, 1. 6) g/d (P = 0. 024) and 0. 8 (0. 3, 1. 6) g/d (P = 0. 0017), respectively, higher at weekends compared to week days. There was an indication of a greater energy intake at weekends (+ 0. 6 (0. 02, 1. 2) MJ/d, P = 0. 06), but no difference in sodium density: week day 291 (279, 304); weekend 304 (281, 327) mg/MJ, P = 0. 360. Cereals/cereal products and dishes, meat, poultry, milk products and gravy/sauces accounted for 71 % of dietary sodium. Conclusions : Mean salt intake (24 -h urine collection) was more than 60 % above recommended levels of 5 g/d salt and 11 - 13 % more salt was consumed at weekends than on weekdays. Substantial reductions in the sodium content of staple foods, processed <b>meat,</b> <b>sauces,</b> mixed dishes (e. g. pasta), convenience and takeaway foods are required to achieve a significant consistent reduction in population salt intake throughout the week. </p...|$|E
40|$|Foods with {{different}} moisture and fat contents (i. e. <b>meat</b> <b>sauce</b> and biscuits) {{were subjected to}} treatments at 4, 12 and 19 kPa for increasing lengths of time to remove furan and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The vacuum treatments were ineffective in removing HMF from both food types, as well as furan from the biscuits, unless this food was preliminary hydrated at high water activity. However, the vacuum treatments allowed furan {{to be removed from}} the high moisture food. In particular, 67 % furan removal from the <b>meat</b> <b>sauce</b> was achieved by applying 12 kPa for 10 min.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effect of variety on long-term product acceptance and consumption in a home-use situation. Subjects (N= 105) consumed a <b>meat</b> <b>sauce</b> once a week at dinner at home for a period of 10 weeks. Three variety groups were designed. The monotony group (N= 45) consistently received the same flavour of <b>meat</b> <b>sauce</b> across all 10 weeks; the imposed variation group (N= 30) received one from three different flavours of the <b>meat</b> <b>sauce</b> in random order, and the free choice (N= 30) in variation group was allowed to choose among three flavours of the <b>meat</b> <b>sauce.</b> Results showed a substantial increase in boredom and decline in acceptance ratings after repeated consumption. As hypothesized, this effect was the largest for the monotony group and was least pronounced in the free-choice group, with the imposed variation group in between. Consumption data were in line with these acceptance ratings; the monotony group consumed less of the food than the free-choice group over that time. In conclusion, repeated consumption of a food product only once a week at home resulted in a remarkable increase of boredom over time. The boredom effect was the largest for subjects who consistently received the same food, and was least pronounced for subjects who were allowed to choose among three different flavours of the food...|$|R
