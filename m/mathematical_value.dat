If an individual gets more than 150,000 euro dividends from non-listed limited companies the tax-exempt percentage will be only 15% for the amount that exceeds 150,000 euro. The effective tax rate for a dividend that does not exceed 8% <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> on stock will be 7.5% - 8.5%.

50|$|Numerical {{analysis}} {{provides a}} variety of techniques to represent (store) and compute approximations to mathematical numerical values. Errors arise from a trade-off between efficiency (space and computation time) and precision, which is limited anyway, since (using common floating-point arithmetic) only a finite amount of values can be represented exactly. The discrepancy between the exact <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> and the stored/computed value is called the approximation error.|$|E

Using White‟s (1959) three component analysis of culture, the author presents 6 <b>mathematical</b> <b>values</b> which {{are important to the}} development of Mathematics, and thus underpinning the development of mathematical thinking in the classroom.

50|$|When a {{professor}} wants {{to apply a}} more precise scale and ranking for students assessments, instead of using the full 1-10 scale (which would make the scale inconsistent with that of other professors), s/he may sometimes have recourse to a plethora of symbols and decimals: the range between 5 and 6 is then expressed, in ascending order, by 5+, 5½, and 6−. Minimum passing is 6. As these symbols (except ½) have no clear <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> (usually ±0.25), calculating end-year averages can be somewhat arbitrary and inconsistent; therefore, {{there has been a}} push since 2008 with the Gelmini reform to uniform the system to the 1-10 scale.|$|E
50|$|A second <b>mathematical</b> <b>value,</b> {{called the}} Center of Distribution, {{can also be}} {{computed}} from the Dosage Profile. To determine this value, the number of Brilliant points in the profile is doubled, and added {{to the number of}} Intermediate points; from this is then subtracted the number of Solid points and twice the number of Professional points. The result is then divided {{by the total number of}} points in the entire profile, including the Classic points. In Secretariat's case, this would work out as 54 (40 + 14) minus 9 (9 + 0) divided by 50 (20 + 14 + 7 + 9 + 0), yielding a Center of Distribution of 0.90 (the figure nearly always being rounded to the nearest 100th of a point, as with the Dosage Index).|$|E

Originally, Richter reported <b>mathematical</b> <b>values</b> to the nearest quarter of a unit, but the values later were reported with one decimal place; the local magnitude scale compared the magnitudes of different earthquakes.

50|$|In mathematics, in combinatorics, Li Shanlan {{identity}} (also called Li Shanlan's summation formula) is {{a certain}} combinatorial identity attributed to the nineteenth century Chinese mathematician Li Shanlan. Since Li Shanlan {{is also known as}} Li Renshu, this identity is also referred to as Li Renshu identity. This identity appears in the third chapter of Duoji bilei (Summing finite series), a mathematical text authored by Li Shanlan and published in 1867 as part of his collected works. A Czech mathematician Josef Kaucky published an elementary proof of the identity along with a history of the identity in 1964. Kaucky attributed the identity to a certain Li Jen-Shu. From the account {{of the history of the}} identity, it has been ascertained that Li Jen-Shu is in fact Li Shanlan. Western scholars had been studying Chinese mathematics for its historical value; but the attribution of this identity to a nineteenth century Chinese mathematician sparked a rethink on the <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> of the writings of Chinese mathematicians.|$|E

Fractional Permissions are {{a popular}} {{approach}} to reasoning about programs that use shared-memory concurrency, because they pro-vide {{a way of}} proving data race freedom while permitting concurrent read access. However, specification using fractional permissions typically requires the user to pick concrete <b>mathematical</b> <b>values</b> for partial permis-sions, making specifications overly low-level, tedious to write, and harder to adapt and re-use.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research are to examine the mathematical values in the curriculum applied in a Victoria, to identify how the mathematical values are presented in a Victorian textbook, and to investigate how the mathematical values presented in the Victorian textbook reflects the curriculum emphases applied in Victoria. This research use qualitative research approach and its data analysis applies textual analysis approach, content analysis method, framework for analysis, and coding. This study concludes (1) The mathematical values in the curriculum applied in Victoria are rationalism, objectism, control, progress, openness, and mystery; (2) In the Victorian textbook, the dominant mathematical values are objectism over rationalism, control over progress, and mystery over openness. The <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> of rationalism is mainly represented {{by the use of}} context [...] - nil, and its complementary value, objectism, is mostly presented by symbolisation adopted in texts. The <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> of control in the Victorian textbook is most frequently presented by the value signal use of imperatives and progress, as its complementary value, is mostly represented by the value signal example of mathematics contributing to societal progress. Predominantly, the <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> of openness is represented by interpersonal distance [...] - use of pronoun “you” and related forms and its complementary value, mystery, is mainly conveyed through presenting the value signal use of specialist vocabulary; (3) In the Victorian textbook, objectism values dominate the ideological components and the value signal symbolisation adopted, dominates the objectism values. This supports the Victorian curriculum which stresses the use of symbols. Rationalism, control, openness, and mystery values which frequently appear in the Victorian textbook are in line with the Victorian curriculum which emphasizes these values, even though rationalism is presented not as often as objectism, and openness values are presented much less frequently than mystery as the complementary pair. However, progress values, which are also underlined in the Victorian curriculum, do not often appear frequently in the Victorian textbooks...|$|E

30|$|Digital manipulatives {{can allow}} {{students}} to make the connection between concrete objects and more abstract objects {{to gain a better}} symbolic, conceptual understanding of the mathematical concept. A challenge of the concreteness and perceptual richness of some physical manipulatives, however, is that it makes it difficult to transfer knowledge and generalize to other contexts. Students may not recognize, for example, that a circle with one fifth shaded, the decimal representation of 0.2, and the fraction representation 1 / 5 all represent the same <b>mathematical</b> <b>value.</b> It is possible that physical, concrete manipulatives are better to learn with at the beginning, but that digital manipulatives are better for transferability. So, if learners can transition from concrete to digital, they may get the benefit of both. As a scaffolding technique, younger students can start with concrete manipulatives before using digital ones. Our later case illustration in this manipulatives section illustrates one way this could be approached.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of signal processing, the {{comparison}} of time histories is required for different purposes, especially for the model validation of vehicle safety. Most of the existing metrics focus on the <b>mathematical</b> <b>value</b> only. Therefore, they suffer the measuring errors, disturbance, and uncertainties and can hardly achieve a stable result with a clear physical interpretation. This paper proposes a novel scheme of time histories comparison {{to be used in}} vehicle safety analysis. More specifically, each signal for comparison is decomposed into a trend signal and several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by ensemble empirical mode decomposition. The trend signals reflect the general variation and are free from the influence of high-frequency disturbances. With the help of dynamic time warping, the errors of time and magnitude between trends are calculated. The IMFs, which contain high-frequency information, are compared on frequency, magnitude, and local features. To illustrate the full scope and effectiveness of the proposed scheme, this paper provides three vehicle crash cases...|$|E
