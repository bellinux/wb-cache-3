5|$|The {{following}} is a timeline of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> It includes a number of events prior to the official formation of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> {{and a number of}} events after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, until the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> was formally replaced by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the United States Congress {{passed a}} law {{providing}} for a national park dedicated {{to the history of}} the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> The <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> National Historical Park was established on 10 November 2015.|$|E
5|$|A {{legacy of}} the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> was the network of {{national}} laboratories, but none was located on the East Coast. Rabi and Ramsey assembled a group of universities in the New York area to lobby for their own national laboratory. When Zacharias, who was now at MIT, heard about it, {{he set up a}} rival group at MIT and Harvard. Rabi had discussions with Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> who was willing to go along with a new national laboratory, but only one. Moreover, while the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> still had funds, the wartime organization was expected to be phased out when a new authority came into existence. After some bargaining and lobbying by Rabi and others, the two groups came together in January 1946. Eventually nine universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Rochester and Yale) came together, and on 31 January 1947 a contract was signed with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which had replaced the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> that established the Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|At the {{invitation}} of {{the director of the}} <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr, Bohr visited the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> sites in November 1943. Groves offered Bohr substantial pay, but Bohr initially refused the offer because {{he wanted to make sure}} that the relationship between the United States and Great Britain remained a real cooperative partnership. In December 1943, after a meeting with Albert Einstein, Bohr and his son Aage committed to working on the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> Bohr made a substantial contribution to the atomic bomb development effort. He also attempted to prevent an atomic arms race with the Soviet Union after the war, which he believed to be a serious threat. In 1944, Bohr made several key points he believed to be essential towards international nuclear weapon control. He urged that Britain and the United States should inform the Soviet Union about the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> in order to decrease the likelihood of it feeling threatened on the premise that the other nations were building a bomb behind their back. His beliefs stemmed from the fact that he was convinced the Russians already knew about the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> which therefore led him to believe that there was no point in hiding it from them.|$|E
5|$|Because the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> was an Allied endeavor, Groves had {{to obtain}} {{permission}} from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945 {{in the office of}} the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison, and his military aide, Colonel William H. Kyle. Groves, Conant, and Tolman represented the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> James Chadwick, the head of the British scientific mission to the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as Groves and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Thompson Matthias (13 March 1908 – 3 December 1993) was an American civil {{engineer}} who directed {{construction of the}} Hanford nuclear site, a key facility of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{hoped that}} a new, {{permanent}} agency {{would be created}} {{to take over the}} responsibilities of the wartime <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> in 1945, but passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 through Congress took much longer than expected, and involved considerable debate about the proper role of the military with respect to the development, production and control of nuclear weapons. The act that was signed by President Harry S. Truman on 1 August 1946 created a civilian agency, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), to take over the functions and assets of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> but the commissioners were not appointed until October, and AEC did not assume its role until 1 January 1947. In the meantime, the Military Appropriation Act of 1946 gave the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> $72.4 million for research and development, and $19 million for housing and utilities at Los Alamos and Oak Ridge.|$|E

5|$|He later {{served with}} Project Alberta, {{the part of}} the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> for {{operations}} in the field. He served on Tinian, where the worked with the X-Unit Section, which was responsible for the Fat Man bomb's firing unit. He flew a number of practice missions, but not the bombing of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. After the fighting ended, {{he was part of the}} <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> team sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to inspect the bomb damage.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Rotblat {{joined the}} Los Alamos Laboratory {{as part of}} Chadwick's British Mission to the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project.</b> The usual {{condition}} for people {{to work on the}} <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> was that they had to become U.S. citizens or British subjects. Rotblat declined, and the condition was waived. At Los Alamos, he was befriended by Stan Ulam, a fellow Polish-Jewish scientist, with whom he was able to converse in Polish. Rotblat worked in Egon Bretscher's group, investigating whether high-energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission would interfere with the nuclear chain reaction process, and then with Robert R. Wilson's cyclotron group.|$|E
5|$|James Edward Westcott (born January 20, 1922) is a {{photographer}} {{who worked for}} the United States government in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project</b> and the Cold War. As {{one of the few people}} permitted to have a camera in the Oak Ridge area during the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project,</b> he created the main visual record of the construction and operation of the Oak Ridge production facilities and of civilian life in the enclosed community of Oak Ridge.|$|E
500|$|Problems {{like this}} {{underlined}} {{the value of}} having high-ranking officers on hand to deal with local commanders to make decisions on the spot if necessary. In drawing up an organization for command of the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project's</b> operations, Groves and Purnell agreed that Purnell should to be present on Tinian as both {{the representative of the}} Military Policy Committee and the personal representative of Admiral King. He was joined by Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project's</b> Deputy for Operations, and the two shared responsibility for coordinating the <b>Manhattan</b> <b>Project's</b> activities with the senior Army and Navy commanders in the Pacific. Along with Captain William S. Parsons, the director of Project Alberta, they formed what became informally known as the [...] "Tinian Joint Chiefs".|$|R
