40|$|Alveolar mammary {{epithelial}} cells (MECs) in mammary glands are highly specialized cells that produce <b>milk</b> <b>for</b> <b>suckling</b> infants. Alveolar MECs also form less permeable tight junctions (TJs) {{to prevent the}} leakage of milk components after parturition. In the formation process of less permeable TJs, MECs show a selective downregulation of Cldn 4 and a localization change of Cldn 3. To investigate what induces less permeable TJs through these compositional changes in Cldns, we focused on two lactogenesis-related hormones: prolactin (Prl) and glucocorticoids. Prl caused a downregulation of Cldn 3 and Cldn 4 {{with the formation of}} leaky TJs in MECs in vitro. Prl-treated MECs also showed low beta-casein expression with the activation of STAT 5 signaling. By contrast, dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid analogue, upregulated Cldn 3 and Cldn 4, concurrent with the formation of less permeable TJs and the activation of glucocorticoid signaling without the expression of beta-casein. Cotreatment with Prl and Dex induced the selective downregulation of Cldn 4 and the concentration of Cldn 3 in the region of Tjs concurrent with less permeable TJ formation and high beta-casein expression. The inhibition of Prl secretion by bromocriptine in lactating mice induced the upregulation of Cldn 3 and Cldn 4 concurrent with the downregulation of milk production. These results indicate that the coactivation of Prl and glucocorticoid signaling induces lactation-specific less permeable TJs concurrent with lactogenesis...|$|E

WW were significant between calves of the first, second and third parity. Significant effect of parity on weaning weight has also been reported by other workers (Getinet et al. 2009; Mekonnen et al. 2011; Melaku et al. 2011). As for YW, calves {{of the fourth}} parity had the highest YW. Yearling weight of calves from the fourth parity was insignificantly higher. Similar, significant (p <  0.01) effects of parity on YW were observed by Giday (2001) and Getinet et al. (2009). In case of 18 -months calves’ weight, the third parity was significantly higher than the other parities except for the fourth parity. This result is similar to other findings (Getinet et al. 2009). Now a day, it is widely accepted that post weaning growth of calves is partly determined by the direct genetic effect of the calves and the level of environmental factors.|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} 26 Bergamasca ewe lambs weaned at 60 days {{of age and}} {{separated}} into 2 groups - Artificial suckling: 10 ewes separated from their dams 48 hours after delivery and fed with cow's milk; Controlled suckling: 16 ewe lambs remained with their dams at pasture {{during the day and}} then separated at night, returning after morning milking. Following weaning, both groups were confined until they reached 38. 6 kg average weight, and then separated into two types of treatment: Pasture rearing: 5 ewes from artificial suckling + 8 ewes from controlled suckling; Confined rearing: 5 ewes from artificial suckling + 8 ewes from controlled suckling. The experimental design was a 2 × 2 factorial, randomized. Average daily <b>milk</b> production <b>for</b> artificial <b>suckling</b> (0. 318 kg) was higher than controlled suckling (0. 256 kg). The economic return of the controlled suckling treatment was 8. 13 % higher than <b>for</b> artificial <b>suckling.</b> With regard to the pasture rearing and confined rearing treatment systems, there was no estrus for pasture rearing during experimental period.

40|$|Goat {{farming is}} a very {{important}} resource, expecially in marginal and unlikely exploitable Mediterranean areas. They are extensively reared, mainly <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> production and <b>for</b> <b>suckling</b> kids meat. The meat from adult goats instead is not profitable, because of its very low commercial value. The transformation of the Sarda goat (native breed) meat in ripened products (ham) would contribute to safeguard the Sardinian goat supply chain. In the present study, in order to characterize the Sarda breed goat dry ham, five batches (L 1 – L 5), processed in a traditional plant, were analyzed. The chemical-physical characteristics were determined in the following stages: fresh ham (MP), after salting (S), after drying (E) {{and at the end of}} ripening (P). The microbiological parameters were determined in MP and in P. The dynamics of pH during processing were similar to those of cured meat products (in P: 6. 58 ± 0. 26). The aw value decreased during the processing up to 0. 79 ± 0. 03. Regarding the microbiological parameters, in P the coagulase negative Staphylococci were the prevalent flora (4. 38 ± 1. 08 Log 10 cfu/g), followed by the Lactic acid bacteria (2. 46 ± 1. 00).

The use of Sarda and Maltese goat meat to obtain ripened products (ham) {{will contribute to}} safeguard the Sardinian goat supply chain. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize Sarda and Maltese goat dry ham. N. 4 Sarda and 5 Maltese batches were analyzed. At farm level feeding and management were evaluated. Moreover, the following analysis were carried out: 1) abattoir: live and carcass weight, pH decrease, conformation ranking and degree of fat cover; 2) chemical-physical characteristics and colour during the following stages: fresh ham (MP), after salting (S), after drying (E) and at the end of ripening (P); 3) microbiological parameters, rheological properties and composition were determined for MP and P samples. Sarda and Maltese live weight was 44 ± 4. 9 and 53 ± 5. 4 kg respectively. The slaughter yield was 43 % and 34 % 1 h after slaughtering, while 42 % and 33 % 24 h after slaughtering in Sarda and Maltese respectively. The dynamics of pH during processing were similar to other cured meat products. The aw value decreased during processing. Referring to P samples, Staphylococci coagulase negative were the prevalent flora in both races. Lactic acid bacteria, moulds and yeasts were not constantly detected and pathogen bacteria were not isolated.

40|$|In Sardinia, goat {{farming is}} a very {{important}} resource. Sarda and Maltese breed are reared mainly <b>for</b> <b>milk</b> production and <b>for</b> <b>suckling</b> kids meat, while meat from adult goats is undervalued. The use of adult goat meat to obtain ripened ham will contribute to safeguard the Sardinian goat supply chain. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize Sarda and Maltese goat dry ham in order to evaluate the quality of autochthonous goat breed meat. Chemical-physical characteristics were determined dur-ing the production stages, while the rheological and colour parameters and the composition of the goat ham were determined at the end of ripening. The pH evolution during processing were similar to other cured meat products, e. g. sheep hams, even though the values were high, especially in the products from Sarda breed. The aw value regularly decreased during processing. Colour parameters (L*, a*, b*) in the hams from Maltese goat breed were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than in those from Sarda. The Sarda goat ham showed a significantly lower percentage of moisture (42 % vs 52 %), an higher protein content (44. 35 % vs 34. 19 %), while no differences were pointed out in the total fat content. Among the ham rheological properties, hardness parameters showed higher levels (13850. 22 ± 7589. 92 vs 11073. 99 ± 6481. 31, respectively in Sarda and Maltese hams) in comparison to similar products from pork and sheep, while adhesiveness value was lower. The results show that the quality parameters of goat ripened hams are affected mainly by the charac-teristics of the goat meat, in relation on the breed and the breeding system, and, less, by the traditional technology...|$|R
