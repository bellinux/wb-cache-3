50|$|A {{secondary}} circulation is a circulation induced in a rotating system. For example, the primary circulation of Earth's atmosphere is zonal.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the effects induced by {{rotation}} on low mass Asymptotic Giant Branch stars. We compute {{two sets of}} models, M= 2. 0 Msun at [Fe/H]= 0 and M= 1. 5 Msun at [Fe/H]=- 1. 7, respectively, by adopting Main Sequence rotation velocities in the range 0 - 120 km/s. At high metallicity, {{we find that the}} Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, active at the interface between the convective envelope and the rapid rotating core, contaminates the 13 C-pocket (the major neutron source) with 14 N (the major neutron poison), thus reducing the neutron flux available for the synthesis of heavy elements. As a consequence, the yields of heavy-s elements (Ba, La, Nd, Sm) and, to a less extent, those of light-s elements (Sr, Y, Zr) decrease with increasing rotation velocities up to 60 km/s. However, for larger initial rotation velocities, the production of light-s and, to a less extent, that of heavy-s begins again to increase, due to mixing induced by <b>meridional</b> <b>circulations.</b> At low metallicity, the effects of <b>meridional</b> <b>circulations</b> are important even at rather low rotation velocity. The combined effect of Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability and <b>meridional</b> <b>circulations</b> determines an increase of light-s and, to a less extent, heavy-s elements, while lead is strongly reduced. For both metallicities, the rotation-induced instabilities active during the interpulse phase reduce the neutrons-to-seeds ratio, so that the spectroscopic indexes [hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] decrease by increasing the initial rotation velocity. Our analysis suggests that rotation could explain the spread in the s-process indexes, as observed in s-process enriched stars at different metallicities.

40|$|Guided by {{the recent}} {{observational}} result that the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> of the Sun becomes weaker {{at the time of}} the sunspot maximum, we have included a parametric quenching of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> in solar dynamo models such that the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> becomes weaker when the magnetic field at the base of the convection zone is stronger. We find that a flux transport solar dynamo tends to become unstable on including this quenching of <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> if the diffusivity in the convection zone is less than about 2 * 10 ^{ 11 } cm^ 2 /s. The quenching of alpha, however, has a stabilizing effect and it is possible to stabilize a dynamo with low diffusivity with sufficiently strong alpha-quenching.

40|$|The Atlantic <b>meridional</b> {{overturning}} <b>circulation</b> {{is widely}} believed to affect climate. Changes in ocean circulation have been inferred from records of the deep water chemical composition derived from sedimentary nutrient proxies (Boyle and Keigwin, 1987, doi: 10. 1038 / 330035 a 0), but their impact on climate is difficult to assess because such reconstructions provide insufficient constraints on the rate of overturning (LeGrand and Wunsch, 1995, doi: 10. 1029 / 95 PA 01455). Here we report measurements of 231 Pa/ 230 Th, a kinematic proxy for the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation,</b> in a sediment core from the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean. We find that the meridional overturning was nearly, or completely, eliminated during the coldest deglacial interval in the North Atlantic region, beginning with the catastrophic iceberg discharge Heinrich event H 1, 17, 500 yr ago, and declined sharply but briefly into the Younger Dryas cold event, about 12, 700 yr ago. Following these cold events, the 231 Pa/ 230 Th record indicates that rapid accelerations of the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> were concurrent with the two strongest regional warming events during deglaciation. These results confirm the significance of variations {{in the rate of}} the Atlantic <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> for abrupt climate changes...|$|R

40|$|Observations of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> of the Sun, {{which plays}} a key role in the {{operation}} of the solar dynamo, indicate that its speed varies with the solar cycle, becoming faster during the solar minima and slower during the solar maxima. To explain this variation of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> with the solar cycle, we construct a theoretical model by coupling the equation of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> (the ϕ component of the vorticity equation within the solar convection zone) with the equations of the flux transport dynamo model. We consider the back reaction due to the Lorentz force of the dynamo-generated magnetic fields and study the perturbations produced in the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> due to it. This enables us to model the variations of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> without developing a full theory of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> itself. We obtain results which reproduce the observational data of solar cycle variations of the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> reasonably well. We get the best results on assuming the turbulent viscosity acting on the velocity field to be comparable to the magnetic diffusivity (i. e. on assuming the magnetic Prandtl number to be close to unity). We have to assume an appropriate bottom boundary condition to ensure that the Lorentz force cannot drive a flow in the subadiabatic layers below the bottom of the tachocline. Our results are sensitive to this bottom boundary condition. We also suggest a hypothesis how the observed inward flow towards the active regions may be produced.

40|$|In {{this work}} we present the {{possible}} variations that the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> of the Sun might have undergone {{during the last}} 250 years. In order to do this, we reduce an α-Ω dynamo to a low-order system {{that focuses on the}} time evolution of one of the solar magnetic field components. Afterward we used a method based on the analysis of phase space of the superficial toroidal magnetic field to infer changes in the superficial <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation.</b> We used sunspot numbers to build a time series that approximately represents the magnetic field behavior. After reconstructing the time series' phase space we assume equilibrium solutions for each solar cycle and we fit them to our model. The resulting fit parameters are shown to depend on background quantities of the theoretical model, such as magnetic diffusivity, differential rotation, <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation,</b> etc. The methodology presented here allows one to extract information about the <b>meridional</b> <b>circulation</b> average behavior, and possibly other parameters, from more that 250 years of sunspot number observations...|$|E
30|$|To {{examine whether}} these {{anomalous}} vertical atmospheric circulations were reinforced in high EASMI years, those circulations in 100 °– 180 °E where TCs mainly occur were averaged to analyze differences in vertical <b>meridional</b> atmospheric <b>circulations</b> {{between the two}} groups. Anomalous secondary circulations were formed in which air currents ascended in regions south to 25 °N and descended in 25 °– 40 °N. Because of the anomalous vertical <b>meridional</b> atmospheric <b>circulations</b> reinforced as such in high EASMI years, positive relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in regions south to 30 °N, while negative relative humidity anomalies were reinforced at all layers of the troposphere in 30 °– 45 °N.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} investigations, the dynamical {{origins of}} the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age remain uncertain. A major unresolved issue relating to internal climate dynamics is the mode and tempo of Atlantic <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> variability, and the significance of decadal-to-centennial scale changes in Atlantic <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> strength in regulating the climate of the last millennium. Here we use the timeconstrained high-resolution local radiocarbon reservoir age offset derived from an absolutely dated annually resolved shell chronology spanning the past 1, 350 years, to reconstruct changes in surface ocean circulation and climate. The water mass tracer data presented here from the North Icelandic shelf, combined with previously published data from the Arctic and subtropical Atlantic, show that surface Atlantic <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> dynamics likely amplified the relatively warm conditions during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the relatively cool conditions during the Little Ice Age within the North Atlantic sector...|$|R

40|$|The mid-Pliocene warm {{period is}} a recent warm {{geological}} period that shares similarities with predictions of future climate.

However, climate models do not simulate such stronger Atlantic <b>Meridional</b> Overturning <b>Circulation,</b> when forced with mid-Pliocene boundary conditions.

40|$|A box {{model of}} the inter-hemispheric Atlantic <b>meridional</b> {{overturning}} <b>circulation</b> is developed, including a variable pycnocline depth for the tropical and subtropical regions. The circulation is forced by winds over a periodic channel {{in the south and}} by freshwater forcing at the surface. The model is aimed at investigating the ocean feedbacks related to perturbations in freshwater forcing from the atmosphere, and to changes in freshwater transport in the ocean. These feedbacks are closely connected with the stability properties of the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation,</b> in particular in response to freshwater perturbations. A separate box is used for representing the region north of the Antarctic circumpolar current in the Atlantic sector. The density difference between this region and the north of the basin is then used for scaling the downwelling in the north. These choices are essential for reproducing the sensitivity of the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> observed in general circulation models, and therefore suggest that the southernmost part of the Atlantic Ocean north of the Drake Passage is of fundamental importance for the stability of the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation.</b> With this configuration, the magnitude of the freshwater transport by the southern subtropical gyre strongly affects the response of the <b>meridional</b> overturning <b>circulation</b> to external forcing. The role of the freshwater transport by the overturning circulation (M ov) as a stability indicator is discussed. It is investigated under which conditions its sign at the latitude of the southern tip of Africa can provide information on the existence of a second, permanently shut down, state of the overturning circulation in the box model.
