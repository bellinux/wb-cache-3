25|$|Numerous oral {{magnesium}} preparations are available. In two {{human trials}} magnesium oxide, {{one of the}} most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high <b>magnesium</b> <b>content</b> per weight, was less bioavailable than magnesium citrate, chloride, lactate or aspartate. Magnesium citrate has been reported as more bioavailable than oxide or amino-acid chelate forms.|$|E
25|$|Magnesium-rich olivine forms a large {{proportion}} of peridotite, and so <b>magnesium</b> <b>content</b> is high. Layered igneous complexes have much more varied compositions, depending on the fractions of pyroxenes, chromite, plagioclase, and amphibole. Minor minerals and mineral groups in peridotite include plagioclase, spinel (commonly the mineral chromite), garnet (especially the mineral pyrope), amphibole, and phlogopite. In peridotite, plagioclase is stable at relatively low pressures (crustal depths), aluminous spinel at higher pressures (to depths of 60km or so), and garnet at yet higher pressures.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies from}} the 1990s and 2000s {{show that there}} is a low seismic-wave-speed anomaly beneath Iceland, but opinion is divided as to whether it {{continues}} deeper than the mantle transition zone at roughly 600km depth. The velocities of seismic waves are reduced by up to 3% (P waves) and more than 4% (S waves), respectively. These values are consistent with a small percentage of partial melt, a high <b>magnesium</b> <b>content</b> of the mantle, or elevated temperature. It is not possible to unambiguously separate out which effect causes the observed velocity reduction.|$|E
50|$|The komatiite is {{typically}} of high magnesian character throughout, although flow top spinifex zones may get to {{as low as}} 18% MgO.

2500|$|Another measure, {{directed}} {{directly at}} the Dutch trade system outside the direct Franco-Dutch relations, was the founding {{of a number of}} chartered trading companies that were intended to compete with the Dutch VOC and WIC, but also make inroads on the Dutch Baltic trade, like the already mentioned West India Company and the French East India Company, both formed in 1664, and given monopolies in France. These caused the Dutch some anxiety, but proved eventually not very successful. The same applied to the Compagnie du Nord that Colbert set up in 1669 to compete with the Dutch in Scandinavia. This was supposed to engross the Dutch salt trade with especially Norway, and replace it with French salt. Unfortunately, the French salt with a high <b>magnesium</b> <b>content</b> proved unfit for preserving herring (as the Dutch could have told Colbert, because they had tried to sell it to the Norwegians themselves, when the Iberian salt trade was closed to them). France therefore had to subsidise these exports, and also the otherwise uncompetitive French shipping rates. Despite government pressure the Bordeaux wine merchants [...] were unwilling to shift their exports away from Dutch carriers, or do without Dutch prefinancing of their operations. The unprofitability of its operations, combined with Dutch dumping policies in the trade of Baltic naval stores, forced the winding up of the company in 1675.|$|E

It was observed that all cultivars infected by C. flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens showed reduction of shoot dry matter and macronutrient contents.

40|$|It was {{confirmed}} that morphine administration in vivo produced a selective {{decrease in the}} calcium content of synaptosomal fractions prepared from rat cerebral cortices. This effect was prevented by naloxone. 2 After morphine or naloxone, there were no changes in the sodium, potassium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>contents</b> {{of any of the}} seven subcellular fractions tested. 3 Since the selective calcium loss was found to occur from fractions similar to those reported to exhibit opiate receptor binding, it is concluded that calcium {{may play a role in}} the action of narcotic agonist drugs...|$|R

40|$|It was {{revealed}} that an AA 5083 alloy had been severely sensitized after 40 years in service at ground atmosphere temperature. The degree of sensitization of the various regions through the alloy plate thickness is different, which {{is associated with the}} non-uniform distribution of Mg through the plate thickness. The alloy plate exhibits Mg-rich bands that promoted the heterogeneous distribution of Mg-containing precipitates. The composition of these precipitates ranges from that for low Mg content intermetallics to that of the β′ phase. Structure characterization revealed the β′ phase and a cubic Al-Mg phase that has lower <b>magnesium</b> <b>contents</b> compared to the β phase...|$|R
50|$|It is {{also noted}} that the soil {{composition}} of the low-lying areas is rich loamy characterized as broad alluvial plains. However, the inherent soil fertility is generally moderate because of the moderate levels of calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>contents</b> that would be adequate for normal growth of crops. Meanwhile, the solids of the coastal plains are generally deep to poorly drained while beach ridges are shallow, coarse and loamy. These areas are noted to be moderately fertile due to low organic matter content; while some areas are poorly drained and prone to tidal floods usually occurring in barangays Sabang, Dolo, and Kinalansan.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIncreasing {{amounts of}} {{magnesium}} in LaCu intermetallic are shown to bring drastic electronic, chemical and mechanical changes. Based on DFT methodologies this is quantified for the cohesive energies, relative charge transfers, bulk modules, electronic structures and bonding properties {{for the three}} compounds LaCu, LaCuMg and LaCuMg 4. Particularly the cohesive energies increase with Mg amounts: This {{is illustrated by the}} increasing number of pair interactions: While in the binary the bonding is ensured by La–Cu, in the ternaries La–Cu, La–Mg and Cu–Mg interactions contribute to the bonding with the extra electrons brought by Mg occupying bonding states. Along the series, increasing <b>magnesium</b> <b>contents</b> lead to moderate increase of the compressibility...|$|R
