25|$|There {{are several}} {{measures}} of aerosol concentration. Environmental science and health often uses the <b>mass</b> <b>concentration</b> (M), {{defined as the}} mass of particulate matter per unit volume with units such as μg/m3. Also commonly used is the number concentration (N), the number of particles per unit volume with units such as number/m3 or number/cm3.|$|E
25|$|Due to the site's {{location}} {{beneath the}} Antarctic ice sheet {{there are no}} direct samples to test for evidence of impact. There are alternative explanations for this <b>mass</b> <b>concentration,</b> such as formation by a mantle plume or other large-scale volcanic activity. If this feature really is an impact crater then, based {{on the size of}} the ring structure, it has been suggested by Frese's team that the impactor could have been four or five times wider than the Chicxulub impactor, which is believed to have caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

25|$|Potassium iodide can be {{conveniently}} {{prepared as}} a saturated solution, abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide {{does not require}} a method to weigh out the potassium iodide so it can be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits {{at the bottom of the}} container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water so SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148grams per 100grams of water. Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.40gram (1400mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of <b>mass</b> <b>concentration)</b> of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.72 g/mL. Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764mg iodide per mL. This concentration of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51mg per drop. It is conventionally rounded to 50mg per drop.|$|E

In order to understand the relationship between indoor <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> and lung cancer, samples were collected in January, March and December 2011 by using TSP-PM 10 -PM 2. 5 impactor in Xuanwei County and Liupanshui District (control), China. <b>Mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> were analyzed using the membrane filter weighing method. The results show the average 24 -h <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> of indoor PM 10 are all lower than the value of Xingfu village (control), Guizhou province, but these are obviously higher than the national standard (150 µg/m 3 Indoor air pollution standards(GB/T 18883 - 2002)), which indicates that indoor pollution is very serious. Moreover, the indoor PM 10 <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> are diverse in different villages, with Jiubao to be the highest, followed by Longlin, Luoshui, Hutou, Xinjian and Caohua. All the values of indoor are higher than outdoor, which indicates that indoor PM 10 in Xuanwei County mainly originates from indoor pollution.

The results indicate remarkable high indoor number and <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> and I/O number concentration ratios caused by cooking. Besides cooking stoves that used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or kerosene as the main fuel, high indoor concentrations can be explained by poor ventilation systems. Particle number concentrations of more than 300, 000 cm(- 3) and <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> of more than 1000 mu g m(- 3) were detected in some cases. When the number and <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> during cooking times were statistically compared, a correlation coefficient r > 0. 50 was observed in 63 % of the households. Some households used other fuels like wood and dung cakes along with the main fuel, but also other living activities influenced the concentrations. In some areas, outdoor combustion processes had a negative impact on indoor air quality. The maximum concentrations observed in most cases were due to indoor combustion sources. Reduction of exposure risk and health effects caused by poor indoor air in urban Indian households is possible by improving indoor ventilation and reducing penetration of outdoor particles.

Increased cathepsin D serum <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> (P < 0. 001) were observed in all these groups of patients as compared to normal subjects (n = 98). However, patients with steatosis had serum <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> of this enzyme significantly lower (mean 2 — 3 fold) than those measured in cancer patients (P < 0. 05) or cirrhotic patients (P < 0. 001). Interestingly, significantly higher cathepsin D serum <b>mass</b> <b>concentrations</b> (mean + 62 %) (P < 0. 006) {{were determined}} in the cirrhosis group as compared to cancer patients. No correlation between cathepsin D {{and a number of}} clinical and biochemical proper-ties examined, namely, α-foetoprotein, number of neoplastic lesions and tumour size in cancer patients or, Child-Pugh grade of severity of cirrhosis and other enzymes of liver function tests in the cirrhotic group was found. The present data and those from other studies which indicate that cathepsin D may be involved in carcinogenesis suggest that this enzyme may be potentially useful as an additional biochemical marker to identify cirrhotic patients who may develop precancerous hepatic nodules.
