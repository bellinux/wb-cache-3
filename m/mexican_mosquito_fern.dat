5000|$|Azolla mexicana, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern,</b> is an {{aquatic fern}} native to Mexico, British Columbia {{and the western}} United States (California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Nevada).|$|E
50|$|Species of the Nostocaceae are {{particularly}} {{known for their}} nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern,</b> cycads, and hornworts. The cyanobacteria provide nitrogen to their hosts. Certain species of Anabaena have been used on rice paddy fields. <b>Mosquito</b> <b>ferns</b> carrying the cyanobacteria grow on {{the water in the}} fields during the growing season. They and the nitrogen they contain are then plowed into the soil following the harvest, which has proved to be an effective natural fertilizer.|$|R
50|$|Salvinia {{is related}} to the other water <b>ferns,</b> {{including}} the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> Azolla. Recent sources include both Azolla and Salvinia in Salviniaceae, although each genus was formerly given its own family.|$|R
50|$|Azolla (<b>mosquito</b> <b>fern,</b> duckweed fern, fairy moss, water fern) is a genus {{of seven}} species of aquatic ferns {{in the family}} Salviniaceae. They are {{extremely}} reduced in form and specialized, looking nothing like other typical ferns but more resembling duckweed or some mosses.|$|R
50|$|In China, <b>mosquito</b> <b>ferns</b> (Azolla spp.) {{have been}} used for at least a {{thousand}} years as companion plants for rice crops. They host a cyanobacterium that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, and they block light from plants that would compete with the rice.|$|R
50|$|Several ferns are noxious weeds or {{invasive}} species, including Japanese climbing <b>fern</b> (Lygodium japonicum), <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> {{and sensitive}} fern (Onoclea sensibilis). Giant water fern (Salvinia molesta) {{is one of}} the world's worst aquatic weeds. The important fossil fuel coal consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.|$|R
5000|$|Ferns of {{the genus}} Azolla are very small, {{floating}} plants that do not resemble <b>ferns.</b> Called the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern,</b> they are used as a biological fertilizer in the rice paddies of southeast Asia, taking advantage {{of their ability to}} fix nitrogen from the air into compounds that can then be used by other plants.http://www.feedipedia.org/node/565 ...|$|R
25|$|During his lifetime, Lamarck named a {{large number}} of species, many of which have become synonyms. The World Register of Marine Species gives no fewer than 1,634 records. The Indo-Pacific Molluscan Database gives 1,781 records. Among these are some {{well-known}} families such as the ark clams (Arcidae), the sea hares (Aplysiidae) and the cockles (Cardiidae). The International Plant Names Index gives 58 records, including a number of well-known genera such as the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> (Azolla).|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known examples of companion planting is the growing of rice with Azolla, the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern,</b> which covers {{the top of a}} fresh rice paddy's water, blocking out any competing plants, as well as fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for the rice to use. The rice is planted when it is tall enough to poke out above the azolla. This method has been used for at least a thousand years.|$|R

50|$|Anabaena is a genus of {{filamentous}} cyanobacteria {{that exist}} as plankton. They {{are known for}} nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern.</b> They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins, which are harmful to local wildlife, as well as farm animals and pets. Production of these neurotoxins {{is assumed to be}} an input into its symbiotic relationships, protecting the plant from grazing pressure.|$|R
40|$|The {{invasion}} of Doñana National Park (SW Spain) by the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> (Azolla filiculoides Lam) In 2001, Azolla filiculoides Lam., a floating pteridophyte {{native to the}} New World, was found in Doñana National Park (SW Spain), an European protected area well known for its high value from a conservation {{point of view and}} for its ecological vulnerability. Until that time, there had been no exotic aquatic macrophyte observations in the National Park. Since then, surfaces covered by Azolla filiculoides have increased explosively forming thick floating mats which eliminate submersed plants, and seriously threaten the aquatic ecosystems in this important protected area...|$|R
50|$|The stereotypical {{image of}} ferns growing in moist shady {{woodland}} nooks {{is far from}} a complete picture of the habitats where ferns can be found growing. Fern species live {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, from remote mountain elevations, to dry desert rock faces, to bodies of water or in open fields. Ferns in general may be thought of as largely being specialists in marginal habitats, often succeeding in places where various environmental factors limit the success of flowering plants. Some ferns are among the world's most serious weed species, including the bracken fern growing in the Scottish highlands, or the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> (Azolla) growing in tropical lakes, both species forming large aggressively spreading colonies. There are four particular types of habitats that ferns are found in: moist, shady forests; crevices in rock faces, especially when sheltered from the full sun; acid wetlands including bogs and swamps; and tropical trees, where many species are epiphytes (something like a quarter to a third of all fern species).|$|R
40|$|Due to its phenomenal growth {{requiring}} neither {{nitrogen fertilizer}} nor arable land and its biomass composition, the <b>mosquito</b> <b>fern</b> Azolla {{is a candidate}} crop to yield food, fuels and chemicals sustainably. To advance Azolla domestication, we research its dissemination, storage and transcriptome. Methods for dissemination, cross-fertilization and cryopreservation of the symbiosis Azolla filiculoides–Nostoc azollae are tested based on the fern spores. To study molecular processes in Azolla including spore induction, a database of 37 649 unigenes from RNAseq of microsporocarps, megasporocarps and sporophytes was assembled, then validated. Spores obtained year-round germinated in vitro within 26 d. In vitro fertilization rates reached 25 %. Cryopreservation permitted storage for at least 7 months. The unigene database entirely covered central metabolism and {{to a large degree}} covered cellular processes and regulatory networks. Analysis of genes engaged in transition to sexual reproduction revealed a FLOWERING LOCUS T-like protein in ferns with special features induced in sporulating Azolla fronds. Although domestication of a fern–cyanobacteria symbiosis may seem a daunting task, we conclude that the time is ripe and that results generated will serve to more widely access biochemicals in fern biomass for a biobased economy. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Pools of {{mosquitoes}} collected in Côte d’Ivoire and Mexico were tested for cytopathic {{effects on the}} mosquito cell line C 6 / 36. Seven pools induced strong cytopathic effects after one to five days post infection and were further investigated by deep sequencing. The genomes of six virus isolates from Côte d’Ivoire showed pairwise nucleotide identities of ~ 99 % among each other and of 56 %– 60 % to Dezidougou virus and Wallerfield virus, two insect-specific viruses belonging to the proposed new taxon Negevirus. The novel virus was tentatively named Goutanap virus. The isolate derived from the <b>Mexican</b> <b>mosquitoes</b> showed 95 % pairwise identity to Piura virus and was suggested to be a strain of Piura virus, named C 6. 7 -MX- 2008. Phylogenetic inferences based on a concatenated alignment of the methyltransferase, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domains showed that the new taxon Negevirus formed two monophyletic clades, named Nelorpivirus and Sandewavirus after the viruses grouping in these clades. Branch lengths separating these clades were equivalent {{to those of the}} related genera Cilevirus, Higrevirus and Blunervirus, as well as to those within the family Virgaviridae. Genetic distances and phylogenetic analyses suggest that Nelorpivirus and Sandewavirus might form taxonomic groups on genus level that may define alone or together with Cilevirus, Higrevirus and Blunervirus a viral family...|$|R
40|$|Diflubenzuron is {{an insect}} growth {{regulator}} {{used to control}} {{a wide range of}} insects through inhibition of chitin formation. Target species include many leaf eating insects, such as grasshoppers, gypsy moth, forest tent caterpillar, Nantucket pine tip moth, velvet bean caterpillar, green cloverworm, beet armyworm, <b>Mexican</b> bean beetle, <b>mosquito</b> larvae, aquatic midge, rust mite, bollweevil, citrus root weevil, West Indian sugarcane rootstalk borer/weevil, sciarid fly and face fly. It is a restricted use chemical that is currently registered for use on cotton, citrus, mushrooms, pastures, soybeans and ornamentals. It is also used in forestry, as a mosquito larvicide, and in cattle (mainly dairy cattle) to control manure flies. There are no registered residential uses for diflubenzuron. The Agency estimated in the 1997 Reregistration Eligibility Decision Document (RED) that < 255, 000 pounds of active ingredient are applied nationally on an annual basis. Soybeans and cotton were the largest use sites (approximately 30 % each). Registered formulations include the Technical Grade (97. 5 %) for manufacturing use, an intermediate compound (90 %), and for end use, a soluble concentrate, flowable concentrate, wettable powder and a pelleted/tableted formulation.
