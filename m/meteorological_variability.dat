40|$|The {{detection}} of meteorological, chemical, or other signals in modeled or observed air quality data – {{such as an}} estimate of a temporal trend in surface ozone data, or {{an estimate of the}} mean ozone of a particular region during a particular season – is a critical component of modern atmospheric chemistry. However, the magnitude of a surface air quality signal is generally small compared to the magnitude of the underlying chemical and <b>meteorological</b> <b>variabilities</b> that exist both in space and in time. This can present difficulties for both policy-makers and researchers as they attempt to identify the influence or signal of climate trends (e. g. any pauses in warming trends), the impact of enacted emission reductions policies (e. g. United States NO x State Implementation Plans), or an estimate of the mean state of highly variable data (e. g. summertime ozone over the Northeastern United States). Here we examine the scale-dependence of the variability of simulated and observed surface ozone data within the United States and the likelihood that a particular choice of temporal or spatial averaging scales produce a misleading estimate of a particular ozone signal. Our main objective is to develop strategies that reduce the likelihood of overconfidence in simulated ozone estimates. We find that while increasing the extent of both temporal and spatial averaging can enhance signal detection capabilities by reducing the noise from variability, a strategic combination of particular temporal and spatial averaging scales can maximize signal detection capabilities over much of the Continental US. We recommend temporal averaging of at least 10 – 15 years combined with regional spatial averaging over several hundred kilometer spatial scales. These results are consistent between simulated and observed data, and within a single model with different sets of parameters. The strategies selected in this study are not limited to surface ozone data, and could potentially maximize signal detection capabilities within a broad array of climate and chemical observations or model output...|$|R

A method for estimating a time series of Sverdrup's critical depth from satellite-derived data is introduced. Comparison with modelled mixed layer depth and chlorophyll concentration demonstrates that Sverdrup's critical depth model is valid for the Irminger Basin spring bloom. The dependence of the timing and magnitude of the spring bloom on winter pre-conditioning is investigated. We find that in the Irminger Basin {{the start of the}} spring bloom can be estimated from the preceding winter's mean wind speed and net heat flux. We also find that the maximum chl-a concentration during the bloom can be estimated from the frequency of winter storms. Increased storm activity results in a reduced bloom chlorophyll maximum by delaying the development of spring stratification, resulting in the bloom missing the ‘window of opportunity’ for optimum phytoplankton growth...|$|R

40|$|Mast seeding, the {{extremely}} variable and synchronized production of fruits, {{is a common}} reproductive behavior in plants. Weather is centrally involved in driving masting. Yet, it is often claimed that it cannot be the sole proximate cause of masting because weather is less variable than fruit production and because the shape of their distributions differ. We used computer simulations {{to demonstrate that the}} assumption that weather cannot be the main driver of masting was only valid for linear relationships between weather and fruit production. Non-linear relationships between interannual variability in weather and crop size, however, can account for the differences in their variability and the shape of their distributions because of Jensen's inequality. Exponential relationships with weather can increase the variability of fruit production, and sigmoidal relationships can produce bimodal distributions. These results challenge the idea that <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> cannot be the main proximate driver of mast seeding, returning <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> to the forefront of masting research...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Biomass {{burning in}} {{southern}} Africa {{exists in a}} complex series of relationships with its adjacent and remote environments. Gas and aerosol emissions can be lofted into the free troposphere and undergo long-range transport in the prevailing easterlies. The same large-scale subsidence that drives continental fires {{during the dry season}} also promotes extensive stratocumulus clouds in the subtropical southeast Atlantic Ocean. Biomass burning aerosols often exist as layers lofted above stratocumulus; where clouds and aerosol layers intersect, the aerosols can influence cloud microphysics and radiative properties. Meteorological patterns also modulate aerosol transport and clouds, but there is ongoing debate in the literature regarding whether this ultimately makes a difference or if aerosol effects are dominant. Few efforts have been made to model this system. In this research, the regional weather-chemistry model WRF-Chem is used to simulate the interaction of biomass burning aerosols with stratocumulus clouds in the Southeast Atlantic to explore how clouds respond to aerosols and to synoptic-scale <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability.</b> At present, absorbing aerosols are excluded; their role will be explored separately in future research. Comparing simulations with biomass burning present or absent, we found increased liquid water path (LWP), reduced lower tropospheric stability(LTS), reduced low cloud, and reduced effective cloud droplet radius. Comparing strong with weak offshore flow indicative of synoptic-scale <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability,</b> we found similarly strong but opposite sign response in LWP, LTS, and low cloud amount. Intriguingly, the offshore flow pattern was associated with greater distance between aerosol and cloud layers, reducing the incidence of cloud-aerosol interactions during peak aerosol loading. We conclude that the <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> driving both clouds and aerosols is an important element in this system that adds interesting complications to the interpretation of observational datasets...|$|E

Future meteorological conditions, the major pollutant forcing function other than emissions, are inherently uncertain although much relevant information is contained in past observational data. For convenience in our discussions of regional pollutant variability unrelated to emission changes, we define <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> as short-term (within-season) pollutant variability and climatological variability as year-to-year changes in seasonal averages and accumulations of pollutant variables. In observations and in some of our simulations the effects are confounded because for seasons of two different years both the mean and the within-season character of a pollutant variable may change. Effects of climatological and <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> on means and distributions of air pollution parameters, particularly those related to regional visibility, are illustrated.

40|$|We {{assess the}} {{significance}} of high-frequency variability of environmental parameters (sunlight, precipitation, temperature) for the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems under current and future climate. We examine the influence of hourly, daily, and monthly variance using the Ecosystem Demography model version 2 {{in conjunction with the}} long-term record of carbon fluxes measured at Harvard Forest. We find that fluctuations of sunlight and precipitation are strongly and nonlinearly coupled to ecosystem function, with effects that accumulate through annual and decadal timescales. Increasing variability in sunlight and precipitation leads to lower rates of carbon sequestration and favors broad-leaved deciduous trees over conifers. Temperature variability has only minor impacts by comparison. We also find that projected changes in sunlight and precipitation variability have important implications for carbon storage and ecosystem structure and composition. Based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model estimates for changes in high-frequency <b>meteorological</b> <b>variability</b> over the next 100 years, we expect that terrestrial ecosystems will be affected by changes in variability almost as much as by changes in mean climate.

Estimation of the CO 2 exchange between the ocean surface, the terrestrial biosphere, and the atmosphere is of first-order importance to understanding the global carbon cycle and the processes that are most crucial in determining the atmospheric CO 2 concentration.

40|$|A tidally and cross-sectionally {{averaged}} model {{based on}} the temporal evolution of the quasi-steady Hansen and Rattray equations is applied to simulate the salinity distribution and vertical exchange flow along the Hudson River estuary. The model achieves high skill at hindcasting salinity and residual velocity variation during a 110 -day period in 2004 covering {{a wide range of}} river discharges and tidal forcing. The approach is based on an existing model framework that has been modified to improve model skill relative to observations. The external forcing has been modified to capture <b>meteorological</b> time-scale <b>variability</b> in salinity, stratification, and residual velocity due to sea level fluctuations at the open boundary and along-estuary wind stress. To reflect changes in vertical mixing due to stratification, the vertical mixing coefficients have been modified to use the bottom boundary layer height rather than the water depth as an effective mixing length scale. The boundary layer parameterization depends on the tidal amplitude and the local baroclinic pressure gradient through the longitudinal Richardson number, and improves the model response to spring–neap variability in tidal amplitude during periods of high river discharge. Finally, steady-state model solutions are evaluated for both the Hudson River and northern San Francisco Bay over a range of forcing conditions. Agreement between the model and scaling of equilibrium salinity intrusions lends confidence that the approach is transferable to other estuaries, despite significant differences in bathymetry. Discrepancies between the model results and observations at high river discharge are indicative of limits at which the formulation begins to fail, and where an alternative approach that captures two-layer dynamics would be more appropriate...|$|R
40|$|While the {{importance}} of ecosystem functioning is undisputed {{in the context of}} climate change and Earth system modeling, the role of short-scale temporal variability of hydrometeorological forcing (~ 1 ?h) on the related ecosystem processes remains to be fully understood. Various impacts of <b>meteorological</b> forcing <b>variability</b> on water and carbon fluxes across a range of scales are explored here using numerical simulations. Synthetic meteorological drivers that highlight dynamic features of the short temporal scale in series of precipitation, temperature, and radiation are constructed. These drivers force a mechanistic ecohydrological model that propagates information content into the dynamics of water and carbon fluxes for an ensemble of representative ecosystems. The focus of the analysis is on a cross-scale effect of the short-scale forcing variability on the modeled evapotranspiration and ecosystem carbon assimilation. Interannual variability of water and carbon fluxes is emphasized in the analysis. The main study inferences are summarized as follows: (a) short-scale <b>variability</b> of <b>meteorological</b> input does affect water and carbon fluxes across a wide range of time scales, spanning from the hourly to the annual and longer scales; (b) different ecosystems respond to the various characteristics of the short-scale variability of the climate forcing in various ways, depending on dominant factors limiting system productivity; (c) whenever short-scale <b>variability</b> of <b>meteorological</b> forcing influences primarily fast processes such as photosynthesis, its impact on the slow-scale variability of water and carbon fluxes is small; and (d) whenever short-scale <b>variability</b> of the <b>meteorological</b> forcing impacts slow processes such as movement and storage of water in the soil, the effects of the variability can propagate to annual and longer time scales...|$|R

In this report we have demonstrated how a series of binary decision rules, known as Classification And Regression Trees (CART), can be used to calculate pollution concentrations that are standardized to levels expected to occur under a fixed (reference) set of meteorological conditions. Such meteo-corrected concentration measures can then be used to identify "underlying" air quality trends resulting from changes in emissions that may otherwise be difficult to distinguish due to the interfering effects of unusual weather patterns. The examples here concern air pollution data (daily concentrations of SO 2 and PM 10). However, the methodology could very well be applied to water and soil applications. Classification trees, where the response variable is categorical, have important applications in the field of public health. Furthermore, Regression Trees, which have a continuous response variable, are very well suited for situations where physically oriented models explain (part of) the variability in the response variable.

In this paper we consider 2 D-interval forecasts, where the goal is to predict summary statistics for the distribution of the PV power values in a future time interval. 2 D-interval forecasts have been recently introduced, and they are more suitable than point forecasts for applications where the predicted variable has a high variability. We propose a method called NNE 2 D that combines variable selection based on mutual information and an ensemble of neural networks, to compute 2 D-interval forecasts, where the two interval boundaries are expressed in terms of percentiles.

However, simple attempts to extrapolate malaria incidence rates from averaged regional meteorological conditions have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} determine if variations in specific meteorological factors are able to consistently predict P. falciparum malaria incidence at different locations in south Ethiopia. Methods Retrospective data from 42 locations were collected including P. falciparum malaria incidence for the period of 1998 - 2007 and meteorological variables such as monthly rainfall (all locations), temperature (17 locations), and relative humidity (three locations). Thirty-five data sets qualified for the analysis. Ljung-Box Q statistics was used for model diagnosis, and R squared or stationary R squared was taken as goodness of fit measure. Time series modelling was carried out using Transfer Function (TF) models and univariate auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) when there was no significant predictor meteorological variable. Results Of 35 models, five were discarded because of the significant value of Ljung-Box Q statistics. Past P. falciparum malaria incidence alone (17 locations) or when coupled with meteorological variables (four locations) was able to predict P. falciparum malaria incidence within statistical significance. All seasonal AIRMA orders were from locations at altitudes above 1742 m. Monthly rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature was able to predict incidence at four, five and two locations, respectively. In contrast, relative humidity was not able to predict P. falciparum malaria incidence. The R squared values for the models ranged from 16 % to 97 %, with the exception of one model which had a negative value. Models with seasonal ARIMA orders were found to perform better. However, the models for predicting P. falciparum malaria incidence varied from location to location, and among lagged effects, data transformation forms, ARIMA and TF orders. Conclusions This study describes P. falciparum malaria incidence models linked with <b>meteorological</b> data. <b>Variability</b> in the models was principally attributed to regional differences, and a single model was not found that fits all locations. Past P. falciparum malaria incidence appeared to be a superior predictor than meteorology. Future efforts in malaria modelling may benefit from inclusion of non-meteorological factors. </p...|$|R

In this work, we described the structure of airborne microbial communities in two urban areas (Milan and Venice, Northern Italy) through the sequencing, by the Illumina platform, of libraries containing the V 5 -V 6 hypervariable regions of the 16 S rRNA gene and estimated the abundance of airborne bacteria with quantitative PCR (qPCR). Airborne microbial communities were dominated by few taxa, particularly Burkholderiales and Actinomycetales, more abundant in colder seasons, and Chloroplasts, more abundant in warmer seasons. By partitioning the variation in bacterial community structure, we could assess that environmental and <b>meteorological</b> conditions, including <b>variability</b> between cities and seasons, were the major determinants of the observed variation in bacterial community structure, while chemical composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) had a minor contribution. Particularly, Ba, SO 4 (2 -) and Mg(2 +) concentrations were significantly correlated with microbial community structure, {{but it was not}} possible to assess whether they simply co-varied with seasonal shifts of bacterial inputs to the atmosphere, or their variation favoured specific taxa. Both local sources of bacteria and atmospheric dispersal were involved in the assembling of airborne microbial communities, as suggested, to the one side by the large abundance of bacteria typical of lagoon environments (Rhodobacterales) observed in spring air samples from Venice and to the other by the significant effect of wind speed in shaping airborne bacterial communities at all sites...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{of global}} {{terrestrial}} solar radiation (Rs) are commonly recorded in <b>meteorological</b> stations. Daily <b>variability</b> of Rs {{has to be}} taken into account for the design of photovoltaic systems and energy efficient buildings. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to Rs data recorded at 30 stations in the Mediterranean coast of Spain. Due to equipment failures and site operation problems, time series of Rs often present data gaps or discontinuities. The PCA approach copes with this problem and allows estimation of present and past values by taking advantage of Rs records from nearby stations. The gap infilling performance of this methodology is compared with neural networks and alternative conventional approaches. Four principal components explain 66 % of the data variability with respect to the average trajectory (97 % if non-centered values are considered). A new method based on principal components regression was also developed for Rs estimation if previous measurements are not available. By means of multiple linear regression, it was found that the latent variables associated to the four relevant principal components can be fitted according to the latitude, longitude and altitude of the station where data were recorded from. Additional geographical or climatic variables did not increase the predictive goodness-of-fit. The resulting models allow the estimation of daily Rs values at any location in the area under study and present higher accuracy than artificial neural networks and some conventional approaches considered. The proposed methodology for estimating Rs based on geographical parameters would be of interest to design solar energy systems and to select their best location.

40|$|The {{increasing}} ice-free {{area during}} late summer {{has transformed the}} Arctic to a climate system with more dynamic boundary layer (BL) clouds and seasonal sea ice growth. The open-ocean sensible heat flux, a crucial mechanism of excessive ocean heat loss to the atmosphere during the fall freeze season, is speculated {{to play an important}} role in the recently observed cloud cover increase and BL instability. However, lack of observations and understanding of the resilience of the proposed mechanisms, especially in relation to <b>meteorological</b> and interannual <b>variability,</b> has left a poorly constrained BL parameterization scheme in Arctic climate models. In this study, we use multi-year Japanese cruise-ship observations from R/V Mirai over the open Arctic Ocean to characterize the surface sensible heat flux (SSHF) during early fall and investigate its contribution to BL turbulence. It is found that mixing by SSHF is favored during episodes of high surface wind speed and is also influenced by the prevailing cloud regime. The deepest BLs and maximum ocean–atmosphere temperature difference are observed during cold air advection (associated with the stratocumulus regime), yet, contrary to previous speculation, the efficiency of sensible heat exchange is low. On the other hand, the SSHF contributes significantly to BL mixing during the uplift (low pressure) followed by the highly stable (stratus) regime. Overall, it can explain [*]∼[*]  10  % of the open-ocean BL height variability, whereas cloud-driven (moisture and radiative) mechanisms appear to be the other dominant source of convective turbulence. Nevertheless, there is strong interannual variability in the relationship between the SSHF and the BL height which can be intensified by the changing occurrence of Arctic climate patterns, such as positive surface wind speed anomalies and more frequent conditions of uplift. This study highlights the need for comprehensive BL observations like the R/V Mirai for better understanding and predicting the dynamic nature of the Arctic climate...|$|R
