Guest unexpectedly died <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the Melbourne season, {{with the role}} being taken up by Bert Newton.|$|E
5|$|Mills made {{large-scale}} {{changes to}} the squad over the summer of 2006, although a few <b>months</b> <b>into</b> 2006–07 more budget cuts were made and this limited his ability to add to a squad lacking in depth. When he left Alfreton they were 13th in the Conference North, and he was playing less frequently, making five appearances in 2006–07.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} staff {{consisted of}} two programmers, Joel Billings and John Lyons, who programmed the game in BASIC. Originally developed for the TRS-80, an Apple II version was also created two <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the process.

5|$|A {{couple of}} <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, {{though it would}} keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the job, Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.|$|E
5|$|Although his new club {{began the}} 2001–02 season strongly, topping the First Division table and looking well placed for regaining the Premier League place that the club had last {{held in the}} 1997–98 season, Bruce {{tendered}} his resignation less than three <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the season in order to return to Birmingham City as manager. Although he was initially prevented from doing so by an injunction taken out by Crystal Palace, he was eventually allowed to join the Midlands-based club after a compensation package was agreed. By now he had acquired {{a reputation as a}} manager who rarely held down a job for a significant length of time.|$|E

Two <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the strike, a parody of The New York Times called Not The New York Times was {{distributed}} in the city, with contributors such as Carl Bernstein, Christopher Cerf, Tony Hendra and George Plimpton.|$|E
5|$|Bad weather {{resulted}} in a decline of anti-shipping operations, and before long the Ju 87 groups began re-deploying to Poland, {{as part of the}} concealed build-up for Operation Barbarossa. By spring 1941, only St.G 1 with 30 Ju 87s remained facing the United Kingdom. Operations on a small scale continued throughout the winter <b>months</b> <b>into</b> March. Targets included ships at sea, the Thames Estuary, the Chatham naval dockyard and Dover and night-bomber sorties made over the Channel. These attacks were resumed the following winter.|$|E
5|$|Constantine I {{returned}} to the throne 18 <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the Greco-Turkish War, launched in May 1919. In September 1921, the Greek defeat {{at the battle of}} Sakarya {{marked the beginning of the}} Greek retreat from Turkey. Resentment among the allies for Constantine's policy during World War I prevented Athens from receiving outside support. Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the new leader of Turkey, regained Smyrna and Eastern Thrace, annexed by Athens at the end of World War I.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell {{far short of the}} actual activity of the season.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{graduated}} from Miami in 1995 with a Bachelor of General Studies degree in criminology and physiology. He joined the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League in 1995.

5|$|Just <b>months</b> <b>into</b> his reign, Edward {{forced a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorcée Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King {{he was also}} head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to accept ministerial advice.|$|E
5|$|Lee died {{of cancer}} in January 1981, four <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the filming of For Your Eyes Only and before any of his scenes could be filmed. Out of respect, no new actor was hired to assume the role and, instead, the script was re-written so that the {{character}} is said to be on leave, with his lines given to either his Chief of Staff Bill Tanner or the Minister of Defence, Sir Frederick Gray. Later films referred to Lee's tenure as head of the service, with a painting of him as M in MI6's Scottish headquarters during the 1999 instalment The World Is Not Enough.|$|E
5|$|Olivier's stage {{roles in}} 1934 {{included}} Bothwell in Gordon Daviot's Queen of Scots, {{which was only}} a moderate success for him and for the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (Bronson Albery) shortly afterwards. In the interim {{he had a great}} success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in Edna Ferber's Theatre Royal. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two <b>months</b> <b>into</b> the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the light}} had a fifth-order Fresnel lens, but a fourth-order Fresnel lens was {{installed}} in May 1902, just three <b>months</b> <b>into</b> its operation. The light characteristic was a fixed white light with a red flash every 15 seconds. In 1972, the light was automated and the Fresnel lens was replaced with a modern optic. The light continues {{to serve as an}} active aid to navigation. In 1987, a FA-251 was installed before the current lens, a VRB-25 was installed. The current light characteristic is an alternating white and red flash every 24 seconds. The white and red flashes can be seen for 18 nautical miles and 15 nautical miles, respectably.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just <b>months</b> <b>into</b> his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for African Americans is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E
