40|$|Airline Operational Control Data Link (AOCDL) is {{a service}} that allows for {{downlink}} of in-flight data to help an airline operate efficiently. Automated <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Transmission</b> (AUTOMET) is a weather reporting system that provides forecasts and atmospheric conditions to pilots during flight. These are two examples of new or extended services that will be enabled by implementation of the ATN and its digital air/ground communications data links. One of the possible data links identified for these services is VDL Mode 2. This research focuses on the data link performance of AOCDL and AUTOMET services in a 2015 scenario using VDL Mode 2 as the data link. In the near term, {{it is expected that}} the Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication (CPDLC) and Decision Support System Data Link (DSSDL) services will also use the VDL Mode 2 link. CPDLC and DSSDL are high-priority services that communicate aircraft control information and require low end-to-end delays for safety. VDL Mode 3, which is the preferred link for these services because it provides priority-based link access, will not be deployed in time for earlier implementations of these services to use. As such, the research also investigates the impact of CPDLC and DSSDL services on the same VDL link as AOCDL and AUTOMET. Performance of these services over the data link will be separately examined for the airport, terminal, and en route domains. OPNET simulations are performed for each domain. The number of aircraft for each domain is representative of the expected peak aircraft in 2015. Results are collected during a steady-state condition, with aircraft neither entering nor exiting the domain. The study explores the services in terms of the traffic load they present to the VDL Mode 2 radio. The amount of load each service contributes to the data link will be shown for each domain. The end-to-end delays for each service will be discussed. Data link metrics such as subnetwork and queuing delays, channel utilization, and protocol overhead will be used to show the impact of these services on VDL Mode 2. All results will be presented both with and without the inclusion of CPDLC and DSSDL services...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — State {{estimation}} {{has become}} a tool of vital importance in modern control centers. If {{the accuracy of the}} state estimation could be increased this will mean that a more reliable representation of the power system is obtained and the operation and control functions can make better decisions. This paper studies the influence of changes of the transmission lines resistance due to temperature on state estimation performance. The possibility to account for this effect in state estimation is shown by the use of Line Heat Balance equation and weather data.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} an {{original}} time-domain approach applied to outdoor sound propagation under <b>meteorological</b> effects. The <b>transmission</b> line matrix method, {{based on the}} Huygens’ principle, had already been validated over impedant grounds and complex topography. The presented formulation proposes {{to take into account}} meteorological effects (wind speed and temperature) through the relative sound speed. The necessary wavefront direction is determined through the calculation of the averaged intensity vector direction. A good agreement is found between simulations of both the transmission line matrix and parabolic equation methods. A relevant use of the method is shown in the framework of environmental acoustics and initial applications are proposed in Part 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background:- In Ethiopia, malaria is {{seasonal}} and unstable, causing frequent epidemics. It usually {{occurs at}} altitudes 2, 000 m above sea level. For transmission of malaria parasite, climatic factors are important determinants {{as well as}} non-climatic factors that can negate climatic influences. Indeed, there is a scarcity {{of information on the}} correlation between climatic variability and malaria transmission risk in Ethiopia in general and in the study area in particular. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of correlation between meteorological variables and malaria cases. Methods: - Time-series analysis was conducted using data on monthly meteorological variables and monthly total malaria in Jimma town, south west Ethiopia, for the period 2000 - 2009. All the data were entered and analyzed using SPSS- 15 database program. Spearman correlation and linear regression analysis were used to asses association between the variables. Results: - During last ten years (2000 - 2009), a fluctuating trend of malaria transmission was observed with P. vivax becoming predominant species. Spearman correlation analysis showed that monthly minimum temperature, total rainfall and two measures of relative humidity were positively related with malaria but monthly maximum temperature negatively related. Also regression analysis suggested that monthly minimum (p = 0. 008), monthly maximum temperature (p = 0. 013) and monthly total rainfall (p = 0. 040), at one month lagged effect, were significant <b>meteorological</b> factors for <b>transmission</b> of malaria in the study area. Conclusion: - Malaria incidences in the last decade seem to have a significant association with meteorological variables. In future, prospective and multidisciplinary cooperative research involving researchers from the fields of parasitology, epidemiology, botany, agriculture and climatology is necessary to identify the real effect of meteorological factors on vector- borne diseases like malaria. </p...|$|R
30|$|According to {{the weather}} and outage data of {{transmission}} lines, appropriate weather factors are determined in the method and denoted as w 1, w 2, …, wp respectively. Due to the temporal and spatial variations of weather factors, temporal and spatial splits are needed. Distribution of weather factors is uneven over a vast area, such as a province. A transmission line might be in multiple areas with a different meteorological environment. A spatial split is the division of weather areas. Assuming that the meteorological environment in each weather area is consistent, the divided weather areas are denoted as WA 1, WA 2, …,WAq respectively. According to {{the data from the}} meteorological department, the weather area is divided the same as the administrative area. There are several lines in one weather area, which are in the same <b>meteorological</b> environment. All <b>transmission</b> lines with the same voltage level are taken as the basic samples for the estimation of one weather area. Temporal treatment of weather data contains both split and aggregation. First weather and outage data are split by a step of one day and the weather data is classified into several intensities. Based on the intensity classification, the weather and outage data with the same intensity are aggregated. Both temporal and spatial aggregation result in data smoothing and provides more meaningful patterns and it converts the time distribution of the weather factors to the intensity distribution. There are several weather factors in one area and the combination of different weather factors is defined as a weather block. As the weather factor w 1 and w 2 in a weather area is at level k and m respectively, the weather block is defined as WBkm. The outage data is divided according to the classification of the weather block.|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Bionomics and {{transmission}} dynamics of vector population are profoundlyinfluenced by local climatic conditions. The study monitored variations in density, infection andinfectivity rates of Culex quinquefasciatus {{with respect to}} season in randomly selected localities ofRaipur City of Chhattisgarh state. Methods: The indoor resting density of Cx. quinquefasciatus, Wuchereria bancrofti infection andinfectivity rates were monitored in Raipur City at regular monthly intervals for {{over a period of}} 12 months and the impact of <b>meteorological</b> conditions on <b>transmission</b> indices were assessed. Thefrequency distribution of different stages of filarial larvae in naturally infected vector population,host efficiency {{and transmission}} intensity index of the vector population was also worked out. Results: The mean vector density of Cx. quinquefasciatus during the study period was 55. 22 whilethe mean vector infection and infectivity rates recorded in Raipur were 4. 05 and 0. 25 % respectively. A gradual increase in Culex infection rate was recorded from June onwards with a maximum(22. 14 %) in August and minimum (2. 38 %) in February. No vector with filarial infection wasdetected during December when the vector density was high. Analysis of frequency distribution ofdifferent stages of larvae revealed dominance of microfilarial stage with a mean larval intensity of 5. 37. The highest infectivity rate was observed during June (1. 15 %) and the lowest was in March(0. 41 %). Both the infection and infectivity rates were at their low during winter season althoughthe density of Cx. quinquefasciatus was at its maximum. Highest mean host efficiency of 0. 44 wasrecorded in February. The annual transmission intensity index (TII) was 32. 72. The highest TIIwas recorded during January and February months. Interpretation & conclusion: The climate appeared to have profound impact on vector density,infection and infectivity rates. The vector infection and infectivity rates were high in rainy seasonfollowed by summer and winter seasons. The highest host efficiency was observed in winter followedby summer and rainy seasons. An apparent negative correlation was observed between vectorinfection rate and vector density. Lower temperatures (23 – 25 oC) with low rainfall favouredprogression of mf to L 3 in Cx. quinquefasciatus in the study region...|$|R
