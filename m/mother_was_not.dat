5|$|Gandhi {{came from}} a poor family, and he {{had dropped out of}} the {{cheapest}} college he could afford. Mavji Dave Joshiji, a Brahmin priest and family friend, advised Gandhi and his family that he should consider law studies in London. In July 1888, his wife Kasturba gave birth to their first surviving son, Harilal. His <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> comfortable about Gandhi leaving his wife and family, and going so far from home. Gandhi's uncle Tulsidas also tried to dissuade his nephew. Gandhi wanted to go. To persuade his wife and mother, Gandhi made a vow in front of his mother that he would abstain from meat, alcohol and women. Gandhi's brother Laxmidas, who was already a lawyer, cheered Gandhi's London studies plan and offered to support him. Putlibai gave Gandhi her permission and blessing.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother {{to be regarded as}} a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|Jerome David Salinger {{was born}} in New York City, on New Year's Day, 1919. His father, Sol Salinger, sold kosher cheese, and was from a Jewish family of Lithuanian descent, his father having been the rabbi for the Adath Jeshurun {{congregation}} in Louisville, Kentucky. Salinger's mother, Marie (née Jillich), {{was born in}} Atlantic, Iowa, of Scottish, German, and Irish descent, but changed her name to Miriam and considered herself Jewish after marrying Salinger's father. Salinger did not learn that his <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> of Jewish ancestry until just after he celebrated his bar mitzvah. His only sibling was his older sister Doris (1911–2001).|$|E

5|$|During {{a family}} {{vacation}} to New York when Lawrence was 14, she was spotted on the street by a talent scout who arranged for her to audition for agents. Lawrence's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> keen on allowing her to pursue an acting career, but briefly moved {{to the city to}} let her read for roles. After Lawrence's first cold reading, the agents said that hers was the best they had heard from someone that young; Lawrence's mother convinced her that they were lying. Lawrence said her early experiences were difficult as she felt lonely and friendless. She signed on with the CESD Talent Agency, who convinced her parents to let her audition for roles in Los Angeles. Lawrence's mother agreed to let her pursue acting on the condition that she graduate from high school. Lawrence was eventually home-schooled in Los Angeles, and graduated two years early with good grades. Considering acting to be a natural fit for her, she turned down several offers for modelling assignments at the time. Between her acting jobs in the city, she made regular visits to Louisville, during which she served as an assistant nurse at her mother's camp.|$|E
5|$|The {{evening before}} Fischer's burial, over 600 people {{attended}} a Catholic service at St. Mary's Church in Brownsville. His parents {{decided to have}} an open casket to allow attendees to kneel and pray next to the coffin. The funeral {{took place in the}} same church. Many people were in attendance including Buddy and Corinne's acquaintances, and Fischer's high school classmates. His girlfriend Marianela Caballero and her mother attended both services. Cristina, his ex-girlfriend, was also at the services, but her <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> present. Fischer was buried at the Mont Meta Memorial Park in San Benito, Texas. In the days after the funeral, several of Fischer's longtime friends and their parents gathered at Buddy's house for moral support. Fischer's family moved out of the house where he was killed, and went to live with Corinne's mother. The day of the murder, the Brownsville police offered a reward of US$5,000 to anyone who could assist in the arrest of any individual involved in the murder. A week later the reward was increased to US$20,000. Five months after the murder, Fischer's house was sold at a US$18,000 loss.|$|E

His <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not.</b> She refused to let him act again until he was 22. His most famous role is that of Caliber, a James Bond-like super-spy. Although dogged for years by rumors that he's gay (he is), he recently married supermodel Gina Beach.|$|E
25|$|Anthony's {{father was}} an {{abolitionist}} and a temperance advocate. A Quaker, he had a difficult relationship with his traditionalist congregation, which rebuked him for marrying a non-Quaker and then disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his home. He continued to attend Quaker meetings anyway and became even more radical in his beliefs. Anthony's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a Quaker but helped raise their children in a more tolerant version of her husband's religious tradition. Their father encouraged them all, girls as well as boys, to be self-supporting, teaching them business principles and giving them responsibilities at an early age.|$|E

25|$|Palach was {{initially}} interred in Olšany Cemetery. As his gravesite was growing {{into a national}} shrine, the Czechoslovak secret police (StB) set out to destroy any memory of Palach's deed and exhumed his remains {{on the night of}} 25 October 1973. His body was then cremated and sent to his mother in Palach's native town of Všetaty while an anonymous old woman from a rest home was laid in the grave. Palach's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> allowed to deposit the urn in the local cemetery until 1974. On 25 October 1990 the urn was officially returned to its initial site in Prague.|$|E
25|$|The {{proximate}} cause was the Dutch decision {{to build a}} road across a piece of Diponegoro's property that contained his parents' tomb. Amongst other causes {{was a sense of}} resentment felt by members of the Javanese aristocratic families at Dutch measures intended to restrict the renting out of land at high prices. Finally the succession of the throne in Yogyakarta was disputed: Diponegoro was the oldest son of Hamengkubuwono III, but as his <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the queen he was not considered {{to have the right to}} succeed his father. Diponegoro's rival to the throne, his younger half brother, Hamengkubuwono IV, and then his infant nephew Hamengkubuwono V, was supported by the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|Reicha {{was born}} in Prague. His father Šimon, the town piper of the city, died when Anton was just 10 months old. Apparently Reicha's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{interested}} in her son's education, and so in 1780 he {{ran away from home}} following a sudden impulse – as he recounted in his memoirs, he jumped onto a passing carriage. He first visited his paternal grandfather in Klatovy, and then his paternal uncle Josef Reicha, a virtuoso cellist, conductor and composer living in Wallerstein, Bavaria, who adopted him. Josef and his wife, being childless, could give young Anton their full attention: Josef taught him violin and piano, his wife insisted on his being taught French and German, and he was also taught the flute.|$|E

25|$|Set in {{the parish}} of St Giles—a notorious slum {{district}} that Hogarth depicted in several works around this time—Gin Lane depicts the squalor and despair of a community raised on gin. Desperation, death and decay pervade the scene. The only businesses that flourish serve the gin industry: gin sellers; a distiller (the aptly named Kilman); the pawnbroker where the avaricious Mr. Gripe greedily takes the vital possessions (the carpenter offers his saw and the housewife her cooking utensils) of the alcoholic residents of the street {{in return for a}} few pennies to feed their habit; and the undertaker, for whom Hogarth implies at least a handful of new customers from this scene alone. Most shockingly, the focus of the picture is a woman in the foreground, who, addled by gin and driven to prostitution by her habit—as evidenced by the syphilitic sores on her legs—lets her baby slip unheeded from her arms and plunge to its death in the stairwell of the gin cellar below. Half-naked, she has no concern for anything other than a pinch of snuff. This <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> such an exaggeration as she might appear: in 1734, Judith Dufour reclaimed her two-year-old child from the workhouse where it had been given a new set of clothes; she then strangled it and left the infant's body in a ditch so that she could sell the clothes (for 1s. 4d.) to buy gin. In another case, an elderly woman, Mary Estwick, let a toddler burn to death while she slept in a gin-induced stupor. Such cases provided a focus for anti-gin campaigners such as the indefatigable Thomas Wilson and the image of the neglectful and/or abusive mother became increasingly central to anti-gin propaganda. Sir John Gonson, whom Hogarth featured in his earlier A Harlot's Progress, turned his attention from prostitution to gin and began prosecuting gin-related crimes with severity.|$|E
500|$|Throughout her life, {{she had a}} good {{relationship}} with her brother, which traced back to their childhood as Rashad reflected that growing up with Aaliyah was [...] "amazing". He recalled her running around their home singing and that never being annoying due to her having a [...] "beautiful voice". She and her brother became close with their cousin Jomo Hankerson, since growing up, they lived [...] "about five blocks apart". Jomo walked Aaliyah and Rashad to their home from school when their <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> able to pick them up and recalled the Haughton household being filled with music. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when the Haughtons moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.|$|E
500|$|Six {{weeks after}} the birth, Rowe saw her son {{for the first time}} since his arrival into the world. She had met with Jackson to pose for {{photographs}} with their newborn son at a hotel. Upon arriving, Rowe was ushered into the hotel room, where she was given the infant to hold and told to smile for the camera with Michael. Afterward, she was sent on her way. Rowe did not want to become too attached to Prince, as she felt it would make her situation harder to deal with. At Neverland, Prince was cared for by a team of six nannies and six nurses during his first few months. According to one nanny who worked at the Californian ranch, Prince Michael's <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a significant presence in the child's early life.

500|$|One of {{the early}} turning points for the {{character}} came in season one's [...] "X-Ray", when Lana discovers information about her parents that changes her perspective on them. It began with her mother's graduation speech, which showed that her <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> as happy as her aunt had led her to believe. Lana's perception of her mother drove the way she led her own life, {{which was based on}} the idea of everyone perceiving her in a good light. In season two, Lana discovers that her mother had had an affair with a man named Henry Small, and that he was her biological father. This continued the idea established in season one that Lana's perception that her parents were this perfect couple was wrong. According to Kreuk, meeting her biological father allowed the character to realize that she had to create her own life, as the one she had envisioned did not actually exist.|$|E
500|$|In 616, Æthelfrith was {{succeeded by}} Edwin of Northumbria, a Deiran. [...] Edwin banished Æthelfrith's sons, {{including}} both Oswald and Oswiu of Northumbria. [...] Both spent their exile in Dál Riata, a kingdom spanning parts of northeastern Ireland and western Scotland. [...] Oswiu {{was a child}} {{when he came to}} Dál Riata, and grew up in an Irish milieu. He became a fluent speaker of Old Irish, and may have married a princess of the Uí Néill dynasty, probably Fín the daughter (or possibly granddaughter) of Colmán Rímid. Aldfrith was a child of this marriage, but his date of birth is unrecorded. He was probably thus a cousin or nephew of the noted scholar Cenn Fáelad mac Aillila, and perhaps a nephew of Bishop Finan of Lindisfarne. Irish law made Fín's kin, the Cenél nEógain of the northern Uí Néill, responsible for his upbringing. The relationship between Aldfrith's father and <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> considered a lawful marriage by Northumbrian churchmen of his day, and he is described as the son of a concubine in early sources.|$|E
500|$|No {{longer able}} to keep his silence, Coach escorts Lisa into an office, admits to Lisa that she is too good for someone who treats her badly, like Roy, and openly refuses to let her marry him. Lisa reluctantly admits that she knows {{everything}} about Roy, that her relationship with Roy is a sham, and that Roy is {{the first and only}} man in her life, as she had no other. Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E
