Here a translation of de Broglie's paper is presented to draw attention to this point. Some brief additional comments are included also. Comment: 5 page...|$|E
40|$|Abstract It {{is shown}} that Planck’s energy {{distribution}} for a black-body radiation field can be simply derived for a gas-like ether with <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics.</b> The gas {{consists of an}} infinite variety of particles, whose masses are integral multiples n {{of the mass of}} the unit particle, the abundance of n-particles being proportional to n− 4. The frequency of electromagnetic waves correlates with the energy per unit mass of the particles, not with their energy, thus differing from Planck’s quantum hypothesis. Identifying the special wave-speed, usually called the speed of light, with the wave-speed in the 2. 7 oK background radiation field, leads to a mass 1 2 × 10 − 39 (kg) for the unit ether-particle, and an average number of about 360 ether particles per cubic centimetre in the background radiation field, whose density is about 0. 2 × 10 − 30 (kg) /m 3. ’There fields of light and liquid ether flow ’ (Dryden). ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The real space-time of Newtonian {{mechanics}} and the ether con-cept is {{contrasted with the}} imaginary space-time of the non-ether concept and rel-ativity. In real space-time (x, y, z, ct) characteristic theory shows that Maxwell’s equations and sound waves in any uniform fluid at rest have identical wave sur-faces. Moreover, without charge or current, Maxwell’s equations reduce to the same standard wave equation which governs such sound waves. This is not a general and invariant equation but it becomes so by Galilean transformation to any other reference-frame. So also do Maxwell’s equations which are, likewise, not general but unique to one reference-frame. The mistake of believing that Maxwell’s equa-tions were invariant led to the Lorentz transformation and to relativity; and to the misinterpretation of the differential equation for the wave cone through any point as the quadratic differential form of a Riemannian metric in imaginary space-time (x, y, z, ict). Mathematics is then required to tolerate the same equation being trans-formed in different ways for different applications. Otherwise, relativity is unten-able and recourse must then be made to real space-time, normal Galilean transfor-mation and an ether with <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics</b> and Planck’s energy distribution...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{collision}} rates and velocities for point-particles {{of different sizes}} in turbulent flows. We construct fits for the collision rates at specified velocities (effectively a collisional velocity probability distribution) for particle stopping time ratios up to four; already by that point the collisional partners are very poorly correlated and so the results should be robust for even larger stopping time ratios. Significantly, we find that while particles of very different masses have approximately <b>Maxwellian</b> collisional <b>statistics,</b> as the mass ratio shrinks the distribution changes dramatically. At small stopping time ratios, the collisional partners are highly correlated and we find a population of high number density (clustered), low relative-velocity particle pairs. Unlike {{in the case of}} identical stopping time collisional partners, this low relative-velocity clustered population is collisional, but the clustering is barely adequate to trigger bulk effects such as the streaming instability. We conclude our analysis by constructing a master fit to the collisional statistics as a function only of the stopping time ratio. Together with our previous work for identical stopping time particle pairs, this provides a recipe for including collisional velocity probability distributions in dust coagulation models for protoplanetary disks. We also include our recipe for determining particle collisional diagnostics from numerical simulations. Comment: 12 Pages, 10 Figures, Accepted, MNRA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We report {{experimental}} {{results on the}} transmis-sion performance of a coherent dual-polarization quadrature phase-shift-keyed (DP-QPSK) transceiver with real-time elec-tronic equalization over fiber having 50 -ps mean polarization mode dispersion (PMD). Both single-channel, single-span and multi-channel, multi-span measurements were performed over the high PMD fiber, which has near <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics</b> for the differential group delay (DGD) as well as higher order PMD as expected for a long, mode-coupled fiber. Transmission of eighty channels was achieved over 8 100 km of TrueWave Reduced Slope fiber plus distributed high PMD fiber, where individual channels had instantaneous DGD as high as 127 ps. The depen-dence of the OSNR penalty on the launch state of polarization was evaluated and found to be minimal, and the contribution of fiber nonlinearities to the transmission penalty was evaluated for two different per-channel launch powers. Finally, using a transceiver equipped with forward-error-correction, error-free transmission over the 800 -km link was demonstrated over a 10 -day period; during this time the DGD of the measured channel varied from 13 to 116 ps.

40|$|The Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST) {{satellite}} detected {{intense and}} coherent 5 – 20 m electric field {{structures in the}} high-latitude topside auroral ionosphere between the altitudes of 350 km and 650 km. These electric fields appear to belong to electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves {{in terms of their}} frequency and wavelengths. Numerical simulations of the response of an electron plasma to the parallel components of these fields show that the waves are likely to excite a wave-driven parallel ion acoustic (IA) instability, through the creation of a highly non-Maxwellian electron distribution function, which when combined with the (assumed) Maxwellian ion distribution function provides inverse Landau damping. Because the counter-streaming threshold for excitation of EIC waves is well below that for excitation of IA waves (assuming <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics)</b> our results suggest a possible two step mechanism for destabilization of IA waves. Combining this simulation result with the observational fact that these EIC waves share a common phenomenology with the naturally enhanced IA lines (NEIALS) observed by incoherent scatter radars, especially that they both occur near field-aligned currents, leads to the proposition that this two-step mechanism is an alternative path to NEIALS...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop tools for {{observers}} {{to use when}} analysing nebular spectra for temperatures and metallicities, with two goals: to present a new, simple method to calculate equilibrium electron temperatures for collisionally excited line flux ratios, using the latest atomic data; and to adapt current methods to include the effects of possible non-equilibrium 'κ' electron energy distributions. Adopting recent collision strength data for [O iii], [S iii], [O ii], [S ii], and [N ii], we find that existing methods based on older atomic data seriously overestimate the electron temperatures, even when considering purely <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics.</b> If κ distributions exist in H ii regions and planetary nebulae {{as they do in}} solar system plasmas, it is important to investigate the observational consequences. This paper continues our previous work on the κ distribution (Nicholls et al. 2012). We present simple formulaic methods that allow observers to (a) measure equilibrium electron temperatures and atomic abundances using the latest atomic data, and (b) to apply simple corrections to existing equilibrium analysis techniques to allow for possible non-equilibrium effects. These tools should lead to better consistency in temperature and abundance measurements, and a clearer understanding of the physics of H ii regions and planetary nebulae. Comment: 15 figures.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{prescription}} for the electron energy dis-tribution function that allows the representation of suprathermal electron tails such as those produced by the nonlinear effects of plasma microturbulence. The model is specified by a bulk temperature, a tail fraction, a tail energy scaling parameter and a tail spread parameter. The parametric distribution func-tion is combined with a multi-level atomic model of argon and {{used to calculate the}} reaction rates for 23 collisional excitation transitions from ground state by electron impact by applying a high-accuracy quadra-ture on the convolution integrands containing the appropriate cross-sections. The prime goal was the study of the parametric dependencies of the mini-mum ionization characteristic length on the tail pa-rameters. Calculations are compared with the re-cent measurements of the dimensions of an ioniza-tion “front ” observed in a low-power MPD thruster by Randolph et. al. The ionization length which is at least 10 times smaller than that calculated assuming <b>Maxwellian</b> <b>statistics</b> is shown to be more consistent with distributions having suprathermal tail fractions and energies that could be produced by plasma micro-turbulence. Tail fractions of about 1 %, under some conditions, can reduce the spatial extent of ionization to the millimeter level. Typical tail parameters ob-tained from a particle simulation code designed for the study of anomalous ionization were used to illus-trate the model’s implications...|$|E
