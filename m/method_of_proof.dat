While earlier Greek proofs were largely geometric demonstrations, the development of arithmetic and algebra by Islamic mathematicians allowed more general proofs that no longer depended on geometry.

[...] He used this method to provide a proof {{of the existence of}} irrational numbers. An inductive proof for arithmetic sequences was introduced in the Al-Fakhri (1000) by Al-Karaji, who used it to prove the binomial theorem and properties of Pascal's triangle.

2500|$|Zeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, had {{the idea}} of a {{standard}} argument pattern found in the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> known as reductio ad absurdum.

Therefore, Zeno and his teacher are seen as the first to apply the art of logic. [...] Plato's dialogue Parmenides portrays Zeno as claiming to have written a book defending the monism of Parmenides by demonstrating the absurd consequence of assuming that there is plurality. Zeno famously used this method to develop his paradoxes in his arguments against motion. Such dialectic reasoning later became popular.

[...] Bolzano's proof relied on the method of bisection: the sequence was placed into an interval that was then divided into two equal parts, and a part containing infinitely many terms of the sequence was selected. [...] The process could then be repeated by dividing the resulting smaller interval into smaller and smaller parts until it closes down on the desired limit point.
