5|$|In {{addition}} to the 16 living orders, there are 9 extinct orders and one superfamily known only from fossils. The relationship of these to living groups and to each other is controversial. The extinct Arthropleuridea was long considered a distinct <b>myriapod</b> class, although work in the early 21st century established {{the group as a}} subclass of millipedes. Several living orders also appear in the fossil record. Below are two proposed arrangements of fossil millipede groups. Extinct groups are indicated with a dagger (†). The extinct order Zosterogrammida, a chilognath of uncertain position, is not shown.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, the Acari (mites) {{collection}} of MZUSP {{was considered the}} second-largest in Brazil with 1,500 lots. The paleontological collection harbors fossils extracted from Brazilian sedimentary basins, including Bauru, São Francisco and Araripe. In 2000, the <b>Myriapod</b> (millipedes and centipedes) collection was considered the largest {{of its kind in}} Brazil with nearly 8,800 lots.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of centipedes extends back to , during the Late Silurian. They {{belong to the}} subphylum Myriapoda which {{includes}} Diplopoda, Symphyla, and Pauropoda. The oldest known fossil land animal, Pneumodesmus newmani, is a <b>myriapod.</b> Being among the earliest terrestrial animals, centipedes {{were one of the}} first to fill a fundamental niche as ground level generalist predators in detrital food webs. Today, centipedes are abundant and exist in many harsh habitats.|$|E

500|$|Although a {{prolific}} describer of species, his legacy to <b>myriapod</b> taxonomy has been mixed. Many of Chamberlin's descriptions of centipedes and millipedes were often brief and/or unillustrated, or illustrated in ways which hindered {{their use in}} identification by other researchers. He described some new species based solely on location, or on subtle leg differences now known to change during molting, and many of Chamberlin's names have subsequently been found to be, or are suspected to be, synonyms of species already described. Biologist Richard Hoffman, who worked with Chamberlin on the 1958 checklist, later described Chamberlin as [...] "an exemplar of minimal taxonomy", and stated his taxonomic work on Central American myriapods [...] "introduced far more problems than progress, a pattern which was to persist for many decades to come". Hoffman wrote Chamberlin was [...] "an admitted 'alpha taxonomist' [...] whose main interest was naming new species", although recognized Chamberlin's work with stone centipedes as pioneering, and of a quality unmatched in Chamberlin's later work.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is widely}} {{agreed that the}} insect, <b>myriapod</b> and {{crustacean}} heads are very similar. The apparent lack of a second antenna in insects and myriapods is explained {{by the idea that}} this appendage has been lost, leaving an appendage-less segment known as the intercalary segment. Modern phylogenies do not in general support an insect-myriapod relationship, suggesting that the second antenna has been lost independently in each group, perhaps {{as a result of a}} convergent adaptation to life on land. Furthermore, there is general agreement that the mandibles, first maxillae and labium/second maxillae each represent a post-oral segment; and that the first antenna [...] represents a preoral segment.|$|E
2500|$|Amber {{specimen}} JZC Bu116 has {{a larger}} number of workers than JZC Bu1814, with a total of twelve workers belonging to two genera. [...] Eleven of the ants are G. spiralis and the remaining worker is from the haidomyrmecine species Haidomyrmex zigrasi. [...] The amber is broken into two portions and has been polished. [...] The original amber piece that the specimen was from was likely larger, and the twelve ants are only a minimum number for what the grouping was. [...] A large number of other arthropods are preserved in the amber with the ants, including several other hymenopteran families, a dermapteran, an orthopteran, seven dipterans, two arachnids, a <b>myriapod,</b> and a large blattodean. [...] The blattodean is central to four of the ants, three G. sprialis and the H. zigrasi worker, suggesting the roach may have been either a potential food source, or one being actively foraged on. [...] Due to a lack of orientation to the roach however, the possibility that the other eight G. sprialis were recruited to the prey blattodean is not clear.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} for this relationship between <b>myriapods</b> and chelicerates derives from comparisons of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes, mitochondrial ribosomal RNA genes, and protein-coding genes. More recent molecular studies, however, favour grouping the <b>myriapods</b> with crustaceans and insects, rather than with the chelicerates, {{to make up the}} clade Mandibulata.|$|R

2500|$|A typical insect head {{possesses}} {{a pair of}} antennae; eyes; mandibles, labrum, maxillae and labium (the latter four forming the cluster of [...] "mouth parts", no. 32. in the diagram). Lying above the oesophagus is the brain or supraesophageal ganglion, divided into three pairs of ganglia: the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and tritocerebrum {{from front to back}} (collectively no. 5 in the diagram). Nerves from the protocerebrum lead to the large compound eyes; from the deutocerebrum to the antennae; and [...] from the tritocerebrum to the labrum and stomatogastric nervous system. Circum-oesophageal connectives lead from the tritocerebrum around the gut to connect the brain to the ventral ganglionated nerve cord: nerves from the first three pairs of ganglia lead to the mandibles, maxillae and labium, respectively. The position of the mouth and the circum-oesophageal connectives allows a distinction to be made between pre- and post-oral structures; although it should be borne in mind that because structures can move around during development, a pre-oral position of a structure in the adult does not necessarily prove that its developmental origin is from there.
