25|$|PGPencryption uses {{a serial}} {{combination}} of hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally public-key cryptography; each step uses {{one of several}} supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a user name or an e-mail address. The first version of this system was generally known as a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system, which uses a hierarchical approach based on certificate authority and which was added to PGP implementations later. Current versions of PGP encryption include both options through an automated key <b>management</b> <b>server.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An AMT PC stores system {{configuration}} information in protected memory. For PCs version 4.0 and higher, this information can include the name(s) of appropriate [...] "whitelist" [...] <b>management</b> <b>servers</b> for the company. When a user tries {{to initiate a}} remote session between the wired PC and a company server from an open LAN, AMT sends the stored information to a <b>management</b> presence <b>server</b> (MPS) in the [...] "demilitarized zone" [...] ("DMZ") that exists between the corporate firewall and client (the user PC's) firewalls. The MPS uses that information to help authenticate the PC. The MPS then mediates communication between the laptop and the company's <b>management</b> <b>servers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The hosts while booting up pings to {{the central}} <b>management</b> <b>server</b> to check whether the central <b>management</b> <b>server</b> is up and active. It {{registers}} with the central <b>management</b> <b>server</b> and requests for its policies which it should implement. The central <b>management</b> <b>server</b> provides the host with its security policies.For example, a license server or a security clearance server can be asked if a certain communication should be permitted. A conventional firewall could do the same, but it lacks important knowledge about {{the context of the}} request. End systems may know things like which files are involved, and what their security levels might be. Such information could be carried over a network protocol, but only by adding complexity.|$|E

50|$|Because {{correlation}} {{occurs at}} the <b>management</b> <b>server</b> (so as {{to be able to}} correlate events from different managed nodes), it does not reduce traffic to the <b>management</b> <b>server.</b> On the other hand, effective use of de-duplication at the managed node will reduce such traffic.|$|E
