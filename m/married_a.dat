30|$|Figure  1 {{shows that}} {{migrants}} who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German have lower intensions to return {{both before and}} after marriage than their counterparts who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse. Among women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse, we actually observe a drop in intentions to return a few years before marriage. For women who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German spouse, intentions to return slightly increase for a few years subsequent to marriage. We see a similar increase in intentions to return in the years around marriage for male migrants who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> non-German, and their intentions to return remain high (about 87 % intend to return). In comparison, far fewer men who <b>marry</b> <b>a</b> German spouse intend to return throughout the 15 -year period (roughly 77 %).|$|R

5|$|Most ancient {{historians and}} modern {{scholars}} agree that Zenobia was displayed in Aurelian's 274 triumph; Zosimus {{was the only}} source {{to say that the}} queen died before reaching Rome, making his account questionable. A public humiliation (as recounted by Malalas) is a plausible scenario, since Aurelian would probably have wanted to publicize his suppression of the Palmyrene rebellion. Only Malalas, however, describes Zenobia's beheading; according to the other historians, her life was spared after Aurelian's triumph. The Augustan History recorded that Aurelian gave Zenobia a villa in Tibur near Hadrian's Villa, where she lived with her children. Zonaras wrote that Zenobia <b>married</b> <b>a</b> nobleman, and Syncellus that she <b>married</b> <b>a</b> Roman senator. The house she reportedly occupied became a tourist attraction in Rome.|$|E
