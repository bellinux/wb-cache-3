Matejko however did not simply illustrate the history, he intended his paintings to have powerful educational and emotional values.|$|E

5|$|The {{main title}} music, a tense, hurtling piece, {{sets the tone}} of {{impending}} violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|Argentine {{football}} finally inscribed {{their name}} on the winner's list in 1964 when Independiente became the champions after disposing of reigning champions Santos and Uruguayan side Nacional in the finals. Independiente successfully defended the title in 1965; Peñarol would defeat River Plate in a playoff to win their third title, and Racing {{would go on to}} claim the spoils in 1967. One of the most important <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament's early history occurred in 1968 which saw Estudiantes participate for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Female {{friendship}}s {{are central}} to both of Wollstonecraft's novels, {{but it is the}} friendship between Maria and Jemima, the servant charged with watching over her in the insane asylum, that is the most historically significant. This friendship, based on a sympathetic bond of motherhood, between an upper-class woman and a lower-class woman {{is one of the first}} <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of feminist literature that hints at a cross-class argument, that is, that women of different economic positions have the same interests because they are women.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{publications}} in various media {{have been written}} {{on the subject of}} Edward's character. Reviewers praised Edward as a balance between the typical clever kid and the stubborn kid persona. Additionally, his comedic moments have been celebrated as some of the best <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series. His Japanese and English voice actors, Romi Park and Vic Mignogna, have both been praised for their performances as Edward Elric and have won several awards for their work. Numerous pieces of merchandise have been released bearing Edward's likeness, including key chains and action figures.|$|E
5|$|Rossi {{retired from}} MIT in 1970. From 1974 to 1980 he {{taught at the}} University of Palermo. In {{retirement}} he wrote a number of monographs, and a 1990 autobiography, <b>Moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Life of a Scientist, which was published by Cambridge University Press. He died from a cardiac arrest {{at his home in}} Cambridge on 21 November 1993. He was survived by his wife, Nora, daughters Florence and Linda and son Frank. He was cremated, and his ashes are in the graveyard of the church of San Miniato al Monte, which overlooks Florence and the hill of Arcetri.|$|E

5|$|The Dying Swan (originally The Swan) is a solo choreographed by Mikhail Fokine in 1905 to Camille Saint-Saëns's Le Cygne from Le Carnaval des animaux as a pièce d'occasion for the {{ballerina}} Anna Pavlova, {{who performed}} it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{life of a}} swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations and various adaptations.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels and Triple H. One spot in the match saw Michaels miss a flying bodypress and crash through a {{broadcast}} table. Another included Triple H assaulting Michaels with a sledgehammer. The last <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match saw Benoit force Michaels submit to the sharpshooter to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|With {{ten minutes}} remaining, he was reintroduced by manager Mickey Harte, {{likely due to}} his {{experience}} as {{the only member of}} the team who had played in an All-Ireland final before. This reintroduction, while not the first time it had happened (blood substitutions had been used sporadically, for example), was seen as one of the greatest <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GAA in the last forty years.|$|E

5|$|As a third-person shooter with an {{emphasis}} on squad-based tactics, players can issue commands to Sergeant Lugo and Lieutenant Adams, who accompany the player for most of the game. Available commands include focusing fire on one particular target and ordering medical attention for an injured squad member. Adams can defeat enemies by using heavy gadgets or throwing grenades, while Lugo provides sniping assistance. Environmental hazards like sandstorms occasionally occur, drastically reducing the player's vision and visibility. Sand becomes a key gameplay mechanic and players can manipulate it at scripted <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, such as triggering a sand avalanche to bury enemies alive. When a grenade explodes on sand, dust clouds that can blind enemies are formed. Sand sometimes opens up new paths to allow players to progress.|$|E
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} {{the contents of his}} larder at home and wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out of}} trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race came from a near-fatal {{accident}} when stunt man Joe Canutt, Yakima Canutt's son, was tossed into the air by accident; he incurred a minor chin injury. Marton {{wanted to keep the}} shot, but Zimbalist felt the footage was unusable. Marton conceived the idea of showing that Ben-Hur was able to land on and cling to the front of his chariot, then scramble back into the quadriga while the horses kept going. The long shot of Canutt's accident was cut together with a close-up of Heston climbing back aboard, resulting in one of the race's most memorable moments. Boyd did all but two of his own stunts. For the sequence where Messala is dragged beneath a chariot's horses and trampled, Boyd wore steel armor under his costume and acted out the close-up shot and the shot of him on his back, attempting to climb up into the horses' harness to escape injury. A dummy was used to obtain the trampling shot in this sequence.|$|E

5|$|Southeast Asia abounds {{with tales}} of {{historic}} cannon: many {{are said to be}} imbued with supernatural powers; some are revered for their cultural and spiritual significance; others are notable for having been present at defining <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region's history. Burma's Glass Palace Chronicle recounts a story about the Burmese-Siamese war (1765–1767) that illustrates the divine properties ascribed to certain cannon. After attempts to repel Burmese attacks on the Siamese capital had proved unsuccessful, the King of Siam ordered that the city's guardian spirit, a great cannon called Dwarawadi, be used to halt the advance. The gun was ceremoniously hoisted and aimed at the enemy's camp, but the powder failed to ignite. Fearing the guardian of the city had abandoned them, the king's officials implored their sovereign to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The 3D cutscenes were {{improved}} with motion capture technology {{to create a}} more cinematic experience. The stylized comic-like cut scenes from the first game carried over into the sequel, though they were reserved for bigger <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. The 3D cutscenes were used to tell the story going on in the moment, while the comic-like cutscenes were used to tell a large piece of the story in a short amount of time. In addition to the cut scenes, the moral element of the original also transferred to the sequel. When incorporating the player's Karma decisions from the first game into the second, it was found challenging to balance the effects of importing saves from the original Infamous and keeping the game interesting for those who did not. The melee combat in the game was redesigned from the original with finishing moves being added. A large focus on the melee combat was the presentation, which was meant to make the player feel super-powered.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific <b>moments</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
