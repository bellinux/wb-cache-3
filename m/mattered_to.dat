5|$|PedroII {{began his}} rule as a figurehead who held {{together}} a realm {{on the verge}} of disintegration. He quickly matured and successfully navigated the empire through repeated and serious crises. By the time of Afonso's death, the nation was entering an unprecedented era of prosperity, development and tranquility. Even as the emperor's political successes and policies began to bear fruit, the lack of a male heir caused him to lose motivation to promote the imperial office as a position to be carried on by his descendants. The emperor turned away from personal and family ties, and focused on upholding the constitution while directing Brazil toward policies that furthered modernization and social advancement. The future of the monarchy as an institution no longer <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> him, and in 1889, he was deposed in a coup, marking the end of the Empire of Brazil.|$|E

Fern's great popularity {{has been attributed to}} her conversational style and sense of what <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> her mostly middle-class female readers. By 1855, Fern was the highest-paid columnist in the United States, commanding $100 per week for her New York Ledger column.|$|E

In March 2006 he was critical of the Ralph Klein government for insufficiently funding school maintenance after {{the roof of a}} school in his riding collapsed. In 2007 and during the 2008 election campaign, he advocated rent controls to deal with the tight housing market in urban Alberta, although the position of the Ed Stelmach government was that they would be unhelpful.|$|E

25|$|Researchers from OPERA {{measured}} the remaining delays and calibrations {{not included in}} the CERN calculation: those shown in Fig.4. The neutrinos were detected in an underground lab, but the common clock from the GPS satellites was visible only above ground level. The clock value noted above-ground had to be transmitted to the underground detector with an 8km fiber cable. The delays associated with this transfer of time had to be accounted for in the calculation. How much the error could vary (the standard deviation of the errors) <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> the analysis, and had to be calculated for each part of the timing chain separately. Special techniques were used to measure the length of the fiber and its consequent delay, required as part of the overall calculation.|$|E

Despite the presence of five court-appointed attorneys, Bundy again handled much of his own defense. From the beginning, he [...] "sabotaged the entire defense effort out of spite, distrust, and grandiose delusion", Nelson later wrote.

500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity."

500|$|The {{book has}} a {{particular}} appeal to young people, an appeal that led historian James Baker to describe it as [...] "more important than its detractors think, although {{not as important as}} Rand fans imagine". Philosopher Allan Bloom said the novel is [...] "hardly literature", but when he asked his students which books <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> them, someone always was influenced by The Fountainhead. Journalist Nora Ephron wrote that she had loved the novel when she was 18, but admitted that she [...] "missed the point", which she suggested is largely subliminal sexual metaphor. Ephron wrote that she decided upon rereading that [...] "it is better read when one is young enough to miss the point. Otherwise, one cannot help thinking it is a very silly book." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{mass media}} has often speculated about a romantic {{relationship}} between Vidya and her co-actors, but she has strongly denied these reports. In 2009, Vidya {{was involved in a}} controversy when she mentioned a previous relationship in which [...] "caustic remarks" [...] were made at her due to her weight. She said, [...] "If someone who matters to you takes you down, it can break you. That someone whose approval <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> me started to constantly find faults with me. At that point of time, it was important to walk away from that relationship." [...] Though she refused to name the person, tabloid reports suggested that she was referring to Shahid Kapoor (her co-star in Kismat Konnection). Kapoor, however, denied the allegations. During an interview in May 2012, Vidya announced that she was dating Siddharth Roy Kapur, the CEO of UTV Motion Pictures. On 14 December 2012, the couple were married in a private ceremony in Bandra, Mumbai.|$|E

The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is better than no cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E

Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as [...] "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." [...] London Business School academics called her a [...] "dynamic entrepreneur" [...] worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that [...] "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly <b>mattered</b> <b>to</b> her." [...] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted: [...] "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies."
