40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} mirror movements seen in X-linked Kallmann's syndrome, we measured changes of regional cerebral blood flow with H 2 15 O-PET. We studied six right-handed Kallmann male subjects and six matched, right-handed control subjects during an externally paced finger opposition task. The analyses were done both on a single subject and a group basis. The Kallmann group showed a strong primary motor cortex (M 1) activation contralateral to the voluntarily moved hand, {{but there was also}} a significant degree of M 1 activation ipsilateral to the voluntarily moved hand, i. e. contralateral to the <b>mirroring</b> <b>hand.</b> However, when comparing contralateral to ipsilateral M 1 activation, the M 1 activation contralateral to the voluntarily moved hand was significantly stronger. In the controls, significant increases in rCBF were seen in the contralateral M 1 during voluntary movement of either hand; a small ipsilateral M 1 activation was found in two out of six normal subjects when they moved their left hand. In a second experiment it was shown that, in two out of two Kallmann subjects, passive movements of the right hand resulted in left M 1 activation that was similar to the activation in the left M 1 when subjects made mirror movements with their right hand. This suggests, but does not prove, that the small but significant activation of the ipsilateral M 1 in Kallmann's subjects may be due to sensory feedback from the involuntarily <b>mirroring</b> <b>hand...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Mirror</b> <b>hand</b> (ulnar dimelia) is an {{extremely}} rare congenital anomaly of the upper limb [1]. Characteristically there is duplication of the ulna with both ulnae facing each other [2, 3], absent radius and multiple fingers which are symmetrical around the midline. There are few descriptions of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity with different variants in the literature. Al-Qattan and Al-Thunayan [4] proposed a classification of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity based on {{presence or absence of}} other congenital anomalies and the type of forearm bones present. Type  1 includes ulnar dimelia, type  2 includes two ulnae and one radius, type  3 includes one radius and one ulna, type  4 includes associated anomalies (syndromic) and type  5 includes multiple hands on a single limb. In the literature several variants of <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> deformity have been described. Multiple fingers with one ulna and one distinct radius [5], multiple fingers with two ulnae (one vestigial) and one radius [6] and multiple fingers with two ulnae (one vestigial) and one radius with duplicated proximal humerus [7] have been described. In the literature, no case has been reported so far with type  1 <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> variant, in which complete duplication of hand with seven fingers and double ulna occur and one ulna follows the other, instead of facing each other as mirror image.|$|E

40|$|Mirror visual {{feedback}} (MVF) is potentially {{a powerful tool}} to facilitate recovery of disordered movement and stimulate activation of under-active brain areas due to stroke. The neural mechanisms underlying MVF have therefore been a focus of recent inquiry. Although {{it is known that}} sensorimotor areas can be activated via mirror feedback, the network interactions driving this effect remain unknown. The aim of the current study was to fill this gap by using dynamic causal modeling to test the interactions between regions in the frontal and parietal lobes that may be important for modulating the activation of the ipsilesional motor cortex during mirror {{visual feedback}} of unaffected hand movement in stroke patients. Our intent was to distinguish between two theoretical neural mechanisms that might mediate ipsilateral activation in response to mirror-feedback: transfer of information between bilateral motor cortices versus recruitment of regions comprising an action observation network which in turn modulate the motor cortex. In an event-related fMRI design, fourteen chronic stroke subjects performed goal-directed finger flexion movements with their unaffected hand while observing real-time visual feedback of the corresponding (veridical) or opposite (<b>mirror)</b> <b>hand</b> in virtual reality. Among 30 plausible network models that were tested, the winning model revealed significant mirror feedback-based modulation of the ipsilesional motor cortex arising from the contralesional parietal cortex, in a region along the rostral extent of the intraparietal sulcus. No winning model was identified for the veridical feedback condition. We discuss our findings in the context of supporting the latter hypothesis, that mirror feedback-based activation of motor cortex may be attributed to engagement of a contralateral (contralesional) action observation network. These findings may have important implications for identifying putative cortical areas, which may be targeted with non-invasive brain stimulation as a means of potentiating the effects of mirror training...|$|E
40|$|The {{congenital}} {{differences of}} the thumb, that have as their main characteristic it’ s hypoplasia or aplasia, are very important, since they deprive {{the child of}} the unique in human species function of opposition. It is hard to estimate their incidence {{because of the presence}} of different classification systems and the deficiency of the registration mechanisms. Besides thumb hypoplasia or aplasia that occurs in isolation, and which is recently considered to be part of the radial longitudinal deficiency sequence (radial club hand), there are other congenital differences in which the thumb is hypoplastic or aplastic or there is deficiency of the 1 st web space and incapability of opposition. Such anomalies are bifid thumb, triphalangeal thumb in the form of “five fingered hand”, <b>mirror</b> <b>hand</b> where there are many hypoplastic digits in the place of the thumb, syndactyly between thumb and index, symbrachydactyly, the atypical form of cleft hand in which the radial digits are attached together, the constriction ring syndrome that concerns the thumb and generalized abnormalities and syndromes as Apert syndrome, Poland syndrome, Holt-Oram syndrome and arthrogryposis. In our effort to classify the 110 patients of our series according to the modified Blauth classification we realized that 41 % of them could not be included in any category. Thus we created a new classification system based on the well known IFSSH classification system for the congenital anomalies of the upper limb, in which we managed to include all of our hypoplastic thumb cases. Our classification system has as basic categories the failure of formation/undergrowth (A), the failure of differentiation (B), the duplication (C), the constriction ring syndrome (D) and the generalized anomalies and syndromes (E). We concluded that the only category of the IFSSH classification system that did not concern the hypoplastic thumb was overgrowth. As far as management is concerned, multiple surgical interventions were used in cases that there was such indication and parental consent, such as 1 st web space deepening, opponensplasty using the abductor digiti quinti or the flexor digitorum superficialis of the ring finger, lengthening of the metacarpal or the phalanx by using distraction osteogenesis, non vascularized phalangeal transfers from a toe or bone allografts, microvascular free toe transfer and index pollicization. In most of the cases the result was very good, in terms of function and cosmesis, in the opinion of both the patient’s environment and the surgeon. A table with the therapeutical guidelines, based on indications, was created. In the future it is possible that the management options will be modified, mainly with the evolution of genetic engineering. Until then it is crucial to use a common classification system and management guidelines that will include the whole of the congenital differences that concern the hypoplasia or aplasia of the most important human digit, the thumb. ...|$|E
