40|$|We studied whether ethanol is {{sulphonated}} {{in humans}} with {{the perspective of}} using the urinary excretion of <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> after ethanol consumption as a biomarker for SULT (sulphotransferase) activity. We developed a sensitive and selective HPLC–MS/MS method for determining <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> in urine. Ten volunteers received a low dose of ethanol (0. 1  g/kg of body mass). In general, excretion of <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> was maximal in {{the first or second}} hour after dosage. Within 8  h, 2. 5 – 6. 8  μmol of <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> was excreted. A 5 -fold increase in the dose of ethanol led to an increase in the amount of <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> excreted within 8  h (28 – 95 μmol) and the presence of this metabolite in urine for at least 24  h. Since <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> was still being excreted for a substantial period after the elimination of ethanol, it might be used as a medium-time biomarker for preceding ethanol consumption. We have expressed previously all human SULT forms identified in Salmonella typhimurium. Ethanol sulphonation was studied in cytosolic preparations of these strains. The highest activities were observed with SULT 1 A 2, 1 B 1 and 1 C 2, followed by 1 A 3. Activities were markedly lower with SULT 1 E 1, 1 A 1 and 2 A 1, and were negligible with SULT 1 C 1, 2 B 1 a, 2 B 1 b and 4 A 1. If the expression levels in tissues are additionally taken into account, SULT 1 A 3 might be the predominant form for the sulphonation of ethanol in vivo, although a robust estimate requires further studies. With this limitation, urinary <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> excretion appears very promising as a biomarker for SULT activity in vivo...|$|R

The results were compared with self-report of alcohol consumption and traditional blood biomarkers for chronically elevated alcohol consumption as carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. EtG was found in distal parts of hair only, whereas the proximal parts were negative. Furthermore, FAEE concentrations were found in the typical distribution over the hair length and showed values typical for either moderate social drinking or abstinence. CDT was above cut-off in 9 out of 16 analyses with a decreasing tendency and the lowest values in the last 2 months before the end of sampling.

40|$|In {{abstinence}} maintenance programs, for reissuing {{the driving}} licence and in workplace monitoring programs abstinence from ethanol and its proof are demanded. Various monitoring programs that mainly use ethyl glucuronide (EtG) as alcohol consumption marker have been established.

In Germany, these "alcohol-free" beverages may still have an ethanol content of up to 0. 5 vol. % without the duty of declaration.

Design, setting, participants, measurements In Alberta, Canada, 534 drivers, convicted of {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol (DUI), installed IIDs and agreed to participate in a research study. IID BAC tests are an established proxy for predicting future DUI convictions. Three risk groups were defined by rates of failed BAC tests. Program entry and follow-up blood samples (n = 302, 171) were used to measure phosphatidyl ethanol (PETH), carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT), gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and other biomarkers. Program entry urine (n = 130) was analyzed for ethyl glucuronide (ETG) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (ETS). Entry hair samples were tested for fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) (n = 92) and ETG (n = 146). Psychometric measures included the DSM- 4 Diagnostic Interview Schedule Alcohol Module, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the time-line follow-back (TLFB), the Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DRINC) and the Temptation and Restraint Inventory (TRI). Findings Except for FAEE, all alcohol biomarkers were related significantly to the interlock BAC test profiles; higher marker levels predicted higher rates of interlock BAC test failures. PETH, the strongest with an overall analysis of variance F ratio of 35. 5, had significant correlations with all nine of the other alcohol biomarkers and with 16 of 19 psychometric variables.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{circumstances}} of death, the degree of inebriation is of importance in many cases, but for several reasons {{the determination of the}} ethanol concentration in post-mortem samples can be challenging and the synopsis of ethanol and the direct consumption markers ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (EtS) has proved to be useful. The use of a rather stable matrix like vitreous humor offers further advantages. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the concentrations of ethanol and the biomarkers in the robust matrix of vitreous humor and to compare them with the respective levels in peripheral venous blood and urine. Samples of urine, blood from the femoral vein and vitreous humor were taken from 26 deceased with suspected ethanol consumption prior to death and analyzed for ethanol, EtS and EtG. In the urine samples creatinine was also determined. The personal data, {{the circumstances of}} death, the post-mortem interval and the information about ethanol consumption prior to death were recorded. EtG and EtS analysis in urine was performed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, creatinine concentration was determined using the Jaffé reaction and ethanol was detected by HS-GC-FID and by an ADH-based method. In general, the highest concentrations of the analytes were found in urine and showed statistical significance. The mean concentrations of EtG were 62. 8 mg/L (EtG 100 206. 5 mg/L) in urine, 4. 3 mg/L in blood and 2. 1 mg/L in vitreous humor. EtS was found in the following mean concentrations: 54. 6 mg/L in urine (EtS 100 123. 1 mg/L), 1. 8 mg/L in blood and 0. 9 mg/L in vitreous humor. Ethanol was detected in more vitreous humor samples (mean concentration 2. 0 g/kg) than in blood and urine (mean concentration 1. 6 g/kg and 2. 1 g/kg respectively).

40|$|Paramagnetic {{resonance}} (p. r.) at {{low temperatures}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} substances in the solid state. Paramagnetic ions in the solid state are subjected to strong crystalline electric fields which profoundly modify the magnetic properties of the free ion. The orbital momentum of the free ion is completely or partially "quenched", leaving the spin momentum unaffected, except to a small extent due to spin-orbit coupling. The ground state consists of a number of levels, generally singlets or doublets. The separations of these levels may be varied by the application of an external magnetic field. If two levels have energies W 1 and W 2 and an external r. f. magnetic field, of frequency v such that h v = W 1 - W 2, is applied, transitions can be excited between the levels, within the limitations of certain selection rules. As the population of the two levels depends upon the Boltzman distribution there is a nett absorption of energy from the r. f. field when transitions occur. If this energy is lost to the crystal lattice quickly enough it is not reradiated. In practice a fixed frequency is chosen and the separation of the energy levels is adjusted by applying an external magnetic field so that the above condition is satisfied. By studying the fields at which the absorption occurs the position of the energy levels in zero field can be inferred. The energies of the levels may be expressed concisely {{in the form of a}} "spin hamiltonlan" which involves a number of parameters which have to be found experimentally. The general spin hamiltonian for an ion in a field of rhombic symmetry is: H = β(g x H x S x + g y H y S y + g z H z S z) + D [S 2 z - 1 ⁄ 3 S(S + 1) ] + E(S 2 x - S 2 y) + A x S x I x + A y S y I y + A z S z I z S is the effective spin chosen so that the multiplicity of the ground state is 2 S + l, β is the Bohr magneton, the g's are spectroscopic splitting factors along the axes of the crystal field. D represents the effect of the axial component of the field along the z axis and E represents the rhombic component of the crystal field. The transitions between the levels defined by these parameters give rise to the so-called fine structure lines. I is the nuclear spin and the terms in A, S and I represent the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and of the nucleus. This interaction splits each fine structure line into 2 I + l equally Intense, equally spaced hyperfine lines. Thus the number of hyperfine lines defines the nuclear spin unambiguously. Also the separatlon between the lines proportional to tbe nuclear magnetic moment so that in certain cases this can be estimated. The specimens used have usually consisted of single crystals of a diamagnetic salt containing about 1 % of an isomorphous paramagnetic salt. This dilution separates the paramagnetic ions and reduces tbe line width caused by their mutual interaction. Tbe experimental arrangement is of the standard type used in Oxford. Some refinements of technique have been used for particular experiments which needed them. Experiments have been performed at wavelengths between 10 em and 0. 8 mm. A klystron oscillator, run from a stabilised power pack, feeds power to a half wave resonant cavity which contains tbe sample placed in a position where the r. f. magnetic field is strong. This cavity can be placed in a dewar vessel of refrigerant and between tbe poles of an electromagnet. A wavemeter measures the wavelength and a crystal detector rectifies tbe power coupled out of the resonant cavity. The external field has a small 50 c/s modulation superimposed on it so that an absorption signal is swept through 100 times a second. The signal from the detector may then be amplified in a video-amplifier. If the amplified signal is fed to the Y-plates of an oscilloscope, which has a correctly phased 50 c/s time base, the trace displays a graph of absorption agalnst magnetic field within the region covered by the field modulation. This technique enables a spectrum to be analysed very rapidly. Complex Cyanides The p. r. spectra of two complex cyanides of divalent ions, K 4 V(CN) 6 3 H 2 O and K 4 Mn(CN) 6 3 H 2 O, have been studied. The orbital momentum of the vanadous ion is completely quenched so that it is in an S = 3 / 2 state and its behaviour resembles that of the same ion in ionic crystals. The g-value, 1. 992, is closer to the free spin value and the crystal field parameters, D = - 0. 0264 ± 0. 0004 em - 1 and E = - 0. 0072 ± 0. 0004 cm - 1, are smaller showing that the effect of higher levels is less than in the ionic salts. The hyperfine structure constant A = - 0. 00555 ± 0. 00003 cm - 1 is only 36 % smaller than in the ionic salts, showing that the configurational interaction which produces the hyperfine structure is not greatly modified by the covalent bonding. In the manganous ion the cubic field does not completely lift the orbital degeneracy of the ground state. The lowest triplet is split into a singlet and a higher doublet by the rhombic component of the crystal field so that the g-values differ widely from the free spin value. The ion behaves with effective spin S = 1 / 2 and has g-valuee g x = 2. 624 Â± 0. 008, g y = 2. 182 ± 0. 008 and g z = 0. 72 ± 0. 05. The hyperfine structure is also anisotropic and the hyperfine structure constants are A x = 0. 00845 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1, A y = 0. 00465 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1 and A z = 0. 0083 ± 0. 0013 cm - 1. The manganous ion in this type of compound resembles the titanic ion in ionic compounds and an attempt has been made to fit the parameters with the titanium theory of Abragam and Pryce (1951). This gives reasonable values for the configurational interaction constant and the mean value of the radius of the electron orbit. Nuclear spins The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of vanadium 50 has been measured in a crystal of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 3 H 2 O containing a few milligrams of vanadium enhanced to contain ~ 20 % 50 V. The spin was found to be six and the ratio of the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios of 50 V/ 51 V, 0. 380, agrees well with the value measured by nuclear resonance of 0. 3792. The spin and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio fit well with the values calculated by Hitchcock (1952) using a j-j spin-orbit coupling model of the nucleus and assuming &delta-function potential. The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of radioactive cobalt 57 have been measured in a crystal of K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 6 H 2 O containing > 0. 5 μgrams of 57 Co. The crystal also contains some stable 59 Co up to 2. 4 μgrams total cobalt content. Only one set of hyperfine structure lines is resolved so tnat the spin and magnetic moment of 57 Co are tht same as 59 Co; i. e. the spin is 7 / 2 and the magnetic moment is 4. 6 ± 0. 2 nuclear magnetons. Chromic methylamine alum Paramagnetic resonance measurements on crystals of Cr(CH 3 NH 3 (SO 4) 12 H 2 2 O show that the crystals undergo a change in strucure at 157 ± 3 °K. Above this temperature the crystal symmetry is cubic and the Cr +++ ions are in a crystal field which has a small component. Below this temperature there is an additional rhombic componant in the crystal field and the crystal symmetry is lower, probably tetragonal. At both 90 °k and 20 °K the parameters in the spin hamiltonian are g = 1. 975 ± 0. 010, D = 0. 0871 ± 0. 0007 cm - 1 and K = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0008 cm - 1. These values give a stark splitting in zero field of 0. 177 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 which disagrees with the value of 0. 188 ± 0. 007 cm - 1 calculated by Kurti and Gardner (1954) from adiabatic demagnetisation measurements. Measurements at frequencies near the Stark splitting give results which lie between the two values so that it is not possible to say whether this descrepency is real. Measurements of nearest neighbour lines and of line widths indicate that there is extremely little exchange interaction between neighbouring Cr +++ ions. The transition is possibly due to a freezing out of a random rotary motion of the methylamine radical as the substance is cooled through the transition temperature. This temperature is the same as that found by Griffiths and Powell (1952) at which there is a discontinuity in the value of the dielectric constant. Interactions between neighbouring ions The p. r. spectrum of two adjacent consists of a series of lines, corresponding to the various orientations of the spins with respect to one another, which occur as satellites to the iines by isolated ions, the number of acid separation these satellites depends upon the size and nature of the interaction between them. The magnetic interaction may be calculated if the distance between the ions is known, so that if allowance is made for this, the size and nature of exchange interaction may be inferred from the positions of the satellite lines. Investigations of this sort have been done in crystals containing about 10 % paramagnetic salt in an isomorphous diamagnetic one, so that there is considerable chance of having two ions adjacent. A study of lanthanum <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> containing up to 30 % neodymium shows that there is a small anisotropic exchange interaction with the two nearest neighbours and undetectable exchange interaction with the six next nearest. There is however no exchange with the next nearest neighbours in concentrated neodymium <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> This discrepancy is not explained. A study of nearest neigbbour satellites was made in KCr(SeO 4) 2 12 H 2 O. the problem is complicated by there being four ions in the unit cell all of which have different crystal field axes. It has not been possible to make an unambiguous interpretation of the results and the best interpretation does not agree with the results of adiabatic demagnetisation experiments of Kurti and Gardner (unpublished). The results of this type of investigation are rather discouraging and seem to indicate that one can hope to obtain satisfactory results only in particular substances. Rare earth <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphates</b> Paramagnetic resonance has been observed in terbium etbyl sulphate using the yttrium salt as a dilutant. The spectrum may be explained using the hamiltonian postulated for the praseodymium salt (Bleaney and Seovil, 1952) : H = g // βH z S z + AS z I z + AS x where g // = 17. 72 ± 0. 02, S = 1 / 2, I = 3 / 2, A = 0. 209 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 and Δ = 0. 387 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. The lowest level is a doublet J z = ± 6 which is admixed with J x = 0 by the crystal field. This admixes the + 6 and - 6 levels and ΔM = 0 transitions are obtained if the r. f. magnetic field is placed parallel to tbe external field. The nuclear spin of terbium 159 is estimated to be 1. 5 ± 0. 4 nuclear magnetons. The work of Bleaney and Seovil (1952) on praseodymium <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> has been extended using yttrium <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a dilutant. The assymmetrical line shape is explained as being tbe result of the splitting Δ in the above hatmiltonian not having a single value but a Gaussian distribution of values, the nuclear magnetic moment of praseodymium 141 is estimated to be 4. 5 ± 1. 1 nuclear magnetons. </p...|$|R

E. coli attached to stainless steel surfaces became significantly more susceptible to benzalkonium chloride (BAC) after treatment with sodium alkyl sulphate (SAS) by 0. 51 Log 10 cfu ml- 1 and fatty alcohol ethoxylate (FAE) by 0. 96 Log 10 cfu ml- 1. No change in susceptibility was observed with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium lauryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (SLES) or polyethoxylated alcohol (PEA). L. monocytogenes became significantly less susceptible to BAC after treatment with anionic detergents SAS by 0. 79 Log 10 cfu ml- 1, SDS by 0. 33 Log 10 cfu ml- 1 and SLES by 0. 22 Log 10 cfu ml- 1, yet no change in susceptibility was observed with FAE. Following treatment with all detergents both organisms became significantly more susceptible to sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) demonstrating that the effect of the disinfectant was independent of detergent type. Flow cytometry using the fluorochrome propidium iodide (PI) revealed significant increases in cell membrane permeability of both organisms by all detergents except sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and the effect was much greater in E. coli. Increasing above the in-use concentration of SAS and FAE had no further effect on cell membrane permeability, or susceptibility to BAC. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) showed that E. coli became less hydrophobic following treatment with SAS, SDS, FAE and L. monocytogenes became less hydrophobic following treatment with SAS and SDS but no effect was seen with FAE. Investigations into carbon chain length of detergent revealed that SAS and the C 18 standard increased susceptibility of E. coli to BAC which, with permeability results, suggests a link between increase in susceptibility to BAC and increase in membrane permeability. Efflux experiments with L. monocytogenes showed that efflux of ethidium bromide (EtBr) was greater from cells treated with SAS than with FAE suggesting that the anionic charge on the detergent molecule influences an efflux mechanism that reduces susceptibility to BAC. Overall the results demonstrate that detergent type can influence the sensitivity of persistent food borne microorganisms to BAC and NaDCC and the significance of the findings may impact on the choice of agents used in cleaning procedures in the food industry...|$|R

Besides that, from the usage of diesel, it will produce sulfur when combustion is involved. Currently, Malaysia is making its effort to reach the sulfur target of 50 ppm as implemented by the Euro IV standards. Sulfur is very harmful towards humans, animals, machines and the environment. Sulfur contributes to air pollution by creating acid rains; in conjunction to machineries, it will corrode the equipment from the inside and thus reducing its effectiveness and requires a high cost to repair and maintenance. In this research, a sulfur compound called dibenzothiophene (DBT) is chosen as the study case. The objective {{of this research is}} to determine whether dibenzothiophene (DBT) can be extract or remove from model oil of n-hexane using an ionic liquid. The ionic liquid that is to be used is 1 -methylpyrazolium <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> C 6 H 13 N 2 O 4 S. The ionic liquid is to be tested on a model oil of n-hexane to check its sulfur removal efficiency. A Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is conducted on the ionic liquid to check its content and an Infra-Red (IR) absorptions classification according to the wavelength is obtained to determine their functional groups. Next, the ionic liquid is tested on a Carbon Hydrogen Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) analysis, to check its sulfur content. From the CHNS analysis, a manual calculation is to be done to check the molecular formula and compare it with the existing molecular formula, C 6 H 13 N 2 O 4 S. On top of that, a High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis is conducted. A series of concentration for standard sample and sample is prepared. The samples consist of concentration in the range of 1500 ppm to 250 ppm. For the standard sample, the model oil of n-hexane is mixed with dibenzothiophene (DBT) is analyse and a calibration curve is plotted. For the sample, the ionic liquid is mixed with the model oil and dibenzothiophene (DBT) is analyse.

The lyophilisation process {{is one of the}} methods applied when preparing urine {{reference materials}} for ensuring stability during distribution, transport and storage. Urine samples of 11 - nor- Δ 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol- 9 - carboxylic acid (THC-COOH), Benzoylecgonine (BE), <b>Ethyl</b> glucuronide/Ethyl <b>sulphate</b> (EtG/EtS) and ethanol (EtOH) were prepared from blank urine previously filtered. Samples were fortified with the adequate standard solutions and they were divided in aliquots. Aliquots stored at 4 ºC and lyophilized aliquots were used to evaluate the homogeneity of the samples. Others were frozen at - 20 ºC and they were used as reference aliquots. In the first analysis, all prepared samples, except EtOH sample, were considered homogeneous. Concentration differences of THC-COOH and BE between lyophilized aliquots and reference aliquots were minimum (lower than 5 %). However, differences higher than 8 % were observed for EtG/EtS. If these differences were maintained constant in subsequence quantifications, they could be attributed to the evaporation of the analytes during the lyophilisation process. Results obtained for EtOH sample show a completely loss of the analyte due to its high volatility...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} in a theoretical study of some one-dimensional models. Special attention {{is given to}} simple but non-trivial soluble models. The study starts with a resume of the Green function method which is the formalism used throughout the work. A discussion of coupled electron-phonon and spin-phonon systems is presented and a decoupling scheme introduced. The approximation gives the transition temperature for one-dimensional systems exactly, namely T = 0, and consequently represents a great improvement on the mean-field approximation. The impure XY-chain in a transverse field is studied and the formal solution presented. The static and time-dependent correlations are discussed, {{and the effect of}} the boundary term reviewed in details. The one-impurity case is solved for the isotropic chain, and it is shown how to derive from it the open chain result in the thermodynamic limit. The heat-flux operator is obtained for the impure isotropic chain by solving the continuity equation for energy density. The dynamics of the one-dimensional transverse Ising model is discussed within several approximations. The limitations of each approximation are examined in detail and the time-dependent correlations are calculated using the most successful approximation. It is also shown that this approximation is only valid in the high temperature limit in which case no critical behaviour is to be observed. The one-impurity solution of the isotropic impure XY-chain is extended to many impurities in two different cases. In the first case the specific heat of the dilute chain is calculated in the framework of the average t-matrix approximation, and the results compared with exact numerical calculations for finite chains. In the second case the specific heat and thermal conductivity of the isotropic XY-chain in a random transverse field are calculated using the coherent-potential approximation (CPA). The results are used to explain the low temperature thermal properties of praseodymium <b>ethyl</b> <b>sulphate.</b> Finally, two interacting systems, an electron-phonon system and a spin-phonon system, are studied after a brief discussion of the so-called Peierls instability. The first model is solved exactly in the framework of the approximation discussed {{at the beginning of the}} work. It presents a giant Kohn anomaly at zero temperature which drives a Peierls transition. The renormalized modes are discussed, and the real and imaginary parts of the phonon propagator are presented for wave vector andpi; andfrasl; a and several coupling constants and temperatures. The spin-phonon system is also studied in the framework of the approximation discussed initially in the work, and it is chosen in such a way that the relevant properties are given in terms of Green functions calculated in the transverse Ising model. The results obtained for the dynamics of this model are used, and since they are valid only in the high temperature limit, the discussion is restricted to this temperature region. Since this region is far away from the critical one, no critical behaviour is observed, and the study is restricted to a simple discussion of modes. The real and imaginary parts of the renormalized phonon propagator are presented for the wave vector andpi; andfrasl; a, high temperature and various coupling constants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mutagenesis in {{crop plants}} {{significantly}} influences the morphological and physiological parameters {{which in turn}} enhances resistance or susceptibility to the infesting insects. Keeping this in view, influence of chemical mutagens viz., Diethyl <b>Sulphate</b> (DES) and <b>Ethyl</b> Methane Sulphonate (EMS) on resistance against whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Aleyrodidae: Hemiptera), in an already identified insect tolerant tomato accession namely Varushanadu Local was studied in comparison with a susceptible check, I 979. The mutagenised plants were evaluated under pot culture conditions at Annamalai University, Annamalainagar, Tamil Nadu, India during 2007 - 2008. Plants of the insect tolerant accession, Varushanadu Local mutagenised with EMS at 0. 2 per cent had the minimum whitefly population (15. 27 numbers/plant) and the maximum plant height (120 cm). But fruit yield was recorded to be the maximum in plants mutagenised with EMS at 0. 3 per cent followed by DES at 0. 1 per cent.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} concerns {{with the development}} and evaluation of the floating matrix tablets of Salbutmol Sulphate. Tablets were prepared by wet granulation method.  Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and ethyl cellulose {{was used as a}} release retardant material. Sodium bicarbonate and Citric acid was incorporated as a gas-generating agent. The effects of Sodium bicarbonate and citric acid on drug release profile, floating properties and matrix integrity of tablet were investigated. Addition of Citric acid in excess amount results in disintegration of the tablet so the floating tablets are prepared by full 3 2 factorial designs by reducing the ratio of citric acid. Developed formulations were evaluated for their physical characteristics, drug content, floating lag time, floating duration, in vitro drug release profile etc. On the basis of various physical characteristics parameters it was found that all the formulations shows good result. On comparative kinetic modeling study such as (Zero order, Higuchi model and Korsmeyer-Peppas) it was found that all the formulations follow Higuchi model and correlation coefficient (R 2) and Korsmeyer model values were nearer to unity. Among those formulations F 8 and F 9 showed R 2 value of Higuchi model more near as compared to the other formulation.
