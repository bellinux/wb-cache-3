50|$|The bar puller {{serves to}} draw bars into the lathe without {{operators}} having {{to feed the}} machine with material each time it is required. With the introduction of CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) for the lathes {{it was possible to}} ensure the reliability of the individual process operations (moving the turret to the material, opening the <b>clamping</b> <b>chuck,</b> drawing in the material, closing the <b>clamping</b> <b>chuck,</b> moving the turret away with the bar puller).|$|R
30|$|Heating {{up of the}} {{specimen}} was done with alternating current, which results by the different electrical potential of the <b>clamping</b> <b>chucks.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{specimen}} to {{be tested}} (Fig.Â  1) is clamped into two electrically conductive <b>clamping</b> <b>chucks</b> by use of fixing bolts connected with the holes of the specimen.|$|R
50|$|Bar pullers {{are used}} in CNC lathes to {{automatically}} draw in bars from the <b>clamping</b> <b>chuck.</b> In this case they serve {{as a substitute for}} a bar feeder on an NC/CNC lathe.|$|R
50|$|The <b>clamping</b> <b>chuck</b> is fitted {{directly}} into the turret of the lathe or into the bar holder. There are two different versions, depending on the design: Start on the X-axis (starting from the radius) or start on the Z-axis (direction of the spindle).|$|R

40|$|The {{connection}} between the tolerances possible to obtain in a machining process and the machining forces and clamping forces in turning of ring-shaped work pieces <b>clamped</b> in conventional <b>chucks</b> with varying jaw numbers has been investigated. The results {{can be used for}} adaptive control of the clamping forces in an optimal way so that the work piece does not come loose in the course of machining and the desired tolerances can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|The model {{presented}} {{in the first part}} of this work is used here to estimate the diameter error in the most common turning operations. In fact, the diameter error is considered as a variable depending on the deflections of the tool, workpiece holder and workpiece, which are considered the main factors responsible for the machining accuracy. The proposed model has been applied to the three most common turning schemes related to workpiece fixturing, where the workpiece is <b>clamped</b> in a <b>chuck,</b> or supported between two centers, or <b>clamped</b> in a <b>chuck</b> at the spindle and supported on a center at the tailstock. Some numerical examples have been computed using the proposed model to predict the diameter error along the workpiece and the cutting force along the workpiece axis, as well as the influence of the cutting force components on the error prediction. The results provide additional insight into error formation in the turning process. Finally, some experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the developed model. Good agreement has been obtained between numerical and experimental results. The proposed model represents a first step towards accuracy control in machining operations and, thus, towards optimization of the manufacturing process...|$|R
40|$|Chucking force {{monitoring}} with {{consideration of}} forces and stresses in the jaw. The <b>clamping</b> force of <b>chucks</b> {{can be measured}} with wire strain gauges during the machining operation. In order to determine suitable measuring points, the deformation behaviour of base jaw and top jaw was examined with the finite element method. The calculated results and experimental investigations showed {{that the kind of}} force must be taken into consideration for the calibration of the sensors. This restriction is removed when the sensors are stressed at the clamping position above a defined load point. In this case the calibration can be carried out pendent from the load point...|$|R
5000|$|If {{the program}} is wrong, {{there is a high}} {{probability}} that the machine will crash, or ram the tool into the part under high power. This can be costly, especially in newer machining centers. It is possible to intersperse the program with optional stops (M01 code) that let the program run piecemeal for testing purposes. The optional stops remain in the program but are skipped during normal running. Fortunately, most CAD/CAM software ships with CNC simulators that display the movement of the tool as the program executes. Nowadays the surrounding objects (<b>chuck,</b> <b>clamps,</b> fixture, tailstock, and more) are included in the 3D models, and the simulation is much like an entire video game or virtual reality environment, making unexpected crashes much less likely. Many modern CNC machines also allow programmers to execute the program in a simulation mode and observe the operating parameters of the machine at a particular execution point. This enables programmers to discover semantic errors (as opposed to syntax errors) before losing material or tools to an incorrect program. Depending {{on the size of the}} part, wax blocks may be used for testing purposes as well.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} concerning a predictive compensation method which corrects for the error on the diameter caused by the deflection when machining a workpiece on a lathe. The deflection model which was formulated to predict the error on the diameter considers the smaller emerging diameter formed by the depth of cut as the tool tip moves along the workpiece, thus improving the accuracy with which the deflection can be predicted. The model also recognizes {{the fact that the}} total deflection undergoes an equilibrium search causing the final deflection to reach a smaller value than that which is obtained when using the methods described in literature. Furthermore, {{the way in which the}} workpiece is commonly supported in industrial practice, which is having one end rigidly <b>clamped</b> in a <b>chuck</b> at the spindle while the other end is supported by its center at the tailstock, is included in the deflection analysis. The compensation method can be applied not only to uniform cylindrical bars but also to general shaped workpieces. However the latter must first be partitioned into segments forming a multidiameter shaft for the deflection analysis. Implementation of this predictive compensation method introduces the possibility of obtaining single pass machining with final pass accuracy...|$|R
