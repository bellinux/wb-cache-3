5|$|Plutarch {{says that}} Pericles stood first among the Athenians for forty years. If this was so, Pericles <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> up a {{position}} of leadership by the early 460s BC- in his early or mid-thirties. Throughout these years he endeavored to protect his privacy and to present himself {{as a model for}} his fellow citizens. For example, he would often avoid banquets, trying to be frugal.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging from a common ancestor around 12 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> it and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E

5|$|While {{investigating}} the animal control team deaths, Charlie is {{attacked by the}} creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie was healthy after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E
5|$|As the Osiris myth first {{appears in}} the Pyramid Texts, most of its {{essential}} features <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> shape sometime before the texts were written down. The distinct segments of the story—Osiris's death and restoration, Horus's childhood, and Horus's conflict with Set—may originally have been independent mythic episodes. If so, they must have begun to coalesce into a single story {{by the time of}} the Pyramid Texts, which loosely connect those segments. In any case, the myth was inspired by a variety of influences. Much of the story is based in religious ideas and the general nature of Egyptian society: the divine nature of kingship, the succession from one king to another, the struggle to maintain maat, and the effort to overcome death. For instance, the lamentations of Isis and Nephthys for their dead brother may represent an early tradition of ritualized mourning.|$|E
5|$|Further {{confusion}} about Knútr in Scottish affairs {{comes from a}} continental source. At some point before about 1030, the eleventh-century Historiarum libri quinque, by Rodulfus Glaber (died c.1047), records that Knútr fought a long campaign against Máel Coluim, and that hostilities were finally brought to a close by the intervention of Knútr's wife, Emma (died 1052), and her brother, Richard II, Duke of Normandy (died 1026). If Rodulfus' account is to be believed, this conflict <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place before Richard's death in 1026, and could refer to events surrounding Máel Coluim's violent annexation of Lothian early in Knútr's reign. Despite uncertainties surrounding the reliability of Rodulfus' version of events, unless the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has misdated Knútr's meeting in Scotland, Rodulfus' account could be evidence that Knútr involved himself with Scottish affairs before and after 1026.|$|E

5|$|In 973, Dunstan's statesmanship {{reached its}} zenith when he officiated at the {{coronation}} of King Edgar. Edgar was crowned at Bath in an imperial ceremony planned {{not as the}} initiation, but as the culmination of his reign (a move that <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> {{a great deal of}} preliminary diplomacy). This service, devised by Dunstan himself and celebrated with a poem in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle forms the basis of the present-day British coronation ceremony. There was a second symbolic coronation held later. This was an important step, as other kings of Britain came and gave their allegiance to Edgar at Chester. Six kings in Britain, including the kings of Scotland and of Strathclyde, pledged their faith that they would be the king's liege-men on sea and land.|$|E
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|E
5|$|The fateful {{encounter}} between Margaðr and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on {{the presumption that}} Margaðr is identical to Echmarcach, and that the event <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place {{at the conclusion of}} Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin. In fact, the Old Norse personal name Margaðr is a form of the Gaelic personal name Murchad; and the aforesaid accounts of Margaðr likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Niðaróss, it is unlikely that any church would have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.|$|E

5|$|As soon as Emperor Michael II {{learned of}} the Arab landing, and before the Andalusians had secured their control over the entire island, he reacted and sent {{successive}} expeditions to recover the island. Losses suffered during the revolt of Thomas the Slav hampered Byzantium's ability to respond, however, and if the landing occurred in 827/828, the diversion of ships and men to counter the gradual conquest of Sicily by the Tunisian Aghlabids also interfered. The first expedition, under Photeinos, strategos of the Anatolic Theme, and Damian, Count of the Stable, was defeated in open battle, where Damian was killed. The next expedition was sent a year later and comprised 70 ships under the strategos of the Cibyrrhaeots Krateros. It was initially victorious, but the overconfident Byzantines were then routed in a night attack. Krateros managed to flee to Kos, but there he was captured by the Arabs and crucified. Makrypoulias suggests that these campaigns <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> place before the Andalusians completed their construction of Chandax, where they transferred the capital from the inland site of Gortyn.|$|E

25|$|Historical sound {{change in}} Japanese {{has led to}} the modern pronunciations of the {{individual}} characters as nichi and hon.
