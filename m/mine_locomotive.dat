5000|$|The first {{electric}} <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive</b> in the United States {{went into}} service in mid 1887 in the Lykens Valley Coal Company mine in Lykens, Pennsylvania. The 35 hp motor for this locomotive {{was built by}} the Union Electric Company of Philadelphia. [...] The 15000 pound (6800 kg) locomotive was named the Pioneer, and by mid 1888, a second electric locomotive was in service at that mine. [...] Use in the Appalachian coal fields spread rapidly. By 1903, there were over 600 electric mine locomotives in use in America with new ones being produced {{at a rate of}} 100 per year.|$|E
5000|$|Mules and {{man power}} {{had long been}} used {{exclusively}} as the motive power in moving coal from the mines, but this method was expensive and unsatisfactory.

40|$|Underground vehicle {{applications}} — tunneling {{and mining}} — {{may be the}} first fuelcell-vehicle markets that succeed solely on economic merit. Providing traction power in these enclosed, highly regulated workplaces is a difficult challenge, and the inadequacies of co-ventional power are the basis of economic stress in the industries. Clean, safe, and pro-ductive fuelcell vehicles, while higher in capital cost, offer cost offsets that can make them the first commercially successful products.

40|$|This {{research}} report discusses the ergonomics of locomotive designs in South African gold and platinum mines. The {{purpose of the}} study was to identify safety aspects of the existing fleet of mine locomotives and rolling stock that could be improved through ergonomics interventions. In order to obtain this objective it was, firstly, necessary to determine the types of locomotives used at gold and platinum mines. This was followed by the objective and subjective evaluation of the existing fleet to determine the ergonomic aspects affecting human performance and human-machine interaction. The key ergonomics characteristics related to safety and work performance were identified for the <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive,</b> and based on this information, an ideal design was formulated. The practical implication of implementing the ideal design was defined, and the required changes and modifications to improve the safety aspects of the existing fleet were determined. Finally, a practical strategy was devised for the improvement of the current fleet. Aspects covered during the study included: · analysis of the locomotive operator tasks. · identification of the ergonomics aspects and mechanical engineering characteristics of the locomotives, which could affect the safety and task performance for the locomotiv...|$|E

40|$|Develop a fuelcell <b>mine</b> <b>locomotive</b> with metal-hydride {{hydrogen}} storage. Test {{the locomotive}} for fundamental limitations preventing successful commercialization of hydride fuelcells in underground mining. During Phase 1 of the DOE-EERE sponsored project, FPI and its partner SNL, completed {{work on the}} development of a 14. 4 kW fuelcell power plant and metal-hydride energy storage. An existing battery-electric locomotive with similar power requirements, minus the battery module, was used as the base vehicle. In March 2001, Atlas Copco Wagner of Portland, OR, installed the fuelcell power plant into the base vehicle and initiated integration of the system into the vehicle. The entire vehicle returned to Sandia in May 2001 for further development and integration. Initial system power-up took place in December 2001. A revision to the original contract, Phase 2, at the request of DOE Golden Field Office, established Vehicle Projects LLC as the new prime contractor,. Phase 2 allowed industry partners to conduct surface tests, incorporate enhancements to the original design by SNL, perform an extensive risk and safety analysis, and test the fuelcell locomotive underground under representative production mine conditions. During the surface tests one of the fuelcell stacks exhibited reduced power output resulting in having to replace both fuelcell stacks. The new stacks were manufactured with new and improved technology resulting in an increase of the gross power output from 14. 4 kW to 17 kW. Further work by CANMET and Hatch Associates, an engineering consulting firm specializing in safety analysis for the mining industry, both under subcontract to Vehicle Projects LLC, established minimum requirements for underground testing. CANMET upgraded the Programmable Logic Control (PLC) software used to monitor and control the fuelcell power plant, taking into account locomotive operator's needs. Battery Electric, a South Africa manufacturer, designed and manufactured (at no cost to the project) a new motor controller capable of operating the higher rpm motor and different power characteristics of the fuelcells. In early August 2002, CANMET, with the technical assistance of Nuvera Fuel Cells and Battery Electric, installed the new PLC software, installed the new motor controller, and installed the new fuelcell stacks. After minor adjustments, the fuelcell locomotive pulled its first fully loaded ore cars on a surface track. The fuelcell-powered locomotive easily matched the battery powered equivalent in its ability to pull tonnage and equaled the battery-powered locomotive in acceleration. The final task of Phase 2, testing the locomotive underground in a production environment, occurred in early October 2002 in a gold mine. All regulatory requirements to allow the locomotive underground were completed and signed off by Hatch Associates prior to going underground. During the production tests, the locomotive performed flawlessly with no failures or downtime. The actual tests occurred during a 2 -week period and involved moving both gold ore and waste rock over a 1, 000 meter track. Refueling, or recharging, of the metal-hydride storage took place on the surface. After each shift, the metal-hydride storage module was removed from the locomotive, transported to surface, and filled with hydrogen from high-pressure tanks. The beginning of each shift started with taking the fully recharged metal-hydride storage module down into the mine and re-installing it onto the locomotive. Each 8 hour shift consumed approximately one half to two thirds of the onboard hydrogen. This indicates that the fuelcell-powered locomotive can work longer than a similar battery-powered locomotive, which operates about 6 hours, before needing a recharge...|$|E

5000|$|Porter, Bell & Co. {{appears to}} have built the first {{underground}} <b>mining</b> <b>locomotives</b> used in the United States around 1870. By 1874, the Consolidation Coal Company and Georges Creek Coal and Iron Company were using several Porter locomotives in their underground mines in the Georges Creek Valley of Maryland. Other users included several coal mines near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company and an iron mine in the Lake Superior Iron Ranges. Porter's <b>mine</b> <b>locomotives</b> required a minimum 5-foot clearance and 4-foot width when operating on 3-foot gauge track, where they could handle a 20-foot radius curve. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works built similar locomotives, starting in 1870. [...] By the early 20th century, very small British-made oil-fired steam locomotives were in use in some South African mines. [...] Porter and Vulcan (Wilkes-Barre) advertised steam <b>mine</b> <b>locomotives</b> in 1909 and 1911. [...] By the early 1920s, only a few small mines in the Pocahontas Coalfield in West Virginia were using steam locomotives underground. [...] Nonetheless, both Baldwin and Vulcan continued to advertise steam locomotives for underground use outside the coal industry as late as 1921.|$|R
