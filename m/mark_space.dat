40|$|Simple point {{processes}} are often characterized by their associated compensators or conditional intensities. For non-simple {{point processes}}, however, the conditional intensity and compensator do not uniquely determine {{the distribution of}} the process.

40|$|SUMMARY. We study {{marked point}} {{processes}} (MPP's) with an arbitrary <b>mark</b> <b>space.</b> First we develop some statistically relevant topics {{in the theory}} of MPP's admitting an intensity kernel t(dz), namely martingale results, central limit theorems for both the number n of objects under observation and the time t tending to in nity, the decomposition into a local characteristic (t � t(dz)) and a likelihood approach. Then we present semi-parametric statistical inference in a class of Aalen (1975) -type multiplicative regression models for MPP's as n! 1, using partial likelihood methods. Furthermore, considering the case t! 1,we study purely parametric M-estimators...|$|E

40|$|In {{the modern}} western world, the discursive {{construction}} of fatherhood and everyday fathering practices has been underpinned by the spatial separation of work from home, of public from private. However, {{increasing numbers of}} employees are now working from home and {{a disproportionate number of}} these are men with young children. This article draws on new empirical research to examine the implications for fathers and for organizations as home-working disrupts earlier spatial configurations of fatherhood and fathering practices. The article concludes that as the spatial boundaries between home and work collapse, new accommodations between fatherhood/fathering and organization are emerging. However, these are underpinned by a traditional gender division of labour in the household. More broadly, these findings confirm the inadequacy of static distinctions between public and private, showing that while such distinctions are still used to <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> and time, this is relational, contingent and unstable...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} the soundscape of a favela in Rio de Janeiro. It argues that sounds, and music in particular, {{play an important}} part in the creation and maintenance of boundaries between groups in the dense urban space of the favela. The politics of presence excercised by different groups constitutes the sonic charisma of the favela. Especially in relation to Pentecostal faith, it becomes obvious how the charisma of the city and in the city are related. A focus on the soundscape of the favela highlights the fact that electronic media are woven into the fabric of its social life and are {{part and parcel of the}} production of locality. Yet the mass-mediated sounds, employed to <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> and identity also demonstrate that identity is not produced either locally or supra-locally, but rather trans-locally and that electro-acoustic technology is essential to the deterritorialization and reterritorialization of religion...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{enforcement}} of nonlinear constraints in Petri nets. An integer linear programming model is formulated to transform a nonlinear constraint to a minimal number of conjunctive linear constraints that have the same admissible <b>marking</b> <b>space</b> as the nonlinear one does in Petri nets. The obtained linear constraints can be easily enforced to be satisfied {{by a set of}} control places with a place invariant based method. The control places make up a supervisor that can enforce the given nonlinear constraint. For a case that the admissible <b>marking</b> <b>space</b> decided by a nonlinear constraint is nonconvex, another integer linear programming model is developed to obtain a minimal number of constraints whose disjunctions are equivalent to the nonlinear constraint with respect to the reachable markings. Finally, a number of examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|To analyse {{interaction}} in marked spatio-temporal point processes (MSTPPs), we introduce marked (cross) second-order reduced moment measures and K-functions for general inhomogeneous second-order intensity reweighted stationary MSTPPs. These summary statistics, which {{allow us to}} quantify dependence between different mark categories of the points, are depending on the specific <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> and mark reference measure chosen. We also look closer at how the summary statistics reduce under assumptions such as the MSTPP being multivariate and/or stationary. A new test for independent marking is devised and unbiased minus-sampling estimators are derived for all statistics considered. In addition, we treat Voronoi intensity estimators for MSTPPs and indicate their unbiasedness. These new statistics are finally employed to analyse the well-known Andaman sea earthquake dataset. We find that clustering takes place between main and fore-/aftershocks at virtually all space and time scales. In addition, we find evidence that, conditionally on the space-time locations of the earthquakes, the magnitudes do not behave like an iid sequence...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} pulsed Ultrasound (US) in recovery from Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS). Methods: Twelve healthy male athletes (mean age 23. 83 ± 1. 697 year) performed an eccentric exercise protocol of non-dominant elbow flexors to induce muscle soreness on 2 occasions separated by 3 weeks. Subjects in experimental group received pulsed US (1 MHz, intensity 0. 8 W/cm 2, <b>mark</b> <b>space</b> ratio 1 : 10), whereas control group received sham US after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Perception of muscle soreness, active ROM and muscle strength were the parameters measured at 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h {{with the help of}} VAS, manual goniometer and JONEX muscles master instrument respectively. Results: Post hoc t test analysis revealed significant differences (p < 0. 05) between 0 h and 72 h in the parameter of ROM (t = 6. 18) and muscle power (t = 2. 54) as well as between 24 h and 48 h in the parameter of muscle soreness (t = 3. 13) in control group. Similar differences were also observed in the experimental group. No significant inter-group differences at α level of 0. 05 was observed in any parameter at any level. Conclusion: The pattern of recovery from DOMS was not influenced by the application of pulsed Ultrasound at the parameters discussed here...|$|E

40|$|The Jingpho or Kachin {{language}} is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken in Kachin State and northern Shan State, Burma and adjacent areas of China and India. This paper, {{based on data from}} a 320 -thousand-word corpus of Jingpho which I compiled, provides a description and analysis of the case marking system of Jingpho. An overview and list of case markers are given in section 3. Section 4 discusses case markers for S (intransitive subject), A (transitive subject), and P (transitive object), and claims explicitly. In section 5, various case markers which mark local semantic roles (locative, source and goal roles) are shown in some detail. Using concordance lines obtained from my corpus, I quantitatively analyse {{the difference between the two}} locative markers, ko? and tha?, and emonstrate that ko? typically <b>marks</b> <b>spaces</b> while tha? typically markstime, although both of them can <b>mark</b> <b>spaces</b> and time. The genitive case and genitive personal pronouns are discussed in section 6, followed by a description of the comitative marker which marks various kinds of semantic roles. Finally, nouns which function as case markers (i. e., mtu 'for', m∂lay 'instead', m∂jo 'because', and zon 'like',) are discussed in some detail...|$|R
