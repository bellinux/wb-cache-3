To illustrate our ideas, we discuss the Stern-Gerlach experiment, Wollaston prisms, beam splitters, <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometers,</b> von Neumann (PVM) tests, the more general POVM formalism, and a variety of modern quantum experiments, such as two-particle interferometry and the EPR scenario. ...|$|R

The two primary types of fiber optics sensors, specifically those with multiwave fibers and those with monowave fibers, are described. Examples of each major sensor type are presented and discussed. Multiwave detectors include external and internal fiber optics sensors. Among the monowave detectors are <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometers,</b> Michelson interferometers, Sagnac interferometers (optical gyroscopes), waveguide resonators, and polarimeter sensors.

In a <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometer,</b> a helically phased source beam is made to interfere with a plane-wave reference beam along a collinear path. Interference fringes will be observed in {{the plane of the}} beam waist and/or at the Rayleigh range.

50|$|Time-bin {{encoding}} is done {{by having}} a single-photon go through a <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometer</b> (MZ), shown in black here. The photon coming from the left is guided through one of two paths (shown in blue and red); the guiding {{can be made by}} optical fiber or simply in free space using mirrors and polarising cubes. One of the two paths is longer than the other. The difference in path length must be longer than the coherence length of the photon to make sure the path taken can be unambiguously distinguished. The interferometer has to keep a stable phase, which means that the path length difference must vary by much less than the wavelength of light during the experiment. This usually requires active temperature stabilization.|$|E

40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} {{have become an}} essential element of spatial deep learning systems. In the prevailing architecture, the convolution operation is performed with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) electronically in GPUs. The parallelism of GPUs provides an efficiency over CPUs, however both approaches being electronic are bound by the speed and power limits of the interconnect delay inside the circuits. Here we present a silicon photonics based architecture for convolutional {{neural networks}} that harnesses the phase property of light to perform FFTs efficiently. Our all-optical FFT is based on nested <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>Interferometers,</b> directional couplers, and phase shifters, with backend electro-optic modulators for sampling. The FFT delay depends only on the propagation delay of the optical signal through the silicon photonics structures. Designing and analyzing the performance of a convolutional neural network deployed with our on-chip optical FFT, we find dramatic improvements by up to 10 ^ 4 when compared to state-of-the-art GPUs when exploring a compounded figure-of-merit given by power per convolution over area. At a high level, this performance is enabled by mapping the desired mathematical function, an FFT, synergistically onto hardware, in this case optical delay interferometers...|$|R

We show that each setup will, after repeated measurement, lead to {{a situation where the}} two-particle (or multi-particle) state gets locked into an eigenstate of some well defined operator.

40|$|The {{problem of}} long-distance {{teleportation}} of single-atom qubits via a common photonic channel is examined {{within the framework}} of a <b>Mach-Zender</b> optical <b>interferometer.</b> As expected, when a coherent state is used as input, a high-finesse optical cavity is required to overcome sensitivity to spontaneous emission. However, we find that a number-squeezed light field in a twin-Fock state can in principle create useful entanglement without cavity-enhancement. Both approaches require single photon counting detectors, and best results are obtained by combining cavity-feedback with twin-fock inputs. Such an approach may allow a fidelity of $. 99 $ using a two-photon input and currently available mirror and detector technology. In addition, the present approach can be conveniently extended to generate multi-site entanglement and entanglement swapping, both of which are necessities in quantum networks...|$|R
50|$|Coherence {{is defined}} as the ability of waves to interfere. Intuitively, {{coherent}} waves have a well-defined constant phase relationship. However, an exclusive and extensive physical definition of coherence is more nuanced. Coherence functions, as introduced by Glauber and others in 1960s, capture the mathematics behind the intuition by defining correlation between the electric field components as coherence. These correlations between electric field components can be measured to arbitrary orders, hence leading to the concept of different orders of coherence. The coherence encountered in most optical experiments, including the classic Young's double slit experiment and <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometer,</b> is first order coherence. Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss performed a correlation experiment in 1956, and brought to light a different kind of correlation between fields, namely the correlation of intensities, which correspond to second order coherence. Higher order coherences become relevant in photon-coincidence counting experiments. Orders of coherence can be measured using classical correlation functions or by using the quantum analogue of those functions, which take quantum mechanical description of electric field (operators) as input. While the quantum coherence functions might yield the same results as the classical functions, the underlying mechanism and description of the physical processes are fundamentally different because quantum interference deals with interference of possible histories while classical interference deals with interference of physical waves.|$|E

40|$|We study {{a system}} of neutral atoms trapped in a {{three-dimensional}} optical lattice suitable for the encoding, initialization and manipulation of atomic qubits. The qubits are manipulated by applied electromagnetic fields interacting with dipole moments of the atoms via light shifts, Raman transitions, Zeeman shifts, and microwave transitions. Our lattice is formed by three orthogonal one-dimensional lattices, which have different frequencies so that interference terms average to zero. This geometry allows considerable freedom in designing the component one-dimensional lattices, so that they provide not only confinement but also independent control in each dimension. Our atomic qubits are initialized from a laser-cooled atomic sample by Raman sideband cooling in individual lattice potential wells. We have demonstrated accurate and robust one-qubit manipulation using resonant microwave fields. In practice such control operations are always subject to errors, in our case spatial inhomogeneities in the microwave Rabi frequency and the light shifted qubit transition frequency. Observation of qubit dynamics in near real time allows us to minimize these inhomogeneities, and therefore optimize qubit logic gates. For qubits in the lattice, we infer a fidelity of 0. 990 (3) for a single pi-pulse. We have also explored the use of NMR-type pulse techniques {{in order to further}} reduce the effect of errors and thus improve gate robustness in the atom/lattice system. Our schemes for two-qubit quantum logic operations are based on controlled collisional interactions. We have experimented with two schemes in order to probe these collisions. The first involves manipulation of the center-of-mass wavepackets of two qubits in a geometry corresponding to two partially overlapping <b>Mach-Zender</b> <b>interferometers.</b> Unfortunately, this scheme has proven extremely sensitive to phase errors, as the wavepackets are moved by the optical lattice. The other scheme starts with two qubits in spatially separated traps, and utilizes microwaves to drive one or both qubits into a third trap in-between the two qubits. Once the wavepackets overlap, the collisions create a large energy shift which can be probed spectroscopically...|$|R

Results are compared with the theory of small deflections of an elastic thin plate. Our experiments suggest that relatively simple apparatus can induce the mirror profiles required to demagnify a conventional helium source into a microprobe suitable for a SHeM.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of the {{scientific}} program SIMMIC supported by the French National Agency for Research (SIMI 9, ANR 2010 BLANC 0905 03), new wide band MEMS piezoresistive microphones have been designed and fabricated for weak shock wave measurements. The fabricated microphones have a high frequency resonance between 300 to 800 kHz depending on the membrane size. In order to characterize the frequency response of the fabricated sensors up to 1 MHz, new calibration methods based on an N-wave source were designed and tested. Short duration spherical N-waves can be generated by an electric spark source. To estimated a constant sensitivity coefficient, a known method is based on the estimation of the peak pressure from the lengthening of N-waves induced by non linear propagation. However, to obtain the sensitivity as a function of frequency, the output voltage must be compared to the incident pressure waveform, which must be accurately characterized. Taking advantage of recent works on the characterization of pressure N-waves generated by an electric spark source by means of optical methods, two calibration methods have been designed to obtain the frequency response. A method based on the comparison with pressure waveforms deduced from the analysis of schlieren images allowed to estimate the frequency response. A second method, based on a <b>Mach-Zender</b> optical <b>interferometer,</b> was found to be the best method to estimate the sensitivity of microphones up to 1 MHz. The methods were first tested by calibrating standard 1 / 8 inch condenser microphones. Then, frequency responses of different MEMS microphones prototypes were characterized to test different sensor designs.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experiments}} {{is the development of}} a non-invasive technique for determining the location of an ultrasonic focus in the wall of the human eye. This would enable improvements in ultrasonic biometry and in ultrasonic tissue characterisation in the eye. Ultrasonic biometry is today generally accepted for clinical measurements of axial length in the human eye. Ultrasonic radio frequency signal analysis is used for the tissue-characterisation of small regions of interest in the ocular wall. Up to now in both applications the precise location of the area examined ultrasonically in an individual eye is not exactly known, because the acoustical beam undergoes refraction and diffraction by the components of the eye. For the study, an eye model, consisting of an artificial cornea, a typical intraocular implant lens and a thein polyethylene pellicle simulating the retinal membrane was built. The model was irradiated in water by ultrasonic pulses from a medical A-mode transducer for biometry of the eye (single element, piston type, 8 MHz nominal center frequency, 1 kHz pulse repetition rate) and by a laser beam simultaneously. The slight vibration of the simulated retina induced by the ultrasonic pulses caused a phase modulation of the light beam proportional to the amplitude of motion. The modulation was analysed in a <b>MACH-ZENDER</b> type <b>interferometer,</b> using heterodyne technique. We succeeded in detecting ultrasound induced vibrations of the pellicle with a high spatial resolution, resulting in amplitudes of about 10 nm in the centre and below 1 nm at the margins of the ultrasonic focus. Averaging of many transients enhanced the resolution up to the sub-nm regime. The results encourage further experiments to detect the location of an ultrasonic beam in the eye wall, passing both the acoustical and optical beam through the cornea and lens of an eye.
