40|$|In {{order to}} enable the {{variable}} linear vibration <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> ideal movement behavior of screen surface and efficient screening capacity, five-freedom dynamic model and stability equations of the variable linear vibration screen were established based on power balance method and Hamilton principle. The motion behaviour of screen face was investigated, and − 0. 10 m ≤ xf ≤ − 0. 04 m was confirmed as the best range of exciting position. With analysis of stability equations, the stable requirement of vibration screen was obtained: the direction angle of exciting force should be 0 ≤ θ ≤ 45 °. Screening processes of variable linear vibration <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> flexible <b>screen</b> face, variable linear vibration <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> fixed <b>screen</b> face and linear vibration screen were investigated and compared by numerical simulation method, {{the results show that}} variable linear vibration <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> flexible <b>screen</b> face have such characteristics as higher intensity of projection and efficient screening. The correctness of theoretical research and simulation research were verified through experiment, and all of the work would provide some guidance for designing and studying variable linear vibration <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> flexible <b>screen</b> face...|$|R
