Extending on current methods which use an extension of the Group LASSO for pitch estimation, this work introduces an adaptive total variation penalty, which both enforce group- and block sparsity, and deal with errors due to sub-octaves. The method is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art sparse methods, where the <b>model</b> <b>orders</b> are unknown, while also requiring fewer tuning parameters than these.

40|$|Abstract—Order {{reduction}} of linear-time invariant systems employing two methods; one using {{the advantages of}} Routh approximation and other by an evolutionary technique is presented in this paper. In Routh approximation method the denominator of the reduced <b>order</b> <b>model</b> is obtained using Routh approximation while the numerator of the reduced <b>order</b> <b>model</b> is determined using the indirect approach of retaining the time moments and/or Markov parameters of original system. By this method the reduced <b>order</b> <b>model</b> guarantees stability if the original high <b>order</b> <b>model</b> is stable. In the second method Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to reduce the higher <b>order</b> <b>model.</b> PSO method {{is based on the}} minimization of the Integral Squared Error (ISE) between the transient responses of original higher <b>order</b> <b>model</b> and the reduced <b>order</b> <b>model</b> pertaining to a unit step input.

50|$|The FDFD {{equations}} can be rearranged {{in such a}} way as {{to describe}} a second order equivalent circuit, where nodal voltages represent the E field components and branch currents represent the H field components. This equivalent circuit representation can be extremely useful, as techniques from circuit theory can be used to analyze or simplify the problem and can be used as a spice-like tool for three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation. This susceptance element equivalent circuit (SEEC) model has the advantages of a reduced number of unknowns, only having to solve for E field components, and second order <b>model</b> <b>order</b> reduction techniques can be employed.|$|E
50|$|The FDFD {{method is}} very similar to the FDTD method, though there are some major differences. Unlike the FDTD method, there are no time steps that must be {{computed}} sequentially, thus making FDFD easier to implement. This might also lead one to imagine that FDFD is less computationally expensive; however, this is not necessarily the case. The FDFD method requires solving a sparse matrix, which even for simple problems can be 20,000 by 20,000 elements or larger, with over a million unknowns. In this respect, the FDFD method is similar to the finite element method, which is a finite integral method and is also usually implemented in the frequency domain. There are efficient numerical solvers available so that matrix inversion—an extremely computationally expensive process—can be avoided. Additionally, <b>model</b> <b>order</b> reduction techniques can be employed to reduce problem size.|$|E

The news, that an uprising {{had broken out}} in Warsaw, and that the Russians had abandoned the capital city, and also {{the borders of the}} kingdom, elicited an unheard of exhilaration among everyone. The quiet shtetl, which knew of no other politics other than making appeals to the nobility, immediately felt demands to step out into the political arena together with the entire land."In the course of one hour, the black eagles on top of the Magistrate Building were torn down and smashed, as well as from other institutions. The old swords were unearthed, and pistols, they were cleaned off, and made ready. In the smithies, the blacksmiths worked even on holidays. Agricultural implements were beaten into pikes. Scythes were mounted on long poles."The intelligentsia, the professors and the Rector himself, call the youth to arm themselves. A rededication of the flag was celebrated, praying in the courtyard of the school. The Rector, Zenkowski gave a speech to the lined up rows of citizens and students, armed with all sorts of ammunition, that each individual was able to make for himself. At the end of the ceremonies, 'Jeszcze Polska nie zginela' was sung. This took place in the middle of December, and immediately, Prof. Kowalski, and many older students, went off with Zenkowski to the Polish military. Only a small number of students remained in the school, only children."After Christmas, a movement of the Russian military began. The first to enter Szczebrzeszyn were the Dragoons, whose wild, beard-covered physiognomies made a frightful impression on us. We looked with fear upon these huge men, who camped out on the same place where the battle-ready youth had stood."Immediately, news reached us about the decisive battles between the Polish military and its heroic leaders in the field, from Grochów, behind Wawer. Every bit of news was transmitted with great fervor from hand-to-hand, comments were made, and plans were made for the future, as is usual in a small shtetl. The joy became even greater in the spring, when our military forces entered Lithuania with Dembinski and Gieldung at their head, when Wojciech Chrzanowski and Jozef Dwernicki entered the Lublin region, marching on Wolhyn, on the second side of the Bug River, stopping along the way to conduct general battles outside of Czaczki, and Old-Zamość."On the same Schulhof, on that great Thursday, Dwernicki's Uhlans and the Krakusi billeted themselves, placing several cannons around the place, which it seems to me had been plundered from Czaczki. We spiritedly approached our riders, and played with their weaponry. For several days, food and drink was carried to them from the city. They were accepted as brothers."When the spring and summer heat set in, a cholera epidemic spread through the city here for the first time. Horse manure was burned in the marketplace and in the streets as a remedy against the cholera, but it didn't help. Many families left the city for the surrounding forests. Prayers were offered in the cloisters to end the epidemic, or prayers of thanksgiving for those victories from the arresting of the disease. The young priest Nowakowski, a fiery orator, would tell the worshippers after prayers about the heroic deeds of our leaders. He punished and accused those young people, who withheld themselves from the military, calling each of them by their name..."Zamość, the nearby fortress, and other points, were threatened with encirclement. Many clashes took place in Szczebrzeszyn. The Cossacks would fall upon the city, plundered, beat the Jews, and the townsfolk. A minute later, the Uhlans or the Krakusi would arrive from the direction of Zamość. Once, the Cossacks, as a response to such an attack, decided to take revenge on the city, while the youth of the city took part in these clashed between the Polish military and the Cossacks. At night, the Cossacks drew near in order to torch the city and carry out a slaughter among its residents. A tumult arose in the city, and half the city's residents fled to the nearby forests. One could already hear the shooting from the direction of Janów."However confusion elicits wonder. The aggressive people armed themselves. The municipal policeman, an older military man, together with the sexton of the cloister, raised an alarm. Banging on the cloister drum, they gave orders in a loud voice, and in doing so, gave the impression that there was a large military detachment present. The Cossacks and Dragoons, which were already positioned outside the city, decided to pull back. Later orders restrained them from acts of vengeance." ...|$|E
