40|$|Abstract Background Emergency Department (ED) <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> {{are often}} the first medical {{responders}} to emergencies in Jamaica because pre-hospital emergency response services are not universally available. Over the past decade, several new ED training opportunities have been introduced locally. Their precise impact {{on the health care}} system in Jamaica has not yet been evaluated. We sought to determine the level of training, qualifications and experience of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> employed in public hospital EDs across the nation. Methods A database of all <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> employed in public hospital EDs was created from records maintained by the Ministry of Health in Jamaica. A specially designed questionnaire was administered to all <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in this database. Data was analyzed using SPSS Version 10. 0. Results There were 160 ED <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> across Jamaica, of which 47. 5 % were males and the mean age was 32. 3 years (SD +/- 7. 1; Range 23 – 57). These physicians were employed in the EDs for a mean of 2. 2 years (SD +/- 2. 5; Range 0 – 15; Median 2. 5) and were recent graduates of medical schools (Mean 5. 1; SD +/- 5. 9; Median 3 years). Only 5. 5 % of the <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> had specialist qualifications (grade III/IV), 12. 8 % were grade II <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> and 80. 5 % were grade I house officers or interns. The majority of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> had no additional training qualifications: 20. 9 % were exposed to post-graduate training, 27. 9 % had current ACLS certification and 10. 3 % had current ATLS certification. Conclusion The majority of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in public hospital EDs across Jamaica are relatively inexperienced and inadequately trained. Consultant supervision is not available in most public hospital EDs. With the injury epidemic that exists in Jamaica, it is logical that increased training opportunities and resources are required {{to meet the needs of}} the population. </p...|$|R

5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief <b>medical</b> <b>officer,</b> who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief <b>medical</b> <b>officer</b> to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the <b>medical</b> <b>officer</b> had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, he could not be impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

5|$|With an {{interest}} in pathology, Stansfield spent {{the last few months}} of his time in Edinburgh working at the Royal Infirmary. In 1889, the London County Council (LCC) was established and took over the running of several London mental asylums; in the process, it advertised for a Fourth Assistant <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer</b> and Pathologist at Banstead Asylum, essentially a junior assistant with pathological duties which often related to postmortems. Stansfield successfully applied for the position. While at Banstead, he became interested in the pathology of mental illness and asylum administration. Accustomed to the laboratories at Edinburgh and drilled in rigorous note-taking skills, he set about instilling similar facilities and ethos at Banstead under the auspices of its superintendent, Dr T. Claye Shaw. Each ward would also have its own fixed notebook for medical officers, a practice which over time spread to all other asylums in the country. Thanks to this and his enjoying good relations with its steward, F. Alderton, Stansfield was made Banstead's Second Assistant <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer</b> in 1890 and, when Claybury Asylum opened in 1892–93, he was transferred there as First Assistant <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer,</b> helped by Claye Shaw's influence at the LCC. Over the course of the 1890s, he visited numerous domestic and foreign institutions, travelling to Germany and the United States.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study using self administered questionnaire on locum practice and I sociodemographic and service factors influencing this practice {{as well as}} its effects on productivity and job stress was carried out among all government <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in the whole state of Negeri Sembilan and Malacca. Universally chosen samples were made of 335 doctors who hailed from Hospital and Health Divisions and from 154 who responded, only 147 samples were chosen and analyzed in the study. Productivity was measured using 7 productivity indexes and job stress was measured using 'Personal Stress Inventory'. Results revealed that 60. 6 % of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> had practiced locum before and 58. 4 % of them were still practicing locum during this study, Locum practice were mainly practiced at private clinics (88. 5 %), after work (94. 3 %), less than 10 hours a week (69. 3 %) and for salary supplement (58. 1 %), whereby, 65. 4 % of them had managed to earn less than RM 1000. Locum were still being practiced by 51. 9 % of male <b>medical</b> <b>officers,</b> 41. 0 % of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> aged less than 30 years, 43. 4 % of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> who had served less than 5 years and 55. 6 % of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> who had earned net income less than RM 1 000. t Meanwhile, 80. 9 % of <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> who had earned gross income more than : RM 5 000 did not practice locum during the study. Logistic Regression analysis then I revealed that locum practice among <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> can positively be influenced by sex (male), Malay ethnic, service duration of less than 5 years, Health Division and net income of less than RM 1 000 (p 0. 05). No association was I found between locum practice and job stress (p> 0. 05). Hence, since locum is still being practiced by <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> to earn extra income, without jeopardizing work productivity or causing job stress, it is suggested that the Ministry of Health should then legalize locum practice. Furthermore, ways to monitor and preparation of guidelines on locum practice should also be looked into...|$|R
