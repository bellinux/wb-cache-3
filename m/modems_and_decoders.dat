40|$|Reed-Solomon {{codes are}} error {{correcting}} codes {{that are used}} in many applications such as satellite communications, digital audio tape, and in CDROMs. Such diverse applications call for the use of many different Reed-Solomon codes. The topic of this thesis is the development of a program to produce synthesizable VHDL code for an arbitrary Reed-Solomon encoder or decoder. A novel extension of the Massey-Berlekamp algorithm for solving the key equation is presented. This modified algorithm is a key aspect of the Reed-Solomon decoder designs discussed in this thesis. The details of the design of both RS encoders <b>and</b> <b>decoders</b> are presented in detail. A program written in a high level language was designed so as to generate the VHDL code that corresponds to the algorithms for encoding and decoding. Several encoders <b>and</b> <b>decoders</b> were synthesized for the Xilinx XCV 1000 series of field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The resulting area and speed metrics are presented for several designs of Reed-Solomon encoders <b>and</b> <b>decoders...</b>|$|R
