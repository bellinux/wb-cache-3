40|$|This booklet {{reports on}} an {{international}} survey of the ministries of education of several countries, conducted {{in cooperation with the}} National Board of Education in Sweden. The study sought to assess the status of peace education in various countries in the mid- 1980 s and again in 1991 - 92. The _questionnaire concentrated on three questions: (1) whether the country had official recommendations for schools that teaching should include questions of peace or "peace education ";'. (2) whether there were instructional materials for school pupils or manuals for teachers dealing explicitly with peace education; and (31. whether there were recent public discussions on the topic of peace education. Although peace education has emerged as a recognized topic for consideration, the researcher concludes that much remains to be done about instructional materials and planning.

40|$|ZEKTZERITE and its isotypes with Zr *+ {{replaced}} by Ti 4 + or Sn 4 + are readily synthesized by fusion of the constituent oxides at 155 o ~ followed by recrystallization of the melt or quenched glass at 75 o- 85 o ~ and I bar pressure. Indexed powder X-ray data for synthetic zektzerites {{are presented in}} <b>miniprint</b> Table I. The powder patterns are consis-tent with an A-centred orthorhombic symmetry. Refined cell dimensions are given in Table III. The Ti, Zr, and Sn zektzerites melt incongruently. Table IV records melting-point data. The coeffi-cients of thermal expansion of Zr and Ti zektzerite have been determined by X-ray dilatometry. Both have moderately low coefficients of expansion: numerical values are given in <b>miniprint</b> Table II. Zektzerites contain a six-repeat unit double-chain silicate anion. Although they are chemically similar to milarites, the latter contain double-ring Sia 203 o anions. Despite the difference in anion constitution both have structures in which many chemically similar atoms occupy similar positions. The effect of this similarity on the physical pro-perties (e. g. X-ray powder pattern) is enhanced by TABLE III. Cell dimensions of the Zr, Ti, and Sn zektzerite isotypes...|$|E

The entry examines the ideologies, practices, and consequences of educating young people from heterogeneous cultural backgrounds. The issues of preserving national unity and promoting cultural diversity through education are discussed. Various curriculum practices in some well-known multicultural societies are also examined. Case studies include Germany, Canada, and the United States. (Contains 43 references.)
