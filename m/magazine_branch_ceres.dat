5000|$|According to the American Freethought Podcast, {{the book}} {{talks about how}} the case was started and how long {{everything}} took. They considered the book to be very [...] "readable" [...] with [...] "great narration" [...] and jokingly stated that it was [...] "fantastic for a COBOL programmer". Reviewing the book in Skeptical Inquirer <b>magazine,</b> Glenn <b>Branch</b> felt that the book's account of the pre-trial was [...] "especially interesting" [...] as the media did not cover that aspect as much, the book reveals {{a lot about the}} first settlement offer as well as Selman's deposition using transcripts, and also the involvement of the expert witnesses. Branch {{would have liked to have}} seen more credit given to the role that Kitzmiller v. Dover had on forcing the school board to settle. According to Branch the book is missing several explanations that would have helped explain the story further. Selman stated that he originally wrote enough for two books, but was advised to cut it back to the content he eventually published. Branch said that the book would have profited by a [...] "firm editorial hand" [...] to clean up the prose and references. He also states that not having a bibliography and index was [...] "mildly frustrating". Branch mentioned that Selman's writing style is [...] "engaging" [...] and states that the use of Yiddish phrases throughout the book will delight some readers.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is travel journalism; despite being a lifestyle genre, it provides important information about {{the image of the}} world. The object of this work is to analyse selected travel articles in the Czech National Geographic magazine, Koktejl magazine and on the Big trip blog during the given period from July until December 2015. The Czech National Geographic <b>magazine</b> is a <b>branch</b> of American National Geographic, where most of the articles are translated from the original version. Koktejl is a Czech geographic magazine with articles written by local authors. Big trip is a personal blog of Ladislav Bezděk and Kateřina Dvořáková; therefore the texts published there are different than those published in the magazines. Researched travelogues are divided by media and cultural resemblance. The aim of the work is to determine, using the qualitative content analysis, in what way the chosen media inform about the areas contained in the texts. This bachelor thesis pays attention to the representation of the world, text range, style, and the position that the geography of travel journalism has in comparison with the geography of foreign news. The theoretical segment contains the characteristic of the chosen media and travel journalism, and is based mainly on foreign literature...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system in Dutch medicine 1820 - 1880 The Netherlands went metric in 1820 and the medical sciences were supposed to follow suit, except for apothecaries weight, which {{was very close to}} the Anglo-Saxon variant and was not abolished before 1870. Doctors and pharmacists had opposed metric weights in pharmacy in 1820 because they were afraid of errors that could lead to loss of life. On the continent old local and Paris units were used in general medical science. It took many decades for the metric system to become predominant in trade and daily life. The same slow acceptance was reflected in the medical sciences. Before it began to make tentative inroads, the metric system was entirely ignored for at least 15 years by the Dutch medical professions. Articles and other texts in medical magazines illustrate this. The slow advance of metric was also hindered by international, especially German influences. The other European nations began to go metric from 1840 onwards and France was the first to do so. Under Napoleon Bonaparte France had reverted to old units for daily life and retail trade in 1812. When Germany, a nation with a profound influence on Dutch medical science, went metric in 1870, the ultimate collapse of the old units began. Their presence in <b>magazines</b> dwindled and <b>branches</b> of medical science such as obstetrics and ophtalmology went metric; the former changed slowly and without planning, the latter went metric after an international agreement in 1866...|$|R
