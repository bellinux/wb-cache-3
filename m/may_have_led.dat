5|$|Tibbie Tamson, an 18th-century Scots woman, whose {{persecution}} <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to her suicide.|$|E
5|$|Little Thetford {{resisted}} the Parliamentary Inclosure Acts of William IV for sevenyears, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> {{to the strong}} Baptist following amongst the poor of the village. About half of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed under the Parliamentary Inclosure Thetford Act of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Pope John Paul II {{provided}} a moral focus for anti-communism; {{a visit to}} his native Poland in 1979 stimulated a religious and nationalist resurgence centered on the Solidarity movement that galvanized opposition and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to his attempted assassination two years later.|$|E
50|$|Ishaq <b>may</b> <b>have</b> {{subsequently}} <b>led</b> {{the pilgrimage}} of 817.|$|R
25|$|Domestication <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>led</b> to more {{varieties}} of coat colors.|$|R
50|$|Schwarzschild's {{struggle}} with pemphigus <b>may</b> <b>have</b> eventually <b>led</b> to his death. He died on May 11, 1916.|$|R
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to melting {{of the ice}} if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, {{is likely to have}} frozen long ago. Among Uranian moons Umbriel was least subjected to endogenic resurfacing processes, although it may like other Uranian moons have experienced a very early resurfacing event.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 13th century, {{women of}} the court were {{expected}} to be able to sing, play instruments, and write jocs partis, or partimen (a debate or dialogue {{in the form of a}} poem). The cultivation of these womanly skills <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the writings of the trobairitz.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to Feuilley's claims, Dubois {{mentioned}} that the Mascarene parrot was not edible which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to Réunion visitors mostly ignoring it. It {{was the last of}} the indigenous parrots of Réunion to become extinct. The only endemic bird species on Réunion that disappeared after the Mascarene parrot was the hoopoe starling in the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these factors and {{continuing}} corruption, the additional funding <b>may</b> not <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a large improvement in the Russian Army's effectiveness.|$|R
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Bede's work, {{because it was so}} widely copied, {{discouraged}} others from writing histories and <b>may</b> even <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.|$|R
50|$|McGinty left Bellshill in <b>May</b> 2015 <b>having</b> <b>led</b> {{the club}} to {{promotion}} to the West of Scotland Super League First Division. He re-entered the Junior game as Rossvale manager in March 2016.|$|R
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils were surrounded by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the distortion of {{the shape of the}} head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, the Anne Frank House {{published}} {{new research}} pointing to investigation over ration card fraud, rather than betrayal, as a plausible {{explanation for the}} raid {{that led to the}} arrest of the Franks. The report states that other activities in the building <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> authorities there, including activities of Frank's company. However, it does not rule out betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{and some}} of his {{siblings}} said they had been physically and psychologically abused by their father, Joseph Jackson. In 2003, Joseph admitted to whipping them as children, but has emphatically rejected the longstanding abuse allegations. The whippings deeply traumatized Jackson and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the onset of further health issues later in his life. Physicians speculated that he had body dysmorphic disorder.|$|E
50|$|The latest {{redesign}} which commenced in <b>May</b> 2017 <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to a {{large number}} of complaints from subscribers, chiefly that the chat room facility (which was unavaialble for three weeks) has not since worked correctly.|$|R
50|$|Heterospory {{developed}} due {{to natural}} selection pressures that encouraged {{an increase in}} propagule size. This <b>may</b> first <b>have</b> <b>led</b> {{to an increase in}} spore size and ultimately resulted in the species producing larger megaspores as well as smaller microspores.|$|R
50|$|Norris {{was known}} to spar 12 rounds every other day in {{preparation}} for fights. Some speculate that this intense training routine is a factor which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> ultimately <b>led</b> to his early expiration as a fighter.|$|R
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused by global dimming. Climate modelers speculatively suggest that this reduction in solar radiation at the surface <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the failure of the monsoon in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1970s and 1980s, together with the associated famines such as the Sahel drought, caused by Northern hemisphere pollution cooling the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Michael's domain in Epirus {{became a}} refuge and centre of {{resistance}} of the Greeks against the Latin Crusaders. At about the same time, according to some modern scholars, he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> the abortive Greek resistance to the Crusaders in the Peloponnese, which was crushed at the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras; according to other views, he <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> a campaign there between 1207 and 1209. In order to avoid invasion and buy time to consolidate his position in Epirus, Michael soon entered into negotiations with Pope Innocent III, and concluded treaties with the Latin Empire and the Republic of Venice. In the meantime, his rule received a boost in legitimacy when he ransomed the deposed Alexios III from captivity. According to later chroniclers, Alexios III conferred the hereditary rule of Epirus to Michael and his descendants.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records {{indicate}} that {{it used to be}} more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, is threatened by human development.|$|E
25|$|By 1900 the Girls' Classical School {{was having}} {{financial}} problems as rival private schools {{were established in}} the city and public high schools became more common in Indiana. Sewall's more progressive ideas <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the drop in enrollment.|$|R
50|$|Orton's {{experiences}} waging environmental {{campaigns in}} Nova Scotia <b>may</b> also <b>have</b> <b>led</b> him {{to adopt the}} central principles of deep ecology. The province's economy is heavily dependent on the extraction of natural resources, and it relies heavily on industrial forestry.|$|R
50|$|Before the Neosho mucket was {{identified}} as a separate species, it was probably commercially popular especially as a source species for pearl button manufacture, which <b>may</b> <b>have</b> partly <b>led</b> to the population and range decline presently observed.|$|R
5|$|Spalding's {{memorial}} became relatively obscure, and was {{not covered}} extensively in any publication about Lutyens' works until the publication of Tim Skelton's Lutyens and the Great War in 2008. Barbara McLaren later married Bernard Freyberg, {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Division, which Skelton speculates <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to Lutyens' commission for the Royal Naval Division Memorial on Horse Guards Parade in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{debut of}} deep-fried butter in 2010 at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to {{a rise in}} {{attendance}} at the event. During the 18-day event in 2010, the concession stand purveying the dish sold 9,000 orders, which equated to 36,000 individual deep-fried butter balls using 800 pounds of butter. The dish was served in portions of four balls at the event, which totaled 315 calories.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} use of the stirrup from the 8th century on aided the warrior's stability and security in the saddle when fighting. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to greater use of shock tactics, although a couched lance could be used effectively without stirrups. In particular, Charles Martel recognized the military potential of the stirrup, and distributed seized lands to his retainers on condition that they serve him by fighting in the new manner.|$|E
5000|$|Journalist Lou Cannon {{writes that}} Jack Reagan was an {{alcoholic}} in his book Reagan. This <b>may</b> <b>have</b> [...] <b>led</b> to his death on May 19, 1941, {{at the age of}} 57 after a series of heart attacks.|$|R
50|$|Tägtgrens {{experience}} as a producer <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the bands change in musical direction, as he is more closely involved with many other bands while producing their albums.|$|R
50|$|In 1911 Mackrell again {{played for}} New Zealand in an {{exhibition}} match against Auckland. Mackrell received a kick to the head in a 1912 match which forced his retirement and <b>may</b> <b>have</b> also <b>led</b> to his early death.|$|R
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to melting {{of the ice}} if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle.

The ocean, however, {{is likely to have}} frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface. The liquids from the ocean may have been able to erupt to the surface, flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} cause of {{collapse}} at Tikal is overpopulation and agrarian failure. The fall of Tikal was {{a blow to}} the heart of Classic Maya civilization, the city having {{been at the forefront of}} courtly life, art and architecture for over a thousand years, with an ancient ruling dynasty. However, new research regarding paleoenvironmental proxies from the Tikal reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to the abandonment of Tikal.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: {{sagebrush}} {{and several}} species of cactus are interspersed with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
