40|$|Background: Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) symbiosis is {{the most}} widespread association between plant roots and fungi in natural and agricultural ecosystems. This work investigated the influence of <b>mycorrhization</b> on the economically relevant part of the tomato plant, by analyzing {{its impact on the}} physiology of the fruit. To this aim, a combination of phenological observations, transcriptomics (Microarrays and qRT-PCR) and biochemical analyses was used to unravel the changes that occur on fruits from Micro-Tom tomato plants colonized by the AM fungus Glomus mosseae. Results: <b>Mycorrhization</b> accelerated the flowering and fruit development and increased the fruit yield. Eleven transcripts were differentially regulated in the fruit upon <b>mycorrhization,</b> and the mycorrhiza-responsive genes resulted to be involved in nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism as well as in regulation and signal transduction. <b>Mycorrhization</b> has increased the amino acid abundance in the fruit from mycorrhizal plants, with glutamine and asparagine being the most responsive amino acids.

We here provide a brief overview of the state of knowledge of <b>mycorrhization</b> in ferns. Only about 62 % of species studied to date have mycorrhizae, with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (mainly Glomeromycta) being the dominant partners, while other associations are made with ascomycetes and the so-called Dark Septate Endophytes. There is no clear phylogenetic signal in <b>mycorrhization</b> among ferns, with both basal (e. g., Anemiaceae, Gleicheniaceae, Cyatheaceae) and derived families (e. g., non-grammitid Polypodiaceae, Tectariaceae, Aspleniaceae) having < 50 % of species mycorrhizal. Ecologically, epiphytes have lower degrees of <b>mycorrhization</b> than terrestrial species, with aquatic taxa almost completely lacking mycorrhizae. This probably reflects the requirements of the fungi. There are no experimental studies on the benefits of mycorrhizae for ferns, but field experiments suggest that there is a fine balance between positive and negative effects, so that many fern species have disposed of the fungi either generally or facultatively.

Samp. by the black truffle fungus T. melanosporum Vittad. by quantitative and molecular analyses. Area of study : seedlings inoculated by different Spanish suppliers. Material and methods : The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of mycorrhizae from different plants were amplified by nested PCR involving fluorescently-labelled primers, and the amplicons either directly sized by ARISA or analysed by TRFLP following their digestion with restriction endonucleases. TRFLP analysis distinguished between mycorrhizae of T. melanosporum, T. indicum Cooke & Massee and T. borchii Vittad., as suggested possible by virtual (in silico) TRFLP analysis and real TRFLP analysis of the ascomata of these species. Main results : Significant differences between suppliers were detected in terms of the mean number of mycorrhizae established per plant and percentage <b>mycorrhization.</b> These results allowed the following quality standards for 2 year-old plants to be proposed: a) good quality: > 3000 mycorrhizae/plant, > 40 % <b>mycorrhization,</b> b) medium (acceptable) : > 3000 mycorrhizae/plant, > 30 % <b>mycorrhization,</b> c) low quality: < 3000 mycorrhizae/plant or < 30 % <b>mycorrhization,</b> always supposing the mycorrhizae counted represent the species of interest as confirmed by the presence of its DNA and the absence of DNA belonging to contaminating species.

Area of study : truffle-inoculated seedlings produced by Italian commercial nurseries. Material and Methods : analysis of truffle-inoculated seedlings for health and quality standards; recording of presence of inoculated Tuber spp. and other concurrent fungi according to the official Italian method for certification; selective amplification of ectomycorrhizal DNA by PCR species-specific primers.

The highest mean percentage of the inoculated Tuber spp., but also the highest presence of contaminants, were recorded after three years. The <b>mycorrhization</b> level of Tuber melanosporum and T. aestivum was higher in Corylus and Ostrya seedlings than in Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, but the latter two host species showed the lowest presence of other ectomycorrhizal fungi. <b>Mycorrhization</b> level distribution in truffle-inoculated seedlings of suitable batches differed very little from the distribution in only all suitable seedlings.

The effects of <b>mycorrhization</b> over a wide range of combinations between N availability, N concentration in plant tissues, and degree of mycorrhizal colonization were studied in Pinus pinaster L. mycorrhizal with Pisolithus tinctorius. Several plant productivity parameters, the seedlings’ N status, chl a fluorescence (JIP test), and mycorrhizal colonization were measured. N was always limiting. A gradient of mycorrhizal effects over the host plant’s growth and vitality was successfully obtained. The mycorrhizal effects on plant growth and N uptake were very strongly and positively correlated, and no evidence was found of a C limitation to growth, confirming hypothesis 1. Indications were found that the plants continued to provide C to the fungus although the N supplied by it was increasingly lower, denying hypothesis 2.

40|$|A major {{limitation}} {{to plant}} growth is the restricted access to nutrients in the soil. To improve nutrient acquisition, {{the majority of}} land plants enter a beneficial symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The accommodation of fungal hyphae in roots requires the extensive transcriptional reprogramming of host cells. Several GRASdomain proteins, including NSP 1 (NODULATION SIGNALLING PATHWAY 1), NSP 2, and RAM 1 (REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR <b>MYCORRHIZATION</b> 1), have emerged as important transcriptional regulators during <b>mycorrhization.</b> Interaction studies suggest that these proteins form multicomponent complexes, raising the question whether they regulate similar or different mycorrhizal processes. Here, the functions of NSP 1, NSP 2 and RAM 1 during AM development were investigated by detailed phenotypic and transcriptional analyses of the corresponding loss‐of‐function mutants. Global gene expression profiling of nsp 1 ‐ 1 revealed that NSP 1 {{is required for the}} expression {{of a large number of}} genes involved in strigolactone and gibberellin biosynthesis at the pre‐contact stage of AM development. Strigolactones are known to attract the fungus to the root. In line with this, the quantification of mycorrhizal structures showed a delay in <b>mycorrhization</b> in nsp 1 ‐ 1. Transcriptional profiling confirmed that the expression of the majority of mycorrhizal‐induced genes was delayed, but not abolished in nsp 1 ‐ 1, suggesting that NSP 1 only has a minor role in the transcriptional regulation once the contact between the fungus and the roots has been established. Unlike NSP 1, RAM 1 plays a critical role in the transcriptional regulation at later stages of AM symbiosis. <b>Mycorrhization</b> was strongly impaired in ram 1 ‐ 1, and transcriptional profiling revealed that RAM 1 is essential for the expression of several genes involved in arbuscule development and the nutrient exchange between the symbionts. Meanwhile, the exact function of NSP 2 remains unclear, as no effect on <b>mycorrhization</b> was observed in nsp 2 ‐ 2 under the conditions tested here. These findings suggest that NSP 1, NSP 2 and RAM 1 play largely different roles in the transcriptional regulation during AM development...|$|E

These ascomycetes are common and widespread colonizers of tree roots. Some PAC strains reduce growth increments of their hosts but are beneficial in protecting roots against pathogens. Nothing {{is known about}} the effects of PAC on mycorrhizal fungi and the PAC-mycorrhiza association on plant growth, even though these two fungal groups occur closely together in natural habitats. We expect reduced colonization rates and reduced negative effects of PAC on host plants if roots are co-colonized by an ectomycorrhizal fungus (ECM). Depending on the temperature regime interactions among the partners in this tripartite ECM-PAC-plant system might also change. To test our hypotheses, effects of four PAC genotypes (two pathogenic and two non-pathogenic on the Norway spruce), <b>mycorrhization</b> by Laccaria bicolor (strain S 238 N) and two temperature regimes (196 C and 256 C) on the biomass of the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings were studied. <b>Mycorrhization</b> compensated the adverse effects of PAC on the growth of the Norway spruce at both temperatures. The growth of the Douglas-fir was not influenced either by PAC or <b>mycorrhization</b> at 19 uC, but at 25 uC <b>mycorrhization</b> had a similar protective effect as in the Norway spruce.

DSE colonisations were lower than in comparable samples of ferns from the Andes, suggesting a geographical or taxonomic pattern in this type of colonisation.

This study presents the first comparison of the colonization patterns of both fungal and bacterial consortia in the roots and mycospheres of different boreal forest ericoid species. Experimentally, the mycorrhizal fungal and bacterial communities of roots of the Ericaceous species Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Calluna vulgaris were characterized and quantified. To simulate natural conditions, the host species were grown in forest soil microcosms under controlled conditions with <b>mycorrhization</b> occurring naturally. The morphology and intensity of root colonization by ericoid mycorrhizal fungi was determined through light microscopy. Quantification of fungal and bacterial abundances was performed using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction for the roots and soil of each species. Microscopic analysis revealed differences in both morphology and intensity of ericoid <b>mycorrhization</b> for the species studied. The fungal and bacterial abundances for the roots of each host species were found to be significantly different, while the soil abundances of each species showed considerable variation and were not found to be significantly different. An intriguing connection between the fungal and bacterial abundances colonizing the root systems of the different plant species was indicated by comparison. These findings begin to clarify the unique relationships each ericoid species has with the highly diverse fungi and bacteria of their environment. Further refinement of techniques and more in depth analyses are suggested for confirming the differences indicated by these results.

Under high Pi supply (100 µM), only minor differences were observed, whereas in response to Pi-limitation (3 µM) several lines exhibited a drastically changed number of lateral roots. Five lines showing the highest alterations or deviations in RSA were selected and inoculated with R. irregularis using two different Pi-fertilization regimes with either 13 mM or 3 mM Pi. <b>Mycorrhization</b> rate of these lines was checked in detail by molecular markers, such as transcript levels of RiTubulin and MtPT 4. Under high phosphate supply, the ecotypes L 000368 and L 000555 exhibited slightly increased fungal colonization and more functional arbuscules, respectively. To address the question, whether capability for mycorrhizal colonization might be correlated to general invasion by microorganisms, selected lines were checked for infection by the root rot causing pathogen, Aphanoymces euteiches. The mycorrhizal colonization phenotype, however, did not correlate with the resistance phenotype upon infection with two strains of A. euteiches as L 000368 showed partial resistance and L 000555 exhibited high susceptibility as determined by quantification of A. euteiches rRNA within infected roots. Although there is genetic diversity in respect to pathogen infection, genetic diversity in mycorrhizal colonization of M. truncatula is rather low {{and it will be}} rather difficult {{to use it as a}} trait to access genetic markers...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study was conducted}} during the raining seasons 2012 through 2015 to assess the status of arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi associated with 4 legumes and millet on the sandy soil of Sadoré, Niger. A factorial completely randomized block design {{was used for the}} layout. Crop roots parameters of <b>mycorrhization</b> and soil fungi spore density and biodiversity were investigated as responses to varied planting densities, rates of rock phosphate, and of urea application on millet monoculture. Spores of Glomus were present in 100 % of plots with respectively 96 %, 47 %, 77 %, and 13 % as relative frequency during rainy seasons 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015; but spores of Gigaspora were present in 70 % of plots and with 3. 63 %, 4 %, 1. 38 %, and 1 % as relative frequency the same years. Spore density/ 100 g of root zone soil varied with crop species and rate of applied crop residue. The maximum intensity of <b>mycorrhization</b> was 78 % while the arbuscular had a rate of 48 % as maximum. The parameters of <b>mycorrhization</b> were influenced by the crop species but not by the rates of applied rock phosphate and the rate of returned crop residues as well. Millet yield in monoculture was affected by residual effects of previous basis legume crop...|$|E
40|$|Micropropagated banana plantlets {{represent}} a good planting material to establish new growing areas or replace old plantations. The plantlets are devoid of pathogens {{but also of}} beneficial root inhabitants (e. g., endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF]) that may help plants withstand stresses. <b>Mycorrhization</b> of banana is usually conducted at the hardening/post-hardening phases. Only {{a few studies have}} reported their application in vitro, and none have investigated the subsequent impact on ex vitro acclimatization. Here, we report {{for the first time the}} effects of in vitro <b>mycorrhization</b> of banana plantlets on growth following transfer to soil. Banana plantlets were pre-mycorrhized under autotrophic conditions. During in vitro culture, heavy root colonization of the banana plantlets was observed. At 5 and 7 wk after transfer to a peat–sand soil substrate, the root system remained highly colonized. The growth (pseudostem height) and biomass were significantly higher than those of control plants grown on media without AMF. The mean shoot dry weight of the pre-mycorrhized plants at 5 wk after transplanting was 66. 7 and 34. 6 % greater than those of non-mycorrhized plantlets grown on modified Strullu-Romand (MSR) and Murashige and Skoog (MS) media, respectively, and was also greater at week 7 (by 64. 7 and 40 %, respectively). In vitro <b>mycorrhization</b> under autotrophic culture conditions thus represents a promising tool for the pre-adaptation of micropropagated banana plantlets to ex vitro conditions...|$|E
