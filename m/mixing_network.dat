The sexual <b>mixing</b> <b>network</b> identifies all partnerships within a population over a given period and is a powerful tool in the study of such infections. Previous models assumed all links within the network to be concurrent active partnerships. We present a novel modelling approach in which we adapt the notion of a sexual contact network to a monogamous population by allowing the nature of the links to change. We use the underlying network to represent potential Sexual partnerships, only some of which are active at any one time. Thus serial monogamy can be modelled while maintaining the patterns of mixing displayed by the population. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

The largest reduction measured {{in the number of}} infections was achieved when combining ring vaccination with a pre-vaccination of health care personnel. In terms of per dose effectiveness, ring vaccination was by far the most effective strategy. While unsurprising, the results can to some extent be adapted to other diseases and environments, including other countries, and the methodology employed can be analysed in its own right. The mixing networks and other intrinsic structures generated {{with the help of the}} model could prove useful to a larger class of problems within policy making, for example...|$|E

The case where the sources are immobile persons speaking in a reverberant room is of particular interest, because it represents a first step toward unlocking the so-called "cocktail party problem". Due to the reverberations, BSS in the time domain is usually expensive in terms of computations, but the number of computations can be significantly decreased if separation is carried out in subbands. An implementation of a subband-based BSS system using DFT filter banks is described, and an adaptive algorithm tailored for subband separation is developed. Aliasing present in the filter bank (due to the non-ideal frequency response of the filters) is reduced by using an oversampled scheme. Experiments, conducted with two-input two-output BSS systems, using both subband and fullband adaptation, indicate that separation and distortion rates are similar for both systems. However, the proposed 32 -subband system is approximately 10 times computationally faster than the fullband system...|$|E

40|$|Anonymity {{technologies}} such as <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> have gained increasing attention {{as a way to}} provide communication privacy. <b>Mix</b> <b>networks</b> were developed for messagebased applications such as email, but researchers have adapted mix techniques to low-latency, flow-based applications such as anonymous web browsing. Although a significant effort has been directed at discovering attacks against anonymity networks and developing countermeasures to those attacks, there is little systematic analysis of the quality of service (QoS) for such security and privacy systems. In this paper, we systematically address TCP performance issues of flow-based <b>mix</b> <b>networks.</b> A <b>mix’s</b> batching and reordering schemes can dramatically reduce TCP throughput due to out-of-order packet delivery.

Our proposed approaches will not degrade the system anonymity degree since they don’t change the underlying anonymity mechanism. Our data matched our theoretical analysis well.

In addition, direct interference of Sp 1 binding to DNA cognate sites using DNA-interacting compounds may provide promising therapies for suppression of cancer progression and viral replication. In this study, we present a rapid, sensitive and cost-effective evaluation of a GC intercalative drug, doxorubicin (DOX), in dissociating the Sp 1 –DNA complex using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in a microfluidic system. FCS allows assay miniaturization without compromising sensitivity, making it an ideal analytical method for integration of binding assays into high-throughput, microfluidic platforms. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -based microfluidic chip with a <b>mixing</b> <b>network</b> is used to achieve specific drug concentrations for drug titration experiments. Using FCS measurements, the IC 50 of DOX on the dissociation of Sp 1 –DNA complex is estimated to be 0. 55 μM, which is comparable to that measured by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). However, completion of one drug titration experiment on the proposed microfluidic-FCS platform is accomplished using only picograms of protein and DNA samples and less than 1 h total assay time, demonstrating vast improvements over traditional ensemble techniques...|$|E
40|$|Networks and the {{epidemiology}} of directly transmitted {{infectious diseases}} are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models {{were based on}} population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a network,. Knowledge {{of the structure of}} the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the <b>mixing</b> <b>network,</b> or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control...|$|E
40|$|In an {{electronic}} election several cryptographic proofs are implemented {{to guarantee that}} all {{the process has been}} fair. Many cryptographic primitives are based on the hardness of the discrete logarithm, factorization and other related problems. However, these problems are efficiently computable with a quantum computer, and new proofs are needed based on different assumptions not broken by quantum computers. Lattice based cryptography seems {{one of the most promising}} post-quantum alternatives. In this thesis we present a coercion resistant cast as intended proof and a proof of a shuffle, both completely based on lattice problems as Inhomogeneous Short Integer Solution (ISIS) and Ring Learning With Errors (RLWE). With the first we prove to the voter that his vote correctly encodes his voting option, without allowing him to prove to a third party that he has chosen a specific option, to avoid the possibility of vote selling. Shuffles are permutations and re-encryptions of casted votes performed by <b>mixing</b> <b>network</b> nodes (mix- net nodes), so that the output can not be related with the input and nobody can link a decrypted vote with the voter who casted it. Given that the goal is to make the output not linkable to the input it is essential to provide a proof of it being a correct shuffle that has preserved the integrity of the votes, without deleting, adding of modifying any of them. To prove both things we have constructed non interactive zero-knowledge proofs, from which anyone can be convinced that a statement is true (with overwhelming probability over a security parameter) with- out revealing any information about the elements that witness it being true...|$|E
40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, using the Internet is not {{anonymous}} at all. Since the Internet is a packet-switching network, every IP packet must carry the IP addresses of both communication endpoints. Consequently, anyone capable of observing {{at least one}} packet of a communication relationship can tell who is communicating with whom. The problem with this lack of anonymity is that it limits the privacy protection of Internet users. Today, privacy issues in the Internet are usually addressed by legislations that require operators of servers to clearly state their privacy practices and by encrypting the application data exchanged between two communicating parties. In general, privacy practices are difficult to enforce and encrypting the application data does not hide the IP addresses in the IP packets. However, learning the endpoints of communications relationships often reveals {{a lot of information}} about individual Internet users' preferences, habits, and problems; for instance when accessing web sites that provide medical information, religious sites, or the web site of a credit institution. These privacy issues can only be solved by enabling anonymous Internet communication. In this thesis, we work on the problem of achieving anonymous Internet access for low-latency applications such as web browsing. With anonymous Internet access, we mean that a client can connect to and communicate with a server such that the server does not learn the client?s IP address and an attacker interested in learning who is communicating with whom cannot find out the IP addresses of both client and server. Unlike encryption, anonymity cannot be "produced" by the communication endpoints themselves, but must be provided by a third party infrastructure. The concept of <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> is widely considered to be the most promising approach for such an infrastructure, and consequently, we focus on <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> in these thesis. The main contribution of our work is MorphMix, which fulfils the principal goal of this thesis: to develop a practical <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> that enables anonymous low-latency Internet access for a large number of users. With practical, we mean that (1) everybody owning a state-of-the-art computer connected to the Internet can use the system, (2) the performance it offers is good enough such that users won?t turn away from it, (3) it provides good protection from attacks by a realistic adversary, and (4) it scales well and can handle a large number of users. We first analyse traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> that strictly separate between the <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure and clients that access servers through the <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> The conclusion is that traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> are not well suited to achieve our principal goal for various reasons. To overcome their limitations, we propose MorphMix, which presents a novel way of operating and organising a <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> In contrast to traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks,</b> MorphMix does no longer distinguish between clients and the <b>mix</b> <b>network.</b> Rather, the clients themselves build the <b>mix</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure in a peer-to-peer fashion. After describing the basic functionality of MorphMix, we give detailed analyses to show that MorphMix scales very well and provides good protection from a realistic adversary. To analyse the performance MorphMix offers to its users, we have implemented a simulator. The simulation results show that the expected performance of MorphMix is indeed good enough to attract users, and that the requirements to use MorphMix are modest. We have also specified the complete MorphMix protocol and have implemented a prototype. The main conclusion of our work is that with respect to our principal goal, MorphMix overcomes the limitations of traditional <b>mix</b> <b>networks</b> and is the first practical system that enables anonymous low-latency Internet access for a large number of users...|$|R
