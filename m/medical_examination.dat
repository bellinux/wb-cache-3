40|$|Background: {{although}} dermatitis is {{a common}} occupational disease, {{little is known about}} dermatitis amongst commercial airline pilots.

5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E
5|$|Applicant (license holder) must {{be cleared}} by his general {{practitioner}} as being fit to possess, carry {{and use a}} firearm.

The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> is obligatory in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.|$|E

5|$|Medical fitness to dive is {{the medical}} and {{physical}} suitability of a diver to function safely in the underwater environment using underwater diving equipment and procedures. Depending on the circumstances it may be established by a signed statement by the diver {{that he or she}} does not suffer from any of the disqualifying conditions and is able to manage the ordinary physical requirements of diving, by a detailed <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> by a physician registered as a medical examiner of divers following a prescribed procedural checklist, attested by a legal document of fitness to dive issued by the medical examiner and recorded on a national database, or by alternatives between these extremes.|$|E

5|$|Realising the {{potential}} public relations coup {{in having a}} star sportsman enlist, officers recommended that Nash be seconded to the Army School of Physical Training (where Don Bradman {{had been given a}} commission), which offered greater pay and rank and ensured that Nash would not be posted overseas, away from family. Additionally, a <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> detected osteoarthritis in both his knees, derived from the number of injuries he sustained throughout his footballing career. Nash refused, stating that he did not wish to be treated differently from ordinary recruits, and enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, gaining the rank of Trooper.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{choice of}} a four-man team for the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> raised doubts about his fitness.|$|E

5|$|Within {{months of}} his leaving the premiership Chamberlain's health began to fail; he {{resigned}} from the cabinet, and died after a short illness in November 1940. Dunglass had volunteered for active military service, seeking to rejoin the Lanarkshire Yeomanry shortly after Chamberlain left Downing Street. The consequent <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> revealed that Dunglass had {{a hole in his}} spine surrounded by tuberculosis in the bone. Without surgery he would have been unable to walk within a matter of months. An innovative and hazardous operation was performed in September 1940, lasting six hours, in which the diseased bone in the spine was scraped away and replaced with healthy bone from the patient's shin.|$|E
5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a warehouseman. In 1999, after a <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on welfare benefits for the long-term unemployed at the time of the murder. In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E
5|$|Despite the dissatisfaction {{of the men}} in the SWPA, the {{demobilisation}} and repatriation process generally proceeded smoothly. Most men {{had been}} returned to Australia by January 1946 and 80 percent were demobilised by the middle of the year. Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a <b>medical</b> <b>examination,</b> interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration entitlements. Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training. A further 135,000 began training but withdrew before completing their course.|$|E

5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E
5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced <b>medical</b> <b>examination</b> of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Mladen {{and other}} members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in Zenica. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ilić, whose death penalty had been {{commuted}} to 20 years' imprisonment. In the Zenica prison, each convict had to spend the first three months in solitary confinement. This was very hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ilić could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital. In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ilić. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a <b>medical</b> <b>examination,</b> he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.|$|E
