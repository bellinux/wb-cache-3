After each step, the materials were characterized regarding the porosity, using inert gas (argon, nitrogen) physisorption measurements. Also, the structure was investigated by small-angle X-ray diffraction analysis and thermogravimetric analysis was used for determination of the amount of grafted material. A total of 17 % by weight of organic material was introduced in the porous host and the structure was preserved during the grafting process.

40|$|In {{previous}} work [1] we showed an unusual temperature dependence for water adsorption in porous activated carbons, and {{hypothesized that the}} pore size plays {{a critical role in}} water adsorption in <b>mesopores.</b> In this paper, we shed further light on water adsorption in <b>mesopores</b> by investigating its dependence on temperature for a highly graphitized non-porous carbon black and a highly ordered mesoporous carbon, Hex.

Analysis of the isotherms for these systems shows that adsorption proceeds by nucleation of water molecules around functional groups (FG) to form an embryo FG-water complex, which grows with increasing pressure to form a cluster. If the clusters are closer than a critical separation, they agglomerate to form a condensate, and provided that the pore size is small enough, the adsorbate fills the confined space.

The results of pore structure studies of Creek lignite are reported in this work. Isothermal drying of Creek lignite samples, under vacuum, caused <b>mesopore</b> structure evolution despite the severe (similar to 50 %) particle size contraction due to heating. <b>Mesopore</b> volume and surface area were increased as the drying temperature was raised to 200 degreesC while further drying up to 250 degreesC caused a <b>mesopore</b> volume and surface area decrease. Lignite drying at 100 degreesC for up to 3 h resulted in a monotonic increase of the <b>mesopore</b> structure properties while heating {{for a longer period}} i. e., 6 h, despite a slight increase of weight loss, caused pore volume and surface area reduction.

Textural analysis showed that all samples had high surface areas (similar to 1000 m(2) /g), large pore volumes (similar to 1. 2 cm(3) /g) and uniform <b>mesopore</b> size (similar to 2. 6 nm).

Transmission electron microscopy observations and CO chemisorption results revealed that this unique bimodal mesoporous structure helped to decrease the particle size of Pd nanoparticles and could further enhance their dispersion. Activity tests revealed the Pd/BMS- 5 -Pd/BMS- 20 catalysts with a bimodal <b>mesopore</b> structure possessed superior catalytic performance for the oxidation of toluene compared to Pd/BMS- 30 with a unimodal <b>mesopore</b> structure.
