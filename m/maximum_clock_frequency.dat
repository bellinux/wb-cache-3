There are many different switching devices {{that could be used}} in such a circuit, but in integrated circuits MOSFET devices are frequently employed.Another basic concept is the charge pump, a version of which is shown schematically in figure 6. The charge pump capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage.

It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump a small amount of charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. While CO is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage.

To confront {{this problem in}} embedded computation either {{in the form of}} programmable processors or FSMD (Finite-State Machine with Datapath) architectures, the use of customized loop controllers has been suggested. In this paper, a thorough examination of zero-cycle overhead loop controllers applicable to perfect loop nests operating on multi-dimensional data is presented. The design of such loop controllers is formalized by the introduction of a hardware algorithm that fully automates this task for the spectrum of behavioral as well as generated register-transfer level architectures. The presented algorithm would prove beneficial in the field of high-level synthesis of architectures for data-intensive processing. It is also shown that the proposed loop controllers can be efficiently utilized for supporting generalized loop structures such as imperfect loop nests.

We derive simple but accurate approximate expressions that allow us to easily quantify {{the effect of}} <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> offset and the influence of the different system parameters on the receiver performance in practical situations. Further, we show that for both uplink and downlink MC-DS-CDMA, the performance {{in the presence of a}} <b>clock</b> <b>frequency</b> offset rapidly degrades with an increasing number of carriers. It turns out that this degradation is larger in the uplink than in the downlink because the former suffers from a higher level of multiuser interference.
