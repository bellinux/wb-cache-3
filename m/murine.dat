5|$|Lacking any {{protective}} shell or {{means of}} escape, sponges {{have evolved to}} synthesize a variety of unusual compounds. One such class is the oxidized fatty acid derivatives called oxylipins. Members of this family {{have been found to}} have anti-cancer, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. One example isolated from the Okinawan plakortis sponges, plakoridine A, has shown potential as a cytotoxin to <b>murine</b> lymphoma cells.|$|E
5|$|Product safety testing : Sterility (bacteria and fungi), In vitro and in vivo {{testing for}} {{adventitious}} viruses, <b>Murine</b> retrovirus testing... Product safety data needed before the initiation of feasibility trials in serious or immediately life-threatening conditions, it serves to evaluate dangerous potential of the product.|$|E
5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a <b>murine</b> {{monoclonal antibody}} with doxorubicin {{has created an}} immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice. Current treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) still leaves pockets of HIV within the host. The immunoconjugate could potentially provide a complementary treatment to ART to eradicate antigen-expressing T cells.|$|E
5|$|Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and <b>Murine</b> Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are {{prevalent}} {{simply because}} their highly contagious natures work {{in tandem with}} the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. It should be noted, however, that MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent study}} {{detected}} a <b>murine</b> astrovirus in laboratory mice held {{at more than}} half of the US and Japanese institutes investigated. <b>Murine</b> astrovirus was found in nine mice strains, including NSG, NOD-SCID, NSG-3GS, C57BL6-Timp-3−/−, uPA-NOG, B6J, ICR, Bash2, and BALB/C, with various degrees of prevalence. The pathogenicity of the <b>murine</b> astrovirus was not known.|$|E
25|$|The <b>murine</b> {{homologue}} of OSM was not discovered until 1996, {{whereas the}} <b>murine</b> OSMR homologue was not cloned until 1998. Until recently, {{it was thought}} that mOSM only signals through the <b>murine</b> type II receptor, namely through mOSMR/mgp130 complexes, because of a low affinity for the type I receptor counterpart. However, it is now known that, in bone at least, mOSM is able to signal through both mOSMR/mgp130 and mLIFR/mgp130.|$|E
25|$|Initially, <b>murine</b> {{antibodies}} {{were obtained}} by hybridoma technology, for which Jerne, Köhler and Milstein received a Nobel prize. However the dissimilarity between <b>murine</b> and human immune systems led to the clinical failure of these antibodies, except in some specific circumstances. Major problems associated with <b>murine</b> antibodies included reduced stimulation of cytotoxicity and the formation complexes after repeated administration, which resulted in mild allergic reactions and sometimes anaphylactic shock. Hybridoma technology {{has been replaced by}} recombinant DNA technology, transgenic mice and phage display.|$|E
25|$|To reduce <b>murine</b> {{antibody}} immunogenicity (attacks by {{the immune}} system against the antibody), <b>murine</b> molecules were engineered to remove immunogenic content and to increase immunologic efficiency. This was initially achieved by the production of chimeric (suffix -ximab) and humanized antibodies (suffix -zumab). Chimeric antibodies are composed of <b>murine</b> variable regions fused onto human constant regions. Taking human gene sequences from the kappa light chain and the IgG1 heavy chain results in antibodies that are approximately 65% human. This reduces immunogenicity, and thus increases serum half-life.|$|E
25|$|Human {{monoclonal}} antibodies (suffix -umab) {{are produced}} using transgenic mice or phage display libraries by transferring human immunoglobulin genes into the <b>murine</b> genome and vaccinating the transgenic mouse against the desired antigen, {{leading to the}} production of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. <b>Murine</b> antibodies in vitro are thereby transformed into fully human antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) {{involves}} the use of radioactively-conjugated <b>murine</b> antibodies against cellular antigens. Most research {{involves the}}ir application to lymphomas, as these are highly radio-sensitive malignancies. To limit radiation exposure, <b>murine</b> antibodies were chosen, as their high immunogenicity promotes rapid tumor clearance. Tositumomab is an example used for non-Hodgkins lymphoma.|$|E
25|$|M-MLV reverse {{transcriptase}} from the Moloney <b>murine</b> leukemia virus {{is a single}} 75 kDa monomer.|$|E
25|$|Minocycline {{was shown}} to be highly {{effective}} in conferring neuroprotection during <b>murine</b> cerebral malaria.|$|E
25|$|Human HPS90AB1 shares 60% overall {{homology}} to {{its closest}} relative HSP90AA1. <b>Murine</b> HSP90AB1 was cloned in 1987 based on homology of the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster gene.|$|E
25|$|Four major {{antibody}} {{types that}} have been developed are <b>murine,</b> chimeric, humanised and human. Antibodies of each type are distinguished by suffixes on their name.|$|E
25|$|Humanised {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by grafting <b>murine</b> hypervariable regions on amino acid domains into human antibodies. This results in a molecule of approximately 95% human origin. Humanised antibodies bind antigen much more weakly than the parent <b>murine</b> monoclonal antibody, with reported decreases in affinity of up to several hundredfold. Increases in antibody-antigen binding strength have been achieved by introducing mutations into the complementarity determining regions (CDR), using techniques such as chain-shuffling, randomization of complementarity-determining regions and antibodies with mutations within the variable regions induced by error-prone PCR, E. coli mutator strains and site-specific mutagenesis.|$|E

25|$|The <b>murine</b> {{antibody}} 1A1D-2 strongly neutralizes DENV1, DENV2 and DENV3. Its Fab fragment was crystallized {{in complex}} with the ED3 domain of DENV2. Its epitope straddles β-strands A and G of ED3.|$|E
25|$|The <b>murine</b> {{antibody}} E111 neutralizes DENV1. Its Fab and scFv fragments were crystallized {{in complex}} with the ED3 domain of DENV1. Its epitope is located around β-strands C and C' of ED3, and the intervening loop.|$|E
25|$|The <b>murine</b> {{antibody}} 2H12 cross-reacts {{with all}} four DENV serotypes. It neutralizes the corresponding viruses, except DENV2. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domains of DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4. Its epitope is located around the conserved AB loop of ED3.|$|E
25|$|The <b>murine</b> homolog {{of human}} 15(S)-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B), 8(S)-lipoxygenase, while preferring arachidonic acid over {{linoleic}} acid, metabolizes linoleic acid predominantly to (9(S)-HpODE, which in tissues and cells is rapidly reduced to 9(S)-HODE. However, ALOX15B, similar to human 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15), metabolizes linoleic acid to 13(S)-HODE {{but not to}} 9(S)-HODEs.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} some reports of Thy1 {{monoclonal}} antibodies cross reacting with some cytoskeletal elements: anti Thy-1.2 with actin in marsupial, <b>murine,</b> and human cells and anti Thy-1.1 with vimentin, and were suggested {{to be due to}} sequence homology by studies done more than 20 years back.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation {{by either}} COX or {{lipoxygenase}} releases {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and the initial products in eicosanoid generation are themselves highly reactive peroxides. LTA4 can form adducts with tissue DNA. Other reactions of lipoxygenases generate cellular damage; <b>murine</b> models implicate 15-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Pre-mRNA {{sequence}} of miR-712 is {{generated from the}} <b>murine</b> ribosomal RN45s gene at the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2). XRN1 is an exonuclease that degrades the ITS2 region during processing of RN45s. Reduction of XRN1 under d-flow conditions therefore leads to the accumulation of miR-712.|$|E
25|$|While {{mouse and}} human {{antibodies}} are structurally similar, {{the differences between}} them were sufficient to invoke an immune response when <b>murine</b> monoclonal antibodies were injected into humans, resulting in their rapid removal from the blood, as well as systemic inflammatory effects {{and the production of}} human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).|$|E
25|$|The first FDA-approved {{therapeutic}} {{monoclonal antibody}} was a <b>murine</b> IgG2a CD3 specific transplant rejection drug, OKT3 (also called muromonab), in 1986. This drug found use in solid organ transplant recipients who became steroid resistant. Hundreds of therapies are undergoing clinical trials. Most {{are concerned with}} immunological and oncological targets.|$|E
25|$|Human, <b>murine,</b> and porcine TRAP genes all contain 5 exons, {{and have}} the ATG codon at the {{beginning}} of exon 2, with exon 1 being non-coding. Within the exon 1 promoter, there are three distinct “tissue-specific” promoters: 1A, 1B, and 1C. This would allow TRAP expression to be tightly controlled.|$|E
25|$|<b>Murine</b> {{models are}} widely used to test {{hypotheses}} linking genetic components of various diseases with sensorimotor gating. While some of the hypotheses stand to the test, others are not, as some mice models show unchanged or increased PPI contrary to the expectations, as in the tests of COMT-deficient mice.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian TRAP is encoded by one gene, {{which is}} {{localized}} on chromosome 19 (19p13.2-13.3) in humans, and on chromosome 9 in mice. TRAP DNA is, as expected from protein sequencing, highly conserved throughout the class mammalia. The TRAP gene has been cloned and sequenced in porcine, rat, human, and <b>murine</b> species.|$|E
25|$|CTL {{responses}} can {{be enhanced}} by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 or B7-2 for DNA vaccines against influenza nucleoprotein, or GM-CSF for DNA vaccines against the <b>murine</b> malaria model P. yoelii. Co-inoculation with plasmids encoding co-stimulatory molecules IL-12 and TCA3 were shown to increase CTL activity against HIV-1 and influenza nucleoprotein antigens.|$|E
25|$|There {{is concern}} that insertional {{mutagenesis}} due to {{integration into the}} host genome might lead to cancer or leukemia. This concern remained theoretical until gene therapy for ten SCID-X1 patients using Maloney <b>murine</b> leukemia virus resulted in two cases of leukemia caused by activation of the LMO2 oncogene due to nearby integration of the vector.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{therapeutic}} antibodies were <b>murine</b> analogues (suffix -omab). These antibodies have: a short half-life in vivo (due to {{immune complex}} formation), limited penetration into tumour sites and inadequately recruit host effector functions. Chimeric and humanized antibodies have generally replaced them in therapeutic antibody applications. Understanding of proteomics has proven essential in identifying novel tumour targets.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{evidence}} for immunostimulatory CpG sequences comes from <b>murine</b> studies. Extrapolation of this data to other species requires caution – individual species may require different flanking sequences, as binding specificities of scavenger receptors vary across species. Additionally, species such as ruminants may be insensitive to immunostimulatory sequences due to their large gastrointestinal load.|$|E
25|$|The genus Rattus is {{a member}} of the giant {{subfamily}} Murinae. Several other <b>murine</b> genera are sometimes considered part of Rattus: Lenothrix, Anonymomys, Sundamys, Kadarsanomys, Diplothrix, Margaretamys, Lenomys, Komodomys, Palawanomys, Bunomys, Nesoromys, Stenomys, Taeromys, Paruromys, Abditomys, Tryphomys, Limnomys, Tarsomys, Bullimus, Apomys, Millardia, Srilankamys, Niviventer, Maxomys, Leopoldamys, Berylmys, Mastomys, Myomys, Praomys, Hylomyscus, Heimyscus, Stochomys, Dephomys, and Aethomys.|$|E
25|$|Central memory T cells (TCM cells) express CD45RO, C-C {{chemokine}} receptor type 7 (CCR7), and L-selectin (CD62L). Central memory T cells {{also have}} intermediate to high expression of CD44. This memory subpopulation is {{commonly found in}} the lymph nodes and in the peripheral circulation. (Note- CD44 expression is usually used to distinguish <b>murine</b> naive from memory T cells).|$|E
25|$|After tens of {{millions}} of years of relative isolation, Africa-Arabia collided with Eurasia, and the formation of the Isthmus of Panama linked South America and North America, facilitating the distribution of mammals seen today. With the exception of bats and <b>murine</b> rodents, no placental land mammals reached Australasia until the first human settlers arrived approximately 50,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|The <b>murine</b> MKK7 {{protein is}} encoded by 14 exons {{which can be}} {{alternatively}} spliced to yield a group of protein kinases. This results in six isoforms with three possible N-termini (α, β, and γ isoforms) and two possible C-termini (1 and 2 isoforms). The molecular mass of the isoforms spans from 38 to 52 kDa, with between 345 and 467 amino acids.|$|E
