40|$|Backgrounds Renal {{scintigraphy}} with radiolabeled pen-tetic acid (diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid [DTPA]) or, more recently, <b>mertiatide</b> (mercaptoacetyltriglycine [MAG 3]), with {{or without}} captopril challenge, is widely rec ommended as a diagnostic test for renal artery stenosis. Objectives: To address (1) whether the diagnostic ac curacy has been improved {{by the use of}} captopril and the introduction of <b>mertiatide</b> and (2) whether a renal scan that shows abnormalities is a useful criterion to select pa tients for renal arteriography. Patients and Methods: A standard diagnostic proto col, using both scintigraphy and arteriography, was fol lowed in 505 consecutive high-risk hypertensive pa tients who were evaluated for renovascular hypertensio...|$|E
40|$|Objective: A drop of split renal {{function}} often {{constitutes a}} criterion for pyeloplasty in hydronephrosis {{since it is}} considered as representing deterioration of the affected kidney. The aim of this work was to determine, in a selected population of patients with a drop of split function of at least 5 %, if the evolution of single kidney glomerular filtration rate (SKGFR) was parallel to the one of split renal function. Methods: From a large data basis, we found retrospectively only 29 children (10 below and 19 above two years of age at first examination) having had at least two Tc- 99 m <b>mertiatide</b> (Tc- 99 m MAG 3) renographic explorations for various urological diseases, with a decrease of split function of at least 5 % between the two examinations. Evolution of split function was compared to evolution of SKGFR obtained {{by means of the}} combination of Tc- 99 m MAG 3 split function and overall glomerular filtration rate as given by the chromium Cr 51 ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) clearance. Results: For the group above two years of age, SKGFR increased or remained stable in 63 % of the cases, while in the children less than 2 years of age, a decrease of SKGFR was never observed, according to the maturation of overall GFR in this age group. Thus, the decrease of split function was not necessarily associated with a similar decrease of SKGFR. Conclusion: In patients with unilateral or bilateral urological disorders, deterioration of split renal function does not necessary correspond to a loss of function of the affected kidney. SKGFR often modifies the interpretation of split function. Â© 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
