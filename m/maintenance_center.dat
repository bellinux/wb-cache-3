5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Center</b> south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses fixed block signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E
5|$|Located {{entirely in}} southeastern Millard County, SR-161 starts at a diamond {{interchange}} with the westernmost exit on I-70 before it terminates at I-15.

40|$|AbstractThere {{are a lot}} {{of studies}} on {{outsourcing}} and its strategic influence to sustainable growth in the organizations, but little is known about how the subjective thoughts for strategic outsourcing decisions transformed to objective criteria. This study examines a model that evaluates the core capabilities for strategic outsourcing decision. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the core competencies of the aviation <b>maintenance</b> <b>centers</b> for strategic outsourcing. AHP method, which is more of a selection tool and is appropriate in decision making situations, where both quantitative and qualitative criteria have to be considered, is used while evaluating the core capabilities. The criteria, such as flight operation effectiveness, flight safety, technological feature, cost effectiveness, usage quantity, procuring sufficiency and work force, are included in the model. The research data were collected from three aviation <b>maintenance</b> <b>centers</b> which are the primary logistics and <b>maintenance</b> <b>centers</b> for aviation industry.

25|$|The Turkish Air Force retired {{all of its}} Fw 190A-3 fleet {{at the end of}} 1947 {{mostly because}} of lack of spare parts.

25|$|The Kolsås Line was {{connected}} with the Lambertseter Line east of the city center from 19 November 1995, taking line number 4 and with operations running through the city center. Operations from Kolsås to Bergkrystallen required ten T1300 trains. Oslo Sporveier decided that it wanted to remove the rush-hour services and instead introduced three-car trains. Because of this, all station platforms were extended in 1997, with the schedule changes taking effect from 7 April. The Kolsås Line {{was connected}} to the Østensjø Line and given number 3 from 5 April 1998.

25|$|On 19 May 2010, Norfolk Naval Shipyard {{completed}} the six-month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) maintenance cycle on Reagan. This PIA project came in under budget, and it marked both Norfolk Naval Shipyard's largest off-site availability, {{as well as}} the largest public-sector work package ever performed on an aircraft carrier berthed at Naval Air Station North Island located near Coronado, California (pictured). During the maintenance period, Ronald Reagan received technological upgrades that prepared it for its next deployment and subsequent operations. Refurbishments included high-tech combat systems and firefighting equipment to improved ship's laundry services and living spaces. This PIA maintenance project was an example of the 'One Shipyard' concept wherein the U.S. Navy mobilizes its work force across its various shipyards to better meet fleet readiness requirements and to stabilize a vital workforce base for the U.S. defense industry. While Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) was the project lead, significant work was done by its partners: Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS), Southwest Regional <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Center</b> (SRMC), and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB).|$|E
