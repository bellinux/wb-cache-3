40|$|In the Swedish {{nuclear power}} plants a {{structural}} verificatio of the pipe systems is a necessity {{to ensure that the}} pipes are strong enough to withstand the forces which can result from a sudden event. One example of a component which generates forces in the systems while operating is the safety relief valve. Safety relief valves are used in order to prevent overpressure in a process system by releasing a volume of fluid from the process when a predetermined maximum pressure is reached. In order to analyze the forces from water and steam in the pipe systems the software RELAP 5, which performs calculations in one dimension, is commonly used within nuclear engineering. The valve model which is currently used when simulating a safety relief valve in RELAP 5 is the <b>motor</b> <b>valve</b> model. However, the usage of this model with present settings results in forces higher than in reality in the pipe systems. The purpose of this project was to investigate how a safety relief valve can be modeled with CFD and to find interesting parameter relations to be implemented in RELAP 5 in order to obtain more realistic results of generated forces in the pipe systems. The aim was to modify the currently used <b>motor</b> <b>valve</b> model and to develop a servo valve model which is a more exible model to use in RELAP 5. The purpose of this project was also to investigate if a CFD simulation in 2 D of the valve gives similar results as a 3 D simulation. The investigated valve in this project was a proportional valve. It starts to open at a set pressure of 31 bar(g) and is completely opened at 10 % overpressure, i. e. 34. 1 bar(g), where the maximum lift of 8. 5 mm is reached. The movement of the spindle is determined by the different forces acting on it. In this project the hydraulic forces, the spring force and the gravity force were considered. The CFD simulations were performed in ANSYS FLUENT v. 13. Dynamic layering was used in order to change the mesh during the opening process of the valve. The 2 D and 3 D geometries were created and meshed in ANSA v. 13. 2. 1. Axisymmetry was used as a boundary condition in the 2 D model, and in the 3 D model mirror symmetry was used. The used turbulence model was SST k !. A sensitivity analysis was performed in order to investigate if and to which extent different mesh densities, turbulence models and time step sizes in fluence the results of the CFD simulations. A verification of the 3 D geometry and force calculations was performed, with the conclusion that they seem to be consistent with reality. The transient 2 D and 3 D simulations were conducted with both an instant and a gradual increase of inlet pressure. Differences could be observed between the 2 D and 3 D simulations but similarities were also evident. The simulations performed with a gradual increase of inlet pressure were verified with experimental data. Interesting relations were found such as that the total hydraulic force acting on the spindle is a function of different pressures in the valve and the mass flow through the valve. In the currently used <b>motor</b> <b>valve</b> model in RELAP 5 an opening time of 1 ms, an instant increase of inlet pressure and the abrupt area change model are used. This model was modified by using an opening time of 41 ms which was a result from the 3 D CFD simulation. This modification resulted in lower forces generated in the pipe right after the valve. The generated forces also reached more realistic magnitudes than the forces generated from the currently used model. A servo valve model was developed in RELAP 5 by specifying all necessary relations, needed for the valve to function, in control variables. One relation from the CFD simulations, describing the total hydraulic force acting on the spindle, was implemented successfully. The usage of the abrupt area change model in combination with short pipes resulted in a stable system and realistic forces. The trends in the opening process were fairly consistent with reality when the inlet pressure was gradually increased. Both the motor and the servo valve model were also modified by using the smooth area change model including the implementation of a Cv table. This modification did not decrease the magnitude of the forces and instabilities were observed in the system. The opening process of the valve, simulated both with CFD and in RELAP 5, is faster than the opening process observed in experimental data. This concludes that the models are conservative, which is a requirement within the nuclear industry...|$|E

40|$|The water {{distribution}} regulation system of Fukuoka City {{is a system}} in which motor valves are operated by remote control while pressure gauges and flow meters attached to distribution pipes are monitored. One of the main objectives of this system is to regulate pressure in all the network nodes between lower and upper target values. With the ever-increasing complexity of the city-wide distribution pipe network, <b>motor</b> <b>valve</b> operations to regulate pressure and flow came to depend more and more on the experience and skills of operators. For this reason, an improvement of valve operations support should be done based on valve operation planning for flow and pressure regulation and the operation knowledge database which is constructed on the basis of past experience in order to prevent the events of pressure regulation falls outside the required target pressure range and also to reduce the effort of operators. Therefore in this study and with the assistance of three years of telemetry data, an analysis of the existing valve operation of a certain block within the city district is performed using both correlation analysis and an unsupervised class of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) named Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Results show that correlation analysis has successfully classified the operation types of different valves attached to the studied network into three categories while SOM is an efficient tool in clustering the different complicated operational patterns of valves, visualizing the huge amount of telemetry valves data, detecting the patterns which need future improvement and could present good alternative solutions for improving future valve operational support...|$|E
40|$|The {{timing of}} the valves of a {{hydraulic}} motor {{plays an important role}} in determining the throttling energy. To reduce this dominating energy loss, the {{timing of the}} valves must allow the fluid in the chamber to be precompressed and decompressed such that there is minimal pressure differential across the transitioning valve. The optimal valve timing to achieve precompression and decompression is a function of the motor displacement, angular velocity, pressure, and air content of the fluid, thus to achieve high efficiency at all conditions, active valve timing is required. The valves in most hydraulic motor architectures are mechanically timed to the piston displacement, rendering it impossible to change the valve timing as a function of operating conditions. This paper presents one novel valve architecture that allows for such processes: a rotary valve that is controlled independently of the piston displacement, enabling active timing control. To validate the concept and test the <b>motor</b> <b>valve</b> at fixed timing and fixed displacement conditions, a prototype valve was installed on a single cylinder 3. 5 cc/rev slider-crank piston motor. The nominal timing of the valve was optimized for operation for a pressure of 7 MPa, 2 % entrained air by volume, and an angular velocity between 10 and 30 Hz. A model, including the pressure dynamics, leakage, compressibility, check valve dynamics, and geometry dependent parameters is developed, simulated, and compared to the experiment. The experimental system includes instrumentation for measuring the inlet and outlet flow rates, piston position, and pressure in the inlet, outlet, and cylinder. A comparison between the model and experimental data shows good agreement and demonstrate the large impact of valve timing on efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Thesis supervisor: Dr. Naz Islam. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Centrifugal {{pumps are}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most common types of pumps in industry today. They are widely-used because their design is simple, they are available in wide range of capacity and head, they have high efficiency and smooth flowrate, and they are easy to operate and maintained. There are many factors that contribute to the efficiency and life time of centrifugal pumps. In this thesis, a control method has been implemented practically to keep the centrifugal pump working on Best Efficiency Point (BEP). This control governors two parameters: speed of the <b>motor,</b> <b>valve</b> angle of Control Valve (CV) that effect the response of the system. Two control systems have been devised in this work: the two-single control and dual control ones. The two-single control system has two systems that work in an alternative manner: the speed control and valve angle control systems. We test three kinds of controllers and compare among them to obtain the best performance, they are PID, predictive neural network and NARMA-L 2 neural network controller. The speed and valve angle systems are designed based on the experimental data through finding the Transfer Functions (TF). Consequently, we use theses TFs to model the relationship between input and output of the two systems. The inputs to the proposed systems are the speed of the motor and valve angle of CV, respectively while the output is fluid flow. After completing the design of the systems, we use the flow rate as reference inputs. On the other hand, the dual control system controls simultaneously the speed of the motor and valve angle and use neuro-fuzzy controller. We train the neuro-fuzzy controller using the experimental data to achieve the BEP. From the obtained results, the NARMA-L 2 NN has proved to be the best controller among the three suggested controllers for the single system. The NARMA-L 2 NN has provided considerable reduction of settling time, overshoot and error steady state. For the dual controller, Neuro-Fuzzy shows good performance for centrifugal pump syIncludes bibliographical references (pages 64 - 69) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{capability}} to vent in zero gravity without resettling {{is a fundamental}} technology need that involves practically all uses of subcritical cryogenics in space. Venting without resettling would extend cryogenic orbital transfer vehicle capabilities. However, the lack of definition regarding liquid/ullage orientation coupled with the somewhat random nature of the thermal stratification and resulting pressure rise rates, lead to significant technical challenges. Typically a zero gravity vent concept, termed a thermodynamic vent system (TVS), consists of a tank mixer to destratify the propellant, combined with a Joule- Thomson (J-T) valve to extract then-nal energy from the propellant. In a cooperative effort, Marshall Space Flight Center's (MSFC's) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (N 4 HTB) {{was used to test}} a unique "spray bar" TVS system developed by Boeing. A schematic of this system is included in Figure 1. The system consists of a recirculation pump, a parallel flow concentric tube, heat exchanger, and a spray bar positioned close to the longitudinal axis of the tank. In the mixing mode, the recirculation pump withdraws liquid from the tank and sprays it radially into the tank liquid, ullage, and exposed tank surfaces. When energy extraction is required, {{a small portion of the}} recirculated liquid is passed sequentially through the J-T expansion valve, the spray bar heat exchanger element, and is vented overboard. The vented vapor cools the circulated bulk fluid, thereby removing thermal energy and reducing tank pressure. Figure 2 is a plot of ullage pressure (P 4) and liquid vapor pressure (PSAI) versus time. The pump operates alone, cycling on and off, to destratify the tank liquid and ullage until the liquid vapor pressure reaches the lower set point. At that point, the J-T valve begins to cycle on and off with the pump. Thus, for short duration missions, only the mixer may operate, thus minimizing or even eliminating boil-off losses. The primary advantage of the spray bar configuration is that pressure reduction is achieved independent of liquid and vapor location, thereby enhancing the applicability of normal gravity test data to zero gravity conditions. The in-tank components are minimized with the proposed TVS design. Because the recirculation pump is external to the tank, no electrical power penetration of the tank is required for pump or valve operation. This is especially desirable for L 02 tanks since the presence of an electrical ignition source in oxygen represents a critical failure mode. Also, since the critical components (pump, <b>motor,</b> <b>valve,</b> orifice) are external to the tank, system checkout and ground servicing/replacement are easier. For zero-g operation, component replacement external to the tank may be a significant benefit. In addition to satisfying the zero g TVS design objectives, the TVS concept tested offers additional benefits to the integrated subcritical cryogenic storage and launch system...|$|E
