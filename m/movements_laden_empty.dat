40|$|Abstract: The paper dose {{research}} about the optimization of container shipping of sea –carriage {{for meeting the}} goods transport requirement by use of integer programming. Both <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> containers are combined into a system. In particular, the effect of special laden container shipping capacity on the shipping plan is investigated. In the model, the objective function is to maximize the total profit of container shipping. The profit caused by laden container shipping minus the cost caused by both <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> container shipping equal to the total profit. The constraints to the model include meeting the need of both <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> containers, shipping limit to both common and special laden containers, the number of empty container supported. Lingo 9. 0 is used to solve the model and shipping methods in varied parameters are shown by simulation. The aim of the paper {{is to provide a}} reasonable plan of container shipping of sea-carriage, so the container shipping cost of a shipping company can be reduced and the its profit made by container shipping are maximized...|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{design for a}} liner shipping network was addressed. Many practical features in real-world operations, including multiple types of containers, container transshipment operations, empty container repositioning, origin-to-destination transit time constraints, consistent services with the current network, and joint services with other liner shipping companies, were considered. Given a set of candidate ship routes, some of these routes had to be used, {{and the use of}} others was optional. A mixed-integer linear programming model was proposed for the selection of optional ship routes. The solution of this model provided the <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> container flow on the selected ship routes. On the basis of the results of this model, techniques were proposed for refining ship routes by changing existing routes, designing new routes, and removing some routes. A large-scale numerical test based on the global shipping network of a liner shipping company, consisting of 166 ports, was performed...|$|R

The couches beneath their tumbled draperies of richly dyed silk looked bedraggled and forlorn, whilst the stains of wine upon the fine white cloths looked like widening streams of blood.

And in the great vases of priceless murra roses and lilies and white tuberoses, the spoils of costly glasshouses, were slowly drooping in the heavy atmosphere. The whole room, despite its rich hangings and gilded pillars, wore a curious air of desolation and of gloom; mayhap Caius Nepos himself was conscious of this, for as he followed his guests from out the atrium he gave three loud claps with his hands, and a troupe of young girls came in carrying bunches of fresh flowers and some newly filled lamps.|$|R

The structure of such systems includes automatic loading and unloading devices for the transport containers and automatic switch throwers for directional changing the routes of <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> transport containers. All these devices belong to the class of robotic mechanisms, automatic control of which is usually provided by the microprocessor control system. The implementation of optimal control of such devices in the microprocessor control system is performed by consistent receiving the information signals, based on which and taking into account the previous state, the control system generates the control commands.

40|$|Empty {{container}} repositioning (ECR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important issues in the liner shipping industry. Not only does it have an economic effect on the stakeholders in the container transport chain, but it also has an environmental and sustainability impact on the society since the reduction of empty container movements will reduce fuel consumption, and reduce congestion and emissions. This chapter first analyzes the main reasons that cause empty container repositioning. Secondly, we provide a literature review with the emphasis on modeling the ECR problem from the network scope, e. g. modeling ECR in seaborne transportation network, modeling ECR in inland or intermodal transportation network, and treating ECR as a sub-problem or a constraint under other decision-making problems. Thirdly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the logistics channel scope perspective, which are categorized into four groups including organizational solutions, intra-channel solutions, inter-channel solutions, and technological innovations. Fourthly, we discuss the solutions to the ECR problems from the modelling technique perspective, which includes two broad research streams: network flow models and inventory control-based models. We then present two specific models representing the above two research streams, which aim to tackle the ECR problems in stochastic dynamic environments considering both <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> container management...|$|R

The threat to the United States, Scheuer has consistently maintained, continues to grow, and the U.S. continually fails to grasp the nature of the struggle in which it is engaged: Islamist and anti-American sentiment continue to grow around the world, and the bin <b>Laden</b> <b>movement</b> is aimed, not at killing or conquering Americans or reforming their internal political systems, but rather bankrupting them in order to reduce their worldwide influence and thereby liberate Muslims from the yoke of American political, military, and financial influence. The failure of the U.S. to apprehend this threat is, in part, rooted in a misunderstanding and underestimation of Osama bin Laden himself. To Scheuer, Osama bin Laden's [...] "beliefs, goals, and intentions" [...] are ...|$|R
40|$|In this concise and {{fascinating}} book, Fawaz A. Gerges argues that Al-Qaeda has degenerated into a fractured, marginal body kept alive {{largely by the}} self-serving anti-terrorist bureaucracy it helped to spawn. In The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda, Gerges, a leading authority on Islamic extremism, argues that the West has become mired in a "terrorism narrative," stemming from the mistaken belief that America {{is in danger of}} a devastating attack by a crippled Al-Qaeda. To explain why Al-Qaeda is no longer a threat, he provides a briskly written history of the organization, showing its emergence from the disintegrating local jihadist movements of the mid- 1990 s [...] not the Afghan resistance of the 1980 s, as many believe [...] in "a desperate effort to rescue a sinking ship by altering its course. " During this period, Gerges interviewed many jihadis, gaining a first-hand view of the <b>movement</b> that Bin <b>Laden</b> tried to reshape by internationalizing it. He reveals that global jihad has attracted but a small minority within the Arab world and possesses no viable social and popular base. Furthermore, he shows that the attacks of September 11, 2001, were a major miscalculation [...] no "river" of fighters flooded from Arab countries to defend Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, as Bin Laden expected. Gerges concludes that the movement has splintered into feuding factions, neutralizing itself more effectively than a Predator drone. Forceful, incisive, and written with extensive inside knowledge, this book will alter the debate on global terrorism...|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, {{the rapid}} {{development}} of international economy {{has led to}} significant inter-regional trade imbalances. In marine transportation, the voluminous empty containers accumulated at ports in import dominated countries have to be re-circulated back to ports in export dominated countries for re-deployment. This repositioning of empty containers is crucial for shipping companies to provide effective transportation services. At present, empty container repositioning {{has proved to be}} highly expensive, contributing to 27 % of the overall operation cost of shipping companies. Consequently, major stakeholders including the shipping companies have strived to reduce the repositioning cost. Unfortunately, few major improvements have been made over the years and there are still lingering research issues. The objective of this research, therefore, is to develop efficient and effective methodologies to obtain empty container repositioning plans that can significantly reduce transportation cost while fulfilling customer demands of <b>empty</b> and <b>laden</b> containers. In this research, the empty container repositioning problem under two related real marine transportation scenarios has been studied. The first scenario considers multi-vessel transportation for both <b>laden</b> and <b>empty</b> containers with split vessel routing (denoted as ECRSVR). A mathematical model of ECRSVR is developed based on the formulation of the Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time Windows (PDPTW). However, a major research issue arises due to such integrated consideration of split vessel routing and transportation of <b>empty</b> and <b>laden</b> containers. The resulting model will encompass many more new decision variables and constraints. Thus, it cannot be readily solved by existing algorithms. To address this issue, a new Branch-and-Price (B&P) algorithm incorporating B&B and column generation is developed. Specifically, a new dynamic programming algorithm with new label structure and dominance rules is established to solve the pricing problem in B&P, and a new multi-layer branching scheme is developed for implementing the algorithm. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology are then tested on a set of randomly generated problems. The second scenario extends the first by including transshipment activities in the ECRSVR (denoted as ECRSVRTS). Apparently, the inclusion of transshipment activities will significantly increase the size of the solution space of feasible routing and distribution schemes. Also, more constraints have {{to be included in the}} model to account for the interdependence between the distribution schemes of separate vessels. To tackle this problem, two mathematical models are developed. The first is a port-based model that explicitly characterizes the routing plans and distribution volumes for each vessel at each time interval as decision variables. The resulting integer program is non-linear and difficult to solve. Therefore, an equivalent event-driven node-based model inspired by the formulation of PDPTW is constructed. In this model, the pickup/delivery tasks and transshipment events are represented as nodes in a generated topology. The B&P scheme is then modified to solve the node-based model and a Hybrid Scatter Tabu Search (HSTS) is developed to solve the pricing problems. Results obtained from the numerical experiments using randomly generated test problems show that the proposed HSTS algorithm outperforms conventional scatter search and tabu search algorithms. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
