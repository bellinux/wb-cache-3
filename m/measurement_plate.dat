40|$|Novel {{pressure}} sensors {{characterized by a}} hybrid setup of both plastic and glass have been presented. Concepts {{have been developed for}} the fabrication of {{pressure sensors}} using the low-cost AMANDA process. These concepts have then been evaluated on the basis of specifications made by industry. This has resulted in a new product concept with the pressure sensor mainly consisting of two molded housing parts, a carrier membrane, and a circular <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> made of glass. Mechanical stresses or strains occurring in the housing are not transferred to the sensitive part of the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate,</b> as the latter is connected to the housing via a thin, slack carrier membrane. In case of a pressure gradient prevailing in the housing, the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> rests against the one or the other side, while its bearing at the edge remains the same. One housing shell is designed as a hollow sphere. Here, a circular plate always contacts along its edges irrespective of positional deviations. On the other side, the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> is always borne by a polyimide ring fixed {{to the bottom of the}} housing. This even holds in case of positional deviations. On its surface, the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> is equipped with strain gauges that measure the strain of the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> under a pressure load. To specify the layout of the strain gauges, the stress and strain behavior on the calculated free <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> was described by mathematical equations. Furthermore, equations were derived for the variation of strain gauge resistance on the plate. These equations were entered into a computer program, by means of which the characteristics could be simulated as a function of strain gauge layout. 12 pressure sensors were manufactured in parallel with each pressure sensor containing a <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> of 2084 #mu#m in diameter, which was etched from 50 #mu#m thick glass substrates. This diameter ensures a linear relationship between central deflection and pressure difference in case of the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> being subjected to pressure differences of #+-# 1000 hPa.

40|$|A {{selective}} {{combination of}} the principles of a thermal mass flow meter and constant temperature anemometry was used to develop a solid mass flow meter that improves significantly on the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). The flow meter has a <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> that is kept at a constant temperature. Due to conductive heat transfer between the entrained solids and the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate,</b> additional power is needed to maintain the plate at this setpoint temperature value. This additional power was correlated against the average solids flow rate. The calibration curve shows a linear relationship between the power measurement and the entrainment flux for entrainment fluxes between 3. 4 x 10 - 4 kg/(m 2. s) and 7. 5 x 10 - 3 kg/(m 2. s). Deviation from a linear response at lower entrainment fluxes may be caused by a longer residence time of fine particles on the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> due to lower shear forces. At higher entrainment fluxes the power measurements were unreliable due to poor temperature control. The turndown ratio of the linear section of the calibration curve is approximately 3 times that of the linear part of the calibration curve of the flow meter developed by De Vos et al (2010). Even further improvement is possible with better temperature control. In a case study to test the applicability of the flow meter to measure changes in entrainment rate associated with hydrodynamic properties other than a change in gas superficial velocity, small amounts of ethanol were dosed to the inlet air. The continuously measured entrainment rate increased at lower ethanol dosing rates but decreased as the dosing rate of ethanol was increased. The increase in entrainment rate may be explained by a reduction in static electricity in the bed, while the decrease at higher dosing rates may be as a result of increased powder cohesivity.

In the {{measurement system}}, the ridges of the flow-field are made of gold-plated stainless steel {{and the rest of}} the <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> is made of a non-conducting material.

The effect of the cell temperature on the current distribution is studied with the measurement system. It appears that the measurement system is useful for PEMFC characterization and even large spatial variations of current density can be measured with it. According to the results, the optimum operating temperature for the studied cell is around 60 8 C without external humidification. In addition, it is concluded that the molecular diffusion is dominating mass transport mechanism at low temperatures but the current density profile is mor...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} a non-destructive measurement method of various permittivity in the multi-medium. To establish this method, {{we have used}} a measurement method of a long distance small parallel-plate air capacitor with an additional electrode called 2 ̆ 2 dummy 2 ̆ 2 in which an electric potential is fixed equal to one of the respective <b>measurement</b> <b>plates.</b> It has been found experimentally that the capacitance of the long capacitor is influenced by the location of its shielding and the dummy electrodes. However, this phenomenon has not been studied theoretically yet. In this paper we will discuss about the effects of the dummy electrodes and the shielding of the permittivity measuring capacitive-device by calculating capacitance and drawing the electric lines of force using the scalar potentials with 2 D Finite Element Method(FEM).

30|$|Active cycling {{can improve}} integration, {{physical}} activity, and mobility {{of people with}} cerebral palsy. However, one should {{take into account that}} problems of perception and space orientation deficits lead to rarely use of bicycles in traffic. Therefore, one comes to the idea of extending the cycling therapy by an option that can compensate the decreased sense of orientation in space and even train the spatial perception. Our suggestion is to equip an E-bike with ultrasonic sensors that can measure distances to objects and give acoustic feedback if the distance becomes less than a defined threshold. Such a system will provide a patient with helpful information on his position with respect to environments and will make cycling more safety. Additionally, the force generated by the legs and the cadence during cycling can be evaluated by using a force <b>measurement</b> <b>plate,</b> which is integrated in the pedal. This will enable tuning the electric motor power to optimize the individual training load. Furthermore, it is useful to integrate a blinker to make the wish of changing the direction visible.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study is to obtain the {{performance}} on a larger area (45 cm 2) equivalent to that obtained on a smaller area (4 cm 2) single cell DMFC overcoming performance losses associated with scale-up of single cell DMFCs due to uneven clamping pressure distribution on MEA through the end-plates and non-uniform distribution of reactants to MEA. The current distribution profile along the cathode flow field channel is measured using a segmented current <b>measurement</b> <b>plate</b> to understand the influence of uneven clamping pressure distribution on the MEA. Uniform current distribution in a single cell DMFC with 45 cm 2 electrode area is achieved using angular ribbed end-plates. Also, in the present study performance of conventional DMFC is compared with that of mixed-reactant (MR), i. e. methanol and air. Performance of DMFC operating on mixed reactant (MeOH + air) at anode and air at cathode is superior compared with DMFC operating on aqueous methanol at anode and air at cathode. A power density of 55 mW cm− 2 at 0. 3 V is obtained for a DMFC single cell with an effective area of 45 cm 2 using angular ribbed end-plates and MR at anode and air at cathode under ambient conditions.

40|$|Agricultural soils {{have been}} {{increasingly}} subject to heavy metal pollution worldwide. However, the impacts on soil microbial community structure and activity of field soils have been not yet well characterized. Topsoil {{samples were collected}} from heavy metal polluted (PS) and their background (BGS) fields of rice paddies in four sites across South China in 2009. Changes with metal pollution relative to the BGS in the size and community structure of soil microorganisms were examined with multiple microbiological assays of biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) <b>measurement,</b> <b>plate</b> counting of culturable colonies and phospholipids fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis along with {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) profile of 16 S rRNA and 18 S rRNA gene and real-time PCR assay. In addition, a 7 -day lab incubation under constantly 25 °C was conducted to further track the changes in metabolic activity. While the decrease under metal pollution in MBC and MBN, as well as in culturable population size, total PLFA contents and DGGE band numbers of bacteria were not significantly and consistently seen, a significant reduction was indeed observed under metal pollution in microbial quotient, in culturable fungal population size and in ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFAs consistently across the sites by an extent ranging from 6 % to 74 %. Moreover, a consistently significant increase in metabolic quotient was observed by up to 68 % under pollution across the sites. These observations supported a shift of microbial community with decline in its abundance, decrease in fungal proportion and thus in C utilization efficiency under pollution in the soils. In addition, ratios of microbial quotient, of fungal to bacterial and qCO 2 are proved better indicative of heavy metal impacts on microbial community structure and activity. The potential effects of these changes on C cycling and CO 2 production in the polluted rice paddies deserve further field studies...|$|E

Patients and methods: Using clinical isolates from patients with ocular infections, drug susceptibility testing using the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute standards was routinely conducted at five facilities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the isolated strains were determined using SG 17 at the Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University. The records of antimicrobial drugs used and the therapeutic course were evaluated for all cases. The susceptibility results from SG 17 and routine methods used at each facility were compared. Results: A total of 112 bacterial strains were isolated from 92 patients. Of these cases, keratitis was the most common (52. 2 %), followed by conjunctivitis (21. 7 %) and others (26. 1 %). Principal signs and symptoms resolved in all patients, indicating that therapeutic effects had been achieved. With SG 17, drug susceptibility was determined in 98. 9 % of isolates compared with 30. 4 % of isolates determined using conventional methods. By adapting the Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute standards to SG 17 results, we found that 91. 3 % of patients were susceptible and 7. 6 % were resistant. In five patients, drugs with a resistant evaluation were initially administered with no effect, and the patients were then switched to drugs with a susceptible evaluation with final resolution, indicating agreement of clinical results with SG 17. Conclusion: SG 17 can be used to determine drug susceptibility to antimicrobial agents currently used in ophthalmic practice. SG 17 is useful for selecting antimicrobial drugs.

40|$|International audienceIn biomechanics, {{calibration}} of body segment inertial parameters (BSIP) {{is crucial}} {{to take into account}} subject morphological specificities. To avoid strenuous protocols, identification methods based on rigid body dynamics laws have been proposed. Thanks to a motion capture system and force platforms, these methods optimize BSIP by minimizing errors in the equations of motion. These errors can be defined as the dynamic resid-uals reflecting inaccuracies arising from estimated BSIP, as well as from kinematics and force <b>plate</b> <b>measurements.</b> The current study aims at evaluating the part of uncertainty on the dynamic residuals directly related to kinematics and force <b>plate</b> <b>measurements.</b> To answer this question, we captured the movements of 10 participants performing a standardized motion. We then applied a Monte Carlo-based approach to introduce variations in the kinematics and force <b>plate</b> <b>measurements,</b> and evaluated the reconstructed difference on the dynamic residuals. Results show that, first, the BSIP evaluation using a regression method seemed to be an acceptable estimate for the studied subjects. Second, the part of uncertainty in the dynamic residuals was significantly higher than the dynamic resid-uals obtained. In conclusion, a subject-specific calibration of the BSIP based on dynamic residuals, for this model and protocol, seems irrelevant and prone to overfitting of BSIP...|$|R
