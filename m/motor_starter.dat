2500|$|In {{a typical}} hard wired motor {{start and stop}} circuit (called a control circuit) a motor is started by pushing a [...] "Start" [...] or [...] "Run" [...] button that {{activates}} a pair of electrical relays. The [...] "lock-in" [...] relay locks in contacts that keep the control circuit energized when the push button is released. (The start button is a normally open contact and the stop button is normally closed contact.) Another relay energizes a switch that powers the device that throws the <b>motor</b> <b>starter</b> switch (three sets of contacts for three phase industrial power) in the main power circuit. Large motors use high voltage and experience high in-rush current, making speed important in making and breaking contact. This can be dangerous for personnel and property with manual switches. The [...] "lock in" [...] contacts in the start circuit and the main power contacts for the motor are held engaged by their respective electromagnets until a [...] "stop" [...] or [...] "off" [...] button is pressed, which de-energizes the lock in relay.|$|E
2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special <b>motor</b> <b>starter</b> for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors.|$|E

The <b>starter</b> <b>motors</b> are serial wound dc motors which enable the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to run. When the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> fault occurs, the ICE cannot be run. Therefore, condition monitoring and pre-diagnosis of <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> faults are important.

With normal operation a step-up autotransformer would have flux linkages at the supply frequency; {{in the case of a}} very fast dv/dt at the instant of contact separation, the voltage induced into the redundant windings of the first starting stage, will be extremely large.

50|$|A small motor can {{be started}} by simply {{plugging}} {{it into an}} electrical receptacle or by using a switch or circuit breaker. A larger motor requires a specialized switching unit called a motorstarter or motor contactor.

Reduced-voltage, star-delta or soft starters connect the motor to the power supply through a voltage reduction device and increases the applied voltage gradually or in steps. In smaller sizes a <b>motor</b> <b>starter</b> is a manually operated switch; larger motors, or those requiring remote or automatic control, use magnetic contactors. Very large motors running on medium voltage power supplies (thousands of volts) may use power circuit breakers as switching elements.|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical and Computer EngineeringAnil PahwaWarren N. WhiteThis thesis {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} the power loss from power panelboards {{by means of}} power loss models. The model {{is intended to be}} used by HVAC engineers to help estimate building heat loss. While McDonald & Hickok (1985) did not report power losses for power panelboards, Rubin (1979) did. These publications present the power losses of electrical devices at rated loads in tables. In this thesis, the models for electrical devices are created and used, instead of tables, to estimate power losses. The use of curve fit models presents a convenience in calculation of power losses. Breaker, fusible switch, and <b>motor</b> <b>starter</b> power losses presented by McDonald & Hickok (1985) and Rubin (1979) were updated using manufacturer published data, technical papers, industrial standards, and test samples. Test, manufacturer, and analytical model data are collected and power loss curve fit models are created for breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures. The panelboard power loss is calculated as the sum of partial power losses of the component electrical equipment, i. e. breakers, fusible switches, motor starters, and bus bars with enclosures used in power panelboards. A power loss model for main breaker and fusible switch power panelboards are created based on the sum of breaker, fusible switch, <b>motor</b> <b>starter,</b> and bus bars with enclosure power loss models. The main breaker and fusible switch power panelboard power loss models are used in a heat loss example. It is shown that power panelboard power losses can be significantly overestimated when calculated with one of the methods currently used (Rubin, 1979). This can result in erroneous sizing of HVAC equipment...|$|E
50|$|The huffer {{works by}} blowing {{compressed}} air via flexible hose to the aircraft's bleed air system.

The <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the compressor and the combustion chamber to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized kerosene starts flowing and an igniter similar to a spark plug ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.|$|R

40|$|<b>Starter</b> <b>motors</b> are {{sensitive}} for overheating. By estimating {{the temperature and}} preventing cranking in time, there is an option to avoid the dangerous temperatures. The truck manufacturer Scania CV AB proposed a master thesis that should evaluate the need of an overheating protection for the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The aim is to evaluate any positive effects of implementing an algorithm that can estimate the brush temperature instead of using the available time constrain, which allows 35 seconds of cranking with a following 2 seconds delay, allowing the crank shaft to stop before a new start attempt is allowed. To achieve high load on the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> and high temperature in the brushes, tests were performed under − 20 o Celsius. Initial testing on truck, under normal temperatures, showed that the batteries could not run the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> long enough to reach high temperatures in the brushes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the voltage drop between the batteries and the <b>starter</b> <b>motor,</b> causing the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> to run in an operating area it is not optimized for. There are several other problems which gives a higher load on the engine, for example oil viscosity, resulting in higher currents, but those are not mentioned in this report. Three different models are compared, Two State Model, Single State Model and a Time Constrained Model. Tests and verifications show that the Two State Model is superior when it comes to protecting the <b>starter</b> <b>motor</b> from overheating {{and at the same time}} maximizing the cranking time. The major difference between the Two State Model and the Single State Model are the cooling characteristics. In the Single State Model the brush temperature drops quickly to the outside temperature while in the Two State Model the brush temperature drops to a second state  temperature instead of the outside temperature. With the currently implemented time constrain it is possible to overheat the <b>starter</b> <b>motor.</b> The algorithms are optimized under cold conditions, due to problems in reaching high temperatures under warmer conditions...|$|R
