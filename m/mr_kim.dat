Kim Jong-nam, Kim Jong-il's eldest son, fell out of favor when caught in a plot to visit Tokyo Disneyland in 2001.

On 14 February 2017, South Korean media reported that Kim Jong-nam was assassinated with the deadly chemical weapon VX at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia by two unidentified women, suspected to be North Korean agents. It is still not clear how the lethal dose was delivered. Some reports suggest needles, others a spray, or a cloth held to Kim’s face. Kim Jong Nam was survived by his wife and two children. His son, Kim Han Sol, has also criticized the regime.
