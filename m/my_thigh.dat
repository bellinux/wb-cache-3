25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
2500|$|In The Iliad Homer [...] names two doctors, “the {{two sons}} of Asklepios, the admirable {{physicians}} Podaleirius and Machaon and one acting doctor, Patroclus. Because Machaon is wounded and Podaleirius is in combat Eurypylus asks Patroclus “to cut out this arrow from <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> wash off the blood {{with warm water}} and spread soothing ointment on the wound." ...|$|E
60|$|I shook so {{with passion}} that my sabre clattered against <b>my</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There was no mistake, doctor; {{there were}} the black marks on <b>my</b> <b>thighs,</b> but I think I have pretty well sweated it out of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires, [...] I {{turn the}} bridegroom {{out of bed}} and stay with the bride myself, [...] I tighten her all night to <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> and lips.|$|R
60|$|Ah, {{it was so}} fine to have a horse between <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> and {{a weapon}} in my grip. I waved it above my head and shouted in my exultation. The chief had come forward with that odious smiling face of his.|$|R
60|$|As he came I grasped {{his left}} wrist {{with my left}} hand, and, {{swinging}} my right arm about his left shoulder, caught him beneath the chin with my elbow and bore him backward across <b>my</b> <b>thigh.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so," [...] said Cetewayo sullenly, [...] "yet {{it was no}} spirit iron {{that cut}} <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> but what do I know of the ways of Spirits? Wizard, I would speak with you in your hut alone where no ear can hear us." ...|$|E
60|$|Again he came at me, {{almost before}} I was {{prepared}} for him, and his point, parried with a downward stroke and narrowly averted, scratched <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> but did more damage to my breeches than my skin, in exchange I touched him playfully on the shoulder, and the sting of it drove him back a second time. He was breathing hard by then, and would fain have paused awhile for breath, but I {{saw no reason to}} be merciful.|$|E
60|$|Nay, thou knowest that I am not apt at the chase. Also it irks me to squat on {{a branch}} all day above a path, bearing a rock upon <b>my</b> <b>thighs.</b> Those words did but awaken within me when I was peaceless in the night.|$|R
50|$|When his two-hour set ended I {{could only}} think, can anyone really be this good; can anyone say this much to me, can rock'n'roll still speak {{with this kind}} of power and glory? And then I felt the sores on <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> where I had been {{pounding}} my hands in time for the entire concert and knew that the answer was yes.|$|R
60|$|We halted once more, {{a quarter}} of a mile away. Clark himself had picked {{fourteen}} men to go under Lieutenant Bayley through the town and take the fort from the other side. Here was audacity with a vengeance. You may be sure that Tom and Cowan and Ray were among these, and I trotted after them with the drum banging against <b>my</b> <b>thighs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mort de ma vie!" [...] I cried, {{slapping}} <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> [...] "I understand!" [...] And {{to myself}} I {{thought of the}} assignation at St. Sulpice des Reaux, {{and the reason for}} this, as also St. Auban's resolution to so suddenly quit Blois, grew of a sudden clear to me. Also did I recall the riddle touching Vilmorin's conduct which a few moments ago I had puzzled over, and of which methought that I now held the solution.|$|E
60|$|Not until I {{was safe}} from them did I turn my {{attention}} to that live agony on <b>my</b> <b>thigh.</b> And then, a dozen feet above the snapping pack that leaped and scrambled {{against the wall and}} fell back, I got the dog by the throat and slowly throttled him. I was a long time doing it. He clawed and ripped my hair and hide with his hind-paws, and ever he jerked and lunged with his weight to drag me from the wall.|$|E
60|$|Knife in hand, I descended my {{staircase}} and edging {{as far as}} possible from the baleful globes greenly burning beneath a mahogany chair, I threw open both doors and besought my unwelcome visitor to take his departure. The night wind came fluttering; there was the blur of a scuttering, shapeless form, and in the flash of an eye I was sprawling on the floor. A good deal shaken, with a nasty scratch on <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> but otherwise unharmed, I waved my hand after the fugitive and returned to bed.|$|E
30|$|The boys {{indicated}} specific {{concern over}} showing their legs and stomachs. When discussing athletic clothes with Nicholas, {{he said he}} felt uncomfortable unless his knees were covered. This was true for other boys, too. Gus wanted his shorts to cover his knees and when asked why he stated, “cause it sort of exposes <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> you know. I don’t like that”. When talking about his gym shorts, Nicholas stated, “I would want to make sure they cover my knees”.|$|R
5000|$|Liu Bei {{stayed in}} Jing Province for about seven years. During {{a meeting with}} Liu Biao, Liu Bei started weeping and the {{surprised}} Liu Biao asked why. Liu Bei answered [...] "In earlier times, I've never left the saddle. <b>My</b> <b>thighs</b> were thin. Now I do not ride anymore, they are fat and flabby. The days and months pass like a stream, and old age will come, but I have achieved nothing. That's why I am sad. In 202, Cao Cao sent Yu Jin and Xiahou Dun to attack Liu Bei. Liu Bei ambushed and defeated them at the Battle of Bowang.|$|R
5000|$|On 9 October 1773, {{he reached}} St. Petersburg, met Catherine {{the next day}} and they had several discussions on various subjects. During his five-month stay at her court, he met her almost every day. During these conversations, he would later state, they spoke 'man to man'. He would {{occasionally}} make his point by slapping her thighs. In a letter to Madame Geoffrin, Catherine wrote: Your Diderot is an extraordinary man. I emerge from interviews with him with <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> bruised and quite black. I have been obliged to put a table between us to protect myself and my members.|$|R
6000|$|... "For a {{very simple}} reason, Benita: because I didn't die. When that Kaffir took the watch from me I was insensible, that's all. The sun brought me to life afterwards. Then some natives turned up, good people in their way, {{although}} I could not understand a word they said. They made a stretcher of boughs and carried me for some miles to their kraal inland. It hurt awfully, for <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> was broken, but I arrived at last. There a Kaffir doctor set my leg in his own fashion; it has left it an inch shorter than the other, but that's better than nothing.|$|E
60|$|Both pistols {{rang out}} their fierce clamor {{at the same}} instant. The chief lost a lock of his hair, and the Colonel's bullet ended its career in the fleshy part of <b>my</b> <b>thigh.</b> The Colonel's left {{shoulder}} was clipped a little. They fired again. Both missed their men this time, but I got my share, {{a shot in the}} arm. At the third fire both gentlemen were wounded slightly, and I had a knuckle chipped. I then said I believed I would go out and take a walk, as this was a private matter, and I had a delicacy about participating in it further. But both gentlemen begged me to keep my seat, and assured me that I was not in the way.|$|E
60|$|For a {{whole week}} things went on thus. During this time I {{recovered}} my strength completely, except in one particular which reduced me to helplessness. The place on <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> where Jana had pinched out {{a bit of the}} skin healed up well enough, but the inflammation struck inwards to the nerve of my left leg, where once I had been injured by a lion, with the result that whenever I tried to move I was tortured by pains of a sciatic nature. So I was obliged to lie still and to content myself with being carried on the bed into a little garden which surrounded the mud-built and white-washed house that had been allotted to us as a dwelling-place.|$|E
6000|$|The mocking {{tongue of}} this jeer was intolerable; the fellow evidently {{considered}} me [...] "done up," [...] so taking a short run I clapped {{my hands to}} <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> and executed as pretty a flip-flap as ever was made without a springboard! At the moment I came erect with my head still spinning, I felt That Jim crowd past me, giving me a twirl that almost sent me off the track. A moment later he had dashed ahead at a tremendous pace, laughing derisively over his shoulder {{as if he had}} done a remarkably clever thing to gain the lead.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{the first}} thing that I did was to {{dismount}} and to lead my mare into a small wood through which a stream ran. There I watered her and rubbed her down, giving her two pieces of sugar soaked in cognac from my flask. She was spent from the sharp chase, but it was wonderful to see how she came round with a half-hour's rest. When <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> closed upon her again, I could tell by the spring and the swing of her {{that it would not be}} her fault if I did not win my way safe to Paris.|$|R
6000|$|By that time, you know, we {{were all}} in a state of tension--largely because of the {{behaviour}} of Wish. We sat all of us with our eyes on Clayton--I, at least, with a sort of tight, stiff feeling about me as though from the back of my skull to the middle of <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> <b>my</b> body had been changed to steel. And there, with a gravity that was imperturbably serene, Clayton bowed and swayed and waved his hands and arms before us. As he drew towards the end one piled up, one tingled in one's teeth. The last gesture, I have said, was to swing the arms out wide open, with the face held up. And when at last he swung out to this closing gesture I ceased even to breathe. It was ridiculous, of course, but you know that ghost-story feeling. It was after dinner, in a queer, old shadowy house. Would he, after all--? ...|$|R
6000|$|As to {{the events}} of the next three days I know only what I have been told, for {{practically}} during all that time I was off my head from loss of blood, complicated with fever brought on by the fearful excitement and exertion I had undergone. All I can recall is a vision of Marie bending over me and making me take food of some sort--milk or soup, I suppose--for it seems I would touch it from no other hand. Also I had visions of the tall shape of my white-haired father, who, like most missionaries, understood something of surgery and medicine, attending to the bandages on <b>my</b> <b>thigh.</b> Afterwards he told me that the spear had actually cut the walls of the big artery, but, by good fortune, without going through them. Another fortieth of an inch and I should have bled to death in ten minutes! ...|$|E
60|$|I went {{again to}} Ceylon {{to look into}} the {{conditions}} of Coolie importation, and then I was going back into Assam once more, still in the wake of indentured labor, when I chanced upon a misadventure. I had my first and only experience of big game shooting in the Garo Hills, I was clawed out of a tree by a wounded panther, he missed his hold and I got back to my branch, but my shoulder was put out, <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> was badly torn, and my blood was poisoned by the wound. I had an evil uncomfortable time. My injury hampered me greatly, and for a while it seemed likely I should be permanently lamed. I had to keep to vehicles and reasonably good roads. I wound up my convalescence with a voyage to Singapore, and from thence I went on rather disconnectedly to a number of exploratory journeys--excursions rather than journeys--into China. I got to Pekin and then suddenly faced back to Europe, returning overland through Russia.|$|E
60|$|The guards saluted {{and were}} dismissed. We mounted to the Prince's private chambers, {{in one of}} which his {{servants}} clad me in fine linen robes after a skilled physician of the household had doctored the bruises upon <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> over which he tied a bandage spread with balm. Then I was led to a small dining-hall, where I found the Prince waiting for me as though I were some honoured guest and not a poor scribe who had wondered hence from Memphis with my wares. He caused me {{to sit down at}} his right hand and even drew up the chair for me himself, whereat I felt abashed. To this day I remember that leather-seated chair. The arms of it ended in ivory sphinxes and on its back of black wood in an oval was inlaid the name of the great Rameses, to whom indeed it had once belonged. Dishes were handed to us--only two of them and those quite simple, for Seti was no great eater--by a young Nubian slave of a very merry face, and with them wine more delicious than any I had ever tasted.|$|E
6000|$|And {{this from}} the fellow who had just told us of his tragical {{encounter}} with Apollyon, a yarn which quite put Bunyan's narrative in the shade! It was useless talking; my irritation gave place to mirth, and, stretching myself out on the grass, I roared with laughter. The more I thought of Lechuza's stern rebuke the louder I laughed, until I yelled with laughter, slapping <b>my</b> <b>thighs</b> and doubling myself up after the manner of Mariano's hilarious visitor from purgatory. My companions never smiled. Rivarola {{came back with the}} bucket of water, and, after staring at me for some time, said, [...] "If the tears, which they say always follow laughter, come in the same measure, then we shall have to sleep in the wet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A roach!" [...] he ho-ho'd. [...] "A shrimp! A sea-louse!" [...] And {{he made to}} squash me between huge {{forefinger}} and thumb, {{either of}} which, Lingaard avers, was thicker than <b>my</b> leg or <b>thigh.</b>|$|R
60|$|But, alas! those skirts were lamentably scanty; and though, {{with its}} quiltings, the jacket was stuffed {{out about the}} breasts like a Christmas turkey, and of a dry cold day kept the wearer warm enough in that vicinity, yet about the loins it was shorter than ballet-dancer's skirts; so that while my chest was in the {{temperate}} zone close adjoining the torrid, <b>my</b> hapless <b>thighs</b> were in Nova Zembla, hardly an icicle's toss from the Pole.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens! how grand he looked, and how awful! High {{into the}} air he flew, {{describing}} a great arch. Just as he touched the highest point of his spring I fired. I did not dare to wait, for I saw that he would clear the whole space and land right upon me. Without a sight, almost without aim, I fired, as one would fire a snap shot at a snipe. The bullet told, for I distinctly heard its thud above the rushing sound caused by {{the passage of the}} lion through the air. Next second I was swept to the ground (luckily I fell into a low, creeper-clad bush, which broke the shock) and the lion was on the top of me, and the next those great white teeth of his had met in my thigh--I heard them grate against the bone. I yelled out in agony, for I did not feel in the least benumbed and happy, like Dr. Livingstone--who, by the way, I knew very well--and gave myself up for dead. But suddenly, as I did so, the lion's grip on <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> loosened, and he stood over me, swaying to and fro, his huge mouth, from which the blood was gushing, wide open. Then he roared, and the sound shook the rocks.|$|E
60|$|But I was in {{a strange}} {{confusion}} when, coming into those entries and passages which the page led me through, I could by no means find my way out. At last seeing a door open that looked through a house into the street, I went in, and out at the other door; but then I was at as great a loss to know where I was, and which {{was the way to}} my lodgings. The wound in <b>my</b> <b>thigh</b> bled apace, and I could feel the blood in my breeches. In this interval came by a chair; I called, and went into it, and bid them, as well as I could, go to the Louvre; for though I knew not the name of the street where I lodged, I knew I could find the way to it when I was at the Bastille. The chairmen went on their own way, and being stopped by a company of the guards as they went, set me down till the soldiers were marched by; when looking out I found I was just at my own lodging, and the captain was standing at the door looking for me. I beckoned him to me, and, whispering, told him I was very much hurt, but bid him pay the chairmen, and ask no questions but come to me.|$|E
6000|$|Walking {{one morning}} before {{the gate of}} the Louvre, with a design to see the Swiss drawn up, which they always did, and {{exercised}} just before they relieved the guards, a page came up to me, and speaking English to me, [...] "Sir," [...] says he, [...] "the captain must needs have your immediate assistance." [...] I, that had not the knowledge of any person in Paris but my own companion, whom I called captain, had no room to question, but it was he that sent for me; and crying out hastily to him, [...] "Where?" [...] followed the fellow as fast as 'twas possible. He led me through several passages which I knew not, and at last through a tennis-court and into a large room, where three men, like gentlemen, were engaged very briskly two against one. The room was very dark, so that I could not easily know them asunder, but being fully possessed with an opinion before of my captain's danger, I ran into the room with my sword in my hand. I had not particularly engaged any of them, nor so much as made a pass at any, when I received a very dangerous thrust in <b>my</b> <b>thigh,</b> rather occasioned by my too hasty running in, than a real design of the person; but enraged at the hurt, without examining who it was hurt me, I threw myself upon him, and run my sword quite through his body.|$|E
60|$|I was conscious, in fact, of a dull {{but very}} {{deep-seated}} pain in <b>my</b> right <b>thigh.</b> I {{tried to move}} it. The agony was intense. It threw me back into my momentary faint again. For {{a minute or two}} I could hardly realize my position. Then it slowly came home to me by gradual stages that I was lying helpless, with a broken leg, unseen and unattended, on the Floor of the Hawaiians, a hundred and twenty feet down the gap of the crater.|$|R
6000|$|As the {{soldiers}} assisted {{me across the}} court the stillness was so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people. There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity; they were as rigid as stone images, and as pale; and dread sat upon every countenance. This hush continued while I was being chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, <b>my</b> knees, <b>my</b> <b>thighs,</b> <b>my</b> body. Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible, and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats without knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and his eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in this attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped. I waited two or three moments; then looked up; he was standing there petrified. With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly up and stared into the sky. I followed their eyes, as sure as guns, there was my eclipse beginning! The life went boiling through my veins; I was a new man! The rim of black spread slowly into the sun's disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless. I knew that this gaze would be turned upon me, next. When it was, I was ready. I {{was in one of}} the most grand attitudes I ever struck, with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun. It was a noble effect. You could see the shudder sweep the mass like a wave. Two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other: ...|$|R
5000|$|She bathes (her) loins for the king. She bathes (her) loins for Iddin-Dagān. Holy Inanna bathes with soap, and {{sprinkles}} {{the floor}} with aromatic resin.

Ama-ušumgal-ana lies down beside her and {caresses her holy thighs} (says:) [...] "O <b>my</b> holy <b>thighs!</b> O <b>my</b> holy Inanna!."
