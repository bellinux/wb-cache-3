2500|$|On {{returning}} to Pakistan in the 1980s, Bhutto's mother organised {{for her to}} marry the businessman Asif Ali Zardari. Many of her friends were surprised that Bhutto acquiesced to an arranged marriage given her liberal attitudes, however she later related that she [...] "felt obligations to <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> religion" [...] {{to go through with}} it and that her high public profile made it difficult for her to find a husband through other means.|$|E

2500|$|I like to {{pray and}} I like to meditate. Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes {{meditation}} twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift my consciousness so that I can be the best version of myself.' ...|$|E
2500|$|After her diagnosis, the {{following}} {{issue of the}} National Enquirer ran the headline: [...] "Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle". [...] Without asking for her comment, the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in It's Always Something: [...] "They found an old photo of me looking frightened from a 'Saturday Night Live' sketch and blew that up to make the point. What they did probably sold newspapers, {{but it had a}} devastating effect on <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> friends. [...] It forced [...] Gene [...] to compose a press release to respond. [...] He said that I had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, had had surgery, and my prognosis was good. [...] The Enquirer doesn't like good news, so the Gilda Radner story stopped running." ...|$|E

2500|$|At a press conference, Hart defiantly stated, [...] "I {{said that}} I bend, but I don't break, and believe me, I'm not broken." [...] Hart {{identified}} the invasive media coverage, and its need to [...] "dissect" [...] him, as his reason for suspending his campaign, [...] "If someone's able {{to throw up}} a smokescreen and keep it up there long enough, you can't get your message across. You can't raise the money to finance a campaign; there's too much static, and you can't communicate....Clearly, under the present circumstances, this campaign cannot go on.

[...] Hart paraphrased Thomas Jefferson and warned, [...] "I tremble for my country when I think we may, in fact, {{get the kind of}} leaders we deserve." [...] Hart later recalled, [...] "I watched journalists become animals, literally." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{was portrayed}} badly on the show, feuding with his fighters and often {{appearing}} uninterested. Shamrock admitted to doing {{a poor job}} with his fighters: [...] "I failed them miserably, completely. So I {{have to figure out}} a way to get this...back in the driver's seat", Shamrock said during the show. Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point. I was the champion and (Masakatsu) Funaki was the number one contender. The rest were all Lion's Den fighters. My reputation doesn’t have to be spoken for or defended. The UFC and Spike TV did what they thought they needed to do for ratings, but in the end, my fans, <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> God know exactly who I am." ...|$|E

[...] Emperor sought closure by stating that neither it nor any of its artists would be making any further statement about the incident. The press conference drew mixed response from the media and the public. An Apple Daily commentary was particularly scathing about the hypocrisy of Chung and of her management company for only obliquely hinting at her [...] "licentiousness". On 14 February, two new nude photographs surfaced [...] one featuring an unidentified woman fellating Chen, and another showed a woman lying on a bed.|$|E

The following day, he released a statement saying: [...] "My driver and I were stopped and held for two hours at Holyhead last Monday, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002.

[...] "I was questioned about lyrics of songs and I was {{asked a lot of}} personal questions about members of <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> children and about my home. At no time was I given any explanation as to why I was being held and interrogated in this manner", he added. He said the fact that Irish people are still being treated this way on their way to Britain is very [...] "saddening". [...] "I had hoped to deal with this matter out of the public domain. But seeing as it has become a news item, I feel the need to offer my side of the story. I found the whole affair quite frightening." ...|$|E

I never looked behind me again, as I now walked on; for I said within myself:--"If he is following me, I must not, and will not avoid him: it will be the best result of my departure, that I shall draw after me that destroying presence; and thus at least remove it far and safely away from <b>my</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> home!" ...|$|E
