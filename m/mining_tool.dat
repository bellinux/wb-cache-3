It uses machine learning, statistical and visualization techniques to discovery and present knowledge in a form which is easily comprehensible to humans. Various popular data <b>mining</b> <b>tools</b> are available today. Data <b>mining</b> <b>tools</b> predict future trends and behaviors, allowing businesses to make proactive, knowledge-driven decisions. Data <b>mining</b> <b>tools</b> can answer business questions that traditionally were too time consuming to resolve. They scour databases for hidden patterns, finding predictive information that experts may miss because it lies outside their expectations.

50|$|Astroneer is a sandbox {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person view. Its open world planets, wherein terraforming can take place, {{are subject to}} procedural generation. The player controls an astronaut who navigates on foot, by lunar rover or spacecraft. Crafting extends to vehicles, spacecraft, modules (smelted into core components) and oxygen reserve tanks. Ice is converted into fuel for the astronaut's spacecraft. When low on oxygen, the astronaut recharges by tethering to poles in the ground; the tethers are extendable if attached in succession (possible after collecting the compound resource). A <b>mining</b> <b>tool</b> allows the player to unearth resources, reshape landscapes and illuminate dark spaces. Solar panels and generators power the <b>mining</b> <b>tool.</b> The astronaut can die from suffocation, impact with storm debris and hostile plants. Single-player and four-player co-op modes are supported.|$|E

This is done {{with the use of}} Kidney Function Tests (KFT). The data <b>mining</b> <b>tools</b> used are Tanagra and Weka with the application of C 4. 5 Algorithm which is based on decision trees. This paper compares the result given by Weka and Tanagra. The outcome of both the tools is analyzed and conclusion is drawn that both the tools are able to work well on dataset but Tanagra is more efficient and less error-prone in terms of the performance of the classifier. The effective usage of data <b>mining</b> <b>tools</b> enables us to find important parameters that reflect the effect of diabetes on kidney. Additionally, it is found that the performance of Weka is best when used with “Use Training Set ” mode than with cross validation followed by percentage split mode for training the classifier...|$|R
