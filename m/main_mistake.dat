60|$|But I {{think the}} <b>main</b> <b>mistake</b> of Mr. Wells's {{philosophy}} is a somewhat deeper one, {{one that he}} expresses in a very entertaining manner in {{the introductory part of}} the new Utopia. His philosophy in some sense amounts to a denial of the possibility of philosophy itself. At least, he maintains that there are no secure and reliable ideas upon which we can rest with a final mental satisfaction. It will be both clearer, however, and more amusing to quote Mr. Wells himself.|$|E
6000|$|... § XX. The changes {{effected}} in form, however, {{were the}} {{least part of the}} evil principles of the Renaissance. As I have just said, its <b>main</b> <b>mistake,</b> in its early stages, was the unwholesome demand for perfection, at any cost. I hope enough has been advanced, in the chapter on the Nature of Gothic, to show the reader that perfection is not to be had from the general workman, but at the cost of everything,--of his whole life, thought, and energy. And Renaissance Europe thought this {{a small price to pay}} for manipulative perfection. Men like Verrocchio and Ghiberti were not to be had every day, nor in every place; and to require from the common workman execution or knowledge like theirs, was to require him to become their copyist. Their strength was great enough to enable them to join science with invention, method with emotion, finish with fire; but, in them, the invention and the fire were first, while Europe saw in them only the method and the finish. This was new to the minds of men, and they pursued it to the neglect of everything else. [...] "This," [...] they cried, [...] "we must have in all our work henceforward:" [...] and they were obeyed. The lower workman secured method and finish, and lost, in exchange for them, his soul.|$|E

He not only retained his control over Prussia, he added {{a new level of}} control over the foreign and domestic policies of the new German Empire. Bismarck had built his reputation as a war-maker, but changed overnight into a peacemaker. He skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germanys position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who [...] "remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, and devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers."

40|$|Purpose – The paper {{investigates the}} utility of {{economic}} theory for post-Communist economic transformation. It serves to explain {{the main reasons for}} market reform failure in different post-Communist countries. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review suggests that {{after the collapse of the}} Communist system there was no economic theory of transition to market. Whenever one considers the transition of post-Communist economies to a market system (which, in fact, is nothing but post-Communist transition to capitalist economies), it has to be placed on record, as this kind of transition has no precedent in history. Findings – The <b>main</b> <b>mistake</b> of gradualists stems from their overlooking some very important conditions for successful transition: political guarantees and internal assets for reforms. And the success of shock therapy rests on the paradox, “the worse, the better”. Originality/value – There is as yet no special economic theory of post-Communist transformation and it is just developing. This paper helps one to understand the main features of shock therapy and gradualism for designing the framework of such a theory. It is geared towards researchers and students interested in the theoretical aspects of the post-Communist economic transition to markets. Capitalist systems, Economic change, Marxist economics...|$|E

The main reason for the crisis were the long-time federal budget deficits, which were mostly financed through short-term domestic debt. This created expectations of central bank fi-nancing.
