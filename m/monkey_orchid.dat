5000|$|Hector Wilks was an English {{botanist}} and conservationist. He {{is perhaps}} best known for rediscovering the <b>Monkey</b> <b>Orchid</b> (Orchis simia) in Kent at a site near Faversham and subsequently introducing the species to Park Gate Down near Elham. The site near Faversham remains one of only two native sites for the <b>Monkey</b> <b>Orchid</b> in the British Isles and has remained closed to the public since its discovery. On the 21 May 2007 Park Gate Down was renamed [...] "The Hector Wilks Reserve" [...] in recognition of his involvement with the reserve from its inception.|$|E

50|$|San Gerardo de Rivas is a {{traditional}} Tico village situated in an agricultural region in the Talamanca Mountain range, although recently is changing to adopt eco-tourism, with economic opportunities for locals and newcomers also. The complex and rare cloud forest environment the village is located in is famed for its waterfalls and its diverse wildlife including rare species of birds, large felines (cougars and jaguars) and <b>monkeys,</b> varieties of <b>orchids</b> and butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Species of grass: orchid (Himantoglossum caprinum), Fritillaria (Fritillaria montana), yellow linum (Linum uninerve), Asplenium ceterach (Ceterach officinarum), Cephalaria (Cephalaria laevigata), <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis simia), {{fragrant}} orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea), corydalis (Corydalis pumila), crocus (Crocus flavus).|$|E
50|$|Orchis purpurea may {{be mistaken}} for the {{military}} orchid (Orchis militaris) or <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis simia). The three species often hybridize, making them difficult to identify, although {{the shape of the}} labellum is distinct to each species.|$|E
50|$|Orchis simia, {{commonly}} known as the <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid,</b> is a greyish pink to reddish species of the Orchis genus. It gets its common name from its lobed lip which mimics the general shape of a monkey's body.|$|E
50|$|These {{terrestrial}} orchids have root tubers {{instead of}} pseudobulbs. They are extremely diverse in appearance. They produce an erect stem. The inflorescence is a cylindrical to globular spike, 5 - 15 cm long, with yellow, red to purple flowers. They start flowering at the base, slowly progressing upwards, {{except for the}} <b>Monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis simia), which flowers in reverse order.|$|E
50|$|Dracula simia, called also <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> or the monkey-like Dracula, is an epiphytic orchid {{originally}} {{described in}} the genus Masdevallia, but later moved to the genus Dracula. The arrangement of column, petals and lip strongly resembles a monkeys face. The plant blooms at any season with several flowers on the inflorescence that open successively. Flowers are fragrant {{with the scent of}} a ripe orange.|$|E
50|$|The nationally rare {{late spider orchid}} (Ophrys fuciflora) {{is limited}} within the British Isles to chalk {{grassland}} between Folkestone and Wye. One of the two native British sites for the nationally rare <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (Orchis simia) is on the North Downs. The nationally scarce man orchid (Orchis anthropophora) is not uncommon on chalk grassland on the Downs in Surrey and Kent. Other scarce plant species such as early gentian (Gentiana anglica), dwarf milkwort (Polygala amarella) and bedstraw broomrape (Orobanche caryophyllacea) also occur on chalk grassland in the North Downs.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include slender bedstraw (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
40|$|The {{past and}} {{current status of}} the two {{population}}s of Military orchid (Orchis militaris) and one population of <b>Monkey</b> <b>orchid</b> (O. simia) in the Chilterns is discussed. All three of these extant populations reached nadirs twenty or more years ago, but have since increased substantially, especially {{in the last five}} years, and are now considered relatively healthy. Preliminary results from re-introduction attempts are given. The possible causes of the population increases are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Ophrys apifera, or bee orchid: {{the most}} {{widespread}} variety at our site. Anacamptis pyramidalis or pyramidal orchid: another common variety, with close to 2500 plants counted in 2005. This year, a Himantoglossum robertianum or giant orchid was spotted for the first time, an extremely rare specimen to find in our region. The <b>monkey</b> <b>orchid,</b> Orchis simia, gets {{its name from the}} bizarre shape of its labellum (this is actually the third petal, hanging down from the flower), which may remind you of a monkey. Himantoglossum hircinum, the lizard orchid, occurs periodically on the site. It has a rather strong odour, which is why in French it is called orchis bouc (goat orchid). </p...|$|E
