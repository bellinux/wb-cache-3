By merging both sampling and compression, CS is very promising to develop practical ultra-low power read-out systems for wireless bio-signal monitoring devices, where large amounts of sensor data need to be transferred through power-hungry wireless links. Lately CS has been successfully applied for real-time energy-aware single-lead ECG compression on resource-constrained Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) motes [1]. Building on our previous work, {{in this paper we}} propose a new and promising approach for joint compression of <b>multi-lead</b> ECG signals, where strong correlations exist between them.
