5|$|Nurkse's theory {{discusses}} how {{the poor}} {{size of the}} market in underdeveloped countries perpetuates its underdeveloped state. Nurkse has also clarified the various determinants of the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> and puts primary focus on productivity. According to him, if the productivity levels rise in a less developed country, its <b>market</b> <b>size</b> will expand and thus it can eventually become a developed economy. Apart from this, Nurkse has been nicknamed an export pessimist, as he feels that the finances to make investments in underdeveloped countries must arise from their own domestic territory. No importance should be given to promoting exports.|$|E
5|$|The {{balanced}} growth theory {{is an economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the <b>market</b> <b>size,</b> increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Bain Capital {{focused on}} venture capital investments. Romney {{set up a}} system in which any partner could veto one of these {{potential}} opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years. The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start Staples Inc., after founder Thomas G. Stemberg convinced Romney of the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> for office supplies and Romney convinced others; Bain Capital eventually reaped a nearly sevenfold return on its investment, and Romney sat on the Staples board of directors for over a decade.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} effects of {{economic}} integration on trade, wages, and welfare when <b>market</b> <b>sizes</b> differ. A duopoly model with two-way intraindustry trade in similar products and with unionized labor markets is employed. It is confirmed that, {{for a wide range}} of different relative <b>market</b> <b>sizes,</b> integration leads to higher wages, employment, and welfare. However, where <b>market</b> <b>sizes</b> differ widely, the reduction of trade barriers leads to a reduction of wages, employment, and-in some circumstances-welfare in the country with the large market.

Total world production, for comparison purposes expressed as HCl, is estimated at 20Mt/year, with 3Mt/year from direct synthesis, and the rest as secondary product from organic and similar syntheses.

5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the <b>market</b> <b>size</b> expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E

25|$|<b>Market</b> <b>size</b> can {{be given}} {{in terms of the}} number of buyers and sellers in a {{particular}} market or in terms of the total exchange of money in the market, generally annually (per year). When given in terms of money, <b>market</b> <b>size</b> is often termed market value, but in a sense distinct from market value of individual products. For one and the same goods, there may be different (and generally increasing) market values at the production level, the wholesale level and the retail level. For example, the value of the global illicit drug market for the year 2003 was estimated by the United Nations to be US$13 billion at the production level, $94 billion at the wholesale level (taking seizures into account), and US$322 billion at the retail level (based on retail prices and taking seizures and other losses into account).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: This thesis {{has three}} objectives. First, the past {{development}} of monetary systems is studied {{to see how}} Bitcoin is positioned as the forerunner of a new category. Second, the attitudes and expecta-tions of Finnish stakeholders are studied to recognize the general perception and future outlook for Bitcoin. Third, bitcoins are examined as an investment instrument by studying price drivers {{and the degree of}} predictability of future returns. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The qualitative methods are based on a literature review and an interview study conducted with Finnish stakeholders from different financial institutions and Bitcoin start-ups. The quantitative methods consist of <b>market</b> <b>sizing</b> calculations, a regression analysis, and Granger tests. The regres-sions utilize novel variables network hashrate, network transactions, and bitcoin supply as explan-atory variables for bitcoin price. Also bitcoin price and Google Trends SVI are used as explanatory variables. The <b>market</b> <b>sizing</b> calculations are based on M 2 monetary aggregates for USD, EUR, and JPY. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The thesis develops a categorization for decentralized cpytocurrencies that takes into account the main developments of the past monetary systems. The interview study reveals optimism for the technology behind Bitcoin and other decentralized systems, while all interviewees accept the un-certainty of Bitcoin survival. The stakeholders perceive the main challenges of Bitcoin to be tech-nological weaknesses, trust, and reputational issues. In terms of <b>market</b> <b>sizing,</b> it is clear that Bitcoin is not currently a serious threat to fiat currencies. Price driver analysis revealed a momen-tum effect in price returns, as well as an inflationary effect caused by the increasing supply. Also the network hashrate was found to forecast future bitcoin returns. The results from the Granger tests challenge the causality assumed in the regressions...|$|R
