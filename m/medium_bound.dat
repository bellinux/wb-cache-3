Methods: Semen samples from nine patients and nine fertile donors were separated in parallel by the standard swim-up method in both media. Subsequently, hemizona assays were performed with prophase, failed-fertilized ICSI and IVF oocytes. Results: Sperm separation resulted in a significantly higher sperm count (P < 0. 01) and progressive motility (P = 0. 018) in binding improvement medium. Moreover, spermatozoa coincubated with hemizonae (prophase, failed-fertilized ICSI and IVF oocytes) in binding improvement <b>medium</b> <b>bound</b> significantly more to hemizonae than in the controls (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Iron {{regulatory}} factor (IRF) is a cytoplasmic mRNA-binding {{protein that}} coordinates post-transcriptionally {{the expression of}} several important proteins in iron metabolism. Binding of IRF to iron-responsive elements (IRE) in the 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) of ferritin and erythroid 5 -aminolevulinic acid-synthase mRNAs inhibits their translation, whereas binding to IREs in the 3 ' UTR of transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA prevents the degradation of this mRNA. IRF binds RNA strongly after iron deprivation, but is inactive, yet present, under conditions of high cellular iron supply. Recently, IRF was also shown to have aconitase activity indicating {{the existence of an}} Fe-S cluster in the protein. In the current study we expressed human IRF in insect cells from recombinant baculovirus and analysed IRE-binding and aconitase activities under various culture conditions. Newly made apoprotein, synthesized in the absence of iron, was fully active in IRE-binding, but showed no aconitase activity.

40|$|The {{pressure}} disturbance propagation {{through a}} weakly compressible <b>medium,</b> <b>bound</b> by rigid structure {{as well as}} material interfaces, has an important bearing on the safety analysis of liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactors. The analyses {{have been carried out}} using numerical algorithms based on Eulerian, Lagrangian, or mixed formulations. Even though the results obtained from these schemes compared well with the benchmark experimental results, certain drawbacks, such as less accurate treatment of material interfaces in the Eulerian schemes and mesh distortion in the Lagrangian schemes, and so forth, remain. These drawbacks may be overcome by using a method of characteristics in two dimensions known as the near-characteristic method to solve the problem. The region of interest is discretized into Eulerian grids, and the flow parameters are obtained from the compatibility equations corresponding to the near characteristics generated from the gridpoints. The material interfaces are tracked explicitly, using the near-characteristic scheme. The scheme is used to analyze a typical core disruptive accident problem, and the results are compared with experimental results as well as those obtained using two other numerical schemes. Good agreement is observed among the results; indeed, the one-dimensional problem of exploding wire phenomena and the two-dimensional problem of core disruptive accident analysis validate the effectiveness of the scheme. The future extension of the present scheme will include fluid structure interaction and complex internal structures...|$|E

40|$|A main known culprit causing amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning {{in humans}} is domoic acid (DA). The toxin appearance in sea waters (by counting the toxin producing algae) and consequently in shellfish is closely monitored to prevent acute intoxications with gastrointestinal symptoms and neurological signs. However {{it is assumed}} that there might be some chronic problems with repetitive exposures to the toxin in animals. In humans this is greatly unknown and it is mostly assessed by relating reported toxin episodes and representative consumption data. Although in Belgium no alarming outbreaks have been reported in recent years, different concentrations of DA have been found in shellfish samples. In this study the human acute and chronic exposure to DA through shellfish consumption was evaluated by linking the data of DA concentrations in samples collected in the scope of the National Food control program in the period 2004 - 2009 and consumption data obtained from the National Belgian Food Consumption Survey including 3245 adults. The found level of toxin was highest in scallops while lowest in mussels.
