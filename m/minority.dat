5|$|The Hungarian {{government}} recognised Croats as a <b>minority</b> {{native to}} Hungary; it {{has decided to}} implement the optional regulations of the European Charter for Regional or <b>Minority</b> Languages {{with respect to the}} Croatian language and establish a <b>minority</b> self-government for the Croatian <b>minority</b> in Hungary, guaranteeing cultural autonomy. The Croatian <b>minority</b> set up 127 local and 7 county self-governments in Hungary. There are concerns that Croatian <b>minority</b> rights in Hungary are being diminished, but the president of Croatia has assessed that both Croatian and Hungarian <b>minority</b> policies were appropriate.

5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench <b>minority</b> representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP <b>minority</b> candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a <b>minority</b> candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the <b>minority</b> has had less representation overall as the proportion of <b>minority</b> MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since <b>minority</b> MPs are a numerical <b>minority</b> in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E

There are 600 recognized First Nations governments or bands, encompassing {{a total of}} 1,172,790 people. Canada's indigenous population is growing at almost twice the national rate, and four percent of Canada's population claimed an indigenous identity in 2006. Another 16.2 {{percent of the population}} belonged to a non-indigenous visible <b>minority.</b> In 2006, the largest visible <b>minority</b> groups were South Asian (4.0%), Chinese (3.9%) and Black (2.5%).

In 1961, less than two percent of Canada's population (about 300,000 people) were members of visible <b>minority</b> groups. By 2007, almost one in five (19.8%) were foreign-born, with nearly 60 percent of new immigrants coming from Asia (including the Middle East).

5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other <b>minority</b> community. A person is regarded as belonging to the Malay community if, regardless of whether or not he or she is of the Malay race, considers himself or herself to be a member of the community and is generally accepted as such by the community. Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other <b>minority</b> community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such. The <b>minority</b> status of candidates is determined by two committees appointed by the President, the Malay Community Committee and the Indian and Other <b>Minority</b> Communities Committee.

Nonresponse rates are usually higher among ethnic <b>minorities</b> than among the native population.

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of <b>minority</b> interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure <b>minority</b> representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of <b>minority</b> candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in <b>minority</b> candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that <b>minority</b> candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of <b>minority</b> candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various <b>minority</b> groups for not entirely addressing {{the needs of}} <b>minority</b> populations.
