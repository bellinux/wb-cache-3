[...] Adults are 12-14 in (30-35 cm) long and weigh 1.0-2.0 lb (0.4-0.8 kg), though rare individuals can weigh 8 lb at 24 in long. It has a robust, slightly compressed body, with a pointed head. Its color varies from silvery to bronze. Fins and tails are yellow and the snout contains blue stripes. As the common name suggests, {{schoolmaster snapper}} live in groups of dozens of subjects. They keep {{a short distance from}} the sea floor at depths between 10 and 90 ft, prefer the cover provided by coral reefs during the day, and expand their range to seagrass beds at night. The schoolmaster snapper is sometimes called the <b>barred</b> <b>snapper</b> or the caji. Like other snapper species, it is a popular food fish.|$|R

50|$|Through the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, the mall changed {{ownership}} several times. Foot traffic started to decrease when Northland Mall {{on the north}} side of Appleton completed a major expansion. Another 15 stores in an existing 1960s-era strip were also connected to Kohl's, creating a rare instance of a hybrid strip/enclosed mall. Dartmouth Clothing & Lady Dartmouth (based in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin) opened a store in the Valley Fair Mall during the early 1980s. It eventually closed and re-opened under the name American Clothiers. Another attraction was the addition of Pedro's, at the time one of the first places in northeast Wisconsin to serve authentic Mexican food. Pedro's was eventually purchased by George Wall and the name changed to Sergio's <b>Mexican</b> <b>Bar</b> & Grill.|$|R

500|$|Since 2004, Brosnan {{has talked}} of backing {{a film about}} Caitlin Macnamara, wife of poet Dylan Thomas, the title role to be played by Miranda Richardson. Brosnan's first post-Bond role was that of Daniel Rafferty in 2004's Laws of Attraction.

Brosnan's next film was 2005's The Matador.
