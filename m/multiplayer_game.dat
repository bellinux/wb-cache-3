5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game</b> mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and assets from it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E

5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead of seeking active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game</b> in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E

Japanese and Western journalists were positive at its release. In August 2015, {{it was announced that}} the game could not continue in its current form, and would be replaced by a new version.

5|$|Up to {{four people}} {{can play in}} {{multiplayer}} mode, which has specific rules predetermined by the players. Stock and timed matches {{are two of the}} multiplayer modes of play.

A winner is declared once time runs out, or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives.

5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game,</b> but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these services would incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game</b> because it gave the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the single-player campaign mode, Descent 3 features an online multiplayer mode where numerous players can compete {{against each other in}} eight different game types. Notable game types include Anarchy, where the objective is to kill as many opponents as possible, Capture the Flag, where two to four teams compete against each other to capture opposing flags, and Monsterball, in which players must shoot and guide a ball into their opponents' goal. Aspects such as time limit, number of players, map to play on, and selection of what weapons are allowed, among others, can be customized to match player preference. The game also features an observer mode which allows players to watch a <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game</b> as a spectator and a co-operative mode that allows players to work together to complete campaign missions. Multiplayer games support the DirectPlay, IPX, and TCP/IP protocols. Online gameplay was also possible over Parallax Online, an online gaming service which kept track of players' statistics and rankings.|$|E

Elite Force {{was to be the}} second PlayStation 2 project undertaken by Majesco. The PlayStation 2 version of the game includes most of the same content as the computer version of the game, albeit that the game's graphics were simplified slightly for the console.

5|$|Writing for PC Gamer, Leif Johnson complimented {{the variety}} of <b>multiplayer</b> <b>game</b> modes available. This {{sentiment}} was shared by other reviewers who thought the multiplayer offering was considerably more diverse than what was typically available in most RTS games. Numerous critics regarded Blitz to be the standout multiplayer mode, however they were still apprehensive about its shortcomings. GamesRadar reviewer Robert Zak called Blitz the most forward-thinking area of Halo Wars 2, in contrast {{to other parts of}} the game which he thought were formulaic. Other writers agreed that the mode was an interesting twist on RTS and enjoyed playing it. While Blitz card packs could be earned through playing the game, both Bratt and Rignall still expressed disappointment about the inclusion of microtransactions for purchasing card packs. Johnson and Stapleton suspected that winning games in Blitz may be too reliant on the luck of the draw. Consequently, Stapleton thought the mode was unsuitable for competitive multiplayer but felt that the randomness and card mechanics worked well in the Firefight variant.|$|E
