Scully and Mulder visit the scene, with Mulder {{continuing}} {{to be very}} skeptical of any alien involvement. The Syndicate is shocked by the massacre. Mulder and Scully visit Cassandra again, who knew <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> died. They encounter Spender, who is upset about their visit with his mother.

5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> remained, taking them to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company did not believe in it and turned it down; as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In the end they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E

25|$|The late 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were a {{turbulent}} {{time for the}} Taiwan-born as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful bargaining chip in their demands for respect for their basic human rights.

25|$|Hachikō {{attracted}} the attention of other commuters. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> frequented the Shibuya train station had seen Hachikō and Professor Ueno together each day. Initial reactions from the people, especially from those working at the station, were not necessarily friendly. However, after the first appearance of the article about him on October 4, 1932 in Asahi Shimbun, people started to bring Hachikō treats and food to nourish him during his wait.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{were born}} in Karelia and were {{evacuated}} want Karelia {{to become part of}} Finland. According to polls, older people (ages 65 and up) and young people (15-25) support the idea more strongly than the generation of their parents (25–65) who grew up during the Cold War. Former President Mauno Koivisto has been against a discussion about the question. Support for regaining the ceded areas is also strong among minor nationalist right-wing groups.|$|E

Once peace was established, Muawiya reconciled <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had been fighting each other by his generosity and fairness. Even the most stubborn of opponents would often melt under his generosity and diplomacy. He also managed through fine diplomacy to balance out the tribal rivalries.|$|E
25|$|The high {{real-estate}} {{prices in}} Santa Fe mean that <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> work there commute from the Albuquerque metro area. Furthermore, the capital {{is home to}} many of the state’s cultural institutions and tourist attractions, and most out-of-state visitors are forced to make the 60-mile journey from the Albuquerque International Sunport by car. As the population of the region grows, commute times are expected to increase 80% on some routes by 2025, making the introduction of additional forms of transportation a priority to local governments.|$|E
25|$|After the Mongol {{conquest of}} the Jin dynasty, in 1236, Ögedei gave Hebei (attached with 80,000 households) {{to the family of}} Tolui, who died in 1232. Kublai {{received}} an estate of his own, which included 10,000 households. Because he was inexperienced, Kublai allowed local officials free rein. Corruption amongst his officials and aggressive taxation caused large numbers of Chinese peasants to flee, which led to a decline in tax revenues. Kublai quickly came to his appanage in Hebei and ordered reforms. Sorghaghtani sent new officials to help him and tax laws were revised. Thanks to those efforts, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> fled returned.|$|E

25|$|Certain changes {{occurred}} in Europe during {{the end of}} the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century that would greatly affect the lives of the French and the people of Corsica. One of those changes came about {{with the advent of the}} Second Industrial Revolution. With the Second Industrial Revolution, <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> worked in agriculture began to move to the larger cities with hopes of finding better jobs and better lives. Also, there was a widespread crop failure due to long periods of drought and crop diseases (e.g., the Phylloxera epidemic destroyed the Corsican wine industry), a cholera epidemic and a general deterioration of economic conditions. Thus, many of the farms in Corsica began to fail.|$|E
25|$|<b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> {{ring the}} bell are {{business}} executives whose companies trade on the exchange. However, {{there have also been}} many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell. Athletes such as Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees and Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps, entertainers such as rapper Snoop Dogg, singer and actress Liza Minnelli and members of the band Kiss, and politicians such as Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani and President of South Africa Nelson Mandela have all had the honor of ringing the bell. Two United Nations Secretaries General have also rung the bell. On April 27, 2006, Secretary-General Kofi Annan rang the opening bell to launch the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment. On July 24, 2013, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to celebrate the NYSE joining the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.|$|E
25|$|Kricfalusi left Bakshi's {{studio to}} work on The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil for ABC, where he teamed up with <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> would later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects. ABC had been {{negotiating}} {{for the production of}} the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampett's cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed {{in order to meet the}} September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the show's crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately not very happy with the cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi. ABC cancelled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for children's programming.|$|E

50|$|Figgins is a surname. The name Figgins appears {{first in}} 13th century Wiltshire, England, {{and may have}} Norman roots (<b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> medieval England by this time had {{ancestors}} who came across to England with <b>the</b> Norman invasion <b>of</b> 1066 AD).|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} conservation {{problem is that}} the area is the second most populated natural protected area in Mexico, with severe problems with poverty. This creates a need to balance conservation efforts with local subsistence needs. One important aspect of this is to manage forest resources so that local woodcutters can make a living while controlling how much is cut. However, mass migration out of the region has almost halved the population of the Querétaro biosphere to about 50,000 people since it was declared. This has taken pressure off of local natural resources, as agriculture, livestock production and logging lessen. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have left are in the United States and send money back home. This money has spurred the building of larger homes and the proliferation of pick up trucks, many with U.S. license plates. It has also allowed for the change to gas over firewood for cooking, but garbage has become a problem. However, overall the depopulation has been positive for the recuperation of the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|During {{the grant}} {{meetings}} in May 1971 {{some of the}} scientists, including Jay Shurley and David Elkind, voiced concern that the prevailing methods of research pursued scientific study {{at the expense of}} Genie's well-being and could cause love and attention to be contingent on her language acquisition. Shurley said that there was strong disagreement during the initial grant meetings and the atmosphere grew increasingly tense and bitter, especially noting that the later meetings excluded <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> had worked most closely with Genie. After May 1971 Elkind declined {{to participate in the study}} further, despite having personally known both the Riglers for several years, and in an interview years later he cited a desire not to be involved in a case which, in his view, prioritized scientific research over Genie's care. While Shurley acknowledged that the scientists at the center of the case were in a completely unprecedented situation, he also decided to minimize his involvement over these concerns and felt that by the conclusion of the study all of the scientists, including himself, had been guilty to varying degrees of using Genie as an object and putting themselves and their goals ahead of her and her mother's best interests.|$|E
25|$|The {{series is}} {{localized}} by Aksys Games; Chunsoft {{was first introduced}} to Aksys through Spike, when Chunsoft {{was looking for a}} company that could publish the first game in the United States. During Aksys' evaluation period of it, many people at the company did not believe in the game and turned it down; as <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. Eventually, they decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company. They worked by the philosophy of keeping true to the spirit of the original Japanese version, opting to make dialogue sound like what a native speaker would say rather than strictly adhering to the Japanese wording. Ben Bateman, the editor of the first two games' localizations, did this by looking at the writing from a wider view, examining it line by line or scene by scene, rather than word by word or sentence by sentence, and thinking about how to convey the same idea in English. Most parts of the games that include a joke in the localization also have a joke in the Japanese versions, but a different one; Bateman did try to make similar types of jokes with similar contents and ideas. He was given mostly free rein in what he could change or add to the writing, as long as it did not disrupt the plot.|$|E
