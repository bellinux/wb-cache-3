Emporis and other building database sites usually give the floor count as 70, while other sources state 73 stories. This table uses the floor count of 73 as stated officially by the building's owner.|$|E

5|$|Harold Innis {{wrote his}} PhD thesis {{on the history}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The {{completion}} of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, an {{advertising}} {{campaign in the}} Netherlands was released in which a white model dressed entirely in white and a black model dressed entirely in black {{was used to compare}} Sony's new Ceramic White PSP and the original Piano Black PSP. This series of ads depicted both models fighting with each other and drew criticism from the media for being racist, though Sony <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ad did not feature any racist message.|$|E

The next day, after much prior deliberation, Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott's house and begins unpacking her belongings.|$|E

5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians. The anthem reminds {{some of the best}} days of Russia and past sacrifices, while it reminds others of the violence that occurred under the rule of Stalin. The Russian government <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> anthem is a symbol of the unity of the people, and that it respects the past. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wagner cannon {{does not}} match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley think {{it more likely that}} the Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. It was likely melted down with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on his analysis of the MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E

5|$|From Europe, {{the legend}} <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{returning}} crusaders brought the Saluki {{back from the}} Middle East. The painting of Henry IV, Duke of Saxony with his hunting dog, painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder in 1514, is thought by some to show a Saluki. The dog wears a collar decorated with a scallop shell, which is the badge of a pilgrim who has traveled the Way of Saint James in Spain. Salukis appear in Paolo Veronese's 1573 work The Adoration of the Magi (also known as the Adoration of the Kings), currently located at the National Gallery, London. Veronese painted the breed in another two of his religious paintings: The Marriage at Cana and The Finding of Moses.|$|E
5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry into the political sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E

5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ride is safe, before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Pe-8s to all causes—mechanical, combat, {{friendly}} fire—had steadily {{increased from}} one aircraft per 103 flights in 1942 to one per 46 sorties in 1944. Despite the losses, production {{kept pace with}} need. The number of aircraft belonging to the 45th DBAD continued to rise; 20 were on hand on 1 January 1944 and 30 on 1 June. The Pe-8s flew 276 sorties in 1944 against such targets as Helsinki, Tallinn and Pskov. Aviation historian Yefim Gordon <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pe-8 flew its last mission {{on the night of}} 1–2 August 1944, but the Statistical Digest of the VVS contradicts this claim, showing 31 Pe-8s assigned to 45th DBAD on 1 January 1945 and 32 on hand on 10 May 1945. However, during this period the 45th DBAD only had three regiments, none of which used the Pe-8 as their primary aircraft, so while the 45th DBAD may have had Pe-8s, these may not have been in use as the primary combat aircraft.|$|E

Zemskov maintains that military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. He <b>maintains</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone.
