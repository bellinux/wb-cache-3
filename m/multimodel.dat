40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} a <b>multimodel</b> approach to control uncertain systems. The basic problem is to minimize the number of models in the dynamic library in order to obtain the desired performance. A proposed solution is based on the Kharitonov principle. Each generic model and its corresponding controller have an unchanged structure. The <b>multimodel</b> control is obtained by fusion of the elementary controllers. A new strategy for <b>multimodel</b> control is proposed, which uses observers to improve the robustness of <b>multimodel</b> control in discrete systems. The principal idea of this control is to reinitialize the state of each model by the corresponding state computed from the process when the error between them exceeds a certain value. A good choice of observer, as well as a fusion applied to the coeOEcients of each controller, allows the <b>multimodel</b> control strategy to reach the desired objective for the <b>multimodel</b> control of the system. The desired performance is reached by the use of this new strategy of <b>multimodel</b> control. Thus, the signicant aspect of this study is the introduction of observers into <b>multimodel</b> control as a technique to improve the validity of the generic models. The <b>multimodel</b> control obtained by this new strategy of control is presented. Computer simulation results show that a robust <b>multimodel</b> control design, based on an appropriate selection of models, plus reinitialization steps based on observers, is feasible and provides good performances...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a <b>multimodeling</b> object-oriented (OO) simulation environment (MOOSE), which is a framework for modeling and developing simulation software. Its architecture derives from Object Oriented Physical Modeling (OOPM), which extends classical object-oriented methodology to allow attributes and methods to take on models as values. The MOOSE Model Repository (MMR) allows distributed model definitions, and so supports "web-based simulation", integrated with the web and made available on the Internet. MOOSE features <b>multimodeling,</b> an OO approach to model refinement and abstraction, allowing creation of heterogeneous hierarchical models. Dynamic models comprising <b>multimodels</b> include Finite State Machines, Functional Block Models, Equation Constraint Models, and Rule Based Models. MOOSE emphasizes visualization, & e#ective use of OO metaphors to connect conceptual model to program, and to capture model geometry and dynamics. The MOOSE human-computer interface has two GUI's: Modeler,formodeldesign,and Scenario, for model execution control and visualization. MOOSE back end generates a model description in a target language such as C++, then translates and adds runtime support to form an Engine. Model execution consists of Engine running synchronously with Scenario. The MOOSE approach facilitates model development, models with greater intuitive appeal, communication among model authors, better agreement between simulation programs and their conceptual models, component reuse, and model/program extensibility. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} into seasonal climate prediction {{has focused on}} combining multiple atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) to develop <b>multimodel</b> ensembles. A new approach to combining multiple GCMs is proposed by analyzing the skill levels of candidate models contingent on the relevant predictor(s) state. To demonstrate this approach, historical simulations of winter (December–February, DJF) precipitation and temperature from seven GCMs were combined by evaluating their skill—represented by mean square error (MSE) —over similar predictor (DJF Niño- 3. 4) conditions. The MSE estimates are converted into weights for each GCM for developing <b>multimodel</b> tercile probabilities. A total of six <b>multimodel</b> schemes are considered that include combinations based on pooling of ensembles {{as well as on}} the long-term skill of the models. To ensure the improved skill exhibited by the <b>multimodel</b> scheme is statistically significant, rigorous hypothesis tests were performed comparing the skill of multimodels with each individual model’s skill. The <b>multimodel</b> combination contingent on Niño- 3. 4 shows improved skill particularly for regions whose winter precipitation and temperature exhibit significant correlation with Niño- 3. 4. Analyses of these weights also show that the proposed <b>multimodel</b> combination methodology assigns higher weights for GCMs and lesser weights for climatology during El Niño and La Niña conditions. On the other hand, because of the limited skill of GCMs during neutral Niño- 3. 4 conditions, the methodology assigns higher weights for climatology resulting in im-proved skill from the <b>multimodel</b> combinations. Thus, analyzing GCMs ’ skill contingent on the relevant predictor state provides an alternate approach for <b>multimodel</b> combinations such that years with limited skill could be replaced with climatology. 1...|$|E

The obtained artificial intelligence based <b>multimodel</b> controllers are compared with clas-sical single model based ones. It is shown through simulation examples that a transient response improvement can be achieved by using multiestimation based techniques. Furthermore, a method for synthesizing <b>multimodel</b> based neural network controllers from already designed single model based ones is presented. The proposed methodology allows to extend the existing single model based neural controllers to <b>multimodel</b> based ones, extending the applicability of this kind of techniques to a more general type of controllers. Also, some applications of genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic to <b>multimodel</b> controller design are proposed. Thus, the mutation operation from genetic algorithms inspires a robustness test which consists of a random modification of the estimates which is used to select the estimates leading to the better identification performance towards parameterizing online the adaptive controller. Such a test is useful for plants operating in a noisy environment. The pro-posed robustness test improves the selection of the plant model used to parameterize the adaptive controller in comparison to classical <b>multimodel</b> schemes where the controller parameterization choice is basically taken based on the identification accuracy of each model. Moreover, the fuzzy logic approach suggests new ideas to the design of multiestimation structures which can be applied to a broad variety of adaptive controllers such as robotic manipulator controller design...|$|E

Three-month lead austral summer rainfall predictions {{produced by the}} components of the system are integrated (i. e., combined and calibrated) using a Bayesian forecast assimilation procedure. The skill of empirical, coupled <b>multimodel,</b> and integrated forecasts obtained with forecast assimilation is assessed and compared.

40|$|Abstract: Model-driven {{engineering}} (MDE) advocates the use {{of different}} domainspecific languages (DSLs) for describing different aspects of a system, which is called multi-view modeling or <b>multimodeling.</b> Existing metamodel-based technologies like Xtext provide good support for defining a DSL and for creating a corresponding domainspecific workbench but do not support <b>multimodeling,</b> yet, i. e., they do not provide means to specify (non-bijective) relations between DSLs, so that models that are created using these DSLs are synchronized automatically. We present an approach to model synchronization {{that is based on}} asymmetric bidirectional transformations. Therefore, we implement lenses – a term-rewriting-based approach to bidirectional transformations – as an internal DSL in the Scala programming language and use lenses for model transformations. This way, our approach does not depend on special tool support and allows for seamless integration with Java-based MDE technologies. ...|$|R
