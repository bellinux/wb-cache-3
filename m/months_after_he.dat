5|$|By {{the time}} the amphitheatre was completed, Titus's short reign had already endured a series of disasters: two <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> had succeeded Vespasian, Mount Vesuvius had erupted, {{destroying}} Pompeii, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Oplontis; a fire had burned {{in the city of}} Rome for three days and three nights causing substantial damage and destroying the Temple of Jupiter that had recently been restored by Vespasian; and there had been an outbreak of plague which was said to be the worst the city had ever endured. To dedicate the amphitheatre and the baths, and probably in an attempt to mollify both the Roman public and the gods, Titus inaugurated the opening of the Colosseum with lavish games which lasted for more than a hundred days.|$|E

5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E

5|$|A few <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> {{was born}} in the village of Bani Jamra, al-Jamri moved with his family to Iraq where his father {{continued}} his religious studies. To his delight, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in 1973 and five years later graduated from high school. In 1979 he moved to the United Kingdom (UK) to continue his higher education. Between 1987 and 2001, al-Jamri lived in self-imposed exile in UK where he became the spokesman of a UK-based opposition group. Following a series of reforms of which he was initially skeptical of, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain in December 2001. He co-founded Al-Wasat in September 2002 and became its editor-in-chief since then. The newspaper, said to be the only one offering independent and non-sectarian coverage in Bahrain was a success, becoming the country's most popular and profitable. Al-Jamri writes daily columns described to be moderate and non-sectarian.|$|E

5|$|At Champotón, {{the fleet}} was {{approached}} by {{a small number of}} large war canoes, but the ships' cannon soon put them to flight. At the mouth of the Tabasco River the Spanish sighted massed warriors and canoes but the natives did not approach.

From the natives they received a few gold trinkets and news of the riches of the Aztec Empire to the west. The expedition continued far enough to confirm the reality of the gold-rich empire, sailing as far north as Pánuco River.

5|$|Bute's father, John, Lord Mount Stuart, {{died a few}} <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> {{was born}} and {{as a young child}} he was brought up first by his mother, the former Lady Elizabeth McDougall-Crichton, and later by his {{paternal}} grandfather, John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute. He travelled widely across Europe before attending Cambridge University. He contracted an eye condition and remained partially sighted {{for the rest of his}} life. Having inherited large estates across Britain, he married his first wife, Lady Maria North, in 1818, and together they lived a relatively secluded life in Mount Stuart House in Scotland, one of Bute's four seats. Bute was dour but industrious, with a flair for land management. He focused his daily routine around extensive correspondence with his estate managers, making biennial tours of his lands around the country. The couple did not conceive any children, and Maria died in 1841. Bute remarried four years later, to Lady Sophia Rawdon-Hastings, and she gave birth to Bute's only child, John, in 1847.|$|E

5|$|For the 2008–09 season, the Devils signed Brian Rolston and Bobby Holik, both {{making their}} second stints with the team. The Devils {{were forced to}} play without Brodeur for over three <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> tore a biceps tendon in November, but strong play by backup goalie Scott Clemmensen kept the Devils atop the Atlantic Division. After his return, Brodeur broke Patrick Roy's record for regular season wins on March 17, 2009, with his 552nd victory, while Patrik Elias became the franchise's all-time leading scorer with his 702nd point. The season {{also served as a}} {{break-out}} year for 24-year-old Zach Parise, who led the team with an impressive 45 goals and 94 points. In the opening round of the 2009 playoffs, the Devils were eliminated in a Game 7 loss in which the Hurricanes scored two goals in the last minute and twenty seconds to erase a 3–2 Devils lead.|$|E
5|$|Joe Jordan's {{tenure in}} charge was short; {{he left the}} club {{less than a year}} after joining. Following Jordan's departure, Stoke opted to reappoint Lou Macari only 12 <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> had left. Despite the {{optimism}} surrounding his return, only a mid-table finish was attained in the 1994–95 season. The 1995–96 season started poorly, but the signing of striker Mike Sheron turned around the club's campaign. Stoke eventually finished fourth but were defeated in the play-off semi-final by Leicester City. The following season, 1996–97, saw Mark Stein return from Chelsea on loan, partnering Sheron in attack. The season started well, with Stoke in fourth place at Christmas, but a poor second half of the season saw the club drop to an eventual 12th place. Sheron was sold in 1997 for a club record fee of £2.5m. Macari left the club at the end of the season, his last game in charge the final league game at the Victoria Ground in a match against West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E

5|$|Bradford were {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup with a 3–0 defeat to League One side Tranmere Rovers. They returned to league action with two more draws, away to Mansfield Town and Chesterfield, the latter game of which featured Joe Colbeck, who had returned from Darlington early despite his one-month loan spell being originally extended. The following week City signed Willy Topp for £35,000the first time they had paid a transfer fee for a player since Andy Tod in November 2001nearly three <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> first came on trial. City were given two weeks off before their next game, when their home game against Rotherham United on 15 December was postponed because of a frozen pitch. But they could {{not take advantage of}} the extra rest and despite taking the lead against Peterborough United, two second half goals gave Peterborough a 2–1 win and helped them to second in the league. The highest attendance of the season for a League Two game attended City's next game on Boxing Day against Lincoln City. It {{was the first time the}} two teams had met in the league at Valley Parade since the fire of 1985 and the crowd of 15,510 observed a minute silence and wreath-laying ceremony before the game. Peter Thorne gave City the lead, and despite an equalier from Lincoln, Barry Conlon secured a 2–1 win for Bradford in the last minute. The 2007 calendar year finished with another home game, but this time City lost 3–1 to Hereford United.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December, Tranmere {{earned an}} FA Cup Second Round home replay after a draw at Oxford United {{thanks to a}} late Jason Koumas goal.

A Max Power strike earned Tranmere victory in the next league game at Dagenham & Redbridge {{to climb out of}} the relegation zone. FA Cup replay brought Rovers another victory and a place in the Third Round thanks to Kayode Odejayi and Max Power goals. Tranmere almost hit a third consecutive league victory versus Cambridge United, but their 10-man rivals managed to equalise in the final minutes. The unbeaten run finally came to end with an away defeat to promotion contenders Burton Albion after Liam Ridehalgh was sent off following a foul in the penalty box {{in the middle of the}} first half. The game was also notable for the second Chris Shuker debut six <b>months</b> <b>after</b> <b>he</b> officially ended his career.
