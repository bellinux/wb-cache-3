50|$|The {{development}} of this lightweight rucksack led to an informal inquiry by officers of the infantry community as {{to the possibility of}} reducing the weight of the M-1956 Load-Carrying Equipment (LCE). As a result of this interest, the army produced a set of LCE in 1962, substituting available nylon materials for the cotton canvas duck. This set of nylon load-carrying equipment weighed slightly more than 3 lb as opposed to 5 lb for the cotton canvas duck items. These two items, the lightweight rucksack and the set of nylon LCE, formed the basis for that portion of the LINCLOE Quantitative <b>Material</b> <b>Requirement</b> dealing with load-carrying equipment. Annex A to the Quantitative <b>Material</b> <b>Requirement</b> set a goal of 3.3 lb for the individual load-carrying equipment and 3 lb for the rucksack. Officials decided that the design of the new load-carrying equipment would follow that of the standard load-carrying equipment with material changes from cotton canvas duck to nylon duck and replacement of the brass and steel hardware with aluminum or plastic items.|$|E

50|$|The MIPS method {{can be used}} {{to measure}} natural {{resource}} consumption in five categories, viz. abiotic and biotic resources, earth movements in agriculture and silviculture, water and air. Abiotic resources refer to non-renewable resources like minerals, fossil energy sources and soil excavations. Biotic resources refer to renewable resources like plant biomass. Earth movements include mechanical movements and erosion. Water includes surface, ground and deep ground water used by humans. Air is calculated when it is used in combustion processes or chemically or physically transformed.The concept of total <b>material</b> <b>requirement</b> (TMR) used in many cases used in macro-level statistics and it refers to sum of abiotic and biotic resources and erosion.|$|E

The General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) M93 Fox NBCRS (Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance System) {{vehicle is}} the US {{variant of the}} Fuchs 1 NBC reconnaissance vehicle. The requirement for a NBC reconnaissance vehicle, for use by US Forces in the European theatre, was first recognised and a three-phase programme initiated in the late 1980s. The {{first phase of the}} project involved the evaluation of three vehicles types; the Fuchs (M93) being selected in July 1989. Phase II of the programme, the Interim System Production (ISP) phase, resulted in the purchase of 48 vehicles. The Phase II vehicles were provided in two batches, one of eight vehicles and the other of 40. Phase II was completed in 1993. Phases III and IV would have included the US-licensed production of an additional 210 vehicles, supplementing the 48 already produced. In mid-1995, it was announced that the US Army had already received a previously unannounced batch of 60 ex-German Army vehicles for Operation Desert Storm. When in use by the US Army in the first Gulf War these were known by the XM93 designation. Due to downsizing of the US Army, the 210 vehicles to be purchased in Phases III and IV were not ordered. Under a number of contract awards from 1991 until around 2002, and through an interim XM931 designation, at least 128 vehicles were upgraded to M93A1 standard. From 2005, 31 vehicles were further upgraded in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to M93A1P1 standard. To support operations in the Southwest Asia (SWA) region, an Urgent <b>Material</b> <b>Requirement</b> (UMR) was issued covering various upgrades to P2 standard for the M93A1P1. The exact number of M93 Fox NBCRS in service with the US Armed Forces is not clear. It is thought that the fleet comprised 122 vehicles, though the exact mix of M93A1, M93A1P1 and M93A1P2 variants is unknown. The previous mix, , was 86 M93A1, 22 of the M93A1P1 and 14 M93A1P2, with upgrades from the earlier variants to the M93A1P2 standard ongoing. The M93 is expected to be replaced in US service by the Stryker NBCRV.|$|E
