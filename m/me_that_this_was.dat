500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems to me to be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, Herndon {{reunited with}} McBride and Thomas after meeting {{them at a}} party at the Handlebar-J Restaurant & Bar in Scottsdale, Arizona, to {{celebrate}} the club's 25th anniversary. After they performed [...] "No More Cryin'" [...] there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride, saying [...] "This thing in my gut was telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the right time for this." [...] The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with pianist and record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled Amarillo Sky, and released it in September of that year. Unlike previous albums, the band wrote most of the songs and played most of the instruments itself because, according to Thomas, [...] "Terry thought this would be even more of a band-like situation if we wrote together more. It would bring us even tighter as a unit." ...|$|E
500|$|Former UCLA {{professor}} of information studies Philip E. Agre and journalist Eric Boehlert argued that three articles in Wired News {{led to the}} creation of the widely spread urban legend that Gore claimed to have [...] "invented the Internet", which followed this interview. In addition, computer professionals and congressional colleagues argued in his defense. Internet pioneers Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn stated that [...] "we don't think, as some people have argued, that Gore intended to claim he 'invented' the Internet. Moreover, there is no question in our minds that while serving as Senator, Gore's initiatives had a significant and beneficial effect on the still-evolving Internet." [...] Cerf would later state: [...] "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956, which his father introduced as a military bill. It was very powerful. Housing went up, suburban boom happened, everybody became mobile. Al was attuned to the power of networking much more than any of his elective colleagues. His initiatives led directly to the commercialization of the Internet. So he really does deserve credit." [...] In a speech to the American Political Science Association, former Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Newt Gingrich also stated: [...] "In all fairness, it's something Gore had worked on a long time. Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is—and I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got , we were both part of a [...] "futures group"—the fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen." [...] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: [...] "I didn't ask him about the Internet. I asked him about the differences he had with Bill Bradley [...] Honestly, at the time, when he said it, it didn't dawn on <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> going to have the impact that it wound up having, because it was distorted to a certain degree and people said they took what he said, which was a carefully phrased comment about taking the initiative and creating the Internet to—I invented the Internet. And that was the sort of shorthand, the way his enemies projected it and it wound up being a devastating setback to him and it hurt him, as I'm sure he acknowledges to this very day." ...|$|E

He told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a better plan and found scholarship money {{for me to go}} to college." [...] Lamm also helped her overcome her family's initial misgivings.|$|E
2500|$|Later in the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama cited his {{crafting}} of {{this speech}} {{as an example}} of a [...] "gut decision". Speaking to journalist Joe Klein in October 2008, Obama said that he decided to make his response to Rev. Wright's comments [...] "big as opposed to make it small", and added: [...] "My gut was telling <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a teachable moment and that if I tried to do the usual political damage control instead of talking to the American people like ... they were adults and could understand the complexities of race, I would be not only doing damage to the campaign but missing an important opportunity for leadership." ...|$|E
2500|$|RC's {{system of}} {{centralised}} control has been deprecated by ex-members {{who would have}} preferred a more accountable leadership. John Heron, once an RC leader and teacher, who left the organization in 1974 to set up his own co-counseling organization, Co-Counselling International, said he parted company with RC because it [...] "systematically conditioned its members to associate {{a certain kind of}} beneficial human development with centralized authoritarian control of theory and community policy. It was clear to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> pseudo-liberation." [...] He considered that the authoritarianism of RC derived partly from the Leninist doctrines of central control that Jackins had learned in the Communist Party of America and partly from the autocratic example of his former associate L. Ron Hubbard.|$|E
