5000|$|Non-aligned Yugoslavia and its {{successor}} Balkan {{countries have}} had long and friendly relations with Libya since Josip Broz Tito's era, with cooperation ranging from civil engineering to military trade. In particular, many Yugoslav planes including Soko G-2 Galeb were exported to Libya, {{and some were}} shot down during imposing of a no-fly zone. In response to unconfirmed allegations that Gaddafi hired Serbian pilots and training officers {{during the early stages}} of the Libyan uprising, the Serbian Ministry of Defence denied that any of its active or retired personnel were participating in the events in Libya, calling the allegations [...] "total stupidity". Serbia has suspended all military trade with Libya, in accordance with UN resolution 1973. The rumors of Serbian and Ukrainian <b>military</b> <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> and helping Gaddafi forces have also been heard in Libya at the beginning of the conflict, and were reported by Al Jazeera from two Libyan colonels who defected to Malta. However, when asked by Serbian TV Pink, Gaddafi said that opposition forces tried to bribe a Serbian officer to say that he was mercenary for Gaddafi, which he refused, quoting this incident as an example of a failed war propaganda. Miroslav Lazanski, a military expert from ex-Yugoslavia, born in Slovenia but now based in Belgrade, claimed the allegations were nonsense, since Serbian pilots never flew the Sukhoi aircraft that comprised the backbone of the Libyan Air Force.|$|E

50|$|From the 1960s, most Corps {{officers}} were tertiary educated with many at the post-graduate level in either mapping or computer disciplines and <b>military</b> command and <b>staff</b> <b>training.</b> This {{was the key}} to understanding the potential, application and implementation of emerging technologies and techniques across all aspects of Corps capability. Corps soldier training was both broad within a trade, across Corps trades and specific to specialised equipment with military training for various levels of leadership. Officers and soldiers posted outside Corps positions were highly regarded. Until the 1970s the Corps sponsored and trained soldiers in trades other than the mapping related trades essential to its operations. These included drivers, storemen and clerks. After some rationalisation the Corps retained career and training responsibility for all mapping related trades, and also photographers (non-public relations), illustrators and projectionists who were posted mainly to training institutions and headquarters.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the factors inhibiting effective <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> at the councils of Temeke Municipality and Kisarawe District in Tanzania. A case study design was employed, with data collected from 47 respondents. The instruments used to collect data were questionnaires and secondary information sources. To report the findings, descriptive statistics was used. The data were validated using mean percentages. On the whole, the study findings identified lack of proper training policies and programmes, lack of or inadequate training fund allocation, lack of top management commitment towards <b>staff</b> <b>training,</b> coupled with malpractices such as favouritism and <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> fragmentation as the main factors inhibiting effective <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> in the study area. As a result, the study provides four recommendations aimed at redressing the situation. First, local government authorities should formulate clear <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> policies and provide well-designed training programmes. Second, local government authorities should increase their <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> budget allocations in addition to establishing a specific unit to oversee and co-ordinate <b>staff</b> <b>training</b> initiatives and all related matters. Third, the top management of such authorities should make an unwavering commitment to <b>staff</b> <b>training.</b> Four, the selection of training candidates {{should be based on}} the organisation’s assessed training needs and the suitability of those candidates to avoid malpractices of favouritism...|$|R
