5000|$|The first Lyric {{records were}} vertical-cut with an unusually narrow groove that {{required}} using steel needles, {{related to that}} used by British [...] "Marathon" [...] discs, which according to company publicity yielded a playing time of four-and-a-half <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> 10-inch <b>side</b> and seven <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> 12-inch <b>side.</b> Over 1000 titles were available by September 1917, including popular vocal, dance, operatic, and orchestral selections. J. Louis von der Mehden was the company's chief conductor, and his diaries (now at the University of Connecticut) detail recording sessions with a 40-player orchestra which he personally recruited, a much larger ensemble than most American recording groups. The recorded sound of Lyric vertical-cut discs is superior to most other contemporary American [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] records. From 1919 Lyric records were double-sided lateral-cut 10-inch discs which have slightly above-average sound quality for the era. The company went into receivership {{in the fall of}} 1921 and ceased operations sometime the following year.|$|R
25|$|Seeburg Corporation {{introduced}} the Seeburg Background Music System in 1959, using a rpm 9-inch record with 2-inch center hole. Each record held 40 <b>minutes</b> of music <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> recorded at 420 grooves per inch.|$|R
25|$|In the 78 era, classical-music and spoken-word items {{generally}} {{were released}} on the longer 12-inch 78s, about 4–5 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> For example, on June 10, 1924, {{four months after}} the February 12 premier of Rhapsody in Blue, George Gershwin recorded a drastically shortened version of the seventeen-minute work with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. It was released on two sides of Victor 55225 and ran for 8m59s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{size and}} format {{was that of}} radio {{transcription}} discs beginning in the 1940s. These records were usually vinyl, 33rpm, and 16inches in diameter. No home record player could accommodate such large records, and they were used mainly by radio stations. They were on average 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> and contained several songs or radio program material. These records became less common when tape recorders began being used for radio transcriptions around 1949.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{oil recovery}} equipment onboard Louhi {{is based on}} the same stiff brush technology that has been proved to be effective by the previous Finnish spill response vessels. The vessel is equipped with three different types of recovery systems developed and manufactured by Lamor, each suitable for specific weather conditions.

The male cones are solitary and erect, spindle shaped and cylindrical 15-23 long and 4-6 cm broad, with light yellow tomentose down and an erect apical spine with 1.2-2 cm sporophylls with 1-3 <b>minute</b> teeth <b>per</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|Members of the Auxiliary formed Recording for the Blind and {{transformed}} the attic of the New York Public Library into a studio, recording textbooks using then state-of-the-art six-inch vinyl SoundScriber phonograph discs that played approximately 12 <b>minutes</b> of material <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> In 1952, Macdonald established recording studios in seven additional {{cities across the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|These {{recordings}} {{were made}} in a time before the LP album, introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. Starting at approximately {{the turn of the}} 19th century into the 20th, recorded music arrived on the market {{in the form of a}} ten-inch gramophone record that played at 78 revolutions <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> two songs of generally no more than four <b>minutes</b> duration <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> The advent of radio increased demand for recorded music played in the home through the 1920s. However, during the Great Depression, home record sales decreased dramatically, but a relatively viable market still existed for the inexpensive play of records in jukeboxes, which had proliferated during the 1920s and 1930s. Initially, these records featuring Billie Holiday were made with that market in mind.|$|R
25|$|The Mutual network, on {{the other}} hand, had {{pre-recorded}} some of its programs {{as early as the}} 1938 run of The Shadow with Orson Welles. And the new ABC network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old NBC Blue Network in 1943 following a federal anti-trust action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by Philco. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer discs that played ten <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> at 33⅓ rpm.|$|E
25|$|Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis/atrophy by {{inhibition}} of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions. Botox injections {{are used in}} bruxism {{on the theory that}} a dilute solution of the toxin will partially paralyze the muscles and lessen their ability to forcefully clench and grind the jaw, while aiming to retain enough muscular function to enable normal activities such as talking and eating. This treatment typically involves five or six injections into the masseter and temporalis muscles, and less often into the lateral pterygoids (given the possible risk of decreasing the ability to swallow) taking a few <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> The effects may be noticeable by the next day, and they may last for about three months. Occasionally, adverse effects may occur, such as bruising, but this is quite rare. The dose of toxin used depends upon the person, and a higher dose may be needed in people with stronger muscles of mastication. With the temporary and partial muscle paralysis, atrophy of disuse may occur, meaning that the future required dose may be smaller or the length of time the effects last may be increased.|$|E

50|$|A 10-inch 78-rpm disc {{could hold}} about 3½ <b>minutes</b> of music <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> A 12-inch 78-rpm could last 4½ minutes. Early albums had to {{severely}} abridge selections {{to fit the}} format.

For example, reprises, or minor songs might not be included.|$|R
50|$|Although the micro{{cassette}} uses tape {{thinner than}} the C90 compact cassette (the width is the same), {{much of its}} reduced size comes from using shorter tapes at slower recording speeds. The original standard MC60 microcassette contained 43.2 m (142') of tape for 30 <b>minutes</b> recording <b>per</b> <b>side</b> at 2.4 cm/s (about 15⁄16 ips, making it half the standard speed of a compact cassette). Most recorders also provide a slower speed of 1.2 cm/s, doubling the recording time but with poor sound quality. The only other common sizes are the MC30 with half the length of slightly thicker tape, and the MC90 with 50% more tape length then the MC60, and correspondingly thinner tape.|$|R
50|$|VHD discs are 25 cm in diameter, {{and store}} up to 60 <b>minutes</b> of video <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> Each disc {{is stored in}} a caddy—like the CED system from RCA, also known as SelectaVision VideoDisc, the user never handled the disc directly. The entire caddy is {{inserted}} into the player, and then withdrawn, leaving the disc inside {{where it will be}} loaded and start playing. At the end of the side the disc must be removed, turned over and re-inserted.|$|R
2500|$|Terms such as [...] "long-play" [...] (LP) and [...] "extended-play" [...] (EP) {{describe}} multi-track {{records that}} play {{much longer than}} the single-item-per-side records, which typically do not go much past four <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> An LP can play for up to 30 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> though most played for about 22 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> bringing the total playing time of a typical LP recording to about forty-five minutes. Many pre-1952 LPs, however, played for about 15 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> The 7-inch 45rpm format normally contains one item per side but a 7-inch EP could achieve recording times of 10 to 15 minutes {{at the expense of}} attenuating and compressing the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were generally used to make available tracks not on singles including tracks on LPs albums in a smaller, less expensive format for those who had only 45rpm players. The large center hole on 7-inch 45rpm records allows for easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. The term [...] "album", originally used to mean a [...] "book" [...] with liner notes, holding several 78rpm records each in its own [...] "page" [...] or sleeve, no longer has any relation to the physical format: a single LP record, or nowadays more typically a compact disc.|$|E
2500|$|Tape length {{usually is}} {{measured}} in minutes of total playing time. The most popular varieties are C46 (23 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side),</b> C60 (30 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side),</b> C90, and C120. The C46 and C60 lengths typically are [...] thick, but C90s are [...] and (the less common) C120s are just [...] thick, rendering them more susceptible to stretching or breakage. BASF declared the C60 with [...] Some vendors are more generous than others, providing [...] rather than [...] of tape for a C90 cassette. Even C180 tapes were available at one time, but these were extremely thin and fragile and suffered from such effects as print-through, which made them unsuitable for general use. 150 minute length is still available from Maxell (UR 150), Sony (CDixI 150) and TDK (TDK AE 150).|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} size of LaserDisc was 30 cm. These {{approximated}} {{the size of}} 12 in LP vinyl records. These discs allowed for 30/36 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> (CAV NTSC/PAL) or 60/64 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> (CLV NTSC/PAL). The vast majority of programming for the LaserDisc format was produced on these discs.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{record changer}} was the [...] "Automatic Orthophonic" [...] model by the Victor Talking Machine Company, which {{was launched in}} the United States in 1927. [...] On a conventional gramophone or phonograph, the limited playing time of 78 rpm gramophone records (averaging a little over four <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> 12" [...] <b>side,</b> and a little over three <b>per</b> 10" [...] <b>side)</b> meant that listeners {{had to get up}} to change records at regular intervals. The Automatic Orthophonic allowed the listener to load a stack of several records into the machine, which would then be automatically played in sequence for a much longer uninterrupted listening time.|$|R
25|$|In 1931, RCA Victor {{launched}} the first commercially available vinyl long-playing record, marketed as program-transcription discs. These revolutionary discs {{were designed for}} playback at rpm and pressed on a 30cm diameter flexible plastic disc, {{with a duration of}} about ten <b>minutes</b> playing time <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression. Because of financial hardships that plagued the recording industry during that period (and RCA's own parched revenues), Victor's long-playing records were discontinued by early 1933.|$|R
50|$|The {{long period}} of development—caused in part by {{political}} turmoil {{and a great deal}} of turnover in the high command of RCA—also contributed to the demise of the CED system. RCA had originally slated the videodisc system for a 1977 release. However, the discs were still not able to hold more than thirty <b>minutes</b> of video <b>per</b> <b>side,</b> and the nickel-like material used by RCA to make discs was not sturdy enough to put into manufacturing. Signal degradation was also an issue, as the handling of the discs was causing them to deteriorate more rapidly than expected, baffling engineers.|$|R

50|$|In any case, the {{standard}} 45-minute playing {{time of the}} LP was a significant improvement over that of the previous dominant format, the 78 rpm single, which was generally limited to three to four minutes. At around 14 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> for 10-inch and 23 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> <b>side</b> for 12-inch, LPs provided a satisfactory time to enjoy a recording before needing to rotate a disc.|$|E

50|$|LP records rarely {{exceeded}} 45 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> disc (both <b>sides),</b> with a {{limit in}} the early years of 52 minutes, due to mastering issues. By the 1960s-1970s, some records began to exceeded the 52-minute limitation, with single albums going to as long as 90 minutes in some cases. However, such records had to be cut with much narrower spacing between the grooves, which allowed for a much smaller amount of dynamic range on the records, and meant that playing the record with a worn needle could damage the record. It also resulted in a much quieter sound. Spoken word, comedy and sound effects albums, not having a wide range of musical instrumentation to reproduce, can be cut with much narrower spacing between the grooves resulting in lengths considerably in excess of 52 minutes. Materials distributed on 10-inch discs by the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in the 1960s, for instance, commonly reached 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> disc at 16 RPM and 180 <b>minutes</b> <b>per</b> disc at 8 RPM.|$|R
25|$|The {{playing time}} of a {{phonograph}} record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78rpm record could hold about three <b>minutes</b> of sound <b>per</b> <b>side</b> and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.|$|R

5000|$|An 1894 78 rpm record called [...] "The Spirit of '76", a narrated musical {{vignette}} with martial fife-and-drum {{that gets}} louder as it 'nears' the listener and quieter as it 'moves away'. There are early examples {{that appear to}} bear no obvious relationship to movement. One is [...] "Barkin' Dog" [...] (1919) by the Ted Lewis Jazz Band. Another contender is [...] "America" [...] (1918), a patriotic piece by the chorus of evangelist Billy Sunday. By the early 1930s longer songs were being put {{on both sides of}} records, with the piece fading {{out at the end of}} Side One and fading back in at the beginning of Side Two. Records at the time held only about two to five <b>minutes</b> of music <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> The segue allowed for longer songs (such as Count Basie's [...] "Miss Thing"), symphonies and live concert recordings.|$|R
5000|$|Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic (RFBD, later renamed Learning Ally) {{was founded}} in 1948 by Anne T. Macdonald, {{a member of the}} New York Public Library's Women's Auxiliary, in {{response}} to an influx of inquiries from soldiers who had lost their sight in combat during World War II. The newly passed GI Bill of Rights guaranteed a college education to all veterans, but texts were mostly inaccessible to the recently blinded veterans, who did not read Braille and had little access to live readers. Macdonald mobilized the women of the Auxiliary under the motto [...] "Education is a right, not a privilege". Members of the Auxiliary transformed the attic of the New York Public Library into a studio, recording textbooks using then state-of-the-art six-inch vinyl SoundScriber phonograph discs that played approximately 12 <b>minutes</b> of material <b>per</b> <b>side.</b> In 1952, Macdonald established recording studios in seven additional cities across the United States.|$|R
5000|$|CLV: Constant linear {{velocity}} or Extended Play discs {{do not have}} the [...] "trick play" [...] features of CAV, offering only simple playback on all but the high-end LaserDisc players incorporating a digital frame store. These high-end LaserDisc players could add features not normally available to CLV discs such as variable forward and reverse, and a VCR-like [...] "pause". By gradually slowing down their rotational speed (1,800-600 rpm) CLV encoded discs could store 60 <b>minutes</b> of audio/video <b>per</b> <b>side</b> for NTSC (64 minutes for PAL), or two hours per disc. For films with a run-time less than 120 minutes, this meant they could fit on one disc, lowering the cost of the title and eliminating the distracting exercise of [...] "getting up to change the disc", at least for those who owned a dual-sided player. The vast majority of titles were only available in CLV (a few titles were released partly CLV, partly CAV. For example, a 140-minute movie could fit on two CLV sides and one CAV side, thus allowing for the CAV-only features during the climax of the film).|$|R
