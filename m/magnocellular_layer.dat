Many retrograde labeling experiments using macaques, for example, have linked parasol and midget retinal ganglion cells with the magnocellular and parvocellular pathways respectively. In addition, similar studies have led to theories underlying color opponency. Research by Dacey (1996) supports this idea where in vitro primate retinal cells were treated with dye fillings. Parasol cells of the magnocellular pathway were found to be achromatic. In other studies, new world monkeys, such as marmosets, have aided in the current understanding of spatial and temporal frequency of the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layer</b> in the LGN.

5000|$|Blindsight is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} individual sustains damage to the primary visual cortex and as a result, loses sight in that corresponding visual field. Patients, however, are able to detect stimuli in that damaged visual field which attributes the [...] "sight" [...] portion in the term blindsight. Mosby's Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing & Health Professions defines the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as [...] "one of two elevations of the lateral posterior thalamus receiving visual impulses from the retina via the optic nerves and tracts and relaying the impulses to the calcarine (visual) cortex". In particular, the magnocellular system of the LGN is less affected by the removal of V1 which suggests that it is because of this system in the LGN that blindsight occurs. [...] This quote suggests that the LGN is what is responsible for the causation of blindsight. Although damage to the primary visual cortex (V1) is what causes blindsight, the still functioning magnocellular system of the LGN is what causes the sight in blindsight. According to Valentin Dragoi of The University of Texas Medical School at Houston, the LGN is made up of 6 layers including layers 1 & 2 which are part of the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers.</b> The cells in these layers behave like that of M-retinal ganglion cells, are most sensitive to movement of visual stimuli [...] and have large centre-surround receptive fields.

The optic nerve is considered the main pathological target for LHON. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} possible involvement of the post-geniculate visual pathway in LHON patients. We used diffusion-weighted imaging for in vivo evaluation. Mean diffusivity maps from 22 LHON visually impaired, 11 unaffected LHON mutation carriers and 22 healthy subjects were generated and compared at level of optic radiation (OR). Prefrontal and cerebellar white matter were also analyzed as internal controls. Furthermore, we studied the optic nerve and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in post-mortem specimens obtained from a severe case of LHON compared to an age-matched control. Mean diffusivity values of affected patients were higher than unaffected mutation carriers (P< 0. 05) and healthy subjects (P< 0. 01) in OR and not in the other brain regions. Increased OR diffusivity was associated with both disease duration (B =  0. 002; P< 0. 05) and lack of recovery of visual acuity (B =  0. 060; P< 0. 01). Post-mortem investigation detected atrophy (41. 9 % decrease of neuron soma size in the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> and 44. 7 % decrease in the parvocellular layers) and, to a lesser extent, degeneration (28. 5 % decrease of neuron density in the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> and 28. 7 % decrease in the parvocellular layers) in the LHON LGN associated with extremely severe axonal loss (99 %) in the optic nerve. The post-geniculate involvement in LHON patients is a downstream post-synaptic secondary phenomenon, reflecting de-afferentation rather than a primary neurodegeneration due to mitochondrial dysfunction of LGN neurons...|$|R

The intervals of high (Tc) and low (Tu) correlation varied from 14 to 224 ms in steps of 14 ms. Depth detection and vergence responses behaved very different from each other as functions of Tc and Tu. The different behaviours suggest that depth and vergence most likely result from independent streams of disparity processing. It is speculated that <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> process disparities that drive vergence and that a parvocellular stream of disparity processing is involved in depth perception.

40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} was {{deposited in}} the optic nerve to retrogradely label and reveal the dendritic form of all classes of ganglion cell, or it was injected into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to reveal only those classes projecting to the thalamus. The results were {{compared with those of}} the accompanying paper in which the ganglion cells projecting to the midbrain are selectively revealed. Two major classes of ganglion cells are described, the P alpha and P beta cells. For both classes dendritic field size increases with eccentricity from the fovea and there is no overlap in the two classes at any given eccentricity. Cell body size shows a similar mean difference but with a slight overlap. Both cell bodies and dendritic fields are larger along the temporal horizontal meridian than the nasal horizontal meridian, for P alpha and for P beta cells, but these differences are reduced when naso-temporal differences in ganglion cell density are taken into account, that is, size correlates closely with density. Injections restricted to the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus labelled almost exclusively P beta cells, whereas injections confined to the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> labelled almost exclusively P alpha cells. As midbrain injections label no P beta cells and few P alpha cells it can be shown that about 80 % of ganglion cells are P beta cells projecting to parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus, and that about 10 % are P alpha cells projecting to <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers.</b> The coverage factor, that is the number of cells covering each point on the retina, varied from 1. 9 - 2. 3 for P beta cells, and from 2 - 7 for P alpha cells. Comparing the results with those of comparable investigations on cats and rabbits shows a much clearer segregation of the terminal targets of different classes of ganglion cell in monkeys, the greatest difference being the absence in the monkey of a projection to the geniculate from gamma- and epsilon-like cells. Further, axons which branch and innervate both thalamus and midbrain are rare in monkeys but common in other mammals.

We found no specific impairments in task-switching in dyslexics. However, dyslexics performed generally much more slowly across all conditions than normal readers. We conclude that while dyslexics have a problem with attentional switching at a perceptual level, their capacity to rapidly switch between tasks is normal.

40|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain the evolution of species differences in brain size, but no consensus has emerged. One unresolved question is whether brain size differences {{are a result of}} neural specializations or of biological constraints affecting the whole brain. Here I show that, among primates, brain size variation is associated with visual specialization. Primates with large brains for their body size have relatively expanded visual brain areas, including the primary visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus. Within the visual system, it is, in particular, one functionally specialized pathway upon which selection has acted: evolutionary changes in the number of neurons in parvocellular, but not <b>magnocellular,</b> <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus are correlated with changes in both brain size and ecological variables (diet and social group size). Given the known functions of the parvocellular pathway, these results suggest that the relatively large brains of frugivorous species are products of selection on the ability to perceive and select fruits using specific visual cues such as colour. The separate correlation between group size and visual brain evolution, on the other hand, may indicate the visual basis of social information processing in the primate brain...|$|R

The majority of the axons innervating the four parvocellular laminae were red/green opponent color units; their terminations formed cylindrical columns that were perpendicular to the layers. In similar fashion, the geniculate cells in the parvocellular layers were mostly red/green units with narrow, bipolar dendritic fields oriented normal to the laminar borders. The majority of the retinal axons ending in parvocellular layers 6 and 5 were on-center units; nearly all geniculate cells in these two laminae were also on-center neurons. In layers 4 and 3 most terminating optic-tract fibers, as well as the geniculate cells themselves, were off-center units. All axons projecting to the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> were broad-band units with spherical terminal arborizations.

Comparison of the resulting activity maps revealed attention-dependent changes in metabolic activity in portions of the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the magnocellular-recipient layers 4 C and 4 B of the striate cortex. In these early stages of the visual system, attention to the orientation of the grating suppressed the metabolic activity in a retinotopically specific band peripheral to the representation of the stimulus. These results favor an early selection model of attention. After a thalamic attention-dependent gating mechanism, irrelevant visual information outside the focus of attention may be suppressed {{at the level of the}} striate cortex, which would then result in an increased signal-to-noise ratio for the processing of the attended feature in higher-tier, less retinotopically organized, extrastriate visual areas. status: publishe...|$|R

The parvocellular layers of the LGN are involved in color vision. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a 6 -layered LGN is a shared-derived trait among catarrhines. This might suggest that in gibbons the lack of further subdivisions of the parvocellular layers is a recent change, and could be related to specializations of visual information processing in this taxon. To address these hypotheses, the lamination of the LGN was investigated in a range of catarrhine species, including several taxa not previously described, and the evolution of the LGN was reconstructed using phylogenetic information. The findings indicate that while all catarrhine species have 4 parvocellular leaflets, two main patterns of LGN parvocellular lamination occur: 2 undivided parvocellular layers in some species, and 4 parvocellular leaflets (with occasional subleaflets) in other species. LGN size was not found to be related to lamination pattern. Both patterns were found to occur in divergent clades, which is suggestive of homoplasy within the catarrhines in LGN morphology...|$|R

However, it remains unclear how synchronized firing affects the large-scale patterns of activity and redundancy of visual signals in a complete population of neurons. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of retinal ganglion cells in primate retina, and examined synchronized firing in completely sampled populations of � 50 – 100 ON-parasol cells, which form a major projection to the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Synchronized firing in pairs of cells was a subset {{of a much larger}} pattern of activity that exhibited local, isotropic spatial properties. However, a simple model based solely on interactions between adjacent cells reproduced 99 % of the spatial structure and scale of synchronized firing. No more than 20 % of the variability in firing of an individual cell was predictable from the activity of its neighbors. These results held both for spontaneous firing and in the presence of independent visual modulation of the firing of each cell. In sum, large-scale synchronized firing in the entire population of ON-parasol cells appears to reflect simple neighbor interactions, rather than a unique visual signal or a highly redundant coding scheme...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 In {{visual area}} V 2, {{cytochrome}} oxidase (CO) histochemistry reveals {{a pattern of}} alternating densely labeled thick and thin stripes separated by lightly labeled interstripe regions. These stripe-like compartments have been related to three separate cortico-cortical pathways, which may be involved with different aspects of visual processing. In the first experiment, we examined whether the tangential distribution of cells projecting to the superior colliculus bear {{a relationship with the}} CO stripes in V 2. The cortico-tectal pathway is thought to be functionally specific, extending from <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). From previous evidence that V 2 thick stripes are closely associated with the <b>magnocellular</b> LGN <b>layers,</b> we predicted that V 2 neurons projecting to the superior colliculus would preferentially reside in thick stripe regions. Our results bore out this prediction. These data support the idea that the stripe-like compartments in V 2 represent separate functional pathways, and extend the notion of segregated cortico-cortical pathways to cortico-subcortical projections. In the second experiment, we compared the distribution of interhemispheric connections in V 2 with the pattern of CO stripes. We found that V 2 callosal connections tend to accumulate within a continuous band along the V 1 /V 2 border from which callosal cells cluster within finger-like extensions within thin and thick stripe regions in V 2 up to 7 - 8 mm from the V 1 border. Our findings extend the notion of segregated cortico-cortical pathways to interhemispheric connections. In addition, different from the pattern of intracortical connections, our results suggest that few cells within interstripe regions in V 2 send connections to V 2 or other extrastriate areas in the contralateral hemisphere. In the third experiment we examined the pattern of callosal linkages in V 2. Based on previous data on the visual field map in V 2, callosal connections could link representations of the visual field located away from the vertical meridian. We examined whether the pattern of V 2 callosal linkages supports this idea. The results demonstrate that callosal connections preferentially link corresponding regions between areas V 2. These data support the hypothesis that V 2 callosal connections mediate interactions between visual field representations located away from the vertical meridian...|$|R

Two VGLUT isoforms, VGLUT 1 and VGLUT 2, are known to characterize complementary distributions of glutamatergic neurons in the rodent brain, which suggests that they are each responsible for unique circuits of excitatory transmission. In rodents, VGLUT 2 is primarily utilized in thalamocortical circuits, and is strongly expressed in the primary sensory nuclei, including all areas of the visual thalamus. The distribution of VGLUT 2 in the visual thalamus and midbrain has yet to be characterized in primate species. Thus, the present study describes the expression of VGLUT 2 mRNA and protein across the visual thalamus and superior colliculus of prosimian galagos to provide a better understanding of glutamatergic transmission in the primate brain. VGLUT 2 is strongly expressed in all six layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and much less so in the intralaminar zones, which correspond to retinal and superior collicular inputs, respectively. The parvocellular and <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> expressed VGLUT 2 mRNA more densely than the koniocellular layers. A patchy distribution of VGLUT 2 positive terminals in the pulvinar complex possibly reflects inputs from the superior colliculus. The upper superficial granular layers of the superior colliculus, with inputs from the retina, most densely expressed VGLUT 2 protein, while the lower superficial granular layers, with projections to the pulvinar, most densely expressed VGLUT 2 mRNA. The results are consistent with the conclusion that retinal and superior colliculus projections to the thalamus depend highly on the VGLUT 2 transporter, as do cortical projections from the <b>magnocellular</b> and parvocellular <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus and neurons of the pulvinar complex.

As a result, magnocellular signals might reach cerebral cortex appreciably before parvocellular signals. The relative speed {{of these two}} channels cannot be accurately predicted based solely on axon conduction speeds, however. Other factors, such as different degrees of convergence in the magnocellular and parvocellular channels and the retinal circuits that feed them, can affect {{the time it takes}} for magnocellular and parvocellular signals to activate cortical neurons. We have investigated the relative timing of visual responses mediated by the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. We recorded individually from 78 magnocellular and 80 parvocellular neurons in the LGN of two anesthetized monkeys. Visual response latencies were measured for small spots of light of various intensities. Over a wide range of stimulus intensities the fastest magnocellular response latencies preceded the fastest parvocellular response latencies by about 10 ms. Because parvocellular neurons are far more numerous than magnocellular neurons, convergence in cortex could reduce the magnocellular advantage by allowing parvocellular signals to generate detectable responses sooner than expected based on the responses of individual parvocellular neurons. An analysis based on a simple model using neurophysiological data collected from the LGN shows that convergence in cortex could eliminate or reverse the magnocellular advantage. This observation calls into question inferences that have been made about ordinal relationships of neurons based on timing of responses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVisual evoked {{potentials}} (VEPs) {{produced by}} pattern reversal {{were compared with}} those elicited by onset of motion in 37 amblyopic children (20 with anisometropic amblyopia, seven with strabismic amblyopia and 10 with both anisometropia and strabismus). The amplitudes and peak latencies of the main P 1 peak in the pattern-reversal VEP and of the motion-specific N 2 peak in the motion-onset VEP through the amblyopic eye were compared with those through the normal fellow eye. Regardless {{of the type of}} amblyopia, the amplitude of the pattern-reversal VEP for full-field stimulation was significantly smaller and its latency significantly longer through the amblyopic eye (P < 0. 001). In contrast, neither the amplitudes nor the latencies of the N 2 motion-onset VEPs differed significantly between amblyopic and non-amblyopic eyes. For pattern-reversal VEPs through the amblyopic eyes, the extent to which amplitude was reduced and latency prolonged correlated well with the reduction of visual acuity, whereas the amplitudes and latencies of motion-onset VEPs did not vary with visual acuity. Even for stimuli restricted to the central visual field (5 or 2 deg diameter) or to the peripheral field (excluding the central 5 deg), motion-onset responses were indistinguishable through the two eyes, while pattern-reversal responses always differed significantly in amplitude. These results suggest that the source of motion-onset VEPs (probably an extrastriate motion-sensitive area) is less affected in amblyopia than that of pattern-reversal VEPs (probably the striate cortex). The motion pathway, presumably deriving mainly from the <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of the lateral geniculate nucleus, may be relatively spared in amblyopia...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of MRI-visible paramagnetic tracers to reveal in vivo connectivity can provide important subject-specific information for multisite, multielectrode intracortical recordings in combined behavioral and physiology experiments. To establish {{the use of}} such tracers in the nonhuman primate, we recently compared the specificity of the anterograde tracer Mn 2 + with that of wheat-germ-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) in experiments tracing the neuronal connections of the basal ganglia of the monkey. It was shown that Mn 2 + and WGA-HRP yield the same projection patterns and that the former tracer crosses at least two synapses, for it could be found in thalamus following injections into the striatum. Here we provide evidence that Mn 2 + reaches the cortex following striatum injections and, thus, is transferred even further than previously shown. In other words, used as a paramagnetic MRI tracer, Mn 2 + can permit the visualization of neural networks covering at least four processing st ages. Moreover, unilateral intravitreal injections show that Mn 2 + is sufficiently synapse specific to permit visualization of the lamina of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Interestingly, the transfer rate of the substance reflected the well-known axonal size differences between the parvocellular and <b>magnocellular</b> <b>layers</b> of dLGN. After intravitreal injections, we were able to demonstrate transfer of Mn 2 + into several subcortical and cortical areas, including the inferotemporal cortex. The specificity of the transsynaptic transfer of manganese that we report here indicates the value of this tracer for chronic studies of development and plasticity, as well as for studies of brain pathology...|$|R
