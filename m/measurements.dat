5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. Preliminary astrometric <b>measurements</b> made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63.1Â° to {{the plane of the}} sky, which would imply a true mass 12% greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity <b>measurements.</b> However, subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos <b>measurements</b> are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions, and the true inclination of the orbit (and hence the true mass) are regarded as unknown.|$|E
5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} <b>measurements,</b> a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later <b>measurements.</b> Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. <b>Measurements</b> of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

40|$|<b>Measurement</b> {{theories}} in psychology may be classified {{in terms of}} whether they begin from a general <b>measurement</b> framework or from a specific area of <b>measurement.</b> Points of contact between theories and different specific <b>measurement</b> areas have been limited by the choice of focus in discussions of general <b>measurement</b> theories and specific theories or models. This presentation outlines a metatheoretical framework that begins with the obvious common factor in all areas, the standard system of <b>measurement.</b> Just as a standard is a commonly accepted unit of <b>measurement,</b> a standard system is a commonly accepted mechanism of <b>measurement</b> for a given area. The concept of a standard system amplifies general definitions of <b>measurement</b> and clarifies metatheoretical statements concerning the requirements for <b>measurement.</b> Differences between <b>measurement</b> situations may be categorized by the type of standard system used and by features of the attribute measured. Identification of different standard systems and elements of the <b>measurement</b> process provides a focus for comparisons between <b>measurement</b> theories and models in different <b>measurement</b> situations.

With the increasing requirements of manufacturing technology of time, the matching image <b>measurement</b> technology is bound to advance to a higher level. Combined with the development of image <b>measurement</b> technology and the current situation in the field of <b>measurement,</b> it can be expected that the image <b>measurement</b> technology will show the following trends: The <b>measurement</b> accuracy has developed from micron to nano-scale, the <b>measurement</b> range has been extended from length to area <b>measurement</b> to shape recognition, and the <b>measurement</b> method has been advanced from off-line <b>measurement</b> to real-time online <b>measurement.</b> The <b>measurement</b> system moves from a single <b>measurement</b> function to an intelligent and automatic system that integrates <b>measurement</b> and control. In short, image <b>measurement</b> technology must achieve high accuracy, high speed, and high efficiency. Therefore, the intelligent <b>measurement</b> system with fast measuring speed, high precision, and high efficiency will become an important developing direction of image <b>measurement</b> technology in the future.|$|R

With reference to the SDM, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical <b>measurement</b> structure including three layers and provides the network <b>measurement</b> reconfiguration model (NMRM). The NMRM decouples the <b>measurement</b> requirement from the <b>measurement</b> resources and supplies an ability of reconfiguration of network <b>measurement</b> by composing the <b>measurement</b> resources according to some <b>measurement</b> requirement dynamically.

40|$|This study emphasises {{the fact}} that the {{objectives}} of the financial statements are not compatible with the principles that establish <b>measurement</b> in the social sciences, and that they therefore cannot be considered to be <b>measurement</b> objectives.

5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic <b>measurements</b> of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential <b>measurements</b> of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. Finely detailed <b>measurements</b> of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first <b>measurements</b> of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening â effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar <b>measurements</b> have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to discuss a {{possible}} way forward in accounting <b>measurement.</b> It also highlights the importance of understanding the lack of appreciation given by the accounting researchers to the distinction between representation <b>measurement</b> theory and the axioms of quantity on which the classical theory of <b>measurement</b> is based. For long, research in <b>measurement</b> theory has classified representational <b>measurement</b> as nothing but applications of the axioms of quantity. It was believed that there is in existence a single approach to <b>measurement</b> theory. However, recent studies in <b>measurement</b> theory have shown that there are two sides to <b>measurement</b> theory; one side at the interface with experimental science which is emphasized in representational <b>measurement</b> and the other side at the interface with quantitative theory which is emphasized in the classical <b>measurement</b> theory. Research in accounting <b>measurement</b> has concentrated on establishing a representational based accounting <b>measurement</b> theory. This has been done under the premise that no <b>measurement</b> theory exists in the discipline. Thus, this viewpoint neglects the concepts of classical <b>measurement</b> theory that already exists in the accounting discipline. Moreover, this created misunderstandings in accounting with regard to whether a theory of <b>measurement</b> exists in the discipline. This study highlights that the accounting concept of <b>measurement</b> was conceived under the principles of the classical <b>measurement</b> theory. Therefore this reason, it is suggested that research and improvements to the accounting <b>measurement</b> concept should be made in the light of the already existing principles of the classical theory of <b>measurement</b> in which the accounting concept of <b>measurement</b> was conceived.
