40|$|As Belgium {{has a long}} 'nematological tradition', the Belgian nematofauna {{has been}} {{relatively}} well studied. Within the terrestrial nematodes, the economically important plant parasitic nematodes belonging to the order Tylenchida have been profoundly examined. However, recently, greater {{attention was paid to}} the more natural habitats and non- conventional crops such as orchards (Bert & Geraert, 2000). In this study and other studies fourteen species were found that were not yet recorded for the Belgian fauna. As a result the review of the nematofauna of Belgium (Coomans, 1989) could be updated. This review discussed the nematological history in Belgium and provided a species listing up to 1989. We have added the species belonging to the order Tylenchida that have not yet been mentioned in this listing and species recorded after 1989. Furthermore this list is adapted to recent nomenclatural changes. A literature study in combination with our findings resulted in several amendments and adaptations of the nematofauna list of Belgium (Coomans, 1989) : 6 out of 119 species were removed because of a synonimisation with another species of the nematofauna list, 16 species were synonimised and presented with the correct nomenclature and 27 species were added (Table 1.) Within the new records for the Belgian nematofauna, Hirschmanniella loofi (Fig 1.), proved to be a European community quarantine organism (PART A: harmful organisms whose introduction into, and spread within all member states shall be banned / Section I: harmful organisms not known to occur in any part of the community and relevant for the entire community). This species was however found in a semi- natural habitat (Bourgoyen-Ossemeersen, Ghent) close to a stand of Phragmites australis. Furthermore, this species was found to have a European distribution (Germany, The Netherlands & Poland) in more or less natural conditions. We suppose a wide distribution of this species through Europe without <b>manifest</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> Consequently this species can be removed from the European community quarantine list...|$|E
40|$|The {{greening}} {{of roots}} and leaves {{has been studied}} in whole oat seedlings grown on White's medium either with or without 2 % sucrose. The added nutrient promotes chlorophyll synthesis and chloroplast differentiation in the roots. Yet it <b>manifests</b> a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> in the foliar tissues where it accelerates the decline in chlorophyll {{as well as the}} chloroplast ultrastructural alterations usually associated with senescence. The <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of the nutrient in the leaves is probably a consequence of the addition of exogenous sucrose to the endogenous sugars produced by photosynthesis. The foliar tissues would therefore be in the presence of high sucrose concentrations, which are known to be harmful for the photosynthetic apparatus.

As there is no unit of measurement to determine the scale of this phenomenon, comparative studies are chosen most often for the areas concerned. The present paper describes a study focused on all counties in Romania, Bucharest included. The purpose {{of this research is}} to establish the determinant factors that influence the size and spread of corruption, as it <b>manifests</b> strong <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on the society we live in. Thus, using a set of regressions over the main variables, some correlation coefficients have been set, which after processing rendered a ranking of all the 42 analysed territorial units, sorted by the estimated size of corruption. The whole scientific approach was completed with a map of corruption, which synthesizes and presents the corruption spread nationwid...|$|R

It deals primarily with child obesity and investigates obesity impact on life quality of individuals. The aim of this work was to <b>manifest</b> a <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of obesity and overweight on health of the population. The theoretic part of the thesis deals with obesity definition, methods of measurement, treatment options and time trends {{with an emphasis on}} the situation in the Czech Republic. Effects of overweight and obesity on humans are analysed on the basis of expert studies. The obesity increases mortality and morbidity levels and the risk may increase if the prevalence grows. The analytical part of the work deals with the examination of survey data for children and adults. Statistical methods of correlation and regression were used for the analytical purpose.

The higher is the extent of the phenomenon of tax evasion, the more the public finances of a State will suffer. If this phenomenon is joined by a weak economy and a shaky fiscal system, the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> are augmented. It should also be pointed out another important aspect of feeble public finances: chances are that fiscal bodies to act in that tough situation under emergency and pressure status and to deceive this tension on the economy, making it more unfit to uphold degraded public finances...|$|R
40|$|Soybean {{flour and}} wheat germ {{are the two}} most {{important}} protein components of wheat germ-based insect artificial diets. The effect of modifying the proportion of these two ingredients in a Noctuidae-specific diet was investigated utilizing the tobacco budworm Heliothis virescens (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), with the goal of developing a suboptimal diet that, without drastically affecting this insect's growth and reproductive rates, could <b>manifest</b> subtle <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in this insect. The original diet formula contained 2. 51 % protein. When the proportions of soybean flour and wheat germ were changed to 2. 15 % protein the net reproductive rate of the first generation was significantly lower. In the second generation, the net reproductive rate, development time, percent female survivorship, fertility, intrinsic rate of increase, finite rate of increase and female longevity were significantly lower in both the 2. 15 % and 2. 26 % protein diets. The survival rate of immatures to the adult stage was 1 % in the 2. 05 % protein diet in the first generation. Interestingly, females exposed to these suboptimal diets produced a significantly higher number of eggs but the survival of their larvae was significantly reduced. It is evident from these results that modifications to the protein content and the nutrient composition profile of the original wheat germ-based insect artificial formula can be used to produce subtle <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> on the growth of tobacco budworm...|$|R
40|$|Several oligo(p-phenylene-vinylene) {{oligomers}} capped with a guanosine or a guanine moiety {{have been}} prepared via a palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Their self-assembly, in both the absence and presence of alkaline salts, has been studied by means of different techniques in solution (NMR, MS, UV-vis, CD, fluorescence), solid state (X-ray diffraction), and on surfaces (STM, AFM). When no salt is added, these p-conjugated molecules self-associate {{in a mixture of}} hydrogen-bonded oligomers, among which the G-quartet structure may be predominant if the steric hindrance around the guanine base becomes important. In contrast, in the presence of sodium or potassium salts, well-defined assemblies of eight functional molecules (8 mers) can be formed selectively and quantitatively. In these assemblies, the p-conjugated oligomers are maintained in a chirally tilted (J-type) stacking arrangement, which is <b>manifested</b> by <b>negative</b> Cotton <b>effects,</b> small bathochromic absorption and emission shifts, and fluorescence enhancements. Furthermore, these self-assembled organic nanostructures, 1. 5 - 2. 0 nm high and 8. 5 nm wide, exhibit an extraordinary stability to temperature or concentration changes in apolar media, and they can be transferred and imaged over solid substrates as individual nanoparticles, showing no significant dissociation or further aggregation...|$|R

To investigate whether poor sperm parameters can influence embryo development, we examined the development of ICSI-fertilized embryos to the blastocyst stage. We present results of blastocyst development from supernumerary ICSI embryos after co-culture on monkey kidney epithelial cells. In addition, we compare the development of supernumerary embryos to the blastocyst stage after ICSI and in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Of 168 supernumerary ICSI embryos, 45 (26. 8 %) developed to blastocysts. Sperm concentration and morphology did not influence blastocyst development. In contrast, blastocysts arose from spermatozoa that had a significantly higher (P = 0. 015) forward progressive motility compared with spermatozoa from those patients who failed to produce blastocysts (42. 7 % versus 28. 2 %, respectively). Overall the rate of embryo development to the blastocyst stage after ICSI was lower (26. 8 %) than that after IVF (47. 3 %). When the rate of blastocyst development was calculated for patients with three or more supernumerary embryos, it remained significantly higher for the IVF patients than for the ICSI patients (45. 6 % versus 30. 0 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean cell number and quality of the supernumerary embryos between the IVF and ICSI patients.

40|$|Internet {{interventions}} {{have great}} potential for alleviating emotional distress, promoting mental health, and enhancing well-being. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated their efficacy {{for a number of}} psychiatric conditions, and interventions delivered via the Internet will likely become a common alternative to face-to-face treatment. Meanwhile, research has paid little attention to the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> associated with treatment, warranting further investigation of the possibility that some patients might deteriorate or encounter adverse events despite receiving best available care. Evidence from research of face-to-face treatment suggests that <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> afflict 5 - 10 % of all patients undergoing treatment in terms of deterioration. However, there is currently a lack of consensus on how to define and measure <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in psychotherapy research in general, leaving researchers without practical guidelines for monitoring and reporting <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in clinical trials. The current paper therefore seeks to provide recommendations that could promote the study of <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in Internet interventions with the aim of increasing the knowledge of its occurrence and characteristics. Ten leading experts in the field of Internet interventions were invited to participate and share their perspective on how to explore <b>negative</b> <b>effects,</b> using the Delphi technique to facilitate a dialog and reach an agreement. The authors discuss the importance of conducting research on <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in order to further the understanding of its incidence and different features. Suggestions on how to classify and measure <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> in Internet interventions are proposed, involving methods from both quantitative and qualitative research. Potential mechanisms underlying <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> are also discussed, differentiating common factors shared with face-to-face treatments from those unique to treatments delivered via the Internet. The authors conclude that <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> are to be expected and need to be acknowledged to a greater extent, advising researchers to systematically probe for <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> whenever conducting clinical trials involving Internet interventions, as well as to share their findings in scientific journals. © 2014 The Authors...|$|R

To rectify this imbalance, this paper first undertakes a rigorous review of the published scholarly empirical evidence pertaining to the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> of social capital in organizations through a search of Web of Knowledge and Scopus, and then enumerates six potentially <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> arising from increased levels of social capital. The review focuses on <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> arising from bonding social capital and those arising from dense networks and closure, advancing new theory to elucidate the generative mechanisms that give rise to the proposed <b>negative</b> <b>effects.</b> Finally, the authors identify potential moderators of the <b>negative</b> <b>effects</b> thus theorized. Using the lens of social identification theory, the authors argue that dysfunctional identification processes restrict the processing of information and stimulate over-commitment to established relationships, diluting in turn the dialectical process, and inhibiting individual learning within organizations, culminating in groupthink, the postponement of structural adjustments, the non-rational escalation of commitment, and the blurring of firms’ boundaries. This review thus furthers the agenda of a more balanced inquiry into the effects of social capital in organizations...|$|R
