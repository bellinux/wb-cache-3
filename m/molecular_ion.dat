The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (Mnbsp&−nbsp&15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH2 groups.|$|E

2500|$|The trihydrogen cation, {{also known}} as protonated {{molecular}} hydrogen or , {{is one of the}} most abundant ions in the universe.

2500|$|Computational {{chemistry}} is {{a branch of}} chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids.

2500|$|Thus, {{molecules}} {{exist as}} electrically neutral units, unlike ions. When this rule is broken, giving the [...] "molecule" [...] a charge, {{the result is}} sometimes named a <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> or a polyatomic ion. However, the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form, such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer. Charged polyatomic collections residing in solids (for example, common sulfate or nitrate ions) are generally not considered [...] "molecules" [...] in chemistry. Some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons, creating radicals. Most radicals are comparatively reactive, but some, such as nitric oxide (NO) can be stable.|$|E
2500|$|The APPI {{interface}} for LC-MS {{was developed}} simultaneously by Bruins and Syage in 2000. [...] APPI is another LC-MS ion source/ interface {{for the analysis}} of neutral compounds that cannot be ionized using ESI. This interface is similar to the APCI ion source, but instead of a corona discharge, the ionization occurs by using photons coming from a discharge lamp. In the direct-APPI mode, singly charged analyte molecular ions are formed by absorption of a photon and ejection of an electron. In the dopant-APPI mode, an easily ionizable compound (Dopant) is added to the mobile phase or the nebulizing gas to promote a reaction of charge-exchange between the dopant <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> and the analyte. The ionized sample is later transferred to the mass analyzer at high vacuum as it passes through small orifice skimmers.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1973 {{and before the}} first {{interstellar}} detection, chemical models of the interstellar medium (the first corresponding to a dense cloud) predicted that hydronium was an abundant <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> and that it {{played an important role}} in ion-neutral chemistry. However, before an astronomical search could be underway there was still the matter of determining hydronium's spectroscopic features in the gas phase, which at this point were unknown. The first studies of these characteristics came in 1977, which was followed by other, higher resolution spectroscopy experiments. Once several lines had been identified in the laboratory, the first interstellar detection of H3O+ was made by two groups almost simultaneously in 1986. The first, published in June 1986, reported observation of the J=1−2 transition at [...] in OMC-1 and Sgr B2.

2500|$|The [...] "hard ionization" [...] {{process of}} {{electron}} ionization can be softened by the cooling of the molecules before their ionization, resulting in mass spectra that are richer in information. In this method named cold electron ionization (Cold-EI) the molecules exit the GC column, mixed with added helium make up gas and expand into vacuum through {{a specially designed}} supersonic nozzle, forming a supersonic molecular beam (SMB). Collisions with the make up gas at the expanding supersonic jet reduce the internal vibrational (and rotational) energy of the analyte molecules, hence reducing the degree of fragmentation caused by the electrons during the ionization process. Cold-EI mass spectra are characterized by an abundant <b>molecular</b> <b>ion</b> while the usual fragmentation pattern is retained, thus making Cold-EI mass spectra compatible with library search identification techniques. The enhanced molecular ions increase the identification probabilities of both known and unknown compounds, amplify isomer mass spectral effects and enable the use of isotope abundance analysis for the elucidation of elemental formulae.|$|E

40|$|The {{stability}} and dynamics of a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) {{is affected by}} the preferential occupancy of small monovalent <b>molecular</b> <b>ions.</b> Small metal and <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> such as sodium and alkyl ammonium have crucial biological functions in human body, affect the thermodynamic stability of the duplex DNA and exhibit preferential binding.

The thermodynamic driving force for a particular molecular ion- DNA interaction is determined by decomposing the free energy of binding into its entropic and enthalpic contributions. Our simulations show that each of these <b>molecular</b> <b>ions</b> preferentially binds to the minor groove of the DNA and the extent of binding is highest for CHO+.
