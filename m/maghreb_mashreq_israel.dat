40|$|Given the {{complexity}} and severity of the problems involved, this book asserts that a comprehensive regional initiative for the Wider Middle East is called for and proceeds to outline exactly what that would entail. The first-best solution would be {{the adoption of a}} convergent strategy towards the Wider Middle East by the EU and US together. The authors argue that a US policy that waged a unilateral war against Iraq and left the Israeli-Arab conflict still festering would mean counterproductive effects for the fight against Al Qaeda and huge damage to Western-Islamic relations {{as well as to the}} transatlantic alliance. At the same time, however, the EU must be prepared to strengthen both the ‘carrots’ and the ‘sticks’ in its policies in the region in any case. The point of the image of Rubik’s Cube is to stress the need for a coherent vision for all three regions of the Wider Middle East (<b>Maghreb,</b> <b>Mashreq</b> and the Gulf), for all three major vectors of policy (politics, economics and security), and for all three major external participants (the US, Europe and the international organisations) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper engages {{engages with}} core-periphery conceptions {{because they are}} a useful "Denkfigur" {{in a time of}} {{increasing}} global interconnectedness. I argue that the core-periphery metaphor is a useful one because it provides us (1) with a relational tool of analysis and (2) with a focus on asymmetric power-relations. But it also has some serious limitations such as a tendency to be over-deterministic and to be too global in scale. In order to meet these limitations, I suggest to re-scale Prebisch, Amin and Wallersteins global conception of core and periphery to the local scale. I hold that we need to “provincialise” the core-periphery metaphor to borrow Chakrabarty’s (2000) famous term and to make the agency of local actors more relevant to our understanding of political dynamics in the <b>Maghreb,</b> <b>Mashreq</b> and Gulf region.  I sketch how “provincialized” and “localized” ways of using the core-periphery metaphor could look like. This part builds on the main ideas Malika Bouziane, Anja Hoffmann and I developed in the introduction to our volume on “Local Politics and Contemporary Transformations in the Arab World” as well as my approach of a “state analysis from below”...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to show several areas (societal sectors) of {{interdependence}} between the two halves of the Euro-Mediterranean region. The northern half of the region (in its widest geographical sense the EU) and the southern half (<b>Maghreb</b> and <b>Mashreq</b> countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea) have several common security issues and interests which makes them highly interdependent. After going through the main issue areas of interdependence, the core assumption of the study will be lined out, which argues that Europe and the Mediterranean reached such a high level of security interdependence that they can be treated now as a single security complex...|$|R
40|$|In October 2009, the French {{government}} {{launched a}} ‘grand debate on national identity’. Through the Ministry of Immigration and National Identity, the government {{set up a}} website asking ‘For you, {{what does it mean}} to be French?’. This initiative sought community perspectives on citizenship in an age of globalisation and migration into Europe from Africa, the <b>Maghreb</b> and <b>Mashreq.</b> It also came at a time when France, Belgium and Switzerland were engaged in debates over Islam and the banning of the burqa, hijab and mosque minarets. But this debate over nationality, identity and citizenship also raises significant issues for people living in France’s overseas dependencies. What does citizenship mean for people in the Pacific islands colonised by France—New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna and French Polynesia? [Introduction...|$|R
3000|$|The {{climate of}} the {{southern}} Mediterranean basin (<b>Maghreb</b> and <b>Mashreq</b> regions) is favourable for livestock rearing. Animals can be raised during the mild winter and slaughtered during the hot and dry season, thus providing a [...] "living bank" [...] for food and cash. Lamb slaughtering, common to all religions in the area, is related to this seasonality. In North Africa, traditional livestock rearing is carried out by transhumants who move the herds over long distances and let their livestock graze also on cereals stubble and inside the maquis (Mediterranean shrubland). There is {{a difference in the}} temperate and wetter areas of Mediterranean Europe - including central and southern Italy and its islands - where pastoral systems are more sedentary, and the importance of other farming systems increases. The traditional pattern in the northern Mediterranean basin is an intermediate system based on the integration of forests, tree plantations, and herbaceous crops - with all these resources interlinked by grazing cattle, sheep and goats.|$|R
40|$|Stephen Calleya {{focuses on}} sub-regionalism {{as a tool}} of region {{building}} within the EMP. This paper’s main concern is the question of whether, in view of the present EMP difficulties, subdividing the southern Mediterranean into various sub-regions (such as the <b>Maghreb</b> and the <b>Mashreq)</b> may be an efficient tool of region building. By taking account of regional relations among southern Mediterranean states and sub-regional initiatives, Calleya discusses several options and conditions under which sub-regionalism within the EMP could contribute to Euro-Mediterranean region building. Calleya argues that if the EU is serious about having a significant positive impact on regional integration in the Mediterranean in the short term, it is necessary to develop an adequate strategy for supporting more directly all regional sub-groupings in the southern Mediterranean...|$|R
40|$|The thesis concerns, from an {{economic}} and institutional point of view, the migration process in connection with development issues, focusing on the Middle East and North Africa region. Adopting a south-south perspective of migration flows, which is focusing on migration from the <b>Maghreb</b> and <b>Mashreq</b> towards the GCC, the research focuses on the linkage between migration and local development (LED), considering the economic implication that temporary migration flows (trough physical and human capital accumulation) have for the labour exporting countries of the region. Since south-south migration flows are both temporary and skilled, the research points out that return migrants from the GCC can {{have a significant impact}} for the growth of recipient countries, as they transfer capital through remittances on regular basis and, once back, they can use human capital acquired abroad to promote economic initiatives. Starting from the descriptive analysis on international migration flows (from an historical to a systemic point of view), and focusing on the patterns of people movements in the Gulf Migration System and on the role remittances have in the region as a strategy for both household survival and local development, the research considers the economics of migrant remittances from a micro and macro perspective and the main direct and indirect effects that remittances have on the local communities. The review of the economic literature on international remittances and on local development shows how migration is an alternative strategy of financing local economic development (LED) especially for low-middle income countries (among them the Maghreb countries). The linkage between return migration, remittances, human capital formation and the promotion of local development in the Egyptian case is the focus of the empirical investigation...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{examines}} {{the relationships between the}} European Union and the third States which are located {{in the area of the}} Mediterranean Sea, as well as the main features of European policies towards these States and the attempt of European Union to play a role of “normative power” in this area. The article considers the situation of the Western Balkans, the participation of the European Union to peace-keeping operations in the territories of States born after the decomposition of Yugoslavia and the European strategies of neighbourhood and stabilization. Whereas the attitude of the European Union generally seems to be consistent with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as regards the Eulex mission following the declaration of independence of Kosovo the position of the European Union is judged as contrary to the Security Council resolution 1244 of 1999. The condition of Turkey is examined: Turkey’s membership application raises some problems which relate not only to the enlargement of the European Union, but even to the definition of its identity. More problems spring from the particular condition of Cyprus, which is a Member of the European Union but which is still divided in two States, after the proclamation in 1983 of the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus. However the most serious problem in the Mediterranean area is represented by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: the European Union’s action, in spite of its efforts to contribute to a solution, so far has not appeared very effective. Finally the article deals with the European policy towards the Mediterranean Countries of <b>Maghreb</b> and of <b>Mashreq,</b> particularly the Barcelona Process, whose results are rather disappointing, and the recent initiative of President Sarkozy concerning the Union for the Mediterranean...|$|R
40|$|Pastoralism is a {{characteristic}} livelihood {{system for the}} whole Mediterranean basin. From Morocco to Turkey, from Sardinia to Libya, herding societies are a common feature of all countries and civilisations that have inhabited the region. Though the material and symbolic wealth of pastoral groups {{is an integral part}} to the Mediterranean livelihood as well as cultural systems (i. e. milk, lambs, transhumance, etc…), these societies have long suffered various forms of socio-political and economic marginalisation. While the lands and environments herders insisted upon have become a main target for modernization policies, from natural reserve to farming expansion, from mining exploitation to livestock market off-takes, their rights have been seldom acknowledged and their technical skills and institutional capacities hardly recognized. Recently, low population density, remoteness and political marginality have made pastoral areas the prime targets for state retrenchment under Structural Adjustment Programs and cuts to public budgets. On the other side important potentials exist for a fairer development of these communities, such as the increasing consumption demand for animal proteins, together with the recognition of pastoralism as an environmental-friendly natural resource management, and processes of enhanced autonomy and local participation in political decision-making offered by recent reforms implying decentralisation and devolution. During the last decades, access to and control of resources in pastoral areas have gone through specific transformation processes, which have reshaped to a large extent pastoralists dependence on their natural resource base and enhanced integration into state and market dynamics. Yet the outcomes of these processes are yet to prove beneficial to pastoral communities, whose sense of marginalisation, disillusionment and resentment towards state or regional institutions is an important element that helps explaining to an extent processes of political radicalisation in many pastoral regions. As a result, pastoral groups seem increasingly exposed to climatic vagaries, increasingly trapped in the vicious circle characterised by high levels of food insecurity, conflict and environmental degradation. Within the climate change framework the vulnerability of these communities to extremes climatic events, i. e. drought, is being increasingly acknowledged (WISP, 2007). This paper addresses the dynamics perceived, the problems faced and the applied coping strategies by some pastoral communities inhabiting the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. With case studies from Morocco and Tunisia and a wider regional analysis which also include cases from Jordan, Syria and Palestine, this paper addresses the shifting vulnerability of pastoral communities under changing environmental and socio-political domains. An innovative participatory tool, the historical livelihood matrix is presented and brought into discussion as an appropriate tool which enables discussing livelihood dynamics in an historical perspective, taking into account the gender as well as generational perspectives. The research work has been undertaken within the ICARDA <b>Maghreb</b> and <b>Mashreq</b> program, complemented with some other development works undertaken by the author in the region with the NGO Ucodep.
