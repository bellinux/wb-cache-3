50|$|Americium is {{the only}} {{synthetic}} element to have {{found its way into}} the household, where {{the most common type of}} smoke detector uses 241Am in the form of americium dioxide as its source of ionizing radiation. This isotope is preferred over 226Ra because it emits 5 times more alpha particles and relatively little harmful gamma radiation. Element collector Theodore Gray mentions in his book The Elements: A Visual Exploration of Every Known Atom in the Universe: You might think that a synthetic radioactive element that follows plutonium (94)—and has a significantly shorter half-life—would be some kind of superbomb material, available only to scientists in secret laboratories. Perhaps a mad scientist is studying americium in a lair somewhere, but if you want some yourself you can simply walk into any neighborhood hardware store, supermarket, or Wal-Mart and buy some, no questions asked.The reason is not that americium is fundamentally less dangerous than the elements around it. In fact, the commonly available isotope, 241Am, is significantly more radioactive than weapons-grade plutonium, and at least as toxic. No, the difference is simply that there is a useful application for americium that requires only a very tiny amount, and for which a company was prepared to go through the effort required to carve out and get a regulatory exception. The amount of americium in a typical new smoke detector is 1 <b>microcurie</b> (37 kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a smoke detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any smoke that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical smoke detector, the ionization smoke detector is cheaper and can detect particles which are too small to produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E

This work {{has resulted in the}} development of a practical tool to study such energy deposition experimentally, at nanometer dimensions. The main contribution of this research is the design of a cylindrical wall-less proportional counter of 1 mm height by 1 mm diameter. A wall-less detector (also called grid-walled detector) overcomes the so-called ??wall effect??, an experimental artifact that introduces distortions in the radiation energy measurements. An important feature of this detector that distinguishes it from other detectors is its modular design. This allows the detector to be repaired or modified, when necessary, without having to completely disassemble it. Novel design techniques were adopted resulting in a functional detector that can simulate cellular sites as small as 10 nanometers, approximately the size of many molecules in the cell. The detector was tested with a 1 <b>microcurie</b> sealed Am- 241 source, which primarily emits monoenergetic alpha particles of energy 5. 57 MeV.

40|$|Introduction Radioisotopes play an {{important}} role in nuclear medicine and represent powerful tools for imaging and therapy. With the extensive use of 99 mTc-based imaging agents, therapeutic rhenium analogues are highly desirable. Rhenium- 186 emits therapeutic − particles with an endpoint-energy of 1. 07 MeV, allowing for a small, targeted tissue range of 3. 6 mm. Additionally, its low abundance γ-ray emission of 137. 2 keV (9. 42 %) allows for in vivo tracking of a radiolabeled compounds and dosimetry calculations. With a longer half-life of 3. 718 days, synthesis and shipment of Re- 186 based radiopharmaceuticals is not limited. Rhenium- 186 can be produced either in a reactor or in an accelerator. Currently, Re- 186 is produced in a reactor via the 185 Re(n,γ) reaction resulting in low specific activity which makes its therapeutic application limited. [1] Production in an accelerator, such as the PETtrace at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR), can theoretically provide a specific activity of 34, 600 Ci. mmol− 1 Re[2], which represents a 62 fold increase over reactor produced 186 Re. The studies reported herein focused on the evaluation of accelerator-based reaction pathways to produce high specific activity (HSA) 186 Re. Those pathways include proton and deuteron bombardment of tungsten and osmium targets by the following reactions: 186 W(p,n) 186 Re, 186 W(d, 2 n) 186 Re, 189 Os(p,α) 186 Re, and 192 Os(p,α 3 n) 186 Re. Additional information on target design related to the determination and optimization of production rates, radionuclidic purity, and yield are presented. Material and Methods Osmium and tungsten metals are very hard and thus very brittle. Attempts at pressing the pure metal into aluminum backings resulted in chalky targets, which easily crumbled during handling. Osmium disulfide (OsS 2) and tungsten disulfide (WS 2) were identified to provide a softer, less brittle chemical form for targets. OsS 2 and WS 2 targets were prepared using a unilateral press with a 13 mm diameter die to form pressed powder discs. A simple target holder design (FIG. 1) was implemented to provide a stabilizing platform for the pressed discs. The target material was sealed in place with epoxy using a thin aluminum foil pressed over the target face. Initial irradiations of OsS 2 were performed using the 16 MeV GE PETtrace cyclotron at MURR. Irradiations were performed for 30 – 60 minutes with proton beam currents of 10 – 20 µA. Following irradiation, the OsS 2 targets were dissolved in NaOCl and the pH adjusted using NaOH. The resultant aqueous solution was mixed with methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), with the lipophilic perrhenate being extracted into the MEK layer and the osmium and iridium remaining in the aqueous layer. The MEK extracts were then passed through an acidic alumina column to remove any remaining osmium and iridium. Determination of rhenium and iridium activities was done by gamma spectroscopy on an HPGe detector. Preliminary irradiations on WS 2 targets were performed at MURR with the beam degraded to 14 MeV with a proton beam current of 10 µA for 60 minutes. After irradiation, WS 2 was dissolved using 30 % H 2 O 2 with gentle heating and counted on an HPGe detector to determine the radio-nuclides produced. Results and Conclusion Thin natOsS 2 targets were produced, irradiated at 16 MeV for 10 µAh, and analyzed for radiorhenium. Under these irradiation conditions, rhenium isotopes were produced in nanocurie quantities while iridium isotopes were produced in <b>microcurie</b> quantities. Future studies with higher proton energies are planned to increase the production of rhenium and decrease the production of iridium. After optimizing irradiation conditions, enriched 189 Os will be used for irradiations to reduce the production of unwanted radionuclides. A liquid-liquid extraction method separated the bulk of the rhenium from the iridium. The majority of the rhenium produced was recovered in the first organic aliquot with little iridium observed while the majority of the iridium and osmium was retained in the first aqueous aliquot. Target production with WS 2 was successful. A thin target of natWS 2 was produced and irradiated at 14 MeV for 10 µAh. Under these irradiation conditions, several rhenium isotopes were produced in <b>microcurie</b> quantities. Target parameters to maximize 186 Re production remain to be determined before enriched 186 W targets are used for irradiations to reduce the production of unwanted radionuclides. In conclusion, the potential production routes for accelerator-produced high specific activity 186 Re are being evaluated. Cyclotron-based irradiations of natOsS 2 targets established the feasibility of producing rhenium via the natOs(p,αxn) Re reaction. Current results indicate higher proton energies are necessary to reduce the production of unwanted iridium isotopes while increasing the production of rhenium isotopes. Preliminary irradiations were performed using the 50. 5 MeV Scanditronix MC 50 clinical cyclotron at the University of Washington to determine irradiation parameters for future higher energy irradiations (20 – 30 MeV). A rapid liquid-liquid extraction method isolated rhenium from the bulk of the iridium and osmium following irradiation. Preliminary studies indicate WS 2 may also provide a suitable target material to produce 186 Re via the (p,n) reaction pathway...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{method has}} been devised for {{determination}} of the hemorrhagic tendency in vivo. Cottonmouth moccasin snake venom (Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus) {{is used as a}} quantitative test to measure the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch and mesoappendix of the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). The test has been applied under Nembutal anesthesia to more than 330 hamsters treated in groups of 10 or more with beta and gamma irradiations, the hemostatic agent Adrenosem, rutin, cortisone, calcium; free Ringer's solution, hyaluronidase, antihyaluronidase, and nor-epinephrine. As applied to the cheek pouch, the venom test consisted of the intrapouch injection of. 02 cc. of a standard test solution (0. 01 percent moccasin venom in mammalian Ringer's solution) by means of a Krogh-Keyes syringe pipette. Exact petechial counts were made at 30 -minute intervals for periods of 2 hours or less. The response to be expected in normal hamsters was established in a group of 50 animals. An average of 80 petechiae (standard deviation 36) formed within 1 hour following application of venom. Within 2 hours 150 or more petechial hemorrhages developed. This figure was therefore considered as the end-point value and used as a basis for comparison with experimental groups. As applied to the mesentery, the venom test consisted of irrigating the preparation with pre-heated venom for 25 seconds. Observations were made at 15 -minute intervals for a period of 1 hour. The end-point count in the mesoappendix of the normal hamster was established as 50 petechiae at 1 hour. The mechanism involved in petechial formation was studied by Kodachrome motion picture recording of the actual process at 900 magnifications. Erythrocytic extravasation occurred without apparent rupture of the vessel wall and ceased abruptly without platelet plug or fibrin clot formation. Petechiae occurred principally at venous junctions. The effect of snake venom was local and transitory, resolution of the hemorrhages usually being complete within 24 to 48 hours. Various vascular effects in addition to the hemorrhagic phenomenon were observed. Within 1 to 3 minutes after application of the venom, the erythrocytes appeared packed and swollen. This pre-petechiation phase was designated as the period of "beaded flow". An increase occurred in the numbers of leukocytes adhering to the venular endothelium. Also arteriolar vasoconstriction and vasomotion were often encountered. An increased bleeding tendency in x-irradiated hamsters was shown by the moccasin venom test. At 5 days after total body x-irradiation with 1200 r, an average of 117 petechiae (standard deviation 30) were counted in the cheek pouch within 1 hour. Increased petechial susceptibility was also demonstrated in the blood vessels of the mesoappendix after similar treatment with x-irradiation as shown by an average of 92 petechiae (standard deviation 20) at 15 minutes following application of venom. No change in petechial susceptibility was detected on the 2 nd post-irradiation day. However, a marked increase in susceptibility was observed in hamsters in a near-terminal condition at 7 to 9 days following 1200 r total body x-irradiation. Petechial counts averaged 146 (standard deviation 5) at 1 hour. X-irradiation of the total cheek pouch with 500 r produced an immediate increase in petechial susceptibility, as indicated by an average of 145 hemorrhages at 1 hour (standard deviation 7). Dosages of 50 r delivered to the total pouch produced no significant immediate effects, but on the 2 nd day after irradiation petechial counts at 90 minutes averaged 129 {{with a standard deviation of}} 31. Intrapouch implantations of Sr 90 (141 <b>microcurie</b> bead; 24 to 48 hour exposure) and Co 60 (92 <b>microcurie</b> needle; 4 weeks exposure) resulted in an increased petechial response to topically applied moccasin venom. End-point counts were obtained within 45 minutes and 90 minutes respectively, following application of the venom. Adrenosem (1. 5 mg. intramuscularly) administered shortly before topical application of the snake venom test solution increased the resistance of cheek pouch and mesenteric blood vessels to the action of venom. Petechial counts in the cheek pouch averaged 72 (standard deviation 47) at 2 hours. Ten petechiae (standard deviation 3) were counted at 1 hour in the mesentery. Pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem effectively reduced the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels of the cheek pouch to snake venom applied on the 5 th day after x-irradiation (lOOOr and 1200 r). An average of 48 hemorrhages (standard deviation 36) was recorded 2 hours after application of moccasin venom. The protective value of pre-irradiation treatment with Adrenosem was not as great in the mesentery. Petechial counts averaged 89 (standard deviation 8) 1 hour after application of the venom test solution. Treatment with 25 mg. of rutin before intrapouch administration of moccasin venom proved ineffectual in decreasing the petechial susceptibility of the blood vessels. At 2 hours the mean petechial value was 146 with a standard deviation of 8. However, rutin gave protection against hemorrhaging when administered prior to total body x-irradiation with 1200 r as demonstrated in hamsters tested with moccasin venom solution on the 5 th post-irradiation day. The average count at 1 hour was 83 petechiae (standard deviation 17). This response was essentially the same as that determined for the non-irradiated control group, although significantly lower than the mean value obtained at 1 hour in unprotected irradiated animals. The effect of prolonged treatment with cortisone upon the petechial susceptibility of blood vessels in the cheek pouch was studied. Ten daily injections of cortisone acetate (5 mg. subcutaneously) were administered before intrapouch application of the snake venom test. The petechial response did not differ materially from that of the control group. Average petechial counts of 147 (standard deviation 9) were recorded at 2 hours. No demonstrable modification occurred in the resistance of cheek pouch blood vessels in hamsters treated with calcium-free mammalian Ringer's solution. Intrapouch and intravenous injections of this solution alone were almost wholly ineffective in eliciting a petechial response as indicated by average 2 -hour counts of 1. 7 (standard deviation 2. 4) and 5 (standard deviation 2) respectively. Intrapouch injection of calcium-free Ringer's solution and moccasin venom combined, resulted in the formation of 140 petechiae (standard deviation 12) in 2 hours. A similar response was also observed in animals which were treated with intravenously administered calcium-free Ringer's solution and intrapouch injections of moccasin venom. The counts at 2 hours were comparable with those in the control group, averaging 146 petechiae (standard deviation 6). Topically-applied hyaluronidase (75 TR units) was ineffective in producing petechiae in the cheek pouch, but intra-pouch injection of a combination of only 7. 1 TR units of hyaluronidase and. 02 cc. of 0. 01 percent moccasin venom solution produced a marked increase in petechial formation. End-point counts of 150 or more petechiae were recorded at 1 hour in all 10 hamsters comprising this group. In the mesoappendix 75 TR units of hyaluronidase were only slightly effective. An average petechial count of 7 (standard deviation 3) was obtained at 1 hour. Three experimental antihyaluronidase solutions (SN 40 -B; SC- 4892; SC- 5345, G. D. Searle, Inc.) produced no significant change in the petechial susceptibility of cheek pouch blood vessels as compared with the control group. Simultaneous intrapouch injections of nor-epinephrine (. 03 cc. of a. 001 percent solution) and the standard amount of the venom test solution produced an average of 14 S petechial hemorrhages (standard deviation 4) in 2 hours. Intravenous injection of a vasoconstrictor dose of norepinephrine produced a very significant increase in petechial formation. The mean petechial count at 1 hour was 108 (standard deviation 32). The effects of intramuscular and intravascular administrations of venom were also studied. Intramuscular (flank) injections of. 2 cc. of a concentrated solution of moccasin venom (1 percent) did not produce petechiae in the cheek pouch although arteriolar constriction and beaded flow were prevalent. Similar results were obtained with intravascular administration of moccasin venom accomplished by cannulating the external maxillary artery and perfusing the cheek pouch with approximately 2 cc. of a 1 percent venom solution over a period of 2 hours...|$|E
