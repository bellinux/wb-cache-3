40|$|We {{investigated}} the current condition of 69 drug dependents (25 stimulant dependents, 24 alcohol dependents, 12 another drug dependents and 8 multiple dependents) who visited Tokyo Metropolitan Government Women Counseling Center between 1977 and 1988. The life history, family history, educational career and character were similar between these 4 groups. However, prior to visiting this center, the alcohol-dependent group showed a more unstable life style. The prognosis {{of this group}} was not good because most recommenced drinking soon after visiting the center. The stimulant-dependent group showed a better prognosis than alcohol-dependent group because many patients in the former group had escaped from stimulant-dependent partners and were committed to ending their own drug use. Patients diagnosed with residual and late-onset psychotic disorder who were most commonly found in the stimulant-dependent group, showed a bad prognosis. Due to ongoing symptoms stimulant-dependent patients were repeatedly admitted and were in hospital for long periods. Most of <b>multiple-dependent</b> group used stimulant drugs, so their overall characteristics were similar to the stimulant-dependent group. In this study we have identified a need for countermeasure treatment of drug dependent patients as severe as that required for infectious diseases like AIDS or E. coli O- 157...|$|E
40|$|Purpose– This study {{explores the}} impact of {{cultural}} values on the importance individuals assign to project success/failure factors. Design/methodology/approach–Themes emerging from 40 interviews of project practitioners based in Brazil, China, Greece, Nigeria, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States are integrated with literature evidence to design a survey instrument. 1313 practitioner survey responses from the eight countries are analysed using multi-group, structural equation modelling. Findings– Ten project success/failure indicators (PSFIs) are found to reduce to two main project success/failure factors (PSFFs) : (1) project control and extra-organisational goals, and (2) project team management/development and intra-organisational goals. It is found that the levels of importance individuals assign to both factors are dependent, not only on age and gender, but also on cultural values measured as constructs based on Hofstede’s individualism, masculinity, power distance and uncertainty avoidance dimensions. Research limitations – The snowballing method used to gather survey data and analysis of relationships at individual level reduce generalisability. Practical implications – The results reveal insights {{on how best to}} match the cultural values of project participants to project characteristics. They also increase knowledge on the likely perceptual differences among culturally-diverse individuals within projects. Originality/value – This research contributes to the literature on culture in project environments by defining a factor structure of <b>multiple-dependent</b> project success/failure indicators and increases insight on how specific cultural values may impact on the perception of the so-defined project success/failure factors. <br/...|$|E
