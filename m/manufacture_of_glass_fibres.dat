40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforcements}} {{form the}} foundation of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Yet because of the intense level of industrial secrecy around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding of what glass fibre sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about glass fibre sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which glass fibre manufacturers have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about glass fibre sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. Glass fibre has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today glass fibre products account for more than 95 % of fibre reinforcements used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and their composites is the fibre sizing. Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance of glass reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development of glass fibre sizing is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns of glass fibre manufacturers and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community. Despite these challenges there has been quite some work published in and around the subject of glass fibre sizings over the years. Given the importance of sizings to the continuing success and growth of the composites industry this review has collected and summarized a large proportion of the widely dispersed literature which is openly available around glass fibre sizings. The review should beneficial to academic researchers embarking on, or already working on, fundamental research in the area of glass fibre sizings and interfaces in glass reinforced composites. However, industrial readers from the composite materials supply chain and those engaged with end-use applications using glass reinforced polymers should also find the contents highly useful in improving their insight and understanding of this critical aspect of composite materials...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project investigated techniques {{to enable the}} fabrication of fibre reinforced composite components from waste generated in the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> fabrics. These waste fabrics and fibres were used to manufacture filament wound tubes using a new technique termed “clean filament winding”. The end-use application for the filament wound tubes was to replace cardboard inner tubes that are currently used by the sponsoring industrial partner to over-wrap the woven fabrics. Pre-manufactured <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were also {{used in this study}} to investigate the production of aligned short-fibre prepregs via a vibration-based alignment technique. The aligned short-glass fibre preforms were autoclaved to produce composite panels. The short-fibre composites were evaluated through the degree of alignment of the short-fibres in the preform, tensile and flexural strengths, fibre volume and void fractions. The filament wound tubes were characterised by: fibre volume and void fractions, hoop-tensile strength, lateral compression strength and inter-laminar shear strength (ILSS). The composite tubes produced using the clean filament winding process proved comparable to those produced using conventional wet-filament winding. Lateral compression strength of the filament wound tubes was significantly superior compared to the cardboard tubes. The degree of short-fibre alignment using the vibration-based alignment technique was over 80...|$|R

The <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> textile <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> using {{the technique of}} drawing the fibres through very fine orifices {{was developed in the}} 1930 s in the USA and started in Germany in 1939.

The earliest bushings used for industrial fibre production had 51 individual nozzles or “tips”. As production processes became more stable, this was increased to 102 and then 204 tips. In these early bushings, the tips were arranged in one or more long rows. Current bushings have up to 4000 tips and there is a trend to even larger numbers. In the most commonly used designs, the tips are arranged in double rows at right angles to the longitudinal axis of the bushing.

40|$|Intrinsic {{crystallisation}} is invoked at {{each process}} stage during the <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> fluoride <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> Thermal history and crystallisation distributions were calculated by numerical simulation {{of the entire}} fibre manufacturing process, from the preform to fibre drawing. Assuming a gaussian field distribution for single-mode fibre, the attenuation due to crystallisation was calculated using classical scattering theory. Results show strong dependence on {{the temperature of the}} core melt and fibre drawing conditions. During fibre manufacture it is necessary to maximise both fibre tension and speed in order to reduce additional attenuation to a level below that of Rayleigh scattering. The mechanical properties of such fibres is governed by the surface quality. A pristine surface was achieved by modifying the drawing furnace to allow evacuation prior to pulling. This indicates that the mechanical weakness of earlier fibres was due to water attack during drawing. 1...|$|R

40|$|Large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) {{has been}} conducted to investigate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> dispersion in an internally spout-fluidised bed with draft tube and disk-baffle, which {{was used in the}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> long <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced thermoplastic composites. The LES results have demonstrated that the internally spout-fluidised bed with draft tube and disk-baffle can remarkably improve its hydrody-namic behaviour, which can effectively disperse fibre bundles and promote pre-impregnation with resin powder in manufacturing fibre reinforced thermoplastics. The hydrodynamics of the spout-fluidised bed has been investigated and reported in a previous paper (Hosseini et al., 2009). This study attempts to reveal important features of fibre dispersion and correlations between the fibre disper-sion and the characteristics of turbulence in the internally spout-fluidised bed using the LES modelling, focusing on the likely hydro-dynamic impact on fibre dispersion. The simulation has clearly indicated that there exists a strong interaction between the turbulent shear flow and transported fibres in the spout-fluidised bed. Fibre entrainment is strongly correlated with the local vorticity distribu-tion. The dispersion of fibres was modelled by a species transport equation in the LES simulation. The turbulent kinetic energy, Rey-nolds stress and strain rate were obtained by statistical analysis of the LES results. The LES results also clearly show that addition of the internals in the spout-fluidised bed can significantly change the turbulent flow features and local vorticity distribution, enhancing the capacity and efficiency of fibre flocs dispersion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> high-durability phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> for biomedical applications. Five different {{borophosphate glass}} formulations in the systems of 45 P 2 O 5 – 5 B 2 O 3 – 5 Na 2 O–(29 − x) CaO– 16 MgO–(x) Fe 2 O 3 and 45 P 2 O 5 – 5 B 2 O 3 – 5 Na 2 O– 24 CaO–(21 − x) MgO–(x) Fe 2 O 3 where x = 5, 8 and 11 mol% were produced via melt quenching. The compositions and amorphous nature <b>of</b> the <b>glasses</b> were confirmed by ICP-MS and XRD, respectively. FTIR results indicated depolymerisation of the phosphate chains with {{a decrease in}} Q 2 units with increasing Fe 2 O 3 content. DSC analyses showed an increase in Tg by ~ 5 °C with an increment of 3 mol% in Fe 2 O 3 content. The thermal properties were also used to calculate processing window (i. e. Tc,ons—Tg) and another parameter, Kgl, to determine the suitability for fibre drawing directly from melt, which equals (Tc,ons—Tg) /(Tl—Tc,ons). The degradation study conducted in PBS solution at 37 °C showed a decrease of 25 – 47 % in degradation rate with increasing Fe 2 O 3 content. This confirmed that the chemical durability <b>of</b> the <b>glasses</b> had increased, which was suggested {{to be due to}} Fe 2 O 3 addition.

40|$|Bioresorbable phosphate-based glasses (PBG) {{have been}} {{investigated}} for varying tissue engineering applications such as fibrous reinforcement for fully resorbable PLA composite for fracture fixation. The mechanical properties of these composites {{are determined by the}} mechanical properties <b>of</b> phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> (PGF) which can be tailored by varying the chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>glass.</b> However, current phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> production is in lab-scale quantities and in single filament form which limits the use of these fibres as they can only be produced as non-woven random or unidirectional fibre mats. The main aim of this project was to scale-up <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and textile product for reinforcement of PLA composite. The detail objectives included novel phosphate glass formulation development, design and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> multifilament PGF drawing system, multifilament PGF fabrication, textile weaving and textile reinforced PLA composite characterisation. In this study, PBGs of the system P 2 O 5 -B 2 O 3 -CaO-MgO-Na 2 O-Fe 2 O 3 were investigated. In order {{to determine the effects of}} replacing P 2 O 5 with B 2 O 3 on the glass structure, thermal properties, density, degradation properties and cytocompatibility studies were carried out. The investigation revealed that the thermal properties and chemical durability <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> were decreased when phosphate was replaced by boron, due to the increase of BO 3 units which, could increase crystallisation tendency and easily be attacked by solution. During phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> fabrication, single filament fibre fabrication was achieved successfully using all <b>glass</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> system (48 -x) P 2 O 5 -(12 +x) B 2 O 3 - 14 CaO- 20 MgO- 1 Na 2 O- 5 Fe 2 O 3. In order to produce phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> all phosphate based glasses in this study were taken into account during single filament fibre drawing trials. To assess the performance of the single filament fibres, the PGF were subjected to mechanical and degradation testing. The performance of PGF was assessed by measuring three different post-processing methods including: annealed, size (water-soluble epoxy size) coated, and size coated and heat-treated. It was found that size coating and annealing treatment of the fibre improved the chemical durability of fibres significantly, whilst heat treatment damaged the coatings on the fibre and eliminated the protection on fibre surface. Based on the success from the single filament <b>fibre</b> manufacture, the <b>glasses</b> with excellent <b>fibre</b> drawing performance were then used in multifilament fibre fabrication. A novel furnace design was then used as a multifilament fibre drawing system. The final multifilament fibres were produced successfully and coated with water-soluble epoxy size for fibre combination and surface protection. Final strands of multifilament fibre were rewound and combined to be fibre products such as roving (without twist) and yarns (with twist). The PLA composite reinforced by unidirectional (UD) roving or yarns were produced and investigated in vitro in terms of degradation profiles and mechanical property retention in order to evaluate the effect of fibre volume fraction and twist on the performance of composites. The flexural properties of UD composites were found to rapidly reduce in aqueous medium, and the high level of twist was also seen to reduce the flexural properties of composite. With the design and <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> a small inkle-type loom for hand weaving, yarns were used successfully in the small Inkle-type loom to produce narrow, plain weave textiles which, to the authors knowledge is the first time textile products <b>of</b> phosphate <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> has been produced in the world. The cytocompatibility of this textile was investigated via MG 63 cell seeding on the textile surface and characterisation of cell metabolic activity. For further study, the textile reinforced PLA composite was produced and compared with a 0 °/ 90 ° unidirectional lay-up composite as a pseudo-zero crimp textile. Due to the limitation of the hand weaving technique, a higher density of yarns laying along the longitudinal direction (load direction) demonstrated greater mechanical properties when compared to 0 °/ 90 ° composite. Retention of mechanical properties for both composites was also investigated during a degradation study and 20...|$|R

40|$|Among {{other modern}} {{applications}} <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{there is a}} strong interest in their use as a strengthening agent for building materials. Alkali-Resistant (AR) <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> serving as ideal reinforcement for concrete proved to be very efficient against crack propagation at very early stages of the concrete setting process. However, a description of their behaviour in real cementous mixtures is missing because by now they have been studied mainly with various model tests simulating conditions of cementous environment. In this study two kinds <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> (Anti-Crack HD and HP) were mixed into Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) and Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) and stored under water for 28 days up to 1 year. Afterwards, chemical durability <b>of</b> the AR <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> was assessed mainly with SEM/EDS analysis. In general, the prepared samples did not demonstrate any signs of leaching or any other severe corrosion defects and they did not behave in a way suggested by the model tests, as reported in literature. In contrast to testing in high alkaline environment, no depleted corrosion layer rich in Zr and Ca was observed and functionality <b>of</b> the <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> remained unchanged...|$|R

"Fibreglass {{reinforced}} plastics" [...] or FRPs (commonly {{referred to}} simply as fibreglass) use textile grade <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> These textile fibres {{are different from}} other forms <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> used to deliberately trap air, for insulating applications (see glass wool). Textile <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> begin as varying combinations of SiO2, Al2O3, B2O3, CaO, or MgO in powder form. These mixtures are then heated through direct melting to temperatures around 1300 degrees Celsius, after which dies are used to extrude filaments <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> in diameter ranging from 9 to 17 µm. These filaments are then wound into larger threads and spun onto bobbins for transportation and further processing. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> {{is by far the}} most popular means to reinforce plastic and thus enjoys a wealth of production processes, some of which are applicable to aramid and carbon fibres as well owing to their shared fibrous qualities.|$|R
40|$|The {{composites}} {{between the}} reinforced <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> wastes obtained from surfboard manufacturing industry and polypropylene were developed for value adding and environmental reasons. The thermomechanical and rheological behaviours of the composites were investigated. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents were varied from 5 to 30 wt%. The effects of maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MA-PP) compatibilizer on the behaviours were also determined. The {{results revealed that}} the addition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> was able to reduce the heat of fusion of the composite. Additionally, the tensile and flexural properties were increased with increasing the <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> contents following the rule of mixtures. The addition of MA-PP led to enhance tensile and flexural properties due to {{the improvement of the}} adhesion between matrix and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> which is correlated with morphological observations. From the rheological studies, the apparent flow activation energy revealed that the addition <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> decreased the fluidity of the molten composite materials; however, it could be slightly improved by using MA-PP...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} and reuse of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. The global annual production <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced composite materials is rapidly approaching 10 million tons, of which approximately 60 % is thermoset based. A number of processes are available for recycling such GRP composites. Of these possible routes, thermal recycling is probably the most technologically advanced and has been piloted in the UK and Denmark. However, nearly all options deliver recycled fibres which suffer from a lack of cost competitiveness with pristine first-pass materials. A key factor in this equation is that there is a huge drop in the performance <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> (80 - 90 %) in comparison to its original state. Consequently, recycled fibres have a very poor performance to cost ratio, and in most cases are considered unsuitable for re{{processing and}} reuse as a valuable reinforcement of composites. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects (ReCoVeR) focussed on the enabling cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> obtained from thermal recycling <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> reinforced composites from end-of-life automotive and wind energy applications. A breakthrough in the regeneration <b>of</b> recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill. This will enable such recycled fibres to compete with, and replace, pristine materials in many large volume composite applications. The development of an economically viable process for regenerating the properties <b>of</b> thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> would have major technological, societal, economic, environmental impacts. This ReCoVeR team of researchers is currently 1. generating fundamental understanding of the degradation <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> strength during thermo-mechanical conditioning (300 - 600 °C) 2. developing cost effective treatments to regenerate the performance <b>of</b> thermo-mechanically treated <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> 3. producing examples of composites using regenerated <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> Highlights <b>of</b> the results from these studies will be reviewed with emphasis on the teams’ breakthrough treatments to regenerate the properties <b>of</b> thermally conditioned <b>glass</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
