5|$|The mountainous {{terrain of}} the Chetco River {{watershed}} was created approximately 130million {{years ago when}} the <b>microcontinent</b> collided with the much larger North American continent. The process uplifted the complex and exotic terranes of the <b>microcontinent</b> to form the Klamath Mountains. Many glaciers carved U-shaped valleys and cirques during the last ice age, and several alpine lakes still exist today.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{flows through}} the ancient Klamath Mountain terrane, which is between 400 and 100million years old, the oldest rocks in Oregon. The Klamath <b>microcontinent</b> was {{originally}} located beneath the ocean near southern California before separating {{hundreds of millions of}} years ago. Plate tectonics pushed the <b>microcontinent</b> north, and bits of granite, sea floor sediment, subduction zones, and coral reefs gradually accreted into small islands. Between 212 and 170million years ago, a massive volcanic arc erupted on the Klamath <b>microcontinent,</b> binding the islands together in a single block. The Klamath <b>microcontinent</b> went through a period of intense tectonic activity known as the Siskiyou orogeny roughly 170 to 165million years ago. The process was strong enough to force sedimentary rocks deep into the Earth's crust, melting them into large plutons of granite, which rose slowly to the surface. Shortly after, a large portion of sea floor was thrust over the older Klamath terranes; much of it is still visible atop Vulcan and Chetco peaks. This region is known as the Josephine Ophiolite, and contains a rare type of rock called peridotite, originating from the Earth's mantle.|$|E
5|$|The {{continent}} didn't {{split into}} two because the Grenville province (a <b>microcontinent)</b> was converging with the proto-North American continent to the east.

5|$|The country {{owes its}} varied topography, {{and perhaps even}} its {{emergence}} above the waves, to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo-Australian Plates. New Zealand is part of Zealandia, a <b>microcontinent</b> nearly {{half the size of}} Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent. About 25 million years ago, a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region. This is now most evident in the Southern Alps, formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault. Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other, producing the Puysegur Trench to the south, the Hikurangi Trench east of the North Island, and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north.|$|E
25|$|It {{was formed}} when {{islands in the}} Klamath <b>microcontinent</b> collided, {{uplifting}} primordial mountains composed of mostly sandstone. Ancient rivers eroded these mountains, and the sediment and sandstone was deposited on the seashore. Then, the <b>microcontinent</b> collided with the North American continent, uplifting Humbug Mountain in the process. Near the summit, rock outcrops of granite and sandstone can still be found.|$|E
25|$|Avalonia was {{an ancient}} <b>microcontinent</b> or terrane whose history formed {{much of the}} older rocks of Western Europe.

50|$|During the Mesozoic era (about 250 to 66 {{million years}} ago) a large ocean (Tethys Ocean), floored by oceanic {{lithosphere}} existed in-between the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia (which lay {{to the south}} and north respectively). This large oceanic plate was consumed at subduction zones. At the subduction trenches the sedimentary rock layers that were deposited within the prehistoric Tethys Ocean buckled, were folded, faulted and tectonically mixed with huge blocks of crystalline basement rocks of the oceanic lithosphere. These blocks form a very complex mixture or mélange of rocks that include mainly serpentinite, basalt, dolerite, and chert. The Eurasian margin, now preserved in the Pontides (the Pontic Mountains along the Black Sea coast), is thought to have been geologically similar to the Western Pacific region today. Volcanic arcs and back-arc basins formed and were emplaced onto Eurasia as ophiolites as they collided with <b>microcontinents</b> (literally relatively small plates of continental lithosphere). These <b>microcontinents</b> had been pulled away from the Gondwanan continent further south. Turkey is therefore made up from several different prehistorical <b>microcontinents.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{formation}} of many UHP terrains has {{been attributed to}} the subduction of <b>microcontinents</b> or continental margins and the exhumation of all UHP terrains has been ascribed principally to buoyancy caused by the low density of continental crust—even at UHP—relative to Earth's mantle.|$|R
25|$|Macquarie Island is {{an exposed}} {{portion of the}} Macquarie Ridge and is located where the Australian plate meets the Pacific plate. The island lies {{close to the edge}} of the {{submerged}} <b>microcontinent</b> of Zealandia, but is not regarded as part of it as the Macquarie Ridge is oceanic rather than continental crust.|$|E
25|$|Further north, {{around the}} Malampaya Sound area {{and up to}} the El Nido area, one finds older (Triassic-Jurassic) deep marine chert and limestone. These units are part of the <b>microcontinent</b> ("North Palawan Block") {{although}} they are deep marine rocks marginal to the continental crust. They were accreted to the Chinese continental crust in the Mesozoic at a time when an Andean-type subduction zone existed in southeast China.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} microcontinents, or {{continental}} fragments, that are built of continental crust {{but do not}} contain a craton. Some of these are fragments of Gondwana or other ancient cratonic continents: Zealandia, which includes New Zealand and New Caledonia; Madagascar; the northern Mascarene Plateau, which includes the Seychelles. Other islands, such as several in the Caribbean Sea, are composed largely of granitic rock as well, but all continents contain both granitic and basaltic crust, {{and there is no}} clear boundary as to which islands would be considered microcontinents under such a definition. The Kerguelen Plateau, for example, is largely volcanic, but is associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland and is considered a <b>microcontinent,</b> whereas volcanic Iceland and Hawaii are not. The British Isles, Sri Lanka, Borneo, and Newfoundland are margins of the Laurasian continent—only separated by inland seas flooding its margins.|$|E

25|$|Because {{most of the}} Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} by {{widespread}} mafic-ultramafic magmatism 1,884to 1,864million years ago along the Superior craton margin during these orogenies, {{a number of different}} suggestions have been made to explain the questionable origins of this large igneous province. It is also not clear if the Circum-Superior Belt has a single origin or it has several origins. Suggestions include back-arc rifting, foredeep flexure, mantle plumes and the breakup of a <b>microcontinent.</b> The geochemical indication of the Circum-Superior Belt is also poorly known; either it contains major regional differences or it is the same throughout the magmatic zone. With the discovery of the Pickle Crow dike swarm throughout the western Superior craton, the likelihood of other 1,880million year old dike groups throughout the Superior craton remains. This is partly because several dike zones in the Superior craton remain undated. The relationship of the Circum-Superior Belt with similar age magmatism throughout the nearby Trans-Hudson belt and elsewhere on Earth is also unknown. This includes the 1,860million year old magmatism of the East Kimberly event in Australia and 1,860million year old magmatism of the Mashonaland event in Africa. The other questionable suggestion related to the Circum-Superior Belt is the existence of a suggested 1,900million year old global superplume event.|$|E
25|$|After Rodinia broke apart, its {{southern}} half traveled south {{and crossed the}} South Pole while its northern half traveled northward to the North Pole. The two halves of Rodinia eventually collided with the Congo craton to form the supercontinent Pannotia 600million years ago. In contrast to Rodinia, Pannotia was short-lived. It rifted apart 545million years ago, or only 65million years after it formed. This resulted {{in the creation of}} at least four continents, namely Baltica, Siberia, Gondwana and Laurentia. By the Early Cambrian 514million years ago, Laurenta was located on the equator, Baltica was south of Laurenta, Siberia was just south of the equator east of Laurenta, and Gondwana lied mostly in the Southern Hemisphere. Subsequently, Baltica, Laurenta and <b>microcontinent</b> Avalonia collided in the Devonian period (416-359million years ago) to form minor supercontinent Euramerica. This eventually started to collide with Gondwana and other landmasses to form supercontinent Pangaea 255million years ago. In the Late Triassic period some 152million years ago, Pangaea split into two minor supercontinents, namely Gondwana and Laurasia. The TGB represented a minor portion of western Laurasia until it divided into Eurasia and North America about 94million years ago. Since the Middle Miocene 14million years ago, the TGB {{has been part of the}} Americas, a minor north-south trending supercontinent comprising the continents of North America and South America.|$|E
500|$|Lord Howe Island is {{the highly}} eroded {{remains of a}} 7-million-year-old shield volcano, the product of eruptions that lasted for about 500,000 years.

2500|$|The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, {{unlike other}} parts of the Philippines. The crust of {{northeast}} Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate.

This <b>microcontinent</b> also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle).

The [...] thick Chukotat Group is made of picritic and tholeiitic basalts. These basaltic lavas are intruded by narrow mafic and ultramafic sills. At least three different types of lava compositions exist in the Chukotat Group, including olivine phyric, pyroxene-phyric and plagioclase phyric. The upper unit of the Chukotat Group is 1,870million years old whereas the lower unit is associated with the Katiniq Suite sills, which cut through the underlying Povungnituk Group. In 1989, the Katiniq Suite sills were thought to be 1,918million years old, but more recent dating and a reinterpretation of the original age in 2004 suggests that the Katiniq Suite sills are closer to 1,880million years old. Therefore, the age range for the Chutotat Group is 1,880to 1,870million years.
