In the present study, we assessed the external exposure and the absorbed dose of metals in personnel from the aluminium cast house. This was combined with an evaluation of respiratory complaints and the lung function of the personnel. 30 workers from an aluminium casting plant participated and 17 individuals of the packaging and distribution departments were selected as controls. The exposure was assessed by the quantification of total inhalable fume with metal fraction and by the determination of urinary aluminium, chromium, beryllium, manganese and lead concentration. Carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), aldehydes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons and <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> concentration were assessed as well. In order to evaluate their respiratory status each participant filled out a questionnaire and their lung function was tested by forced spirometry. Total inhalable fume exposure was maximum 4. 37 mg m(- 3). Exposure to the combustion gases, <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and metal fume was well below the exposure limits. Beryllium could not be detected in the urine. The values of aluminium, manganese and lead in the urine were all under the respective reference value.

40|$|Evidence on the {{mechanism}} by which inhaled <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> lead to pulmonary fibrosis has not been forthcoming. As with silica, a biphasic cell culture system was required to distinguish phagocytosis from collagen formation. Synthesis of total protein and collagen by rat fibroblasts was estimated by incorporation of labelled proline after treatment with the medium from rat peritoneal macrophages that had been cultured {{in the presence of}} different types of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre.</b> The influence of fibre length was also examined. All the main varieties of asbestos reacted with macrophages to produce or release a fibrogenic factor. However, chrysotile and the longer amosite fibres evoked the response only after prolonging the period of incubation with macrophages, presumably by permitting more complete phagocytosis of curled or longer fibres. Short amosite fibres proved to be more active than longer ones and under certain conditions were as potent as quartz. Fibrous glass also possessed stimulatory properties and again a sample having a short length gave a stronger response than a long one. Collagen formation by asbestos thus appears to be mediated by a macrophage factor, so operating {{in a manner similar to}} that previously demonstrated for quartz. The conventional view that short fibres are comparatively insignificant in asbestos fibrogenesis cannot, on the present evidence, be sustained.

40|$|International audienceA proper {{understanding}} of the pulmonary toxicology of <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> (MMMF) requires information on their durability in the human lung but to date there is little information on this subject.

The transformed fibres exhibited a spectrum ofmorphological features and elemental compositions. Some retained a typical ceramic chemistry but were heavily coated with ironcontaining material. Others had a hollow tube morphology, made up offine iron-containing granules without any of the normal major ceramic elements. Such fibres were sometimes found lying under a bed ofsiliceous Seachate.

To evaluate the fibrogenic and neoplastic potency of <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> rockwool fibres were investigated in an in vivo model. Wistar rats received a single intratracheal instillation of 2 ml rockwool fibres suspension (10 mg/ml buffered saline) into the right lung. The animals were sacrificed after a period of one day up to 730 days after instillation. The lungs were investigated by histomorphological, immunohistochemical, physical-analytical and molecular genetic techniques. Within the first 14 days after intratracheal instillation of fibres an exsudative, but unspecific stage of a diffuse alveolar damage could be documented. In the following observation time we found a different active proliferating phase with hyperplasia and metaplasia of bronchial and alveolar surface epithelial cells, granuloma formation and a different predominance of inflammatory cells. During the whole observation time an abundant clearance function of the macrophages was found. We could demonstrate a reduction of the medium fibre length due to fibre breakage from 18 #mu#m at the beginning to 7 #mu#m 730 days after instillation. Immunohistochemical and molecular genetic investigations to define the role of the tumor suppressor gene p 53 did not provide references to a p 53 gene mutation in the gene locus examined. However, a P 53 protein accumulation points to a fibre induced damage of individual cells. According to our results, the man-made rockwool fibres have a weaker fibrogenic potential than crocidolite which was investigated in previous studies. Tumors could not be documented during the observation time of 730 days.

Die Lungen wurden nach Zeitraeumen von 1 Tag bis zu 730 Tagen histomorphologisch, physikalisch-analytisch und molekularbiologisch untersucht. Die morphologischen und immunhistochemischen Untersuchungsergebnisse zeigten, dass die Fasern waehrend der ersten vierzehn Tage nach Faserinstillation eine zum Teil ausgepraegte, aber unspezifische, exsudative Entzuendungsreaktion verursachen. Im weiteren Beobachtungszeitraum waren eine wechselnd aktive Proliferationsphase mit Hyperplasien und Metaplasien des Bronchial- und Alveolarepithels, eine Ausbildung von Fasergranulomen und phasenartiger Dominanz unterschiedlicher Entzuendungszelltypen zu dokumentieren.

Whether occupational exposure to other agents, such as inorganic dust or chemicals, also increases the risk for infectious pneumonia is not clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to elucidate whether occupational exposure to respiratory pollutants and irritants increases the risk for infectious pneumonia. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Swedish male construction workers. Participants 320 143 male construction workers exposed to inorganic dust (asbestos, <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> dust from cement, concrete and quartz), wood dust, metal fumes and chemicals (organic solvents, diisocyanates and epoxi resins) or unexposed. Main outcome measures The cohort was followed from 1971 to 2003 and the main outcome measures were mortality to infectious pneumonia, lobar pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia. RRs were obtained by the person-years method and from Poisson regression models, adjusting for baseline values of age and smoking habits. Results Among men aged 20 e 64 years there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to metal fumes (RR 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 3. 95), inorganic dust (RR 1. 87, 95 % CI 1. 22 to 2. 87) and chemicals (RR 1. 91, 95 % CI 1. 37 to 3. 22). The mortality was also increased from both lobar pneumonia and pneumococcal pneumonia. Among men aged 65 e 84 years the occupational exposure to inorganic dust and chemicals was associated with slightly increased mortality from infectious pneumonia. Among groups with mutually exclusive exposures there was increased mortality from infectious pneumonias among construction workers exposed to inorganic dust, but not among those exposed to wood dust or chemicals. There were no cases among workers exposed only to metal fumes.

40|$|The {{group of}} <b>man-made</b> <b>mineral</b> or {{vitreous}} <b>fibres</b> (MMMFs or MMVFs) includes glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, glass filaments and microfibres, and refractory ceramic fibres (RCFs). Experimental observations have provided evidence that {{some types of}} MMVF are bioactive under certain conditions. The critical role of size parameters has been demonstrated in cellular and animal experiments, when intact fibres are {{in direct contact with}} the target cells. It is, however, difficult to extrapolate the results from these studies to humans since they bypass inhalation, deposition, clearance and translocation mechanisms. Inhalation studies are more realistic, but show differences between animal species regarding their sensibility to tumour induction by fibres. Fibre biopersistence is an important factor, as suggested by recent inhalation studies, which demonstrate positive results with RCF for fibrosis, lung tumours and mesothelioma. There is no firm evidence that exposure to glass-, rock- and slag wool is associated with lung fibrosis, pleural lesions, or nonspecific respiratory disease in humans. Exposure to RCF could enhance the effects of smoking in causing airways obstruction. An elevated standard mortality ratio for lung cancer has been demonstrated in cohorts of workers exposed to MMVF, especially in the early technological phase of mineral (rock slag) wool production. During that period, several carcinogenic agents (arsenic, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) were also present at the workplace and quantitative data about smoking and fibre levels are lacking. It is not possible from these data to determine whether the risk of lung cancer is due to the MMVFs themselves. No increased risk of mesothelioma has been demonstrated in the cohorts of workers exposed to glass-, slag- or rock wool. There are in fact insufficient epidemiological data available concerning neoplastic diseases in RCF production workers because of the small size of the workforce and the relatively recent industrial production.

Results are quantified on the basis of number of fibres per millilitre of air (f/ml). Many countries strictly regulate the methodology applied to the MFM.|$|R

40|$|The <b>mineral</b> <b>fibre</b> {{plate is}} made from a {{hydrophobic}} part and a hydrophilic part connected together. The ratio of thickness of the two parts can be varied according to the use required. Plant seeds and nutrients can {{be included in the}} hydrophilic part. The <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in the hydrophobic part can be hydrophobically wetted and similarly for the hydrophilic part with hydrophilic means. USE - Suitable for covering walls with greenery. ADVANTAGE - Plate can be fixed on walls with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic side...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the combined effects of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> and cigarette smoke on the production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by alveolar macrophages. Rats were exposed to cigarette smoke in vivo, and production of TNF by alveolar macrophages was measured in the presence of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in vitro. For smoke exposure, rats were divided into two groups. Five were exposed to a daily concentration of 10 mg/m 3 of cigarette smoke for an eight hour period, and five rats (controls) were not exposed to smoke. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed after exposure to smoke and the recovered alveolar macrophages were incubated with either chrysotile or ceramic fibres on a microplate for 24 hours. Activity of TNF in the supernatant was determined by the L- 929 fibroblast cell bioassay. When alveolar macrophages were not stimulated by <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres,</b> production of TNF by rats exposed to smoke and unexposed rats was essentially the same. When alveolar macrophages were stimulated in vitro by chrysotile or ceramic fibres, production of TNF by alveolar macrophages from rats exposed to smoke was higher than that by alveolar macrophages from unexposed rats. The findings suggest that cigarette smoke and <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> have a synergistic effect on TNF production by alveolar macrophages...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} the crystal {{structure}} of regulated and unregulated <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres.</b> The aim is to provide readers, both specialists and researchers broadly interested in environmental problems, with up-to-date information on a topic that is expanding daily. The chapter describes specifically {{the structure of the}} fibrous modification whenever available and outlines possible differences from the corresponding prismatic variety. Details of the experimental techniques used for structure determination/refinement are reported also, if appropriate, to outline the experimental difficulties faced due to the small dimensions, sensitivity and chemical complexity of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Specific {{friction}} {{materials have}} been developed and then tested on a braking Tribometer in order to study the impact of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> on the NVH behaviour of the braking pads. Two parameters were tested: fibres amount and fibres type. Numerical simulations {{have been used for}} determining instability conditions. Results show that the squealing mode is selected among instable modes. That selection depends on the type and the amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in the friction material. Rubbing surfaces have been observed using SEM. Silent and noisy surfaces present very different morphologies...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of {{carcinogenic}} <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were measured}} at 7 sites in Baden-Wuerttemberg during 1987 - 1989. The fibrous particles show a very inhomogeneous {{distribution in the}} troposphere. Annual mean concentrations are lower than the proposed preventive limits of 200 asbestos fibres per m" 3, but some asbestos peak concentrations were even higher than 1000 fibres per m" 3. The estimated cancer risk caused by inhalation of asbestos fibres is as low as 10 "-" 5. Ca-contamination on chrysotile and amphibole fibres poits to asbestos-cement building materials as a fibre origin. The concentration of all other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> were {{much higher than the}} concentration of asbestos fibres. There exists no correlation between the concentration of asbestos fibres and of other <b>mineral</b> <b>fibres</b> in the air.
