500|$|Pearce {{reported}} that the guerrillas numbered about 50, and followed them eastwards during 28 July. Flight Lieutenant Petter-Bowyer led a detail of four Alouette IIIs providing air support. Petter-Bowyer's helicopters spotted the insurgents encamped by a stream beneath some dark, shady trees, leading Strong's 12 Troop, 3 Commando to be brought forward to contact them the following morning. Strong's fresh men were sent into the trees while Pearce was reluctantly forced to withdraw and provide back-up. Strong called back almost immediately after entering, [...] " [...] left about one <b>minute</b> <b>ago</b> – in a hurry. There is abandoned equipment—no time to collect—moving east on tracks." [...] 12 Troop pursued the guerrillas and trackers found that they numbered only about 20, meaning that the majority had gone in another direction. Pearce, who had been sent into the camp after Strong, found tracks from {{the remainder of the}} cadres that headed south. He followed them while 12 Troop continued to head east and reached the Mozambican border at nightfall on 30 July. At this time they were able to confirm from bootprints at the road crossing that the exact number of ZIPRA they were pursuing was 15.|$|E
2500|$|When Neff {{learns that}} Keyes {{suspects}} Nino of being Phyllis' accomplice, Neff sees {{a way out}} of his predicament. He arranges to meet Phyllis at her house. He informs her that he knows about her involvement with Nino, and guesses that she is planning to have Nino kill him. He tells her that he intends to kill her and put the blame on Nino. She is prepared, however, and shoots him in the shoulder. Seriously wounded but still standing, he slowly comes closer and dares her to shoot again. She does not, and he takes the gun from her. She says she never loved him [...] "until a <b>minute</b> <b>ago,</b> when I couldn't fire that second shot." [...] Neff does not believe a word she says, and as she hugs him tightly, Neff says, [...] "Goodbye, baby," [...] and shoots twice, killing her.|$|E
