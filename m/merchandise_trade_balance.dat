Although Djibouti runs a substantial surplus in its services balance, the surplus has been smaller than the deficit in the <b>merchandise</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance.</b> As a result, Djibouti's current account balance has been in deficit.

Movements in Japan's current account balance have generally mirrored those of the <b>merchandise</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> considered earlier, although deficits in services and net transfers have offset the surpluses somewhat. Japan began to register surpluses in the current account in 1965, which later continued to rise, although they were punctuated by short-term deficits following the two oil price hikes in 1973 and 1979 (cf. 1973 oil crisis and 1979 energy crisis).|$|E

50|$|Imports began {{recovering}} {{sharply in}} 2003, {{as both the}} purchasing power of the peso and domestic demand increased, and, despite this, from 2003 to 2011 the nation's <b>merchandise</b> <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> recorded a cumulative US$115 billion in surpluses. These surpluses were bolstered as much by growing exports as by a marked recovery in terms of trade for Argentina, which by 2010 had improved 40% over the level prevailing in the 1990s. The nation's perennial trade deficit in manufactures widened during this expansion, however, and exceeded US$30 billion in 2011. Accordingly, the system of non-automatic import licensing was extended in 2011, and regulations were enacted for the auto sector establishing a model by which a company's future imports would be determined by their exports (though not necessarily in the same rubric).

40|$|From the Introduction. One of the {{striking}} characteristics of France’s economic performance {{since the beginning}} of the present decade has been the strength of the external accounts. In particular, on the basis of national accounts data, since 1989 the current account and the non-energy <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> have recorded rising surpluses, which in 1996 amounted to 1. 7 % of GDP and to close to 1. 5 % of GDP, respectively. The service balance, on the other hand, has registered persistent surpluses which averaged between 1 and 1. 4 percent of GDP in the 1990 s. The largest component of <b>merchandise</b> <b>trade</b> is trade in manufactured goods 1. The <b>balance</b> on manufacturing <b>trade</b> recorded surpluses throughout the period following the 1973 oil crisis to the late 1980 s. The manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> slipped into deficit in the period 1987 - 1991 but subsequently moved into surplus which rose to almost 1 % of GDP in 1996. Graph 1 presents quarterly data on the evolution of these variables from the beginning of the 1970 s to the end of 1996; data adjusted for inflation present a similar picture. It is clear that since movements in the current account are dominated by movements in the non-energy and, in particular, in the manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance</b> throughout this period the sources of the current account improvement in the 1990 s are likely to be those explaining the improvement of the manufacturing <b>trade</b> <b>balance...</b>|$|R

Latest data and events The economy grew by 0. 7 percent in the June 2014 quarter, with an expansion in business services influencing growth. There was strong growth for both administrative and support services; and professional, scientific, and technical services over the quarter. Household consumption increased by 1. 3 percent over the quarter, due to increased spending on durable goods (e. g. whiteware) and services. On an annual average basis, the economy expanded by 3. 5 percent over the year ended June 2014. New Zealand’s current account deficit totalled $ 5, 798 million in the year ended June 2014, equivalent to 2. 5 {{percent of gross domestic}} product (GDP). This compared with a deficit of $ 7, 893 million in the June 2013 year (3. 7 percent of GDP). The improvement in the deficit was driven by an increase in the goods balance, which was partially offset by a rise in foreign investor earnings on their New Zealand investments. Fonterra announced that it was reducing its forecast payout for the 2014 / 15 season to $ 5. 30 per kilogram of milksolids (kg/MS), down 70 cents from its previous forecast (excluding dividends).
