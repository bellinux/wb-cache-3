[...] and a [...] "... Mecca for B-movie lovers." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers [...] "... {{if you can find}} a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he [...] "... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge. He's as much the auteur of this baby as the director and screenwriters, and that fierce glimmer in his eye is partly joy." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{appointment}} {{as head of}} the United States Information Agency was seen as a vote of confidence in the agency, which provided the official views of the government to the public in other nations. The USIA had been under fire during the McCarthy era, and Murrow reappointed at least one of McCarthy's targets, Reed Harris. Murrow insisted on a high level of presidential access, telling Kennedy, [...] "If you want <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the landings, I'd better be there for the takeoffs." [...] However, the early effects of cancer kept him from taking {{an active role in the}} Bay of Pigs Invasion planning. He did advise the president during the Cuban Missile Crisis but was ill at the time the president was assassinated. Murrow was drawn into Vietnam because the USIA was assigned to convince reporters in Saigon that the government of Ngo Dinh Diem embodied the hopes and dreams of the Vietnamese people. Murrow knew the Diem government did no such thing. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Murrow did so but resigned in early 1964, citing illness. Before his departure, his last recommendation was of Barry Zorthian to be chief spokesman for the U.S. government in Saigon, Vietnam.|$|E

6000|$|So it was {{not because}} I was a fighter, but because I was a thinker, that I was enraged by the motion-wastage of the loom-rooms and was persecuted by the guards into {{becoming}} an [...] "incorrigible."

60|$|Alter a while, I got a {{direction}} to a boarding-house near the Yard, {{and went to}} it, with a message from my old shipmates {{that they would be}} responsible for the pay. But to this the man would not listen; he took <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> my own account, saying that no blue-jacket should be turned from his door, in distress. Here I staid and got a comfortable night's rest. Next day I was a new man, holy-stoned the decks, and went a second time to the Department.|$|E

I couldn't help it, Captain; I {{wanted to be}} in on this game. It was a pretty tough trip, especially in the department of the commissary. In the low grounds there were always bananas and oranges.

Let <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the scrapping to-morrow.' ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{stiff and}} sore of foot I {{was in the}} morning, and quite dazed by the beating of drums and marching of troops, which seemed to hem <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> every side when I went down towards the long narrow street. Feeling that I could go but a very little way that day, if I were to reserve any {{strength}} for getting to my journey's end, I resolved to make the sale of my jacket its principal business. Accordingly, I took the jacket off, that I might learn to do without it; and carrying it under my arm, began a tour of inspection of the various slop-shops.|$|E

[...] "You {{have seen the}} yield on the lower {{workings}} going down until it's just about worth while to keep the stamps going, and though none of the boys seem to notice anything, {{there are signs that}} are tolerably clear to me that the pay dirt's running right out.

6000|$|This {{valuable}} man {{was hardly}} gone before a lively young fellow with a smoothly shaven, smiling face slipped in.

[...] The young man's smile became a chuckle as he saw these things, and he said to himself: [...] "Nothing here to identify him, eh?"
