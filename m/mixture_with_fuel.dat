40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. A detailed literature review of laminar burning velocity and flammability limits of biogas mixtures combustion is presented. Biogas alone and in <b>mixtures</b> <b>with</b> other <b>fuels</b> is particularly significant because of its capability of application as fuels for internal combustion engines (ICEs). Therefore, a strict determination of the fundamental combustion characteristics required for their application in ICEs is crucial. Producing energy from biogas has the additional benefit of preventing its release into the atmosphere, where it results into significant air pollution. The CH 4 and CO 2 are the main compounds of biogases, such as landfill, agricultural and sewage gas, after {{the removal of the}} trace amounts of organic compounds. For the same equivalence ratio, the presence of CO 2 in the fuel feed results in substantial reduction of the laminar flame speed and flammability limits. Several research projects have shown that the decrease in the laminar flame speed of a fuel mixture containing dilution components is caused by the increase in specific heat capacity and the decrease in heat release, flame temperature and thermal diffusivity. The most promising strategies to increase the laminar burning velocity and the flammability limits of biogas are revised and discussed. The thermodynamic conditions under which these properties are determined are analyzed and the work still required for a comprehensive laminar burning velocity and flammability limits determination, at typical ICEs thermodynamic conditions, is addressed. dc 201...|$|R

40|$|Lean methane-air {{ignition}} {{experiments were}} conducted in a constant volume combustion chamber at 2 bar absolute pressure to evaluate a novel pulsed discharge ignition technology. High-speed schlieren imaging revealed that the flame kernel was expelled outwards into the chamber away from the spark electrodes in pulsed discharge experiments. This effect produced a wrinkled structure in the flame kernels, increasing the burning rates by increasing the flame surface area. The in-cylinder pressure history also indicates faster flame development times. An increased number of pulses led to an increased expulsion of the flame kernel, which is beneficial to its growth. Background Pulsed discharges have been observed to enhance ignition processes for gaseous combustible <b>mixtures</b> <b>with</b> different <b>fuels.</b> Enhancements include reduced ignition delay times, reduced ignition temperature, and increases in flame propagation speed, with the greatest effect observed in fuel-lean regimes [2]. The compounding hydrodynamic effect from a pulsed discharge in breakdown regimes poses issues for practical ignition applications in engines. Pre-vious experiments have shown an increase in wrin-kled flame structure when using microwave-assisted spark plugs in these fuel-lean regimes [3]. This in-vestigation documents both observed kinetic and hydrodynamic effects of a pulsed discharge in lean premixed methane-air mixtures, and expands on previous work by incorporating data analyzed from the high speed imaging.

The quantitative determination of these fuel blends using simple, fast and low cost methods based on near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with chemometric methods has been reported.
