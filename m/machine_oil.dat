5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing <b>machine</b> <b>oil</b> found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

40|$|T {{has been}} widely used to remove <b>machining</b> <b>oils</b> from metals after those metals have been stamped and formed.

Because the CFC solvents have been implicated in stratospheric ozone depletion, AT&T has developed a policy that calls for a 50 % reduction in emissions by 1991 with eventual discontinuation of emissions in manufacturing processes by 1994. To comply with the corporate goals, alternative methods of metal cleaning must be developed. These methods may involve cleaning techniques that do not depend upon CFCs or processes that do not result in contaminated parts. Previous to this work, CFC- 113 was used in the production of circuit board backplane pins in Kansas City. The incoming rolls of CA 725 metal (Cu/ Ni/Sn) alloy were lubricated with <b>machining</b> <b>oils,</b> stamped and immersed in an ultrasonically agitated CFC- 1 13 bath to remove residual oil in a continuous reel-to-reel operation. The reels of stamped metal were then inspected for physical imperfections, stored for a variable period and sent to the plating shop as needed. The first step in the plating process, also a reel-to-reel operation, was immersion in a caustic cleaning bath to remove residual oil left from the CFC- 113 process and subsequent contaminants from the inspection procedures and storage period prior to plating. The parts were rinsed, immersed in an acidic solution for preplate activation, plated with the appropriate metals and finally coated with insertion oil. Cleanliness is very im...|$|R
