[...] He also attributed the quality of every track of Blackout to economic reasons, since {{one of the main}} causes album sales began to suffer during the digital era is due to the [...] "unbundling" [...] of albums in online stores – making it easier for consumers to buy some tracks rather than the entire album. Ewing explained that [...] "The Revolver blueprint for pop albums – every track good, every track a potential hit – makes <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> ever. Especially if a star can keep sonically up-to-date in a fast-moving market." ...|$|E

500|$|While Simon Blackquill {{speaks in}} an old-fashioned and [...] "rough" [...] {{way in the}} Japanese version, {{matching}} what a ronin {{would be expected to}} sound like, Hsu said that this cultural shorthand of a ronin character did not exist in the West to build his character upon, so his characterization had to be rendered in a different way to be more accessible to Western players. Hsu and the translators had the same problem with this as Fuse had when balancing the prosecutor and convict aspects of the character, but eventually leaned more towards the prosecutor side, and made him speak Victorian English. They felt that this made <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> portraying him as a cursing delinquent due to his high intelligence, and his Victorian-era clothes, due to their different cultural connotations in the West compared to Japan.|$|E
500|$|During {{his service}} as ambassador, Hay {{attempted}} {{to advance the}} relationship between the U.S. and Britain. The latter country had long been seen negatively by many Americans, a legacy of its colonial role that was refreshed by its Civil War neutrality, when British-built raiders such as the Alabama preyed on US-flagged ships. In spite of these past differences, according to Taliaferro, [...] "rapprochement made <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> at any time in their respective histories". In his Thanksgiving Day address to the American Society in London in 1897, Hay echoed these points, [...] "The great body of people in the United States and England are friends... that intense respect and reverence for order, liberty, and law which is so profound a sentiment in both countries". Although Hay was not successful in resolving specific controversies in his year and a third as ambassador, both he and British policymakers regarded his tenure as a success, because of the advancement of good feelings and cooperation between the two nations.|$|E
500|$|Her {{greatest}} critic was Kenneth Tynan who ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 {{production of}} Titus Andronicus, commenting that she [...] "receives {{the news that}} {{she is about to}} be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber." [...] He was also critical of her reinterpretation of Lady Macbeth in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role. After her death, however, Tynan revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as [...] "one of the worst errors of judgment" [...] he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, [...] "made <b>more</b> <b>sense...</b> <b>than</b> the usual battle-axe" [...] portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named her performance as Lady Macbeth as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.|$|E

500|$|... "Volcano" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode was inspired by volcano-related Hollywood disaster films, such as Dante's Peak (1997) and Volcano (1997), which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, [...] "If you watch this episode and then go watch Volcano, this makes <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> Volcano does." [...] Debbie Liebling, who served as a South Park producer {{at the time of the}} episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where [...] "anything can happen". Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the Volcano film was set in Los Angeles; Stone said, [...] "If they could do it, we could." [...] Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, [...] "Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are." ...|$|E

[...] Barb Lien-Cooper from Comic World News concurs that the manga cannot keep pace with the anime, but she finds Excel herself to be wittier in the manga and that the manga's plots make <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> the anime's.

2500|$|Natural {{languages}} such as English have {{words for}} several Boolean operations, in particular conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and implication (implies). But not {{is synonymous with}} and not. When used to combine situational assertions such as [...] "the block is on the table" [...] and [...] "cats drink milk," [...] which naively are either true or false, the meanings of these logical connectives often have the meaning of their logical counterparts. However, with descriptions of behavior such as [...] "Jim walked through the door", one starts to notice differences such as failure of commutativity, for example the conjunction of [...] "Jim opened the door" [...] with [...] "Jim walked through the door" [...] in that order is not equivalent to their conjunction in the other order, since and usually means and then in such cases. Questions can be similar: the order [...] "Is the sky blue, and why is the sky blue?" [...] makes <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> the reverse order. Conjunctive commands about behavior are like behavioral assertions, as in get dressed and go to school. Disjunctive commands such love me or leave me or fish or cut bait tend to be asymmetric via the implication that one alternative is less preferable. Conjoined nouns such as tea and milk generally describe aggregation as with set union while tea or milk is a choice. However context can reverse these senses, as in your choices are coffee and tea which usually means the same as your choices are coffee or tea (alternatives). Double negation as in [...] "I don't not like milk" [...] rarely means literally [...] "I do like milk" [...] but rather conveys some sort of hedging, as though to imply {{that there is a}} third possibility. [...] "Not not P" [...] can be loosely interpreted as [...] "surely P", and although P necessarily implies [...] "not not P" [...] the converse is suspect in English, much as with intuitionistic logic. In view of the highly idiosyncratic usage of conjunctions in natural languages, Boolean algebra cannot be considered a reliable framework for interpreting them.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{listening}} {{session in}} New York City, J. Cole previewed the album to a select few, including Insanul Ahmed of Complex. At the listening session {{it was revealed}} the song [...] "In the Morning" [...] featuring Drake off his Friday Night Lights mixtape would appear on the album. Cole defended this decision saying, he felt the song never got the push it deserved, and {{he wanted it to}} reach more people. Another song that was previously released on another project The Warm Up, was [...] "Lights Please". Cole explained this song was the track that won over his manager Mark Pitt and Jay-Z. The interlude, was revealed to be a quick skit where Cole talks about the day he found out Jay-Z wanted to sign him. As soon as Cole got the good news he was pulled over and ended up spending the night in jail for parking violations. Even so, he explains that it was [...] "the easiest time ever" [...] because he knew success was coming around the corner. The track [...] "Rise and Shine" [...] opens with a sample from the documentary, Backstage where Jay-Z is talking about finding that one great artist that he'll sign. [...] "Dollar and a Dream III" [...] was revealed, produced by Kyle Justice, the third in the [...] "Dollar and a Dream series" [...] following the two from his first two mixtapes. In an interview with VIBE Cole admitted that he originally wanted Jay-Z to appear on the song [...] "God's Gift" [...] rather than [...] "Mr. Nice Watch." [...] He continued saying, [...] "Everything worked out, I'm a true believer that everything happens for a reason. Like, when he did that, it made way <b>more</b> <b>sense</b> <b>than</b> my song. It's a bigger record, a more universal record. Being the hip-hop nerd that I am, I would have loved to hear Jay-Z on that [...] beat. But really, I'm fine on that song alone." [...] J. Cole released [...] "Mr. Nice Watch" [...] himself through the internet, for promotional purposes, on September 14, 2011. The song contains elements of Dubstep and Electronica. Two days before the album's release, J. Cole released a music video for the bonus track, [...] "Daddy's Little Girl". [...] On October 25, J. Cole released a three-year-old never-before seen music video for the track, [...] "Lost Ones".|$|E
