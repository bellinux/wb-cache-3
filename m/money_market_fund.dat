40|$|<b>Money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> {{are widely}} used by all types of investors, {{including}} households, corporate treasurers, pension funds, or insurance companies, who regard <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> as a ‘safe’ short-term liquid asset class for investing cash.

25|$|Institutional money {{funds are}} high minimum investment, low expense share classes that are marketed to corporations, governments, or fiduciaries.

25|$|A <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> (also {{called a}} money market mutual fund) is an {{open-ended}} mutual fund that invests in short-term debt securities such as US Treasury bills and commercial paper. Money market funds are widely (though not necessarily accurately) regarded as being {{as safe as}} bank deposits yet providing a higher yield. Regulated in the United States under the Investment Company Act of 1940, money market funds are important providers of liquidity to financial intermediaries.|$|E

Several more funds were shortly set up and the market grew significantly over the next few years. Money market funds are credited with popularizing mutual funds in general, which until that time, were not widely utilized.|$|E

40|$|US dollar <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> and non-US banks 1 The Lehman Brothers failure {{stressed}} global interbank {{and foreign}} exchange markets because {{it led to}} a run on <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> the largest suppliers of dollar funding to non-US banks. Policy stopped the run and replaced private with public funding. JEL classification: E 58, F 34, G 28, G 29. That a loss of confidence in dollar <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> amplified the financial instability arising from the Lehman Brothers failure in September 2008 is well appreciated. What is less well understood, however, is why the run on these funds coincided with the deterioration in global interbank markets. Similarly unclear {{is the relationship between}} policies to stabilise US <b>money</b> <b>markets</b> and those to distribute dollars through cooperating central banks. How great was the need of non-US banks for dollars and how much did they rely on US dollar <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds?</b> How did a safe haven become the critical link between Lehman’s failure and the seizing-up of interbank markets?

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the crisis two {{solutions}} have been proposed. One, repeatedly supported over the long term by the GAO and others is to consolidate the U.S. financial industry regulators. A step along this line has been the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to address systemic risk issues that have in the past, as amply illustrated by the <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> crisis above, fallen neatly between the cracks of the standing isolated financial regulators. Proposals to merge the SEC and CFTC have also been made.|$|E
25|$|To many retail investors, {{money market}} funds are confusingly similar to {{traditional}} bank demand deposits. Virtually all large {{money market funds}} offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.|$|E

50|$|During {{the week}} ending September 19, 2008, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> {{had begun to}} {{experience}} significant withdrawals of funds by investors. This created a significant risk because <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> are integral to the ongoing financing of corporations of all types. Individual investors lend <b>money</b> to <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds,</b> which then provide the funds to corporations in exchange for corporate short-term securities called asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). However, a potential bank run had begun on certain <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds.</b> If this situation had worsened, the ability of major corporations to secure needed short-term financing through ABCP issuance would have been significantly affected. To assist with liquidity throughout the system, the US Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank announced that banks could obtain funds via the Federal Reserve's Discount Window using ABCP as collateral.|$|R

2500|$|The first {{money market}} mutual fund {{to break the}} buck was First Multifund for Daily Income (FMDI) in 1978, liquidating and restating NAV at 94 cents per share. [...] An {{argument}} has been made that FMDI was not technically a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> as at the time of liquidation the average maturity of securities in its portfolio exceeded two years. [...] However, prospective investors were informed that FMDI would invest [...] "solely in Short-Term (30-90 days) MONEY MARKET obligations." [...] Furthermore, the rule restricting which the maturities which money market funds are permitted to invest in, Rule 2-a7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, was not promulgated until 1983. Prior to the adoption of this rule, a mutual fund had to do little other than present itself as a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund,</b> which FMDI did. [...] Seeking higher yield, FMDI had purchased increasingly longer maturity securities, and rising interest rates negatively impacted the value of its portfolio. [...] In order to meet increasing redemptions, the fund was forced to sell a certificate of deposit at a 3% loss, triggering a restatement of its NAV and the first instance of a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> [...] "breaking the buck".|$|E
2500|$|Over time, <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> [...] "depositors" [...] {{felt more}} and more secure, and not really at risk. Likewise, on the other end, {{corporations}} saw the attractive interest rates and incredibly easy ability to constantly roll over short term commercial paper. Using rollovers they then funded longer and longer term obligations via the money markets. This expands credit. It’s also over time clearly long-term borrowing on one end, funded by an on-demand depositor on the other, with some substantial obfuscation {{as to what is}} ultimately going on in between.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{recommended}} to its customers to invest cash holdings in a <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>fund</b> {{that was an}} affiliate of the Reserve Primary Fund and the fund gained approximately $1 billion in assets {{as a result of}} such marketing by the company. The company received commissions from the fund for steering customers. In September 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007–2008, {{as a result of its}} holdings in securities of Lehman Brothers, the fund was forced to break the buck and $1 billion in cash equivalents of TD Ameritrade clients were frozen. The company was accused of having a conflict of interest as a result of commissions that it received, for having poor marketing ethics, and for misrepresenting the safety of the investment. Fredric Tomczyk, President of the company, argued that the contract with the Reserve Fund was a standard contract and that [...] "an investment firm has to make money in some way." [...] The company was named in class action lawsuits by its customers and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into its marketing practices. In 2008, the company agreed to reimburse its customers for up to a 3% loss in the Reserve Primary Fund, or up to $50 million. In 2011, the company settled the SEC case and agreed to pay 1.2¢ per share of the Reserve Yield Plus Fund that was held by its customers, or $10 million in total. The Reserve Yield Plus made its final distribution in 2016 and investors received 97 to 98 cents on the dollar in addition to compensation from TD Ameritrade.|$|E

Investing in less liquid assets, however, widens the narrow structure of <b>money</b> <b>market</b> <b>funds</b> and makes them vulnerable to runs.
