40|$|When tested as a {{microbial}} {{model for}} mammalian drug metabolism, the filamentous fungus Cunninghamella elegans metabolized chlorpromazine and <b>methdilazine</b> within 72 h. The metabolites were extracted by chloroform, separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass, and UV spectroscopic analyses. The major metabolites of chlorpromazine were chlorpromazine sulfoxide (36 %), N-desmethylchlorpromazine (11 %), N-desmethyl- 7 -hydroxychlorpromazine (6 %), 7 -hydroxychlorpromazine sulfoxide (36 %), N-hydroxychlorpromazine (11 %), 7 -hydroxychlorpromazine sulfoxide (5 %), and chlorpromazine N-oxide (2 %), {{all of which}} have been found in animal studies. The major metabolites of <b>methdilazine</b> were 3 -hydroxymethdilazine (3 %). (18) O(2) labeling experiments indicated that the oxygen atoms in <b>methdilazine</b> sulfoxide, <b>methdilazine</b> N-oxide, and 3 -hydroxymethdilazine were all derived from molecular oxygen. The production of <b>methdilazine</b> sulfoxide and 3 -hydroxymethdilazine was inhibited by the cytochrome P- 450 inhibitors metyrapone and proadifen. An enzyme activity for the sulfoxidation of <b>methdilazine</b> was found in microsomal preparations of C. elegans. These experiments suggest that the sulfoxidation and hydroxylation of <b>methdilazine</b> and chlorpromazine by C. elegans are catalyzed by cytochrome P- 450...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} oxidation of an antihistamine drug, <b>methdilazine,</b> was studied in 9. 2 pH with 0. 2  M phosphate buffer as supporting electrolyte at 25  ±  0. 2 °C. Glassy carbon electrode {{was used to}} perform the experiment at cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetric techniques. The dependence of the current on pH, concentration and scan rate were investigated. Differential pulse voltammetric technique was adopted to know the linear relation between peak current and <b>methdilazine</b> concentration. The linear response was obtained {{in the range of}} 3. 0  μM– 1. 0  mM with a detection limit of 0. 1  μM. The proposed method was also applied for the quantitative determination of <b>methdilazine</b> in pharmaceuticals and biological samples...|$|E
40|$|The growth {{inhibition}} of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus {{was accompanied by}} significant release of K+ and UV-absorbing small molecules upon exposure to <b>methdilazine,</b> an extensively used phenothiazine antihistamine. A severe decrease in [U- 14 glucose uptake and a rapid efflux of hexose from sugar-preloaded bacteria were also observed but without visible cellular lysis. Considerable damage to membrane permeability by <b>methdilazine</b> was proposed to explain the rapid loss in cfu/mL of the bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Two methods, {{spectrophotometric}} and turbidimetric, {{which are}} simple, sensitive and cost effective, are described for the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> in bulk drug and in dosage forms. Spectrophotometry {{is based on}} the ion-pair complex reaction of <b>methdilazine</b> with bromophenol blue and in the presence of phthalate buffer of pH 3. 0. The chromogen being extractable with chloroform, could be measured quant. at 420 nm. Turbidimetry involves the addn. of the same dye to an aq. soln. of the drug in the presence of potassium chloride and hydrochloric acid, which results in the formation of a stable suspension of drug-dye ion-pair complex. Turbidity of the suspension is measured {{with the use of a}} visible spectrophotometer, the absorbance being measured at 650 nm and then related to concn. by a calibration graph or regression equation. In both methods, all variables were studied to optimize the reaction conditions. Regression anal. of the Beer's law plot showed good correlation in the concn. range 2 - 16 Î¼g ml- 1 of <b>methdilazine</b> for spectrophotometry. The calibration graph was linear over the concn. range 10 - 70 Î¼g ml- 1 of <b>methdilazine</b> for turbidimetry. No interference was obsd. from commonly encountered additives and excipients.

40|$|Four simple, selective, accurate, and {{reproducible}} {{procedures are}} described for the assay of <b>methdilazine</b> {{in bulk form}} and in formulations. One titrimetric and 3 spectrophotometric methods {{are based on the}} oxidn. of the drug with potassium iodate, and detn. of either excess iodate or iodine released in the reaction. In the titrimetric method (Method A) the drug is reacted with a known excess of iodate in sulfuric acid medium followed by the iodometric detn. of residual oxidant. The residual oxidant is detd. by reacting it with variamine blue and measuring the absorbance of the oxidized dye at 540 nm (Method B). The second spectrophotometric method (Method C) is based on the oxidn. of the drug in sulfuric acid medium in the presence of chloride ions by a large excess of iodate and the iodate being reduced to iodine. The ICl- 2 generated in this reaction is used to iodinate 2 ', 7 '-dichlorofluorescein dye, and the red color of the iodinated dye is measured at 525 nm. The other spectrophotometric method (Method D) also involves the oxidn. of the drug in acid medium by a large excess of iodate with the liberation of iodine and its subsequent extn. with carbon tetrachloride followed by measuring the absorbance 520 nm. The methods were successfully applied to the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> in tablets and syrup and the results obtained in agreement with the label claim. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Two titrimetric and two {{spectrophotometric}} methods, {{which are}} simple, accurate, precise and economical, are described for the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> hydrochloride {{in bulk form}} and in formulations. All the methods {{are based on the}} oxidn. of the drug by metavanadate in acidic condition followed by measurement of unreacted oxidant or V (IV) produced in the redox reaction. In one titrimetric method (A), the drug is treated with a known excess of metavanadate in H 2 SO 4 medium and after the redox reaction, the residual oxidant is back titrated with Fe (II) ammonium sulfate using N-phenylanthranilic acid indicator. The other titrimetric method (B) is based on the titrn. of V (IV) produced in the redox reaction with Ce (IV) sulfate using ferroin as indicator and in the presence of acetone catalyst. In one spectrophotometric method (C) the drug is treated with a known excess of metavanadate and, after the reaction is judged to be complete, the unreacted metavanadate is detd. by complexing with chromotropic acid in the same H 2 SO 4 medium employed for the oxidn. step. The other spectrophotometric method (D) relies on the detn. of V (IV), a product of the redox reaction, by interacting with ferriin reagent and measuring the resulting ferroin at 510 nm. The working conditions of the methods were optimized. Optical characteristics such as Beer's Law limits, detection and quantification limits, molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity values are reported for spectrophotometric methods. The methods were successfully applied to the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> in tablets and syrup, and the results obtained were in agreement with the label claim. Further, the validity of the procedures were confirmed by applying the std. -addn. technique. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} {{and thermal}} degradation studies of phenothiazine (PTZ), acetophenzazine dimaleate (APM), <b>methdilazine</b> hydrochloride (MDH) and mepazine hydrochloride monohydrate (MH) are reported. The activation energies are evaluated {{based on their}} electrical conductivity study conducted over the temperature range 30 - 150 degrees C. These energies for PTZ, APM, MDH and MH {{are found to be}} 0. 44, 0. 41, 0. 34 and 0. 47 eV, respectively. MH showed unusual temperature dependence metallic and semiconducting electrical conductivity. The parent compound and other derivatives showed semiconducting behaviors. The materials are analyzed for the kinetic parameters like the activation energies for decomposition and the Arrhenius pre-exponential factors in their pyrolysis region using Broido's, Coats-Redfern and Horowitz-Metzger methods. Using these factors and the standard equations thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy, entropy and free energies are calculated. Thermogravimetric study on these phenothiazine derivatives in air indicated that their stabilities are in the order APM > MDH > PTZ > MH. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Cyproheptadine {{hydrochloride}} (CPH), <b>methdilazine</b> hydrochloride (MDH) and promethazine theoclate (PMT) {{were determined}} in their pure state and in pharmaceutical formulations {{by a simple}} spectrophotometric method. The determination {{was based on the}} formation of a charge-transfer complex between chloranilic acid as a pi-acceptor and the studied drugs as n-donors in an acetonitrile-chloroform mixture. The spectra, various experimental parameters, the stoichiometry and the stability of the complexes formed were investigated. The complexes formed were found to absorb at 520 run. Beer's law is obeyed in the concentration ranges 25 - 125, 20 - 100 and 25 - 150 mug ml(- 1), for CPH, MDH and PMT respectively. The corresponding values of molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity are 1. 48 x 10 (3), 1. 56 x 10 (3) and 1. 75 X 10 (3) 1 mol(- 1) cm(- 1) and 217. 39, 212. 44 and 284. 63 ng cm(- 2), respectively.

40|$|A simple, precise, and accurate, and stability-indicating isocratic Ultraperformance Liq. Chromatog. (UPLC) {{method was}} {{developed}} for the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> hydrochloride (MDH) in bulk drug and in its tablets. The use of UPLC, with a rapid 5 -min-reversed-phase isocratic sepn. on a 1. 7 Î¼m reversed-phase packing material to provide rapid "high throughput" support for MDH, is demonstrated. The method was developed using Waters Acquity BEH C 18 column (100 mm Ã— 2. 1 mm, 1. 7 Î¼m) with mobile phase consisting of a mixt. of potassium dihydrogenorthophosphate and 1 -pentane sulfonic acid buffer of pH 4. 0 and acetonitrile (60 : 40 vol. /vol.). The eluted compd. was detected at 254 nm with a UV detector. The std. curve of mean peak area vs. concn. showed an excellent linearity over a concn. range 0. 5 - 80 Î¼g mL- 1 MDH with regression coeff. (r) value of 0. 9999. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was 0. 2 Î¼g mL- 1 and the limit of quantification (S/N = 10) was 0. 5 Î¼g mL- 1. Forced degrdn. of the bulk sample was conducted {{in accordance with the}} ICH guidelines. Acidic, basic, hydrolytic, oxidative, thermal, and photolytic degrdns. were used to assess the stability indicating power of the method. The drug was found to be stable in acidic, basic, thermal, hydrolytic, and photolytic stress conditions and showed slight degrdn. in oxidative stress condition. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
40|$|One titrimetric and 2 {{spectrophotometric}} methods, {{which are}} simple, rapid, cost-effective and eco-friendly, are described for the detn. of <b>methdilazine</b> hydrochloride (MDH) in bulk drug, tablet and syrup formulations {{based on the}} oxidn. of MDH by Ce(IV). In titrimetry (method A), the acidified soln. of MDH is titrated directly with Ce(IV) using ferroin as indicator. The spectrophotometric methods are based on oxidn. -redn. reaction involving MDH and Ce(IV), and the resulting Ce(III) is complexed with either arsenazo(III) at pH 7. 8 Â± 1. 0 and absorbance measured at 620 nm (method B) or chromotrope 2 R at pH 2. 5 Â± 0. 8 and absorbance measured at 530 nm (method C). Under optimized exptl. conditions, titrimetric procedure is applicable over the range of 3 - 15 mg of MDH, and the reaction stoichiometry {{is found to be}} 1 : 2 (MDH:Ce(IV)). The spectrophotometric methods are applicable over the ranges of 0. 4 - 10. 0 Î¼g mL- 1 (method B) and 0. 4 - 12 Î¼g mL- 1 (method C). The molar absorptivities are calcd. to be 3. 4 Ã— 104 and 2. 8 Ã— 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for method B and method C, resp., and the corresponding Sandell sensitivity values are 0. 0096 and 0. 0118 Î¼g cm- 2. The limits of detection are calcd. and found to be 0. 12 and 0. 38 Î¼g mL- 1 for method B and method C, resp., with corresponding limits of quantification of 0. 09 and 0. 71. The methods were applied to the detn. of MDH in tablets and syrup, and the results were compared statistically with those of a ref. method. [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|E
