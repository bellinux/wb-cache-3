Setting out the foundational principles of the Union and Member State relationship is also a convenient {{starting point for the}} ensuing chapter concerning competence. The necessary treatment of external Union competence in chapter two provides for the discussion envisaged above concerning the scope for mixed agreements and the adjoining constitutional issue. For reasons of space and time, not all aspects of Union external competence will be considered. This thesis concentrates specifically upon the common commercial policy and what prior to the Lisbon Treaty constituted implied external Community competence. These areas have been frequently debated in the academic discourse and they have had and continue to have a considerable impact upon mixed agreements. The second part of the answer to why an evaluation of mixed agreements is needed is related {{to the use of the}} <b>mixed</b> <b>agreement</b> as such. As implied above already, difficulties with the management of the mixed formula constitute the most serious criticism of the mechanism. With no Treaty provision existing to do the job, the Court has developed the concept of the duty of cooperation as the tool to mitigate negative effects of Union and Member State cooperation. Unfortunately, as only abstract comments have been given in terms of its features, it remains unclear to what extent this duty of cooperation is being observed and what legal obligations are carried with it. Depressing conclusions of the collaboration between the Union and the Member States are by many taken for granted and advocates in favour of the use of pure Union agreements continue to occupy much of the discussion surrounding the mixed agreements. However, no greater exploration of the duty of cooperation and its function in relation to mixed agreements has of yet been undertaken. Accordingly, being the logical consequence of its first part, the management of the mixed formula constitute a fundamental part of this thesis. As already indicated, the dissection of the function of the <b>mixed</b> <b>agreement</b> also constitutes the necessary compliment to the constitutional issue advertised above...|$|E
40|$|Award date: 30 November 2015 Supervisor: Professor Marise Cremona, European University InstituteMember States {{inter se}} {{agreements}} are a complex legal phenomenon epitomizing {{the tension between}} intergovernmental channels of cooperation and supranational structures of integration characterizing the evolution of EU law. EMU inter se agreements, in particular, constitute a unique laboratory to investigate this tension and they help {{to better understand the}} legal nature of Member States’ international agreements which display substantive, institutional and teleological proximity to EU law. EU law imposes some restraints on Member States for the conclusion of inter se treaties. This work critically scrutinises both competence-based and procedural-based restraints which are aimed at safeguarding the specific characteristics of EU law and the peculiarities of EU institutionalism. More specifically, the evaluation of inter se treaty-making restraints moves from the consideration that the use of EU Institutions outside of the Treaties’ framework is liable to undermine the very nature of EU institutionalism. The use of institutions outside the EU framework, as devised by the EMU inter se treaties, induces to a reinforcement of contractual visions of Europe premised on the conception of EU institutions as common organs in the hands of Member States. The EU external relations law practice provides interesting solutions to the risk of departure from Institutionalism entailed in the contractual conception of Europe. In particular, the Court’s understanding of <b>mixed</b> <b>agreements</b> suggests an associative institutionalist vision of Europe which is less concerned on the precise apportioning of competences between the EU and its Member States and is more attentive to the procedural framework in which the intergovernmental and the supranational components of the EU jointly operate.

40|$|From the introduction]. This paper {{deals with}} the {{question}} how the European Union operates in international negotiations resulting in a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA). As the European Community (EC) does not have exclusive competences on environmental issues, MEAs are <b>mixed</b> <b>agreements,</b> meaning that both the EC and the member states are a party to it. As a result, the EC and the member states participate in the negotiations. While the EC participation is regulated in article 300 TEC, which appoints the Commission as the negotiator, there is no legal framework at the EU level for the member states part (Delreux T., 2006). However, practice learns that the member states often decide to pool their voices and delegate negotiation autonomy to the Presidency or another member state. From a legal perspective, this generates a hybrid {{situation in which the}} Commission should negotiate for issues falling under EC competences and the member states separately (or via the Presidency or a third member state, if they want) for the issues of national competence. The two case studies in this paper on two negotiations on international chemicals management (PIC and POPs) point out that this hybrid situation is not always followed in practice. As speaking with a single voice is considered to increase the EU’s bargaining power, the EU negotiation arrangement and the question ‘who negotiates on behalf of the EU?’ become particularly relevant. To frame this question theoretically, I rely on principal-agent theory. The next section applies this model to the EU decision-making process during negotiations resulting in MEAs. Moreover, I extent the traditional model in a twofold way. Firstly, I introduce private information for the principals, the compellingness of the external environment and the cost of no agreement to understand this process. Secondly, I broaden the model for exclusive EC competences to shared competences and <b>mixed</b> <b>agreements.</b> In section 3, I apply this model on two international chemicals negotiations {{of the end of the}} 90 s: the Rotterdam PIC Convention and the Stockholm POPs Convention.

Methods: As part of an HIV seroincidence study, 800 Rwandan female sex workers (FSW) were HIV tested, with those testing positive further tested by BED-CEIA (BED) and AxSYM Avidity Index (Ax-AI) assays. A sample of HIV-negative (N= 397) FSW were followed prospectively for HIV seroconversion. We compared estimates of risk factors for: 1) prevalent HIV infection; 2) recently acquired HIV infection (RI) based on three different STARHS classifications (BED alone, Ax-AI alone, BED/Ax-AI combined); and 3) prospectively observed seroconversion. Results: There was <b>mixed</b> <b>agreement</b> in risk factors between methods. HSV- 2 coinfection and recent STI treatment were associated with both prevalent HIV infection and all three measures of recent infection. A number of risk factors were associated only with prevalent infection, including widowhood, history of forced sex, regular alcohol consumption, prior imprisonment, and current breastfeeding. Number of sex partners in the last 3 months was associated with recent infection based on BED/Ax-AI combined, but not other STARHS-based recent infection outcomes or prevalent infection.

40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} internal state of 60 MeV/u Kr 35 + ions traversing amorphous carbon foils is studied theoretically and experimentally. This system {{is of particular interest}} as the times scales for collisional distribution, mixing due to the wake field, and radiative processes are comparable to each other. A transport theory based on a quantum-trajectory Monte Carlo method is developed, which treats the collisional and radiative redistribution of states on the same footing. The simulations exhibit clear signatures for the interplay between radiative decay and collisional <b>mixing.</b> Good <b>agreement</b> with experimental data is found...|$|R
