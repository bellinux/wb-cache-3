40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{measures}} the relative impact of company economic characteristics and workplace hazards on {{the prevalence of}} several types of <b>medical</b> <b>testing.</b> It uses the results to assess likely public health impacts of testing. METHODS. We used data on potential exposure to workplace hazards, <b>medical</b> <b>testing,</b> unionization, firm size, and turnover from the National Occupational Hazards Survey and the National Occupational Exposure Survey. Other sources provided industry-specific data on wages and turnover. Logistic regression analysis estimated the relationship of economic variables and workplace health risks to the prevalence of <b>medical</b> <b>testing.</b> RESULTS. Economic variables {{were related to the}} prevalence of testing. However, consistent positive relationships were not found between health hazards and testing. CONCLUSIONS. Employers' testing decisions may not be beneficial to the health of workers and may shift the costs of illness to workers or other employers. Safer firms may provide too much <b>medical</b> <b>testing,</b> and firms that are less safe may provide too little...|$|R
5|$|Cancer {{screening}} uses <b>medical</b> <b>tests</b> {{to detect}} disease in {{large groups of}} people who have no symptoms. For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to {{it in a way that}} prolongs life. This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%). High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.|$|E

Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper.

5|$|Army {{commitments}} intervened {{during the}} 1943 season. Lindwall {{had attempted to}} enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force, but he was rejected because the employees of his firm were exempted from military service. Thus Lindwall resigned his job in order to join the army. As part of his Anti-aircraft and Fortress Signal unit, he was deployed in May 1943 to New Guinea as the Japanese reached the Kokoda Trail close to Port Moresby. Lindwall's unit were bombed while they were ashore and he was lucky not to be killed. In 1945, he returned from the Solomon Islands, where he was believed to have contracted malaria and Dengue fever, although <b>medical</b> <b>tests</b> did not confirm this, he needed injections and atebrin tablets to aid him in recovering from bouts of minor illness for some time afterwards, and he resumed State cricket in 1945–46, despite the rigours of war having reduced him to just 73kg, which was thin for his height of 178cm.|$|E

5|$|The club's {{pre-season}} {{began on}} 8 July with {{two days of}} <b>medical</b> <b>tests.</b> Benfica's first training session was held two days later, nine days before their first pre-season match with Estoril. After a draw with Estori, the club lost Guadiana Trophy matches to Blackburn Rovers and Sporting CP. That week Benfica made more squad adjustments, paying €5million for 18-year old Sidnei and releasing Petit after six years with the club. Early in August, Benfica won the Cidade de Guimarães Trophy against Paris Saint-Germain and Vitória de Guimarães, drawing with the former and defeating the latter. Before their presentation match with Feyenoord, Benfica signed Spanish winger José Antonio Reyes in a €2.6 million loan deal. In the match with Feyenoord, Óscar Cardozo scored the winning goal for Benfica. The club ended its preparation for the season against Inter Milan on 15 August in the new Eusébio Cup. After a goalless draw in regular time, the Milanese won on penalties.|$|E
5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and <b>medical</b> <b>tests</b> reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E
