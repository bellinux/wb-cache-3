2500|$|Air {{ambulance}} {{services in the}} United States can be operated {{by a variety of}} sources. Some services are hospital-operated, while others may be operated by Federal, State or local government; or through a variety of departments, including local or State police, the United States Park Service, or Fire Departments. [...] Such services may be operated directly by any of these EMS systems, or they may be contracted to a third-party provider, such as an aircraft charter company. [...] In addition, {{it is not uncommon for}} U.S. military helicopters to be pressed into service providing air ambulance support. [...] The vast distances covered by the U.S. mean that while helicopters may be the preferred form of service delivery for 'on-scene' emergencies, fixed wing aircraft, including small jets, are often used for transfers from rural hospitals to tertiary care sites. [...] These aircraft are typically staffed by a mix of personnel including physicians, nurses, and paramedics, and in some cases, by all three. [...] Publicly operated air ambulance service is supplemented by emergency and non-emergency air transport service, which may be provided by dedicated air ambulance companies, or by aircraft charter companies as a 'sideline' business operation. Air Ambulance companies are not all considered the same. Some are brokers that farm-out the air <b>medical</b> <b>transports</b> other are highly accredited by accrediting organizations like CAMTS.|$|E

50|$|The Syrian {{civil war}} {{has been marked by}} {{widespread}} human rights abuses, including numerous violations of medical neutrality. Government forces have invaded, attacked, and misused hospitals and <b>medical</b> <b>transports,</b> preventing civilians from receiving health care.

An investigation by Physicians for Human Rights revealed that these circumstances have led to the rise of an underground health network.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of Red Rovers {{commissioning}} as a hospital ship, the Union was already using steamers such as the City of Memphis as <b>medical</b> <b>transports</b> to carry casualties upriver.

50|$|Vlieland {{heliport}} (Dutch: Helihaven Vlieland) {{is a small}} heliport used {{mainly by}} the Royal Netherlands Air Force for search and rescue flights or <b>medical</b> <b>transports</b> from the island of Vlieland. It was home to one Agusta-Bell 412SP rescue helicopter, which was usually stationed on the island {{during the day and}} at Leeuwarden Air Base at night until it was retired in 2016. While the heliport remains under military control, medevac operations are now carried out primarily using an Airbus Helicopters H145 operated by ANWB.

50|$|In 2006, a user pays {{pricing policy}} was {{appointed}} by law, under which mountaingoers (both domestic and foreigners) are required {{to pay for the}} cost of their rescue. This effectively forced mountaingoers to take out a special kind of insurance, which covers the costs for the rescue in case of an emergency. The costs of a rescue need to be covered even if visitors get into an emergency situation staying on marked official paths. Exception of this policy are EMS and <b>medical</b> <b>transports</b> (including by helicopter) resulting from accidents on marked ski slopes in skiing resorts, which are covered by common health insurances. Search and Rescue operations are not covered by common health insurances.|$|E
50|$|Adding to the {{challenges}} faced by the emergency system in the land-locked city of Juneau are the influx of upwards of 18,000 additional people a day from cruise ship and tourist traffic during the summer months. May through September, CCFR hires four additional firefighter/EMT’s to staff a Basic Life Support ambulance downtonwn in a seasonal hire program to facilitate <b>medical</b> <b>transports</b> from the cruise ships, Bartlett Regional Hospital and air ambulance services. During this five-month period the extra ambulance will handle approximately 500 calls for service. This program frees up the Advanced Life Support ambulances to continue to respond to emergencies that require the higher level of care. This has {{reduced the number of}} times that all in-service ambulances were unavailable due to the call load and reduced response times across the city and borough.|$|E
