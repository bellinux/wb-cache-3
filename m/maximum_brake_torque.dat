50|$|Water has a {{very high}} heat of vaporization. As the ambient {{temperature}} water is injected into the engine, heat transfers from the hot cylinder head and intake air into the water. This makes it evaporate, cooling the intake charge. A cooler intake charge means it is more dense (higher volumetric efficiency) and also has a lower tendency to knock. However, the water vapor displaces some air, negating some of the denser intake charge benefit. Knocking is generally {{more of a problem}} in forced induction engines rather than naturally aspirated, so this can help prevent it. On electronic ignition systems the ignition timing is generally retarded to prevent knock from occurring but with water injection it can be advanced closer to <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> (MBT) timing for additional power.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque,</b> a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is to be equal to the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> In the case of normal braking, the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is chosen as the smaller one between the overall <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> and the command <b>braking</b> <b>torque.</b> To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is smaller than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is bigger than the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system, the whole <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time.

40|$|Eddy current brake (ECB) is an {{attractive}} contactless brake whereas it suffers from <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation when the rotating speed increases. To stabilize the ECB’s torque generation property, this paper introduces the concept of anti-magneto-motive force to develop the ECB model on the fundamental of magnetic circles. In the developed model, the eddy current demagnetization {{and the influence of}} temperature which make the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> attenuation are clearly presented. Using the developed model of ECB, the external and internal characteristics of the ECB are simulated through programming by MATLAB. To find the sensibility of the influences on ECB’s torque generation stability, the stability indexes are defined and followed by a sensibility analysis on the internal parameters of an ECB.

40|$|The {{brake torque}} of a direct-{{injection}} diesel engine {{is known to}} plateau over a range of injection timings. Injection timing affects the engine?s ignition delay and the fractions of fuel which burn in premixed and diffusion modes. Therefore, the characteristics of combustion for swept injection timings along the <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> plateau are determined. The research is conducted by varying injection timing at constant engine speed and load while measuring engine emissions and in-cylinder pressure, revealing the premixed and diffusion burn fractions as well as important engine and exhaust design criteria such as maximum in-cylinder pressure and exhaust composition. These results are significant in diesel engine design because cheaper, lighter engines may be built if desired <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> may be produced with lower peak in-cylinder pressures. More critically, different emissions composition profiles exist for the desired <b>maximum</b> <b>brake</b> <b>torque,</b> which will allow designers to choose injection calibrations which favor some emissions over others.

The objective {{of this study is to}} clarify the effects of blade lean angle on hydraulic retarder performance. In this article, we employ a computational fluid dynamic approach to numerically investigate the fluid flow of a hydraulic retarder for rotor blade lean angles of 35 °, 40 °, 43 °, and 45 ° in the direction of rotation, where the stator employs an equivalent angle, and all other geometries are held constant. The numerical results of the <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> were validated against available experimental results. Analyses of torque performance, flow field, and energy loss are conducted in this study. Additionally, the outer loop oil flow rate is used as another indicator of hydraulic retarder heat exchange performance.

A digital controller design was chosen which combines a fuzzy logic element and a decision logic network. The controller identifies the current road condition and generates a command braking pressure signal, based on current and past readings of the slip ratio and brake pressure. The controller detects wheel blockage immediately and avoids excessive slipping. The ABS system performance is examined on a quarter vehicle model with nonlinear elastic suspension. The parallelity of the fuzzy logic evaluation process ensures rapid computation of the controller output signal, requiring less time and fewer computation steps than controllers with adaptive identification.

In this thesis a new class of locking mechanisms is investigated: a combination between a singular- and a friction locking mechanism (singular-friction locker) which is statically balanced with one additional spring. This combination of three types of locking mechanisms results in a locking mechanism that has an infinite number of locking positions, can unlock well under load and has an absolute zero actuation force in a singular configuration. In all other configurations the mechanism is theoretically in static balance. The first part of this thesis investigates rigid body type statically balanced singular-friction lockers (SBS-FLs) and works towards a classification of all possible classes of SBS-FLs. This classification contains nine types of rigid body SBS-FLs, consisting of one linkage type class of lockers and eight cam type classes of lockers. In the second part of this thesis different embodiments of SBS-FL {{mechanisms are}} investigated on their ability to become a very compact locking device. From five different concepts the highest compactness is obtained by a locking mechanism with a rotational cam input and a rotational follower connected to torsion springs. This mechanism is build and all design aspects are reported. In the third and last part of this thesis the performance and the characteristics of the prototype are investigated. The locking device has a zero actuation torque in the 'engaged' and 'disengaged' (singular) configurations and a maximum actuation torque of 0. 035 Nm when switching 'on' and 'off' in 5 seconds. This is a 97 % reduction of the actuation torque compared to a regular <b>brake.</b> The <b>maximum</b> <b>braking</b> <b>torque</b> is 0. 83 Nm in clockwise direction and 0. 75 Nm in counter clockwise direction.

The split pillar works not only as the mother body of ESR cross arm, but also as the rotation driving device of the cross arm. Since the tremendous mass of the cross arm and electrodes, serious inertia torque generates when the split pillar rotates, which leads to motion instability and problems of angle location and even safety threatens. In this paper, based on virtual machine technology, dynamic research of the rotation process of the electroslag-remelting-furnace split pillar was proceeded; influences of driving torque applied on the split pillar was researched, as the driving torque being constant, anti-step and with <b>brake</b> <b>torque.</b> 3 D solid model of the split pillar and clamping device were established; main technical parameters were accomplished; and simulation research of the dynamic process was proceeded. It was found that, appropriate <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> was important to better motion stability of the split pillar. The best <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> was acquired, and the action time of the <b>brake</b> <b>torque</b> was obtained...|$|R
