The underlying LIBOR interest rates are assumed to follow the LIBOR market model. For this PDE problem the existence and uniqueness of solution are obtained in the classical framework of uniformly parabolic PDEs {{in terms of a}} sequence of nested Cauchy problems. Moreover, this approach allows to obtain a new numerical method based on the approximation by computable fundamental solutions of constant coefficient operators. This method is compared with classical Monte Carlo simulation and a proposed characteristics Crank-Nicolson time discretization combined with finite elements strategy.

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the <b>M</b> <b>65</b> and <b>M</b> <b>65</b> ED assays for differentiation among significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis were 0. 66 and 0. 76, 0. 66 and 0. 73, and 0. 74 and 0. 82, respectively. In multivariate analysis, high <b>M</b> <b>65</b> ED (hazard ratio 6. 13; 95 % confidence interval 1. 18 - 31. 69; P = 0. 031) and severe fibrosis (hazard ratio 7. 45; 95 % confidence interval 1. 82 - 30. 51; P = 0. 005) were independently associated with liver-related death, transplantation, or decompensation. High serum <b>M</b> <b>65</b> ED was also significantly associated with poor outcome in PBC (log-rank test; P = 0. 001).

We conducted <b>M</b> 30 /M <b>65</b> analyses on 34 patients with TC before and during treatment with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin and showed that prechemotherapy serum levels of <b>M</b> <b>65</b> and <b>M</b> 30 antigens are correlated with established TC tumor markers lactate dehydrogenase, alpha-fetoprotein, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, probably reflecting tumor load.

Serum <b>M</b> <b>65</b> and <b>M</b> 30 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analysis of variance was used for comparison among groups; q-test was used for pairwise comparison.

Though the b value immediately after the M 7.3 quake fluctuated due to many aftershocks following the quake, the b values after this period were significantly larger than those before the <b>M</b> <b>6.5</b> quake.

National Science Foundation This report summarizes the description of occurrence and characteristics of the crystalline salt deposits found on and beneath the morains {{on the bottom of}} the Miers Valley, in this report these deposits are called "evapontes" although the mechanism of the formation of these deposits is still obscure. The mam characteristics of the climate in the Dry Valley are quite arid condition and comparatively high temperatures in summer and strong wind, which are considered to be ascribed chiefly to the low albedo of widely exposed rocks to the insolation in summer and the compressional effect (pseudofoehn phenomenon) of katabatic wind. These circumstances may have a close relation to the mechanism of formation of the evapontes. The Miers Valley was once covered with glaciers and by the retreat of the glaciers the U-shaped valley was formed, the floor of which being widely covered with moraines. The moraines are composed of undifferentiated material of the Koettlitz Glacier origin, which was grouped into four types by BLANK. The moraines are quite flat in part, suggesting a levelling action of water (lake water?). Patterned ground is commonly developed in the moraines Lake Miers is located at the bottom of the valley and ill-defined old strand lines of the lake can be observed The lake water is not saline probably because of the presence of an outlet stream. The evaporites can be grouped into three types by the mode of occurrence (1) platelike aggregates of crystals spread over the flat moraines (Sample Nos. <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 60, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 80, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 90, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 1001, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 1002, Photo 3), (2) cloddy crystal aggregates on the ridge of moraines, some of which lie directly on the core of ice (Sample Nos <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 30, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 402, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 401, Photo. 4) and, (3) horizontal layers interbedded with moraines, exposed on the flank of a gorge which was formed by downcutting of an outlet stream (Sample Nos <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 501, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 502, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 503, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 504, <b>65</b> <b>M</b> 506, Photo 5) Samples of the deposits were analyzed mineralogically and chemically X-ray diffraction pattern and emission spectrogram were also taken.
