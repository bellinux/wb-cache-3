2500|$|Horizontal {{bandsaws}} {{hold the}} workpiece stationary while the blade swings {{down through the}} cut. [...] This configuration is used to cut long materials such as pipe or bar stock to length. Thus {{it is an important}} part of the facilities in most machine shops. The horizontal design is not useful for cutting curves or complicated shapes. [...] Small horizontal bandsaws typically employ a gravity feed alone, retarded to an adjustable degree by a coil spring; on industrial models, the rate of descent is usually controlled by a hydraulic cylinder that bleeds through an adjustable valve. [...] When the saw is set up for a cut, the operator raises the saw, positions the material to be cut underneath the blade, and then turns on the saw. [...] The blade slowly descends into the material, cutting it as the band blade moves. When the cut is complete, a switch is tripped and the saw automatically turns off. [...] More sophisticated versions of this type of saw are partially or entirely automated (via PLC or CNC) for high-volume cutting of machining blanks. Such machines provide a stream of cutting fluid recirculated from a sump, in the same manner that a CNC <b>machining</b> <b>center</b> does.|$|E

Due to Weibull model’s versatility and relative simplicity and artificial neural networks’ (ANNs) high capability of approximating, they are widely used in reliability engineering and elsewhere. Considering the advantages of these two models, this paper defined a novel model: Weibull neural network (WNN). WNN inherits the hierarchical structure from ANNs which include three layers, namely, input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Based on more than 3000 [*]h field test data of CNC <b>machining</b> <b>centers,</b> WNN has been successfully applied in comprehensive operation data analysis.

40|$|This {{paper will}} address the {{realistic}} need {{for the use of}} redundancy in communications of control systems within an industrial complex. In today’s environment there is much concern for redundancy to keep production facilities up and running. This is an area of prime importance as the cost of downtime and lost production can often times make the difference between profit and loss. Often times money is spent on unnecessary components for redundancy. Hopefully this session will serve as a guide to help decision makers arrive at the correct needs to support their facilities. This paper will use as its prime example a recently constructed and currently operating $ 25 million Sawmill. The operation being used as a model produces lumber that is manufactured from the primary breakdown of logs processed through 9 <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> to result in a finished product ready for shipment. The manufacturing process utilizes State of the Art Laser optimization that passes information from the scanners to the PLCs. The Sawmill was started up in the summer of 2004. The platforms supported throughout the Sawmill include; Ethernet, ControlNet, DataHighway +, Serial, QNX (operating system), wireless and remote dial-up support. These communication platforms are used to control I/O and communicate machine status between <b>machine</b> <b>centers.</b> In addition, the communications handle data acquisition, HMI and reporting over the company wide intranet. The <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> utilize VFD drives that are synchronized with upstream and down stream drives between <b>machine</b> <b>centers.</b> The fact that the <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> each have separate PLC systems emphasizes the need that reliable communication is of the highest priority. With the loss of information as to the status of an adjacent <b>machine</b> <b>center,</b> the results could be catastrophic both to the safety of personnel as well as to production and damage of equipment.

40|$|Scheduling is an {{important}} process widely used in manufacturing, production, management, computer science, and so on. Appropriate scheduling not only reduces manufacturing costs but also reduces possibilities for violating due dates. Finding good schedules for given sets of jobs can thus help factory supervisors effectively control job flows and provide solutions for job sequencing. In simple flow shop problems, each <b>machine</b> operation <b>center</b> includes just one machine. If at least one <b>machine</b> <b>center</b> includes more than one machine, the scheduling problem becomes a flexible flow-shop problem. Flexible flow shops can thus {{be thought of as}} generalizations of simple flow shops.

40|$|We {{consider}} a generalization of the permutation flow shop problem of scheduling n jobs on m <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> which more appropriately represents several production scheduling problems. Each center consists of parallel identical machines, each job consists of ordered operations {{that have to}} be processed on machines from different <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> where the sequence in which the jobs pass through the <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> is identical for all jobs. The problem is to find an optimal sequence (schedule) in which n jobs pass through each <b>machine</b> <b>center,</b> keeping the sequence same for each center. In addition to the hybrid flow shop problem, we also consider the following generalizations, which enhances its practical use. The processing times of the operations on some machines may vary between a minimum and a maximum value dependent on the use of a continuously-divisable resource. We {{consider a}} nonregular criterion based on due dates which are not a priori given but can be fixed by a decision-maker. A due date assignment cost is included into the objective function. For this generalization, we propose a heuristic constructive algorithm based on job insertion techniques and heuristic iterative algorithms. For the latter, we primarily deal with the design of suitable neighbourhoods of a solution. Computational results for problems with up to 20 jobs and 10 <b>machine</b> <b>centers</b> are given.

50|$|Milling can be {{done with}} a wide range of machine tools. The {{original}} class of machine tools for milling was the milling machine (often called a mill).

The integration of milling into turning environments and of turning into milling environments, begun with live tooling for lathes and the occasional use of mills for turning operations, led to a new class of machine tools, multitasking machines (MTMs), which are purpose-built to provide for a default machining strategy of using any combination of milling and turning within the same work envelope.|$|R
