50|$|Odynerus spinipes, the spiny <b>mason</b> <b>wasp,</b> is {{a species}} of potter wasp from western Europe. It is the type species of the genus Odynerus, being first {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758.|$|E
50|$|Pseudodynerus quadrisectus is {{a species}} of solitary <b>mason</b> <b>wasp</b> in the genus Pseudodynerus and family Eumenidae, first {{described}} by Thomas Say in 1837. It includes the subspecies P. q aztecus (Saussure, 1857).|$|E
50|$|<b>Mason</b> <b>wasps</b> create nests with mud, {{constructing}} {{one or more}} separate chambers {{for their}} larvae, each stocked with an insect food source. <b>Mason</b> <b>wasps</b> are also known as potter wasps for the pot-like nests some other species build, but pseudodynerus quadrisectus builds in existing cavities in wood, sometimes those previously used by other hymenoptera like the carpenter bee.|$|R

50|$|Potter <b>wasps</b> (or <b>mason</b> <b>wasps),</b> the Eumeninae, are a {{cosmopolitan}} wasp group presently {{treated as a}} subfamily of Vespidae, but sometimes recognized {{in the past as}} a separate family, Eumenidae.|$|R
50|$|Prawle cliffs are {{the only}} site in the UK for the rare cuckoo bee Nomada sexfasciata, this is a cleptoparasite of the Long-horned mining bee Eucera longicornis. Another rare species of {{particular}} note is the <b>mason</b> <b>wasp</b> Euodynerus quadrifasciatus. Currently, this is only known from three sites in the UK: East Prawle, West Weare (Portland, Dorset), and Thursley Common (Surrey).|$|E
50|$|Ruined Kingdoms {{contains}} adventures for Al-Qadim set in long-lost Nog and Kadar. In these adventures, {{the player}} characters meet the gibbering beggar-prophet Adil, find a cursed ceramic disk, meet a pleasant <b>mason</b> <b>wasp,</b> fight yak men, and {{run afoul of}} an ancient Arch-Geomancer. Traveling to the jungles of eastern Zakhara {{to solve the mystery}} of the disk, the PCs model for three giant sisters who sculpt topiary shrubs, fight serpent cultists, visit the Isle of the Elephant, and learn that one PC is the long-lost heir of a rich merchant family.|$|E
40|$|Pison morosum is {{a smaller}} relativr {{of the better}} known <b>mason</b> <b>wasp</b> P [...] spinolae. In this, the first {{published}} article on its behaviour, evidence is presented to show that P. morosum preys on small, usually immature spiders. It stores then 1 in clay cells in the vacant tunnels of wood-boring beetle larvae. Cell stocking is variable, but many spiders are normally required for each cell. Some overlap in prey taken exists between the 2 species of Pison and so they probably compete to some extent. In its behaviour P. morosum displays an interesting tactic to help capturc its main prey-the cobweb spider Achaearanea ueruculata. It bumps into the web, triggering off the dropping response of the spider, so making the capture easier...|$|E
50|$|P. metricus {{belongs to}} the kingdom Animalia (animals), the phylum Arthropoda (arthropods), the subphylum Hexapoda (having six feet), the class Insecta (insects), the order Hymenoptera (which {{includes}} ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies), the taxon Aculeata (which includes stinging wasps, bees, and ants), the superfamily Vespoidea (which includes hornets, yellowjackets, paper <b>wasps,</b> potter <b>wasps,</b> <b>mason</b> <b>wasps,</b> and pollen wasps), the family Vespidae, the subfamily Polistinae (paper wasps), the genus Polistes, and the species metricus.|$|R
25|$|M. drewseni is {{a member}} of the Vespidae family, which is broken down into four subfamilies: Paper Wasps ({{subfamily}}: Polistinae), Pollen Wasps (subfamily: Masarinae), Potter and <b>Mason</b> <b>Wasps</b> (subfamily: Eumeninae), and Yellow Jackets (subfamily: Vespinae). Within the Vespidae family, M. drewseni belongs to the subfamily Polistinae which is typically found in tropical regions and comprises 25 genera. Within the Polistinae is the tribe Epiponini containing many genera, all of which, including M. drewseni, are found in the new world. The asymmetrical tarsal lobes of the genus Mischocyttarus separates it from other Epiponini. Mischocyttarus larvae also have distinct first thoracic spiracles. The genus Mischocyttarus is the largest genus of social wasps. In fact, there are 186 species in this genus.|$|R
50|$|P. annularis is {{classified}} {{as part of the}} kingdom Animalia, the phylum Arthropoda, the subphylum Hexapoda, the class Insecta, the order Hymenoptera, the suborder Aculeata, the superfamily Vespoidea, and the family Vespidae. Its subphylum Hexapoda indicates it has six feet; the order Hymenoptera includes ants, bees, wasps, and sawflies; the Aculeata include ants, bees, and stinging wasps in particular; the Vespoidea include yellow jackets, hornets, paper <b>wasps,</b> potter <b>wasps,</b> <b>mason</b> <b>wasps,</b> and pollen wasps. The genus name Polistes is most likely derived from the Greek polistes (πολιστης) which is translated as “founder of a city”. The species name annularis is the Latin word that means “ringed”. A common name for P. annularis is the red paper wasp, due to its distinctive red coloration.|$|R
50|$|The first {{recorded}} host of Melittoboa australica was Pison spinolae, however, the primary hosts are leaf cutting bees Megachile spp, <b>mason</b> <b>wasps</b> and mud dauber wasps {{but it is}} catholic in its choice of hosts. There are no indigenous social wasps in Australia but in New Zealand and North America it has been recorded in the nests of Vespula species, as well as nests of Polistes, Bombus and honeybees Apis mellifera. The bombyliid fly Anthrax angularis and the ichneumonid Stenarella victoriae are parasites in the nests of Sceliphron spp and have been recorded as being viable hosts for M. australica. In addition, M. australica were found on dipteran puparia found in the nests of Sceliphron which {{are thought to be}} parasites on the spiders stocked in empty cells by the wasps.|$|R
25|$|V. {{squamosa}} {{is commonly}} called the southern yellowjacket. This species {{was discovered by}} Dru Drury around 1770. It {{is a member of}} the Vespidae family, which includes paper wasps (subfamily: Polistinae), pollen wasps (subfamily: Masarinae), potter and <b>mason</b> <b>wasps</b> (subfamily: Eumeninae), and yellow jackets (subfamily: Vespinae). The Vespidae family has about 4000 species, the majority of which are not social. Within the Vespinae subfamily, however, the roughly 80 species are all eusocial, including V. squamosa. They create either annual or perennial nests, and some species, including V. squamosa, are parasites to other Vespinae species. Within the subfamily of Vespinae, the four genera are Provespa, Vespa, Dolichovespula, and Vespula. Within the Vespula genus are 18 species. The southern yellowjacket is fairly closely related to V. maculifrons (eastern yellowjacket), and V. squamosa is a social parasite of V. maculifrons. V. squamosa is also closely related to V. rufa.|$|R
40|$|In morphology, coloration, and size, Pseudabispa wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Eumeninae) closely {{resemble}} <b>mason</b> <b>wasps</b> in the genus Abispa, and their distributions overlap. Although these two genera {{are among the}} largest solitary wasps in Australia, the biology of Pseudabispa was not previously known. Field observations from near Katherine, Northern Territory, strongly suggest that P. paragioides (Meade-Waldo) females attack and kill female A. ephippium (Fabricius) and usurp their nests, then appropriate cells, mass provision them with caterpillars acquired by theft from still other nests, and close them with mud taken from the host nest. Despite an abundance of potentially available cells in nests of three other large solitary wasps common at the same site, P. paragioides was found associated only with nests of A. ephippium. This unusual report of apparently forcible and lethal interspecific nest takeover for a non-social wasp parallels behaviors previously known only from socially parasitic eusocial Hymenoptera. Exploitation by P. paragioides {{may help explain why}} its host displays some of the most highly developed parental care known in any solitary eumenid, and why its nests are spaced widely from one another...|$|R
5000|$|One of his Broadway shows, his two-act Politically Incorrect (1994-95) {{which ran}} for 347 {{performances}} at Broadway's John Golden Theater. Critic John Simon of Time wrote: [...] "His method is hyperbole and reductio ad absurdum, but always informed by bitter reason. His irony is a spotlight illuminating our absurdities; his zingers are scalpels laying bare the sickness under the skin. There is a unifying thrust, a focus, a structure: {{an attack on}} both liberal hypocrisy and conservative apathy, and on the climate of political correctness that {{makes it impossible to}} attack anyone but <b>WASPs....</b> <b>Mason</b> is a true satirist in the mold of ... Mark Twain ...." [...] It was performed during the same period that Bill Maher's late-night, half-hour political TV talk show Politically Incorrect was on the air. Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason's production, which was dismissed as frivolous. Mason was able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television interfaith sitcom called Chicken Soup alongside Lynn Redgrave.|$|R
