40|$|Abstract. In {{areas like}} <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>communications,</b> {{transportation}} or aerospace, the increasing size {{and complexity of}} reactive systems make their verification difficult to handle. Compositional reasoning {{is a way to}} master this problem. In this paper, we propose an approach based on a constraint synchronized product to specify and to verify such systems. This approach supports a compositional refinement for both labelled transition systems and their composition. In this framework, we show how to verify local and global invariance properties during a refinement verification. Thus, these properties are preserved through refinement. The different aspects of our work are illustrated on the example of a communication protocol between an integrated chip card and a reader interface device...|$|E
40|$|Colloque avec actes et comité de lecture. Manufacturing {{applications}} are today distributed and integrated, relying on {{different types of}} communication networks to interconnect the different levels of the systems' architecture. This paper discusses the main topics on <b>manufacturing</b> <b>communications</b> from the applications requirements to the most common solutions derived to fulfill them. Temporal and spatial properties of the data to be exchanged are analysed. Data is classified as periodic, aperiodic and sporadic and, for these types, the communication system performance requirements are identified with emphasis on the real-time aspects. A similar discussion is carried on in what concerns the size of data to be transferred per transaction. The use of multimedia and of wide-area communication is also briefly explored. Solutions for different levels of the CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing) architecture are identified and an overview of their characteristics is presented. This includes a short description of their organization under the OSI Reference Model and a more detailed discussion on techniques for traffic scheduling. This discussion is mainly focussed on the techniques to control the access to the communications medium and {{on the use of}} static or dynamic scheduling. This has essentially in consideration the fulfilment of the data temporal constraints. A short overview of the possibilities opened by the use of Internet in these applications is also included...|$|E
40|$|Using the {{marginal}} {{effective tax rate}} (METR) analysis for Uganda and its neighboring countries, this study demonstrates that it is indeed possible that, even when a country's public revenue is low at the macroeconomic level, rapidly increasing taxation may pose a constraint to private investment at the microeconomic level. There are two reasons. First, while the enterprise sector in these economies is typically small, it represents {{a high proportion of}} the effective tax base. Second, access to credit is limited, particularly for smaller firms, and hence most private investment is financed by profits. As a result, taxation reduces both the expected revenue from investment projects and the liquidity to finance them. From the perspective of foreign investors, Uganda is more highly taxed than Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda's tax disadvantage results mainly from its property tax, the depreciation allowance on buildings, and its high fuel taxation. As inventories and buildings are the highest taxed assets in Uganda, industries investing heavily in them (tourism, <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>communications)</b> incur a higher METR than the other sectors. Tax administration, if not fair and efficient, can distort the best intentions of policy-makers and can in practice produce a very different tax burden than intended. Using firm survey evidence, we identify several factors that can alter a METR based on the formal tax regime, includin...|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} 50 years, the {{morphology}} for satellites has remained fundamentally unchanged despite evolutions in <b>manufacturing,</b> <b>communications,</b> and software occurring in other industries. Primary spacecraft support systems—power, attitude control, and others—are {{designed in the}} same way, whether in space telescopes, large communications satellites, interplanetary spacecraft, or Cubesats. This paradigm has been {{the status quo in}} spacecraft design and construction and has precluded any industry-wide, large-scale cost savings while maintaining performance. To change this trend and ensure performance and utility at low cost, that can scale, DARPA postulated the concept of a cellularized satellite, or “satlet,” as a satellite architectural unit. In this new morphology, each satlet would provide some fraction of the overall functions that, when aggregated via hardware and software, provide spacecraft space system with its complete required capabilities. The DARPA Phoenix program has developed this satlet morphology in Phase I and plans to validate and demonstrate it in a series of steps that exercise various applications and levels of configuration flexibility enabled by a satlet architecture. The first system experiment is planned to be conducted on orbit in 2015. This paper aims to take a deeper look at the potential impact of space systems with cellular based designs, and using historical data showcases how design, production and ultimately cost can form the foundation for next generation spacecraft opportunities. A first order analysis conducted in a previous paper indicated that U. S. -launched satellites alone could create a market demand for 2, 000 - 8, 000 satlets flown per year, while the overall annual world satellite market could create demand for 10, 000 - 40, 000 satlets. This paper explores the instantiation of a cellular morphology to design, production and development to further quantify the impact of this revolutionary space system capability...|$|E
