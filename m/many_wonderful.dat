25|$|At {{the close}} of the sixteenth century the city was large, well formed, and remarkably healthy; most of its houses were built of brick and mortar with tiled roofs; the streets were broad, the chief of them with room enough for ten ox-carriages to drive abreast; and among its public {{buildings}} were large number of stone mosques, each with two large minarets and <b>many</b> <b>wonderful</b> inscriptions.

He was granted a British patent in 1885. Gold mirrors and gold mirrored signs were very popular in English public houses (pubs) in the late Victorian era and <b>many</b> <b>wonderful</b> examples of the art can be found all over Britain today. Felix Andres, a sign painter in San Francisco, introduced a process for spray gilding glass in 1923, but the fashion for elaborate detail in signs was changing to the modern neon style and his business was not successful.|$|E

500|$|During {{a three-week}} {{vacation}} visit to Ireland in October 1973, Morrison wrote {{seven of the}} songs that made up his next album, Veedon Fleece. Though it attracted scant initial attention, its critical stature grew markedly over the years—with Veedon Fleece now often considered {{to be one of}} Morrison's most impressive and poetic works. In a 2008 Rolling Stone review, Andy Greene writes that when released in late 1974: [...] "it was greeted by a collective shrug by the rock critical establishment" [...] and concludes: [...] "He's released <b>many</b> <b>wonderful</b> albums since, but he's never again hit the majestic heights of this one." [...] "You Don't Pull No Punches, but You Don't Push the River", one of the album's side closers, exemplifies the long, hypnotic, cryptic Morrison with its references to visionary poet William Blake and to the seemingly Grail-like Veedon Fleece object.|$|E
