25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the breast(s) with grafts of autologous fat is a non-implant alternative to further surgery after a breast cancer surgery, be it a lumpectomy or a breast removalsimple (total) mastectomy, radical mastectomy, <b>modified</b> <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> skin-sparing mastectomy, and subcutaneous (nipple-sparing) mastectomy. The breast is reconstructed by first applying external tissue expansion to the recipient-site tissues (adipose, glandular) to create a breast-tissue matrix that can be injected with autologous fat grafts (adipocyte tissue); the reconstructed breast has a natural form, look, and feel, and is generally sensate throughout and in the nipple-areola complex (NAC). The {{reconstruction of}} breasts with fat grafts requires a three-month treatment periodbegun after 3–5 weeks of external vacuum expansion of the recipient-site tissues. The autologous breast-filler fat is harvested by liposuction from the patient's body (buttocks, thighs, abdomen), is refined and then is injected (grafted) to the breast-tissue matrices (recipient sites), where the fat will thrive.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a {{homogeneous}} series of 319 <b>modified</b> <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomies</b> where both pectoralis muscles are respected, in the treatment of breast cancer. Operative mortality is nill and morbidity is low. Persistant lymphedema of the arm is not marked. The frequency of axillary nodes is 64 %. Local recurrences occur in 12 % of cases. Total 5 year survival was 50. 1 %. It was 89 % for stage I, 57. 3 % for stage II and 43. 7 % for stage 222. It was 61. 5 % if there were no involved nodes, 63. 9 % when 1 to 3 nodes were involved and 32 % when 4 or more nodes were involved. The authors recommend this type of operation of tumors of state II and III as the 5 year survival is identical to that of other techniques, as morbidity and mortality are low and distant sequellae are unimportant.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Women {{diagnosed}} with early breast cancer {{have had the}} opportunity to receive breast-conserving surgical treatment, which reduces the physical and psychological morbidity heretofore associated with breast removal. METHODS. Nonclinical factors associated with women receiving partial mastectomies with radiation (P + R) compared with <b>modified</b> <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomies</b> without radiation (MOR) were examined in 2238 Black and White women diagnosed, in 1985 through 1987, with early-stage breast cancer in the metropolitan Detroit area. RESULTS. Age at diagnosis and size of hospital were the strongest predictors of type of surgery received, with younger women (less than 55 years of age) and women treated in larger hospitals (more than 500 beds) more than twice as likely to receive P + R. Stratifying on race, age at diagnosis remained the strongest predictor for White women, followed by hospital size. Among Black women, hospital size was more strongly associated with surgery received than was age. CONCLUSIONS. Younger women and women undergoing treatment at large hospitals are more likely to receive the breast-conserving P + R.

40|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} after {{breast cancer}} surgery represents a positive step in restoring a women’s idea of self by reestablishing her feminine features and confidence, thus improving essential aesthetic and emotional aspects. Regarded as the cornerstone {{in breast cancer}} management, the surgical treatment {{has come a long}} way since 1884 when W. S.

Among the 13 patients with positive IPN, there were no differences in tumor size or location from the entire group. The two patients whose only nodal metastases were to the IPN are currently disease-free without having received systemic adjuvant therapy. These data suggest that for early breast cancers treated by MRM, routine excision of the IPN is of potential therapeutic or prognostic benefit in very few cases.

40|$|Introduction: Breast {{cancer is}} the most common of all {{malignant}} neoplasms in women worldwide. This study aims to demonstrate certain biological, clinical and pathological characteristics of patients treated at the university hospital oncology unit. Methods: A descriptive study was conducted during a period of 2 years, from October 2003 through September of 2005 in Kermanshah, Iran. 555 patients were selected to participate, representing all the cases diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. Data was gathered according to questionnaires and pa-tients’ records. Results: The mean age at which breast cancer was first diagnosed was 46. 5 ± 11. 6 year of age with 89 % of tumors being infiltrating intraductal carcinoma. The majority of the patient population had tumors stage II and grade II. Mean tumor size was 2. 14 ± 0. 57 centimeters. 58 % of the tumors were localized to the upper outer quadrant of the affected breast and 89 % of the patients received <b>modified</b> <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomies</b> with almost a 92 % two year survival. Conclusion: Highest prevalence of breast cancer was recorded in the 40 - 49 (mean 46) years of age group which compares favorably with studies done under similar circumstances.

After a biopsy determined that her tumor was cancerous, she resisted the then-standard radical mastectomy procedure, in which muscle tissue and lymph nodes were removed along with the breast.

40|$|Locally {{advanced}} {{breast cancer}} (LABC) represents 15 % of all non-metastatic breast cancers, {{with an overall}} poor prognosis, despite current guidelines that recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant radiation. Therefore, a novel treatment paradigm using concurrent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was proposed. A clinical trial was designed, where 32 LABC patients were treated with q 3 weekly 5 -fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for three cycles, followed by weekly docetaxel for 9 weeks with concurrent regional radiation (45 + 5. 4 Gy) for the first 6 weeks. Patients subsequently underwent <b>modified</b> <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomies.</b> Pathological complete responses (pCR) and 3 year overall survival rates were compared to a matched concurrent control cohort. The concurrent chemoradiation cohort saw {{a significant increase in}} pCR rate and a trend toward 15 % improvement in overall survival that failed to reach statistical significance. This regimen was not without toxicity, and 25 % of patients experienced grade 3 or greater dermatitis and 25 % experienced grade 3 or greater pneumonitis, resulting in one death. Tumour biomarker, plasma osteopontin, prior to chemotherapy was found to significantly predict for overall survival. In conclusion, LABC is an aggressive subset of breast cancer for which novel regimens must continue to be developed, taking advantage of the improved response to treatment with radiosensitivity seen in this concurrent chemoradiation regimen, but using alternative radiosensitizing agents to minimize toxicity...|$|R

METHODS: Between 1979 - 1987, 691 consecutive patients underwent mastectomy after a negative biopsy of the axillary apical lymph nodes. The median age of the patients was 59 years (range, 26 - 89 years). The clinical tumor size was 5 cm in 169 patients; 16 patients had a T 4 tumor. Surgery was comprised of a modification of the Halsted <b>radical</b> <b>mastectomy,</b> including {{at least part of the}} pectoralis major muscle and the entire pectoralis minor muscle, in 573 patients; 303 patients had positive axillary lymph nodes. Adjuvant radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes was given to 74 patients, whereas an additional 414 patients underwent irradiation to the internal mammary and medial supraclavicular lymph nodes. The median follow-up was 91 months. RESULTS: The actuarial overall survival rate was 82 % at 5 years and 63 % at 10 years.
