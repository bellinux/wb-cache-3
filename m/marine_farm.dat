Furthermore, the Tasmanian Department of Sea Fisheries, which grants <b>marine</b> <b>farming</b> leases and permits and adjudicates over appeals, is also responsible for the promotion and development of <b>marine</b> <b>farming</b> in Tasmania. Due to the rapid expansion of <b>marine</b> <b>farming</b> in the State, it is argued that the Department will be increasingly less able to resist pressure to allocate areas of the sea that are better suited for public rather than private use. The thesis identifies the vesting of parts of the sea as special <b>marine</b> <b>farming</b> areas by the Lands Department in the Department of Sea Fisheries as the point where Crown Land is designated for exclusive private use. A case study of eight <b>marine</b> <b>farming</b> areas in southern Tasmania supports the view that inadequate consideration was given to the public amenity.

40|$|The microsporidian Paranucleospora theridion was {{discovered}} in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar suffering from proliferative gill disease in a <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> in western Norway in 2008. The parasite develops in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, cells important for normal immune function. The {{aim of this study}} was to see if P. theridion could play a part in some of the diseases with unclear causes in salmon production in Norway, i. e. proliferative gill disease (PGI), pancreas disease (PD), heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) and cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS). P. theridion was present in all areas with salmon farming in Norway, but high prevalence and densities of the parasite in salmon and salmon lice were only seen in southern Norway. This region is also the main area for PGI and PD in Norway. Quantification of pathogens associated with PGI, PD, HSMI and CMS diagnoses showed that P. theridion levels are high in southern Norway, and may therefore play a role in susceptibility and disease development. However, among the different diagnoses, fish with PGI are particularly heavily infected with P. theridion. Therefore, P. theridion appears as a possible primary agent in cases with high mortality in connection with PGI in western Norway...|$|E
40|$|This study explores and {{provides}} new insight in {{to how the}} increase in sea surface temperature {{as a result of}} climate change may affect the marine farming industry and coastal zone management of New Zealand. As the world’s population grows and the effects of climate change intensify there will be a greater demand for sustainable food resources. Aquaculture can provide our growing population with this resource {{as long as there is}} effective environmental management. Policy and decision makers must review and consider the full array of effects climate change may have on the coastal zone and aquaculture. A marine farmer questionnaire was developed to gain insight into how current marine farmers viewed important variables in <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> site selection and climate change. A number of GIS techniques were used to identify what species are at risk of experiencing water temperatures that exceed their physiological threshold. A simple agent-based model was developed to estimate the potential loss in the numbers of those animals that may experience extreme water temperatures. Lastly, a suitability analysis was developed to identify alternative sites for farming the at risk species. A majority of marine farmers rated some important physical and social variables in <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> site selection as less important than farmers 15 years ago. A majority of marine farmers feel they are somewhat informed and have little concern for climate change. The King Salmon is at risk of experiencing water temperatures that exceed its physiological threshold. Around 15 - 66 % of the salmon currently being farmed in the Marlborough Sounds could be lost to water temperature greater than 17 °C. Alternative sites for farming salmon are located in the middle-lower regions of the South Island, New Zealand under the IPPC’s A 2 and B 1 emissions scenarios. The findings from this research are useful to organisations such as Aquaculture NZ and the Marine Farming Association in planning for the future of the industry. These findings are also useful to policy and decision makers for developing effective management strategies and in marine space allocation in the wake of climate change. This is a novel study for New Zealand, as very little research has been undertaken to explore the effects of climate change on the aquaculture industry and coastal zone management. Based on the results the current literature gaps in the body of knowledge are filled. It also provides a solution to help mitigate the effects of climate change for decision makers and those farms that are may experience extreme water temperatures...|$|E
40|$|With {{average annual}} growth at 38 %, sea bream {{production}} is the main growth factor in Israel's fish- eries industry. It is estimated that cultured sea bream constituted over 10 % of the volume and 20 % {{of the value of}} domestic fisheries in 2000. Per capita consumption of sea bream grew from 0. 11 kg in 1995 to an estimated 0. 39 kg in 2000. Rapid industry development lowered market prices but, in general, farm-gate prices in Israel are higher than in major Mediterranean producers. Fluctuations in sea bream prices reflect fluctuating demand, but the percentage that sales have increased is greater than the percentage that prices have decreased. Cultured sea bream in Israel lacks competition from wild or imported sources. Increasing supplies of sea bream will come from the local mariculture industry, but growth is slowing and several constraints must be overcome. Intensive recirculating aquaculture systems may enhance inland <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> production. The sea bream market in Israel has not reached saturation level, as indicated by consumption which has increased without signifi- cant marketing efforts.

We introduce a methodology and a decision-aid system for <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> design. The developed framework will help, for a given marine area, to fnd the most relevant sites and marine technologies using multicriteria analysis. The approach is oriented toward marine current energy but this methodology can be extended to others marine energies. Amongst the criteria involved in the decision process, a model is developed to evaluate the quantity of electrical energy produced by the farm, and the cost of the system during its entire lifetime. These two parameters allow us to derive the cost of the produced energy, {{which is one of the}} more important criteria to evaluate the economic feasibility of a marine energy project. The energy produced is evaluated taking into account both technological possibilities (turbines technology, generator type, underwater cables, offshore substation etc.) and site characteristics. The cost is estimated thanks to a specific cost model of each component and the farm layout, and also includes a first order evaluation of the installation/dismantling and maintenance costs.

Scallops measuring 32. 6 + 4. 9 mm of initial height were cultivated in eight Japanese lanterns with five floors each, at a density of 25 scallops/floor, according to the following delineament: T 1 – control (scallops alone); T 2 – scallops with E. lucunter; T 3 – scallops with L. variegatus; T 4 – scallops with T. viridula. Densities of the bio-controllers were: four (E. lucunter), three (L. variegatus) and 15 animals/floor (T. viridula).

The Lectra/San ® marine sewage system was able to reduce the levels of infectious hepatitis A virus in human faeces by 4 logs following a single 2 -minute electrolytic process with accompanying maceration. This indicates that, under optimal conditions, the Lectra/San ® will inactivate hepatitis A virus and other less resistant enteric viral pathogens in marine sewage such {{that they no longer}} present a health risk. However, the potential variability in operation of the Lectra/San ® system means that there could still be a risk of viral contamination from faecal material discharged from boats fitted with the Lectra/San ® systems. The change in the Marine Pollution Regulations to no discharge within 500 metres of a <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> or maitaitai reserve for Type B systems will ensure that marine farms and maitaitai reserves are better protected from sewage contamination. The project has contributed scientific data on the inactivation of enteric viruses by the Lectra/San ® system and provided new information for determining controls on treated sewage discharges from recreational boats. The information generated will assist government agencies, including regional and district councils in formulating policies for safe management of waters used for recreation, shellfish growing and boating. ...|$|E

A novel variant of the lactate oxidase gene, lctO, in Australian isolates of S. iniae from diseased barramundi was found during a diagnostic screen using LOX- 1 and LOX- 2 primers, yielding amplicons of 920 bp instead of the expected 869 bp. Sequencing of the novel gene variant (type 2) revealed a 51 -nucleotide insertion in lctO, resulting in a 17 -amino-acid repeat in the gene product, and three-dimensional modeling indicated formation of an extra loop in the monomeric protein structure. The activities of the lactate oxidase enzyme variants expressed in Escherichia coli were examined, indicating that the higher-molecular-weight type 2 enzyme exhibited higher activity. Growth rates of S. iniae expressing the novel type 2 enzyme were not reduced at lactate concentrations of 0. 3 % and 0. 5 %, whereas a strain expressing the type 1 enzyme exhibited reduced growth rates at these lactate concentrations. During a retrospective screen of 105 isolates of S. iniae from Australia, the United States, Canada, Israel, Réunion Island, and Thailand, the type 2 variant arose only in isolates from a single <b>marine</b> <b>farm</b> with unusually high tidal flow in the Northern Territory, Australia.
