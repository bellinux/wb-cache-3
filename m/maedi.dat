5000|$|Visna - <b>Maedi</b> is {{a chronic}} viral disease {{prevalent}} in adult sheep. The disease is rarely found in certain species of goat. <b>Maedi</b> Visna virus is {{also referred to}} as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). This disease corresponds to two clinical entities caused by the same <b>Maedi</b> is a form that results in a chronic progressive pneumonia. Visna refers to the neurological form of the disease and predominantly causes meningoencephalitis in adult sheep. This disease has inflicted many economic losses worldwide due to the long incubation period and the high mortality rate of sheep and goats. MV virus can infect sheep of any age but clinical symptoms rarely occur in sheep less than two years old. The onset of the diseases is gradual resulting in relentless loss of weight in addition to breathing problems. Cough, abortion, rapid breathing, depression, chronic mastitis and arthritis are also additional symptoms observed. These symptoms appear mostly in animals over the age of three and therefore might spread to other flocks before clinical diagnosis can be achieved. Animals showing the above symptoms might die within six months of infection. This causal lentivirus can be found in monocytes, lymphocytes and macrophages of infected sheep in the presence of humoral and cell mediated immune response and can also be detected by conducting several serological tests. Transmission of the disease occurs most commonly via the oral route caused by ingestion of colostrum or milk that contains the virus or inhalation of infected aerosol droplets. Due to variation of the strains of MVV, some of the association clinical symptoms may be more pre-dominant in a flock relative to others along with differences in genetic susceptibility patterns.|$|E

After this, the power of the Scordisci declined rapidly. This decline was more a result of the political situation in barbaricum rather than the effects of Roman campaigns, as their client tribes, especially the Pannonians, became more powerful and politically independent. Between 56 and 50 BC, the Scordisci were defeated by Burebista's Dacians, and became subject to him.They were crushed in 15 BC by Tiberius, and became Roman subjects, playing the part as mercenaries.Other sources say the Romans made alliance with the Scordisci in Sirmium and Danube valleys following the Alpine campaign under Tiberius in 15 BC, the alliance would be crucial for the victory over the Pannonians (15BC) and later Breuci (12BC).|$|E

50|$|Visna <b>Maedi</b> virus (VMV) {{belongs to}} the small {{ruminant}} lentivirus group (SRLV). In general, SRLVs enter the cell through the interaction of their glycosylated envelope protein with a cellular receptor on the cell's plasma membrane facilitating fusion of the viral and cellular membrane. However, the specific cellular receptor that VMV binds is not entirely certain. A few studies have proposed MHC class II, CD4 and CXCR4 proteins as possible receptors however, none of these proteins have been established as the main receptor. Another study suggests that C-type lectins part of the mannose receptor (MR) family play a role as an alternative SRLV receptor. The mannose receptor is a 180-kDa transmembrane protein with eight tandem C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of which CRD4 and CRD5 are essential in recognizing mannose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine residues. Studies suggest that VMV gains entrance to the cell via mannosylated residues on its envelope proteins. MR is involved in recognizing the surface of pathogens and is involved in phago- and endocytosis and mediating antigen processing and presentation {{in a variety of}} cells including monocyte/macrophages and endothelial cells.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{described}} pulmonary lesions {{are compatible}} with lesions previously described for <b>maedi.</b> In this study, {{one of the most}} important ovine slow viral infections is "Maedi disease" which was evaluated in Mashhad province. METHODS: During the study, ovine lung samples from 170 sheep (> 1 year old) with their serum samples were collected in the Mashhad industrial abattoir. Initially, histopathological study for lung samples was carried out by providing H&E staining, serological test and an indirect ELISA on the serum samples. Histopathological study indicated all three lesions of <b>Maedi</b> disease in ovine lung which included smooth muscle hyperplasia (SMH) of alveolar walls, lymphofollicular hyperplasia (LFH) and interstitial pneumonia (IP). Furthermore, some involvement of each lung sample was estimated from mild-moderate and severe. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results of histopathological study demonstrated 45 cases (26. 5 %) and 15 cases (8. 8 %) with moderate degree and severe degree of involvement respectively. Liked-maedi disease included 60 cases (35. 3 %) of the whole ovine lung samples. Results of serological study showed 34 positive serums (20. 0 %). In addition, 15 cases (8. 8 %) of pulmonary lesions which were observed in histopathological study were equal and similar to the lesions previously described for <b>maedi</b> disease, and serological results confirmed them as well. However, there are some pathogens that can cause nearly pathological lesions like <b>maedi</b> in ovine lung. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the pathogen causing <b>maedi</b> disease (maedi-visna virus) can be one of the pathogens causing chronic to subacute lymphoid interstitial pneumonia in Iran.

40|$|Background Bronchoalveolar lavage {{has proven}} helpful for the {{diagnosis}} of certain ovine diseases of the lungs. There is insufficient data concerning the leukocyte profile of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from MaediVisna infected sheep. Objective The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the differential leukocyte profile of BALF associated with <b>Maedi</b> virus infection in sheep and to determine whether cytologic examination of BALF is an effective way to diagnose <b>Maedi</b> or determine the severity of lung lesions. Methods BALF and serum samples were analyzed from 400 sheep. Sediment smears of bronchoalveolar lavage were stained with Diff-Quik and examined microscopically to obtain a 200 -cell differential cell count. Serum was tested using a commercial kit for Maedi-Visna virus antibodies. Lung samples obtained at the time of slaughter were weighed and examined histologically. Results Maedi-infected sheep (n= 267; seropositive with lung lesions) had a significantly higher percentage of lymphocytes and lower percentage of macrophages in BALF than normal sheep (n= 133; seronegative and no lung lesions). These differences were significantly more severe in animals with advanced vs moderate lung lesions. Using classification trees, a cut-off of 13. 5 % lymphocytes was predictive of <b>Maedi</b> infection and a cut-off of 24. 5 % lymphocytes was predictive of advanced lung lesions. Conclusions Cytologic examination of BALF is useful for the clinical diagnosis of <b>Maedi</b> in sheep and provides important information about the severity of the lung lesions...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} direct plaque assay for <b>maedi</b> virus, two strains of {{progressive}} pneumonia virus, and two strains of visna virus {{has been developed}} and evaluated. The technique allows the plaques formed by these viruses to be localized without disturbing the host-cell substrate of sheep choroid plexus cells or the gelled maintenance medium over the host-cell monolayer. Diethylaminoethyl-dextran supplementation of the medium used to overlay strain K 796 visna virus-infected cultures decreases the time required for maximum plaque development from 12 to 10 days, enhances the contrast of the plaques, increases the titer of plaque-forming units, and permits a plaque size heterogeneity to be realized. Both large and small plaques occur in cultures infected with the visna viruses, one strain of progressive pneumonia virus, or <b>maedi</b> virus. In contrast, the plaques observed in cultures infected with the second strain of progressive pneumonia virus are relatively homogeneous in size...|$|E
40|$|Maedi-visna is an {{economically}} important viral disease of sheep that occasionally affects goats. The maedi-visna virus (MVV), a lentivirus; infects its hosts for life. Although most infections are subclinical, {{a minority of}} animals develops progressive, untreatable disease syndromes including dyspnea (<b>maedi)</b> or neurologic signs (visna). Both <b>maedi</b> and visna are eventually fatal. Additional economic costs may include marketing and export restrictions, premature culling, and losses from poor milk production due to indurative mastitis. Economic losses can vary considerably between flocks. MVV {{is closely related to}} the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV), a lentivirus found most often in goats. Although documented cases of natural crossspecies transmission are currently rare, MVV can infect goats and CAEV can infect sheep.
