50|$|In physics, {{the quantum}} <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bell</b> test {{prediction}} is the prediction that quantum mechanics would give for the correlation probabilities {{for a set}} of measurements performed on a quantum entangled state. An important outcome of this prediction is that it violates the Bell inequality, which, as a result, has serious implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5000|$|Most Ericofons had {{mechanical}} rotary dials, {{typical of}} all phones {{made in the}} era. While Ericofons produced by Ericsson used miniature buzzers as ringers, North Electric introduced the electronic [...] "Ericotone" [...] ringer. The Ericotone ringer used a simple, one-transistor oscillator circuit to produce a distinctive [...] "chirping" [...] sound. This {{was one of the}} earliest uses of a transistor in a telephone; telephones with <b>mechanical</b> <b>bell</b> ringers and rotary dials did not need transistors.|$|E
40|$|Both {{the quantum}} <b>mechanical</b> and {{classical}} <b>Bells</b> experiment {{are within the}} focus of this paper. The fact that one measures different probabilities in both experiments is traced back to the superposition of two orthogonal but nonentangled substates in the quantum mechanical case. This superposition results in an interference term that can be splitted into two additional states representing a sink and a source of probabilities in the classical event space related to Bells experiment. As a consequence, a statistical operator can be related to the quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bells</b> experiment that contains already negative quasi probabilities, as usually known from quantum optics in conjunction with the Glauber-Sudarshan equation. It is proven that the existence of such negative quasi probabilities are neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for entanglement. The equivalence of using an interaction picture in a fixed basis or of employing a change of basis to describe Bells experiment is demonstrated afterwards. The discussion {{at the end of this}} paper regarding the application of the complementarity principle to the quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bells</b> experiment is supported by very recent double slit experiments performed with polarization entangled photons.

5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were <b>mechanical</b> <b>bells,</b> mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|R
2500|$|Automatic level {{crossings}} in Belgium have two red lights, a [...] "moon-white" [...] light, electronic (previously <b>mechanical)</b> <b>bells</b> and (usually) barriers. The white light flashes {{for half a}} second at regular intervals to inform drivers and pedestrians that they can cross the level crossing, and that the signal is in working order. In some cases the white light is absent; the Belgian traffic law of 1975 does not cover that situation. The bells ring until the barriers are fully lowered and then stop. If barriers are absent the bell continues ringing throughout.|$|R
50|$|This {{telephone}} {{was able}} to operate on both loop disconnect (pulse) and MF4 (tone) dialing. The method was chosen by a switch on the base, {{as shown in the}} photograph. It was introduced in the 1980s as a basic telephone and was the last model with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bell.</b> The volume control was the ultimate in simplicity: a plastic disc with a hole in it which could be rotated to cover over the sounder holes by a varying amount.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} bell is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bell</b> that functions {{by means of}} an electromagnet. When an electric current is applied, it produces a repetitive buzzing or clanging sound. Electric bells have been widely used at railroad crossings, in telephones, fire and burglar alarms, as school bells, doorbells, and alarms in industrial plants, since the late 1800s, but they are now being widely replaced with electronic sounders. It consists of coils of insulated wire wound round iron rods. When an electric current flows through the coils, the rods became magnetic and attract a piece of iron attached to a clapper. The clapper hits the bell and makes it ring.|$|E
5000|$|The ringer was a <b>mechanical</b> <b>bell</b> {{consisting}} of two bell gongs of slightly different dimensions to produce different pitches and a striker between them driven by a solenoid; when the solenoid was energized by AC ringing current, typically about [...] at , it struck the two gongs alternately, producing a distinctive effect of two superimposed sounds. On phones with a ringer loudness control, one gong was mounted off-center on the loudness control wheel; turning the wheel moved the gong toward (quieter) or away (louder) from the striker. Overall, the model 500 ringer was fairly loud and could be heard a few rooms away. The ringer could not be turned off on-the-fly, but could be disabled in the wiring. When the phone was subjected to mechanical shock the striker would hit the brass bells and a short ring would be heard. This effect was faithfully represented in various films and television shows.|$|E
25|$|Sciota {{is served}} by the Keokuk Junction Railway. As of January 2010, there were two rail sidings. There is one grade {{crossing}} protected {{by a pair of}} crossbucks with flashing lights and a <b>mechanical</b> warning <b>bell</b> (no gates).|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most appliances are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert {{people to the}} presence of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were <b>mechanical</b> <b>bells,</b> mounted on the front or roof of the truck. Most vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different sounds. Fire service driving training often includes the use of different sounds depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. For instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is like a wail, but faster.|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{realistic}} protocol for the preparation and readout of <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bell</b> states in an optomechanical system. The proposal relies on parameters characterizing a photonic crystal cavity mode, coupled to two localized flexural modes of the structure, but equally applies to other optomechanical {{systems in the}} same parameter range. The nonclassical states are heralded via optical postselection and revealed in specific interference patterns characterizing the emission at the cavity frequency.

40|$|The {{outstanding}} {{progress in}} nanostructure fabrication and cooling technologies allows what was unthinkable {{a few decades}} ago: bringing single-mode mechanical vibrations to the quantum regime. The coupling between photon and phonon excitations is a natural source of nonclassical states of light and mechanical vibrations, and its study {{within the field of}} cavity optomechanics is developing lightning-fast. Photonic crystal cavities are highly integrable architectures that have demonstrated the strongest optomechanical coupling to date, and should therefore play a central role for such hybrid quantum state engineering. In this context, we propose a realistic heralding protocol for the on-chip preparation of remotely entangled mechanical states, relying on the state-of-the-art optomechanical parameters of a silicon-based nanobeam structure. Pulsed sideband excitation of a Stokes process, combined with single photon detection, allows writing a delocalised <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bell</b> state in the system, signatures of which can then be read out in the optical field. A measure of entanglement in this protocol is provided by the visibility of a characteristic quantum interference pattern in the emitted light. Comment: 8 pages, 5 Figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of two dual and emergent sets of three irreversible bi-vectors- dubbed the TauQuernions τi, τj, τk- that are otherwise isomorphic to quaternions. This inherently dissipative 3 -dimensional tauquernion space is a subspace of the geometric (Cli ord) algebra G 4, 0 with generators {a, b, c, d}; a straightforward mapping produces a 3 + 1 dimensional sub-space with signature (+ − −−) in G 5, 0. The individual tauquernions are entanglement operators corresponding to the quantum <b>mechanical</b> <b>Bell</b> and Magic operators. The form τi + τj + τk has 64 sign variants of which 16 are nilpotent, which latter we identify with the Higgs boson; the other 48 variants square to the unitary 4 -vector ±abcd, which we identify as the carrier of mass. A natural candidate for dark matter also emerges, which we analyze. We calculate the information content of these and related forms, draw an exact map of the entropic pathways an expansion will follow, and sketch how this Bit Bang develops. Photons are clearly represented and transparently intertwined in the space, so one can expect overall compatibility with relativity theory...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, most police cars are also fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an emergency vehicle before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were <b>mechanical</b> <b>bells,</b> mounted to either the front or roof of the car. A later development was the rotating air siren, which made noise when air moved past it. Most modern vehicles are now fitted with electronic sirens, which can produce a range of different noises. Police driving training often includes the use of different noises depending on traffic conditions and maneuver being performed. In North America for instance, on a clear road, approaching a junction, the [...] "wail" [...] setting may be used, which gives a long up and down variation, with an unbroken tone, whereas, in heavy slow traffic, a [...] "yelp" [...] setting may be preferred, which is a sped up version of the [...] "wail". Some vehicles may also be fitted with airhorn audible warnings. Also in some European countries, where a hi-lo two tone siren is the only permitted siren for emergency vehicles, a [...] "stadt" [...] siren will be used in cities where it has loud echo that can be heard from blocks away to warn the traffic an emergency vehicle is coming, or a [...] "land" [...] siren will be used on highways to project its noise to the front to produce more penetration into the vehicles ahead to alert the drivers.|$|R
5000|$|A Tsirelson bound is {{an upper}} limit to quantum {{mechanical}} correlations between distant events. Given that {{quantum mechanics is}} non-local, i.e., that quantum <b>mechanical</b> correlations violate <b>Bell</b> inequalities, a natural question to ask is [...] "how non-local can quantum mechanics be?", or, more precisely, by how much can the Bell inequality be violated. The answer is precisely the Tsirelson bound for the particular Bell inequality in question. In general this bound is lower than what would be algebraically possible, and much research has been dedicated {{to the question of}} why this is the case.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1980s, pachinko {{machines}} were <b>mechanical</b> devices, using <b>bells</b> to indicate different {{states of the}} machine. Electricity was used only to flash lights and to indicate problems, such as a machine emptied of its balls. Balls were launched using a flipper; their speed was controlled by pulling the flipper down to different levels. Manufacturers in this period included Nishijin and Sankyo; most of these machines available on online auction sites today date to the 1970s. After that time, pachinko machines incorporated more electronic features, thus requiring electricity for operation.|$|R
50|$|It was {{constructed}} by engineering firm Curt Rudolph Transportanlagen from Dresden, Germany with electrical equipment from AEG and <b>mechanical</b> parts from <b>Bell</b> Maschinenfabrik, Switzerland. The official opening was on 5 August 1931 with one passenger car, {{while the second}} car was only a platform ballasted with stones used to counterbalance the passenger car. The electric overhead power cable and the pantographs of the coaches are only used for lighting and heating of the cars. The upper station housed the electrically driven funicular mechanism in the basement, whilst {{the lower end of}} the line did not even have a shelter until 1932.|$|R
50|$|A 30-year {{veteran of}} higher education, Bell {{started his career}} as an {{assistant}} senior engineer for Mobil Research and Development Corp. in Dallas, Texas. First joining The University of Alabama in 1986 as {{an assistant professor in}} the College of Engineering's department of <b>mechanical</b> engineering, <b>Bell</b> was named department head nine years later. With research interest in combustion engines, Bell has expertise in alternative fuels for engines, innovative engine designs and modeling of engine and engine processes. He directed UA's Center for Advanced Vehicle Technologies from 1998-2002. Immediately prior to becoming UA's president, Bell was executive vice president and provost at Louisiana State University. During Bell's tenure there and earlier at the University of Kansas, where he served as dean of its College of Engineering, those institutions opened new facilities, and student recruitment, retention and success were emphasized. Bell was awarded the Society of Automotive Engineers' Ralph Teetor Award for Outstanding Contributions to Research and Teaching in 1988. He was presented the T. Morris Hackney Faculty Leadership Award for the UA College of Engineering in 2001, and, in 2005, he received the Richard S. Woodbury Award from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|R
2500|$|Most level {{crossings}} (spoorwegovergang in Dutch) have half barriers, <b>mechanical</b> or electrical <b>bells,</b> and double (or sometimes single) red lights. The lights flash alternately, {{as do the}} ones on the barriers. Those for pedestrians with an active warning system have full barriers. Three {{level crossings}} are operated remotely by staff from a traffic control center, using cameras; these have full barriers and no bells. Two level crossings for vehicles have full barriers, with a system to detect a vehicle been trapped; in this case the exit barriers are opened. Crossings with little road traffic and/or little rail traffic have no alarm, just warning signs. There are no level crossings where trains routinely run at over 140km/h. Level crossings have a sign saying [...] "WACHT" [...] (WAIT).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{under which}} conditions quantum nonlocal manifestations as Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering or Bell nonlocality can manifest themselves {{even at the}} macroscopic level of two mechanical resonators in optomechanical systems. We adopt the powerful scheme of reservoir engineering, implemented by driving a cavity mode with a properly chosen two-tone field, to prepare two mechanical oscillators into an entangled state. We show that large and robust (both one-way and two-way) steering could be achieved in the steady state with realistic parameters. We analyze the mechanism of the asymmetric nature of steering in our system of two-mode Gaussian state. However, unlike steering, Bell nonlocality is present under much more stringent conditions. We consider two types of measurements, displaced parity and on-off detection, respectively. We show that for both the measurements Bell violation requires very low environmental temperature. For the parity detection, large Bell violation is observed only in the transient state when the mechanical modes decouple from the optical mode and with extremely small cavity losses and mechanical damping. Whereas for the on-off detection, moderate Bell violation {{is found in the}} steady state and robust against cavity losses and <b>mechanical</b> damping. Although <b>Bell</b> violation with the parity detection seems extremely challenging to be experimentally demonstrated, the conditions required for violating Bell inequalities with the on-off detection are much less demanding.

5000|$|The {{original}} Old Main {{was completed}} in 1863 after a six-year period of construction. Hugh McAllister designed the structure to contain classrooms, laboratories, offices, a chapel, and residential space for 400 students. The limestone used to build the structure was quarried from the land {{directly in front of}} it, and was carried in part by a mule named Old Coaly, whose bones were subsequently preserved. After being deemed structurally unsound in the 1920s, the building was razed in 1929 and rebuilt in 1930. The new building, occupying the same footprint as the previous structure and incorporating some of its limestone, was christened [...] "Old Main". The renovations cost $837,000, which was mostly paid for by state appropriations and an emergency building fund campaign. The bell in the tower was a gift from the 1904 graduating class, and westminster chimes were added as a gift of the 1937 class. The original chimes remained in use until the late 1970s when the university replaced them with a mix of <b>mechanical</b> and electronic <b>bells.</b> These bells eventually gave way in 1993 to the digital chimes which ring over the campus today. Between 1940 and 1949, Henry Varnum Poor utilized the fresco style to paint large murals (over 1300 ft²) {{on the second floor of}} Old Main that depict Penn State's land grant history.|$|R
40|$|I {{first read}} about Bell’s {{inequality}} and the “demise of locality ” in a Scientific American {{article in the}} late 1970 s, and I remember being very much impressed with its oddball conclusions regarding the fate of objective reality (what E. Squires has more recently referred to as “the ultimate silliness of the quantum world”). Nowadays I am much less impressed, but I don’t know why; maybe it’s only because I am now more accustomed to quantum mechanics than I was then. Nevertheless, the quantum <b>mechanical</b> violation of <b>Bell’s</b> inequality, which was proven experimentally in the 1980 s, is {{yet another example of}} how God has cooked up a universe that is stranger than anything we could have imagined. If you have experienced problems deriving Bell’s inequality and/or its quantum variant, the following discussion should be of help to you. The only prerequisite is elementary quantum mechanics and an open mind. And although I will share some of my personal thoughts about what I think it all means, you’ll have to decide for yourself if there’s anything really profound involved. Bohr v. Einstein You may have read about the friendly but earnest “war ” that Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein waged from the 1920 s on regarding whether nature was deterministic or probabilistic.

50|$|Chacko master {{had always}} been a very strict teacher, who {{emphasized}} on memorization and discipline at the expense of analysis and creativity. His achievements made him narcissistic as a father, wanting to make his son as good a mathematician as himself. His pride blinded him to his son’s aspirations and talents. Unlike his father Thomas was not good at math, but was very creative and productive in designing mechanical and electronic gadgetry like a <b>mechanical</b> timer school <b>bell,</b> something the admirers call “miracle bell” (for its excellence and innovation). He even made an AM radio receiver inside a soap case, at a time when phonographs were the fad of the time. Thomas’s talent astonished others, whereas his father saw them as a waste of time, or even as insults showered at him. He destroyed each one of them and was angry at him for converting his mathematical instrument box into a mechanical toolbox. Chacko master, who punished his students ruthlessly, treated his son worse - assuming him to be behind every mischief in school and punishing him until the actual culprit gives in. He always compared his son to the best student in the class - Balu (the son of a ‘simple’ police constable), adding to his pressure. Thomas worked hard, and did well in his language paper, but his father asked his language teacher Ravunni master to grade his paper so as to fail him, on the belief that only low grades will provoke him to study harder. His language teacher did as asked (regretting it later on). When Thomas found out that even his most beloved language teacher was biased against him, he became outraged and ran away from the village; after stabbing Balu on the palm with a compass. Fourteen years later, he returned as a changed man, no longer interested in clockwork or gadgetry. His father still hate him and profess to love his sister more, who lived up to the expectations. Thomas’s only regret is that he couldn’t get a chance to apologize to Balu, who died in a bike-accident; for which he feels his father is to blame, as he praised the boy too much so as to bring an early death upon him.|$|R
