50|$|Effects {{of spatial}} area: Eastern towhees appear to prefer edge {{habitats}} in many areas. For instance, the <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> of eastern towhees in a baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) in northern Florida was 18, while eastern towhees {{did not occur}} in either the baldcypress forest or the clearcut.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} choice of the measure of <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> on the abundance-occupancy relationship, and to examine the implications for identifying causal mechanisms. Innovation: Simulations were performed to generate stochastic abundance-occupancy data sets covering {{a wide range of}} scenarios representative of empirical abundance-occupancy data. Two common measures of <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> were used: local <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> calculated using only data from occupied sites) and global <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> (<b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> calculated using all sites or samples). I found that the choice of <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> measure had a strong effect on the correlation between abundance and occupancy. Local <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> was associated with a high proportion of negative correlations (mean percentage of negative correlations across 24 simulations = 44. 39), while global <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> was strongly associated with positive correlations (mean percentage of negative correlations across 24 simulations = 0. 02). Main conclusions: The choice of abundance measure influences the correlation between abundance and occupancy. Negative correlations between local <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> and occupancy are an inherent and unavoidable consequence of using this measure of abundance. Efforts to identify causal mechanisms that give rise to the abundance-occupancy relationship have attempted to explain occasional negative correlations when the expectation was for positive correlations. This study shows that negative correlations arise from the choice of <b>mean</b> <b>abundance</b> measure and that this artefact confounds efforts to identify ecological causal mechanisms. 10 page(s...|$|E

In the past, papers presenting single SAR curves prevailed. Recently, also unifying works have appeared. One approach has focused on the possible relationship between mean number of individuals per species and the rate of increase of number of species with area.

Thirteen species of freshwater snails of nine families were examined for A. cantonensis infection. Six species were found infected with A. cantonensis larvae. These species were L. carinatus, C. bulimoides, C. cyclostomoides, B. alexandrina, L. natalensis and M. tuberculta. The infection prevalence of A. cantonensis in the examined snails ranged from 0. 63 to 2. 24 %.
