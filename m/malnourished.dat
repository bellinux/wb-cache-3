5|$|In January and February 2015, 1450 <b>malnourished</b> or sick {{sea lion}} pups {{have been found}} {{on the coast of}} California, and estimations give a higher number of dead pups. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has pointed the cause to unprecedentedly warm PDO in the North American west coast {{as a result of a}} failed attempt at El Niño, which has reduced the {{abundance}} of anchovies, sardines and mackerel, principal components of the sea lion diet just in the pups nursery season. Pups are leaving the rookeries in search of food long before they are capable of hunting fish. The outcome is pups really <b>malnourished</b> washed out on the shores. These conditions lead some of these pups to death if not rescued in time.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{attitudes in}} Western {{medicine}} in the 1940s and 1950s, Native American and Fijian cultures and societies were strongly dissuaded from premastication due to concerns about the hygiene of the practice. However, the lack of knowledge regarding premastication and its prohibition by missionaries and doctors instead caused severe anemia in the infants of the population, or resulted in <b>malnourished</b> infants and children deprived of nourishment.|$|E
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are <b>malnourished</b> and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find are largely <b>malnourished</b> and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E
5|$|Co-produced by Phil Spector and {{featuring}} the latter's signature Wall of Sound {{in a live}} setting, the fundraiser album was delayed for three months due to protracted negotiations between Harrison and two record companies keen to protect their business interests, Capitol and Columbia/CBS. Besides the main performers, the musicians and singers on the recording include Badfinger, Jim Horn, Klaus Voormann, Alla Rakha, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis and Claudia Linnear. The box set's original packaging included a 64-page book containing photos from the concerts; the album cover, designed by Tom Wilkes, consisted of {{an image of a}} <b>malnourished</b> child sitting beside an empty food bowl.|$|E
5|$|Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in and individual’s overall health; {{psychological}} and physical health status is often dramatically impacted by the presence of malnutrition. India currently has one of the highest rates of <b>malnourished</b> women among developing countries. A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency. One of the main drivers of malnutrition is gender specific selection of the distribution of food resources.|$|E
5|$|Sherwood also adopted {{neglected}} or orphaned {{children from}} the camp. In 1807 she adopted Annie Child, a three-year-old who had been given too much medicinal gin and in 1808 a <b>malnourished</b> two-year-old Sally Pownal. She found homes for those she could not adopt and founded an orphanage. In 1816, {{on the advice of}} doctors, she and her family returned to Britain; in her autobiography Sherwood relates that she was continually ill in India and it was believed at the time that neither she nor any of her children could survive in a tropical climate.|$|E
5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} arable land) dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of arable land dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being <b>malnourished.</b> The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or <b>malnourished</b> specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves can spread them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E
5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} country. In support of the new Republic, Soegijapranata had an Indonesian flag flown {{in front of the}} Gedangan Rectory; however, he did not formally recognise the nation's independence, owing to his correspondence with Willekens regarding the Church's neutrality. He and his clergy treated injured Dutch missionaries, who had recently been released from internment, at the rectory. The Dutch clergy were <b>malnourished,</b> and several required treatment at a hospital. Some were later taken to Indonesian-run internment camps, but the Catholics were still allowed to look after them. Meanwhile, inter-religious strife led to the burning of several mission buildings and the murder of some clergymen. The government also took several buildings, and some that had been seized by the Japanese were not returned.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, a government-endorsed {{disaster}} relief program was initiated {{to mitigate the}} developing humanitarian crisis in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 <b>malnourished</b> children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona {{as part of the}} program, which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by March 6, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000. Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe. United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute tarps, while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment.|$|E
5|$|Prisoners {{received}} a hot {{drink in the}} morning, but no breakfast, and a thin meatless vegetable soup at noon. In the evening they {{received a}} small ration of moldy bread. Most prisoners saved some of the bread for the following morning. Nyiszli notes the daily intake did not exceed 700 calories, except for prisoners being subjected to live medical experimentation, who were better fed and clothed. Sanitary arrangements were poor, with inadequate latrines {{and a lack of}} fresh water. In Auschwitz II-Birkenau, latrines were not installed until 1943, two years after camp construction began. The camps were infested with vermin such as disease-carrying lice, and the inmates suffered and died in epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Noma, a bacterial infection occurring among the <b>malnourished,</b> was a common cause of death among children in the Gypsy camp.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as {{the commander of the}} First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and he was suffering from malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where the surgeons decided to remove most of his stomach. This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained <b>malnourished</b> and thin.|$|E
5|$|G-Dragon {{has shown}} support for {{numerous}} charity organizations over the years, notably {{at the final}} concert of his world tour in 2013, a booth was erected, where fans could donate to build a fishery in Haiti, as a collaboration with YG Entertainment's With Campaign which he previously worked with {{to help build a}} school in Nepal. At the same event he and his fans from 14 different countries around the world donated a 9.9 tons rice, which was sent to help <b>malnourished</b> children, elderly living on their own, and other people in need. He's reportedly donated ₩81.8 million ($80,000 USD) every year on his birthday. G-Dragon donated ₩50 million ($43,400 USD) in 2011 (when fans donated under his name) and in 2012 (privately by himself) to Seoul National University Hospital to help children with diseases get treatment, it was revealed accidentally in 2017 as his name was engraved on a plaque honoring those who had contributed ₩100 million or more.|$|E
5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. The slow lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and <b>malnourished,</b> and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers. As many as 95% of the slow lorises rescued from the markets die of dental infection or improper care.|$|E
5|$|On 22 May, the fleet—now {{reduced to}} only two ships—rounded the Cape of Good Hope. They arrived in Beseguiche (now Dakar, located near Cape Verde) on 2 June. There they found not only Nicolau Coelho's caravel {{but also the}} nau captained by Diogo Dias—which had been lost {{for over a year}} {{following}} the disaster in the South Atlantic. The nau had experienced several adventures of its own and was now in poor condition with only seven sick and <b>malnourished</b> men aboard—one of whom was so weak that he died of happiness upon again seeing his comrades. Another Portuguese fleet was also found riding at anchor in Beseguiche. After Manuel I had been told of the discovery of what is now Brazil, he sent another and smaller fleet to explore it. One of its navigators was Amerigo Vespucci (for whom the Americas would be named), who told Cabral of his exploration, confirming that he had indeed made landfall on an entire continent and not merely an island.|$|E
5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of oxalic acid. The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as <b>malnourished</b> or alcoholic patients.|$|E
25|$|As the {{definitions}} of starving and <b>malnourished</b> people are different, the number of starving people {{is different from that}} of <b>malnourished.</b> Generally, far fewer people are starving, than are <b>malnourished.</b>|$|E
25|$|New York {{social workers}} {{reported}} that 25% of all schoolchildren were <b>malnourished.</b> In the mining counties of West Virginia, Illinois, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, {{the proportion of}} <b>malnourished</b> children was perhaps as high as 90%.|$|E
25|$|The average female life {{expectancy}} today in India is {{low compared to}} many countries, but it has shown gradual improvement over the years. In many families, especially rural ones, girls and women face nutritional discrimination within the family, and are anaemic and <b>malnourished.</b> Almost half of adolescent girls are chronically <b>malnourished.</b> In addition, poor nutrition during pregnancy often leads to birth complications.|$|E
25|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>malnourished</b> and of starving {{people in the}} world has been more or less continually decreasing for at least several centuries. This is due to an increasing supply of food and to overall gains in economic efficiency. In 40 years, the {{proportion of}} <b>malnourished</b> people in the developing world has been more than halved. The proportion of starving people has decreased even faster.|$|E
25|$|According to {{estimates}} by the Food and Agriculture Organization there were 925 million under- or <b>malnourished</b> {{people in the}} world in 2010. This was a decrease from an estimate of roughly 1 billion <b>malnourished</b> people in 2009. In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990-92. It has also been recorded that the world already produces enough food to support the world's population.|$|E
25|$|According to the World Bank, 70% of the South Asian {{population}} and about 75% of South Asia's poor live {{in rural areas}} and most rely on agriculture for their livelihood according to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organisation. In 2015, approximately 281 {{million people in the}} region were <b>malnourished.</b> The report says that Nepal reached both the WFS target as well as MDG and is moving towards bringing down the number of undernourished people to less than 5% of the population. Bangladesh reached the MDG target with the National Food Policy frameworkwith only 16.5% of the population undernourished. In India, the <b>malnourished</b> comprise just over 15 percent of the population. While the number of <b>malnourished</b> people in neighborhood has shown a decline over the last 25 years, the number of under-nourished in Pakistan displays an upward trend.There were 28.7 million hungry in Pakistan in the 1990sa number that has steadily increased to 41.3 million in 2015 with 22% of the population <b>malnourished.</b> Approximately 194.6 million people are undernourished in India, which accounts for the highest number of people suffering from hunger in any single country.|$|E

25|$|The Bolivarian {{government}} originally {{took pride}} in its reduction of malnutrition when it had oil revenues to resource its social spending in the 2000s. However by 2016, the majority of Venezuelans were eating less and spending {{the majority of their}} wages on food. A 2016 survey by the Bengoa Foundation found nearly 30% of children <b>malnourished.</b> According to nutritionist Héctor Cruces, generations of Venezuelans will be affected by the shortages becoming <b>malnourished,</b> causing stunted growth and obesity. The immune systems of Venezuelans were also weakened {{due to the lack of}} food intake, while the lack of water in Venezuela also caused hygienic issues.|$|E
25|$|Diet: Malnutrition, {{particularly}} vitamin A and E deficiencies, can worsen alcohol-induced {{liver damage}} by preventing regeneration of hepatocytes. This is particularly a concern as alcoholics are usually <b>malnourished</b> {{because of a}} poor diet, anorexia, and encephalopathy.|$|E
