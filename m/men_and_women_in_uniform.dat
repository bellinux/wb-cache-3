500|$|The National Anthem Act {{specifies}} {{the lyrics}} and melody of [...] "O Canada", placing {{both of them}} in the public domain, allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derived works, including musical arrangements. There are no regulations governing the performance of [...] "O Canada", leaving citizens to exercise their best judgment. When it is performed at an event, traditional etiquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem, including situations when other anthems are played, and for the audience to stand during the performance. Civilian men usually remove their hats, while women and children are not required to do so. Military <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> traditionally keep their hats on and offer the military salute during the performance of the anthem, with the salute offered {{in the direction of the}} Maple Leaf Flag if one is present, and if not present it is offered standing at attention.|$|E

Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found {{to be a member of}} Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H. Kerr, that you sent to ask me the question at the CNN-YouTube debate last night in Florida. Send more!!! Merry Christmas, Duncan Hunter." [...] The Hillary Clinton campaign did not respond to the letter.|$|E

500|$|In 1882, the U.S. Navy {{consisted}} of many outdated ship designs. Over the next decade, Congress approved building multiple modern steel-hulled armored cruisers and battleships, and by around {{the start of}} the 20th century had moved from twelfth place in 1870 to fifth place in terms of numbers of ships. After winning two major battles during the 1898 Spanish–American War, the American Navy continued to build more ships, {{and by the end of}} World War I had more <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> than the British Royal Navy. The Washington Naval Conference of [...] 1921 recognized the Navy as equal in capital ship size to the Royal Navy, and during the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built several aircraft carriers and battleships. The Navy was drawn into World War II after the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, and over the next four years fought many historic battles including the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, multiple naval battles during the Guadalcanal Campaign, and the largest naval battle in history, the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Much of the Navy's activity concerned the support of landings, not only with the [...] "island-hopping" [...] campaign in the Pacific, but also with the European landings. When the Japanese surrendered, a large flotilla entered Tokyo Bay to witness the formal ceremony conducted on the battleship , on which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. By the end of the war, the Navy had over 1,600 warships.|$|E

They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them." [...] In a blog post the next day, Moulitsas defended and clarified his remarks:"My language was harsh, and, in reality, not true. Fact is, I did feel something. That's why I was so angry. I was angry that five soldiers—the real heroes in my mind—were killed the same day and got far lower billing in the newscasts. I was angry that 51 American soldiers paid the ultimate price for Bush's folly in Iraq in March alone. I was angry that these mercenaries make more in a day than our brave <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>uniform</b> make in an entire month. I was angry that the US is funding private armies, paying them $30,000 per soldier, per month, while the Bush administration tries to cut our soldiers' hazard pay.
