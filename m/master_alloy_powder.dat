40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the metallic powder surface {{play a critical role}} in the development of strong bonds between particles during sintering, especially when introducing elements with a high affinity for oxygen. In this study, Mn and Si have been combined in a Fe–Mn–Si–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> in order to reduce their chemical activity and prevent oxidation during the heating stage of the sintering process. However, when this <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> is mixed with an iron base powder, differences in chemical activity between both components can lead to an oxygen transfer from the iron base powder to the surface of the master alloy particles. The present research is focused on studying the evolution of the master alloy particle surface during the early stages of sintering. Surface characterization by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> surface is mostly covered by a thin easily reducible iron oxide layer (~ 1 nm). Mn–Si particulate oxides are found as inclusions in specific areas of the surface. Evolution of oxides during sintering was studied on green compacts containing iron powder, graphite and Fe–Mn–Si–C <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> that were heat treated in vacuum (10 − 6 mbar) at different temperatures (from 400, 600, 800 to 1000 °C) and analyzed by means of XPS. Vacuum sintering provides the necessary conditions to remove manganese and silicon oxides from the powder surface in the range of temperatures between 600 °C and 1000 °C. When sintering in vacuum, since the gaseous products from reduction processes are continuously eliminated, oxidation of master alloy particles due to oxygen transfer through the atmosphere is minimized...|$|E

In addition, the homogenization of vanadium in Ti- 6 Al- 4 V was accelerated significantly by SPS (completed in 15 min at 1, 100 °C under 30 MPa).

Depending on the compaction pressure, which was varied from 200 to 1000 MPa, non-lubricated warm die (200 C) compaction was very effective for - 100 mesh HDH Ti powder, increasing the green density by 5. 0 - 9. 4 % theoretical density (TD). Die wall lubrication with stearic acid showed no influence on the green density when compacted at 800 MPa. With warm die (200 C) compaction, achieving a green density of greater than 90 %TD was straightforward for HDH Ti powder when compacted at ≥ 750 MPa.

In this study Mn, Si, and Cr were introduced in the form of a <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> designed to be mixed with the iron base powder and provide the final composition of the steel during the sintering process. The reduction/oxidation phenomena taking place during the heating stage were studied by thermogravimetry, dilatometry, and mass spectroscopy, using either reducing (H 2) or inert (Ar) atmospheres. The results show how the difference in chemical activity between base iron powder and master alloy causes the so called "internal-getter" effect, by which the reduction of less stable iron oxides leads to oxidation of the elements with higher affinity for oxygen. This effect can be somehow minimized when sintering in H 2, since the iron oxides are reduced at lower temperatures at which the reactivity of the elements in the master alloy is lower.

The physical {{properties of the}} <b>alloy</b> <b>powders</b> were determined by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and nitrogen adsorption method. From the X-ray diffractogram showed that introduction of high concentration of third elements (Mn and Fe) caused the peaks to become more distinct {{as compared to the}} binary alloys. Increasing stirring time decreased the crystallite size as calculated using Scherrer's equation.

Ti 50 Fe 45 Sn 5 amorphous <b>alloys</b> <b>powder</b> {{was prepared}} by mechanical alloying (MA) in a high-energy planetary ball mill. The non-crystallization degree was tested by X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was shown from the XRD results that a higher ball to powder weight ratio (BPR) is advantageous in preparing amorphous <b>alloys</b> <b>powder.</b> The microstructure {{and shape of}} the powder was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was shown from the SEM results that the as-milled amorphous <b>alloys</b> <b>powder</b> is flake shape and assembles together to be agglomeration structure, which is a typical morphology of amorphous powders prepared by MA. Thermodynamic properties and crystallization kinetics behavior of the as-milled amorphous <b>alloys</b> <b>powder</b> were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The supercooled liquid region △Tx is broad (up to 119 K) and the reduction glass transforming temperature Trg (0. 78) is great, which shows that the as-milled amorphous <b>alloys</b> <b>powder</b> has a strong glass-forming ability and the thermal stability of the powder is excellent...|$|R
40|$|Sintering of steels {{containing}} oxidation sensitive elements {{is possible}} if such elements are alloyed with others which present lower affinity for oxygen. In this work, a <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> containing Fe–Mn–Si–C, {{specifically designed to}} create a liquid phase during sintering, {{has been used for}} such purpose. The effect of processing conditions such as sintering temperature and atmosphere was studied with the aim of describing the microstructural evolution as well as the morphology and distribution of oxides in the sintered material, evaluating the potential detrimental effect of such oxides on mechanical properties. Chemical analyses, metallography and fractography studies combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses on the fracture surfaces were used to reveal the main mechanism of fracture and their correlation with the chemical composition of the different fracture surfaces. The results indicate that the main mechanism of failure in these steels is brittle fracture in the surrounding of the original master alloy particles due to degradation of grain boundaries by the presence of oxide inclusions. Mn–Si oxide inclusions were observed on intergranular decohesive facets. The use of reducing atmospheres and high sintering temperatures reduces the amount and size of such oxide inclusions. Besides, high heating and cooling rates reduce significantly the final oxygen content in the sintered material. A model for microstructure development and oxide evolution during different stages of sintering is proposed, considering the fact that when the master alloy melts, the liquid formed can dissolve some of the oxides as well as the surface of the surrounding iron base particles.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{mechanical}} properties of duplex stainless steels. Design/methodology/approach: In presented study duplex stainless steels were obtained through powder metallurgy starting from austenitic, martensitic base powders by controlled addition of alloying elements, such as Cr, Ni, Mo and Cu. In the studies behind the preparation of mixes, Schaeffler’s diagram was taken into consideration. Prepared mixes have been sintered in a vacuum furnace with argon backfilling at 1260 °C for 1 h. After sintering: rapid cooling have been applied in argon atmosphere. Produced duplex stainless steels have been studied by scanning and optical microscopy. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, impact energy, hardness and wear rate were evaluated. Findings: According to achieved results, it was affirmed that applied sintering method as well as powder mixes preparation allows for manufacturing the sintered duplex steels with good mechanical properties which depends on austenite/ferrite ratio in the microstructure and elements partitioning between phases. The additions of alloying elements powders (promoting formation ferritic and austenitic phase) to <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder,</b> makes possible the formation of structure and properties of sintered duplex stainless steels. Sintered duplex steels obtained starting from austenitic and ferritic powders with admixture of elemental powders achieve lower mechanical properties when compared to composition obtained by mixing ferritic and austenitic powder in equal amounts. Research limitations/implications: According to the powders characteristic, the applied fast cooling rate seems to be a good compromise for mechanical properties and microstructures, nevertheless further tests should be carried out in order to examine different cooling rates. Originality/value: The use of elemental powders added to a stainless steel base showed its potentialities, in terms of fair compressibility and final sintered density. In addition a good microstructural homogeneity and first of all mechanical properties and corrosion resistance was achieved, also working with cycles possible for industries...|$|E
40|$|Powder compact forging {{was used}} to produce Ti and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rocker arms using {{pre-alloyed}} and blended elemental powders. Green powder compacts with high relative density were manufactured by warm compaction. Due to the characteristics of raw powders, interlocking and cold welding are the main mechanisms for HDH powder compaction, while warm welding is the main mechanism for GA powder compaction. During induction heating of the powder compact, {{it was found that}} necks formed extensively in as-sintered HDH Ti powder compact, leading to an average elongation to fracture of 7. 5 %, whereas necks did not form so extensively in as-sintered HDH Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder compacts, which make them brittle due to their low relative density. As a rapid consolidation process, the densification rate was enhanced by powder compact forging due to pore collapsing caused by material flow driven by a large amount of localized plastic deformation. The degree of powder consolidation of powder compact forging using HDH Ti, HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powders were studied by characterising their porosity distributions, microstructure, mechanical properties and fracture behaviour. Due to the positive effect of shear deformation on the powder consolidation of powder compact forging, the powder compact in the centre of forged parts were consolidated completely with full density and had better mechanical properties than those from ingot metallurgy. The effects of heat treatments on microstructure and mechanical properties of as-forged HDH Ti part, HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts were investigated, and the ductility of forged HDH Ti part was improved significantly by annealing treatment. Recrystallization annealing was {{regarded as one of the}} best heat treatments to achieve the high ductility of as-forged HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts, which can open the applications of forged HDH Ti- 6 Al- 4 V part with high oxygen content (~ 0. 5 %). The mechanical properties of forged HDH and GA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V parts after solution and aging treatment and recrystallization annealing were much better than those from both the ones from reported pre-alloyed approaches and wrought parts, which were caused by the enhancement of powder consolidation during recrystallization process. Blended elemental approach and mechanical alloying method were applied to produce Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rocker arm by powder compact forging at 1350 oC. The effect of holding time at forging temperature on the samples produced by forging the compact of HDH Ti/Al-V <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>powder</b> mixture was studied, and it was found that a holding time of 5 - 10 minutes at forging temperature is required to get the as-forged part with good mechanical properties and homogeneous microstructure of free undissolved master alloy powders. Also, in order to reduce the holding time for achieving composition homogeneity, the powder mixture of Ti and Al-V master alloy powders was milled to produce Ti/Al- 40 wt%V composite powder. With such composite powder, the master alloy layers/particles were dissolved rapidly into Ti matrix, but the oxygen pick up during milling and powder passivation make the mechanical properties of the forged samples inferior to those of the parts made by powder compact forging of the powder mixture or pre-alloyed powder...|$|E

Performance comparison of Al– 5 Ti <b>master</b> <b>alloy</b> in grain refinement of commercial purity Al with different additions (0. 6 %, 1. 0 %, 1. 6 %, 2. 0 %, and 3. 0 %) and holding time (10, 30, 60 and 120 min) were investigated.
