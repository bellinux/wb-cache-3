5|$|The term {{power was}} used by the Greek {{mathematician}} Euclid for the square of a line. Archimedes discovered and proved the law of exponents, 10a10b=10a+b, necessary to manipulate powers of 10. In the 9th century, the Persian mathematician Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī used the terms mal for a square and kahb for a cube, which later Islamic mathematicians represented in <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation</b> as m and k, respectively, by the 15th century, as seen in the work of Abū al-Hasan ibn Alī al-Qalasādī.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mathematical</b> <b>notation</b> was decimal, {{and based}} on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million. Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} {{necessary}} to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables of values facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E

The history includes Hindu–Arabic numerals, letters from the Roman, Greek, Hebrew, and German alphabets, {{and a host of}} symbols invented by mathematicians over the past several centuries.|$|E

25|$|Chomsky's theory {{posits that}} {{language}} consists of both deep structures and surface structures. Surface structure 'faces out' and {{is represented by}} spoken utterances, while deep structure 'faces inward' and expresses the underlying relations between words and conceptual meaning. Transformational grammar is a generative grammar (which dictates that the syntax, or word order, of surface structures adheres to certain principles and parameters) that consists of a limited series of rules, expressed in <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation,</b> which transform deep structures into well-formed surface structures. The transformational grammar thus relates meaning and sound.|$|E
25|$|Most of the <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation</b> in {{use today}} was not invented until the 16th century. Before that, {{mathematics}} was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery. Euler (1707–1783) was responsible {{for many of the}} notations {{in use today}}. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to Barbara Oakley, this {{can be attributed to the}} fact that mathematical ideas are both more abstract and more encrypted than those of natural language. Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as cow) with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog. Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.|$|E
25|$|A common {{identifier}} {{naming convention}} {{is for the}} loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), where {{i would be the}} most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of FORTRAN, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation</b> where indices for sums and multiplications are often i, j, etc. A variant convention is the use of reduplicated letters for the index, ii, jj, and kk, as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{classical}} economics can {{be presented in}} simple geometric terms or elementary <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation.</b> Mathematical economics, however, conventionally makes use of calculus and matrix algebra in economic analysis {{in order to make}} powerful claims that would be more difficult without such mathematical tools. These tools are prerequisites for formal study, not only in mathematical economics but in contemporary economic theory in general. Economic problems often involve so many variables that mathematics is the only practical way of attacking and solving them.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the 20th century, {{articles}} in [...] "core journals" [...] in economics have been almost exclusively written by economists in academia.

[...] A subjective assessment of mathematical techniques employed in these core journals showed a decrease in articles that use neither geometric representations nor <b>mathematical</b> <b>notation</b> from 95% in 1892 to 5.3% in 1990. [...] A 2007 survey of ten of the top economic journals finds that only5.8% of the articles published in 2003 and 2004 both lacked statistical analysis of data and [...] lacked displayed mathematical expressions that were indexed with numbers at the margin of the page.|$|E
