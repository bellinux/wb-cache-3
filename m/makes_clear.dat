Those opposed to making D.C. a state claim that {{such a move would}} destroy the notion of a separate national capital and that statehood would unfairly grant Senate representation to a single city.|$|E

5|$|Washington <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> at {{the outset}} that he was not running for a third term, and then thanking his fellow {{citizens}} for the opportunity to serve as their president. He then writes about the preservation of the Union, the core of American nationhood, and which, along with the Constitution binds all Americans together and provides for the popular well being. Concerned about the obstacles and potential hazards that lay ahead for the nation, Washington urges the nation's people to cherish and safeguard their hard-won system of republican government despite their many differences.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin is a mystery. All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E

25|$|Notice the {{ambiguity}} of the sentence: {{it is only the}} context that <b>makes</b> <b>clear</b> that what falls down is actually the stone, not the man.

25|$|Therefore, the {{variance}} of the mean {{of a large number}} of standardized variables is approximately equal to their average correlation.

25|$|As a young man, Russell had {{a decidedly}} {{religious}} bent, himself, {{as is evident}} in his early Platonism.

While he rejected the supernatural, he freely admitted that he yearned for a deeper meaning to life.|$|E
25|$|As {{the above}} {{discussion}} <b>makes</b> <b>clear,</b> any ABC analysis requires choices and trade-offs {{that can have}} a considerable impact on its outcomes.
