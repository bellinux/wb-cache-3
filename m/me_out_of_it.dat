25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tonight's the Night" [...] {{alludes to}} sexual anticipation, {{suggesting}} a lesbian encounter and potential threesome during its finale. Jackson stated, [...] "The record company {{tried to talk}} <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> because it's directed toward a girl. I love the song the way it is, and it's reality {{for a lot of}} people." [...] "I Get Lonely" [...] evokes lush sensuality as Jackson speaks of abandonment over a sparse backing. [...] "Rope Burn" [...] evokes bondage and sadomasochism, as Jackson requests to be tied down and pleasured with candle wax. It was declared [...] "the first R trip-hop ballad, retro-fitted with a lazy, jazzy beat and a spare, slap bass-heavy backing track." [...] Jackson regarded it as a [...] "soft instrument of extended pleasure," [...] saying, [...] "The expression of sexual fantasies can be beautiful if there's trust, love and understanding." [...] "Anything" [...] is a ballad invoking [...] "feverish dimensions" [...] of satisfaction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
