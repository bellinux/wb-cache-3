5000|$|Today, <b>mechanical</b> <b>sowing,</b> {{herbicide}} application for weed control, and mechanical harvesting have displaced this reliance on manual farm work. A root beater uses {{a series of}} blades to chop the leaf and crown (which is high in nonsugar impurities) from the root. The [...] beet harvester lifts the root, and removes excess soil from the root {{in a single pass}} over the field. A modern harvester is typically able to cover six rows at the same time. The beets are dumped into trucks as the harvester rolls down the field, and then delivered to the factory. The conveyor then removes more soil.|$|E

Hanrike. The obtained results could be summarized as follows; <b>Mechanical</b> <b>sowing</b> method of sugar beet significantly surpassed the traditional sowing method in root and foliage fresh weights/plant, root/top ratio, root length and diameter, root, top and sugar yields/fed in both seasons. Sowing methods showed significant effect on TSS, sucrose and purity percentages in both seasons, except purity% in the second season. Controlling weeds by two hand hoeings significantly recorded the highest values of root, top and sugar yields/fed and its components and purity percentage in both seasons. However, the highest percentages of TSS and sucrose were achieved from controlling weed by one hand hoeing in both seasons. Fertilizing sugar beet plants with 100 kg N/fed significantly increased yields and its components and markedly recorded the highest values in both seasons. From the obtained, {{it can be concluded}} that sowing sugar beet using <b>mechanical</b> <b>sowing</b> method (planter machine), controlling weeds by hand hoeing and mineral fertilizing with 100 kg N/fed could be recommended in order to maximize its productivity and quality under the environmental conditions of Sharkia Governorate, Egypt...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of seed chilling on the flower and seed formation of some vegetable and related crops was studied. The seed was germinated and then cooled almost to 0 °C {{so that it}} was still suited to <b>mechanical</b> <b>sowing,</b> a prerequisite if the technique were to be used in practice. This treatment was here called jarovization as introduced by Lysenko for wheat. The object was to bring certain spring-sown crops to flowering and sufficient seed production in the same year. Jarovization was only partly successful. Most of the crops under investigation still required a period of plant vernalization to behave as an annual. With beet (Beta vulgaris L.), black radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. niger), swede turnip (Brassica napus L. napobrassica), Belgian endive (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum) and some other species the jarovized crop ran completely to seed when an untreated crop of the same cv. sown on the same date yielded at least 15 to 20 % early bolters. The best sowing time for a full-grown seedcrop from jarovized seed was two, or, at most, three weeks later than from untreated seed. Many species could not be vernalized sufficiently until the young plants reached a certain age (juvenile phase), if they were to form flowers in ensuing favourable conditions...|$|E

Before the introduction of the seed drill, the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting (evenly throwing) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to bury the seeds to the correct depth.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the vulnerability of}} agricultural cropping systems based on millet and sorghum and the adoption of new technologies in Sahelian and Sudano - Sahelian areas in Mali (West Africa). Semi-structured interviews (ISS) using questionnaires addressed to the chiefs of family farm (FAE) {{were used for the}} collection of data. The descriptive statistics and matrices were realized for the data analysis using the following softwares: EXCEL and SPSS 20. The results of the surveys conducted in 2014 among 360 farms in Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian areas, shows that agricultural producers are aware of the main factors affecting the productivity of their cropping system and food security of agricultural holdings. Rainfall variability, characterized by failure and irregularity of rains is the main constraint of cropping systems based on millet and sorghum as stated by 97 % of surveyed producers, followed by soil poverty 81 %, and the lack of agricultural equipment 47 %. The impacts of these factors at the farms level are translated by a decrease in the crops yields and on the frequency of the shortages in foodstuffs which are observed by 98 % of the farms every year and more than 50 % every 3 years. To reduce vulnerabilities, practices and innovations were adopted by farms as strategies. The main concern fertilizer micro dosing technics, seed soaking, improved varieties, organic and mineral fertilization, soils and water management technics, <b>mechanical</b> <b>sowing,</b> and agro forestry were adopted as strategies.

40|$|Global crop {{production}} {{is affected by}} seasonal and climatic variations in temperature, rainfall patterns or intensity and the occurrence of abiotic and biotic stresses. Climate change can alter pest and pathogen populations as well as pathogen complexes that pose an enormous risk to crop yields and future food security. Crop simulation models have been validated as an important tool {{for the development of}} more resilient agricultural systems and improved decision making for growers. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) is a software tool that enables sub-models to be incorporated for simulation of production in diverse agricultural systems. Modification of APSIM to incorporate epidemiological disease model for crop growth and yield under different disease intensities has few attempts in the UK or elsewhere. The overall aim of this project is to model disease impact on wheat for improved food security in two different agro-ecological zones. The incidence of wheat diseases between 2009 and 2014 in two different agro-ecological zones, UK and Oman were compared. Most of the fields surveyed in Oman and UK were found to have at least one disease. Leaf spot was the most prevalent foliar disease found in Omani fields while Septoria was the most common foliar disease in the UK. Fusarium followed by eyespot and ear blight represents the most common diseases of stem and ears in UK winter wheat between 2009 and 2014. However, in Omani wheat Fusarium causing stem base and loose smut of ears were the most common. Eyespot was not found in Omani winter wheat and this may relate to the high temperature during winter in Oman. This study discussed the first work on the occurrence of fungal diseases and their pathogens in Oman and the influence of agronomy factors. Large numbers of pathogenic fungi causing symptoms were found to be prevalent in wheat fields in Oman. Isolation from six symptomatic wheat varieties resulted in 36 different fungal species. Alternaria alternata was the most frequently isolated pathogen followed by Bipolaris sorokiniana, Setosphaeria rostrata, and Fusarium equiseti. Results also showed some agronomic practices influenced disease incidence. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>sowing</b> method and time of urea application were found to influence leaf spot disease. An investigation into the recovery of treatment cost for eyespot control through yield and the effect of fungicide treatment on risk showed that all fungicides apart from (epoxiconazole) Opus at 1 L ha- 1 were found to be worth the costs, either under high disease pressure (inoculated sites) or naturally infected sites. For the risk averse manger fungicide treatment would be worth the cost as it would reduce the higher level of disease and consequently minimise associated yield losses. In this work, disease models were built to predict the disease development and yield loss in relation to crop phenology using results from previous literature on conditions favouring sporulation, infection and disease development and severity. Analysis of 461 data sets showed that climatic conditions and agronomic factors significantly influenced disease development either positively or negatively in all models. The application of a range of fungicides at GS 31 / 32 reduced disease significantly at GS 39 in comparison to epoxiconazole alone. Disease severity at GS 39 decreased yield only slightly by 2. 2...|$|E
40|$|Integrated weed {{management}} (IWM) in {{cropping systems}} aims {{to lower the}} reliance on herbicides of the crops, by introducing new combinations of agricultural practices in the system development (Munier-Jolain et al, 2009). These combinations may greatly change from a system to another and include a large variety of practices, such as false seed beds, late <b>sowing,</b> <b>mechanical</b> weeding, reduced tillage, specific crop rotations that alternate spring and winter crops, the choice of crop varieties {{and the use of}} pesticides with low ecotoxic impacts. Several implemented agricultural practices are likely to alter soil biogeochemical cycles and different components of the greenhouse gas budget (balance between the carbon sequestration and the greenhouse gas emission) of the system: e. g. crop rotation, dates and level of nitrogen fertilization and tillage. The main objectives of our study were to evaluate i) the N 2 O fluxes emitted from soil during one year for 4 cropping systems (i. e. 3 IWM systems and a local reference of conventional system), and ii) to investigate the relationship between the measured fluxes and soil parameters and the agricultural practices of each system...|$|R

40|$|Integrated Weed Management (IWM) is {{necessary}} to reduce environmental damages by herbicides. The modifications required for IWM in cropping systems can result in unexpected side-effects, e. g. {{an increased risk of}} bioagressors other than weeds, either because the new cropping systems favour these bioagressors or because they favour weeds that are potential bioagressor hosts, thus increasing the contagion risk for crops. To evaluate these risks, the present case study worked with two model pests, a grass-weed species (blackgrass, Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) and a soil-borne cereal pathogen (Gaeummanomyces graminis (Sacc.) von Arx et Olivier var. tritici Walker, responsible for take-all disease) which strongly interact and depend on cropping systems. For each pest, a model quantifying the effects of cropping systems in interaction with pedoclimatic conditions on pest dynamics was chosen from literature (AlomySys for weed dynamics, TakeAllSys for disease incidence) and linked with a new interaction model predicting the effect of one bioagressor on the other. A simulation study was then carried out, testing a herbicide-intensive reference system identified in farm surveys and a series of IWM systems combining several modifications (e. g. mouldboard ploughing, <b>mechanical</b> weeding, delayed <b>sowing)</b> to compensate for herbicide reductions. Each scenario was simulated over 27 years and repeated 20 times, with randomly chosen weather series from two different pedoclimates. The best IWM systems were more efficient than the herbicide-intensive reference system to control the grass weed. In the case of weed-free simulations, none of the IWM systems increased disease incidence, and the best systems even slightly reduced it. Integrating the reduction in weed seed production due to the disease in the simulations did not significantly change the simulation outcome, irrespective of the tested cropping system. Conversely, when the role of weed in disease transmission was taken into account, disease incidence in cereals crops considerably increased, particularly when past non-host crops in the rotation were infested by the weed. Nevertheless, the best IWM systems presented negligible weed-induced disease increase. The present results can be extrapolated to similar pest types (e. g. with propagules surviving in soil and negligible dispersal between fields). The modelling and simulation approach were easily feasible thanks to the availability of consistent models of cropping system effects on the two pests and experimental data on their interactio...|$|R
