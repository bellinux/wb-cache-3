40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{elements of}} evidential reasoning problems are described, {{followed by a}} discussion of the structure of various types of problems. Bayesian inference networks and state space formalism are used as the tool for problem representation. A human-oriented decision making cycle for solving evidential reasoning problems is described and illustrated for a <b>military</b> <b>situation</b> <b>assessment</b> problem. The implementation of this cycle may {{serve as the basis for}} an expert system shell for evidential reasoning; i. e. a situation assessment processor.

40|$|New {{framework}} of situation assessment oriented plan recognition (SAOPR) {{based on the}} closed loop of “Cognition, Prediction, Validation ” is proposed {{for the application of}} <b>military</b> <b>situation</b> <b>assessment,</b> and its implementing method has been researched too. In this paper firstly the workflow of the closed loop process is analyzed and the SAOPR framework is extracted. For to explain the describility and the calculability of the closed loop process, several concepts of situation elements are defined and the SAOPR architecture including the plan recognition algorithm is designed. Then the plan recognition knowledge model of SAOPR has been discussed. The designed model has a structure of knowledge hierarchy which consists of much kind of nodes as action, event, situation and purpose. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that SAOPR could describe clearly the evolvement process of battlefield situation assessment, so it is expectable for SAOPR to play a useful role in situation assessment system.

40|$|The {{probabilistic}} {{network technology}} is a knowledgebased technique which focuses on reasoning under uncertainty. Because of its well defined semantics and solid theoretical foundations, the technology is finding increasing application in fields such as medical diagnosis, machine vision, <b>military</b> <b>situation</b> <b>assessment,</b> petroleum exploration, and information retrieval. However, like other knowledge-based techniques, acquiring the qualitative and quantitative information needed to build these networks can be highly labor-intensive. CONSTRUCTQR integrates techniques and concepts from probabilistic networks, artificial intelligence, and statistics in order to induce Markov networks (i. e., undirected probabilistic networks). The resulting networks are useful both qualitatively for concept organization and quantitatively {{for the assessment of}} new data. The primary goal of CONSTRUCTOR is to find qualitative structure from data. CONSTRUCTOR finds structure by first, modeling each feature in a data set as a node in a Markov network and secondly, by finding the neighbors of each node in the network. In Markov networks, the neighbors of a node have the property of being the smallest set of nodes which “shield ” the node from being affected by other nodes in the graph. This property is used in a heuristic search to identify each node’s neighbors. The traditional x 2 test for independence is used to test if a set of nodes “shield ” another node. Cross-validation is used to estimate the quality of alternative structures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Background Cooperation, collaboration, and {{teamwork}} {{are essential to}} the functioning of any organization. Collaborative planning activities and decision making occur in large dispersed organizations whether they are industrial enterprises or medical organizations. The required infrastructure for such activities is the shared workspace, through which participants located at different sites can manipulate the same multimedia objects. Collaborative software enables each participant to exchange ideas and information while actively analyzing a problem, and facilitates consensus based decisions. Teleconferencing and consultation are important aspects of both <b>military</b> and medical <b>situation</b> <b>assessment</b> and interpretation, particularly for difficult cases. Existing teleconferencing systems provide an efficient and convenient environment for timely exchange of ideas between remote parties. They do not, however, support more advanced collaborative activities such as share...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} {{situation}} estimate as a probability distribution over hypothesized groups, units, sites {{and activities of}} interest in a <b>military</b> <b>situation.</b> To be useful to decision makers, {{there must be a}} way to evaluate the quality of <b>situation</b> <b>assessments.</b> This paper presents and illustrates an approach to meeting this difficult challenge. A <b>situation</b> <b>assessment</b> integrates low-level sensor reports to produce hypotheses at a level of aggregation of direct interest to a military commander. The elements of a <b>situation</b> <b>assessment</b> include 1) hypotheses about entities of interest and their attributes, 2) association of reports and/or lower level elements with entities of interest, and 3) inferences about the activities of a set of entities of interest. In estimating the quality of a stiuation assessment, these elements may be scored at any level of granularity from a single vehicle to the entire situation estimate. Scoring involves associating situation hypotheses with the ground truth elements that gave rise to them. We describe why this process may present technical challenges, and present a method for inferring the correspondence between hypotheses and ground truth. Conditional on this correspondence, the quality of the estimate must be assessed according to criteria that reflect the user's requirements. Scores must then be integrated over different plausible assignments. Our scoring methods can be tailored to user requirements, and include rigorous treatment of the uncertainties associated with a situation estimate. We also discuss how to score the <b>situation</b> <b>assessment</b> when ground truth is not available. We discuss how our approach is instantiated in algorithms and describe an example from DARPA's Dynamic Database program. 2 1...|$|R
