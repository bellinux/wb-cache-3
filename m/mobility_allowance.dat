A full licence can be acquired as soon as the provisional licence is received, unlike many other countries where applicants must wait a minimum of 6-12 months with this being said, before getting a full license. The provisional licence is available without taking a test, although to get a full, unrestricted licence - the applicant must take a written 'Theory' test containing fifty multiple choice questions and fourteen-clip hazard perception test, both of which are done on a computer at one of the many DSA (Driving Standards Agency) Test centres. Once the learner has passed the theory test, they may take the practical driving test, however the practical driving test has to be done within 2 years of completing the theory test, as the theory test certificate expires 2 years after receiving it. Once the practical driving test has been taken and passed a full driving licence will be automatically issued. While it is possible to take both tests immediately after each other, most learner drivers take a period between taking the theory and applying for a practical test to carry out driving lessons, either with their supervisor or a professional Driving school.|$|E
40|$|We {{live in the}} 21 st century, {{when more}} than ever solves finance, economy {{in terms of both}} the {{individual}} and the state, but also the European Union, which affects every Member State and the Czech Republic is no exception. State economic situation continues to affect both small and large companies, entrepreneurs and individuals who {{under the influence of the}} surrounding developments make decisions affecting not only the present but also the future. Economic decisions impinge on the functioning of the state authorities, which is taking steps to support the decision given on the company, such as electronic records of sales, taxation and other laws affecting their business. This impacts directly or indirectly to a particular individual moving in the country's economy. The aim of the dissertation is to express the economic impact in terms of social policy on selected sectors of the Czech economy, both theoretically and practically. The economic impact of social policy affects the financial situation of the economically active population who are hit by unexpected life situations. It is degraded in the social position due to declining economic level, which is then inadequate and social policies often do not sufficiently take into account the economic situation of the individual before and after the establishment of that situation. And the individual is often unable to adequately use the possibilities that social policy allows. The main reason is a lack of awareness, that should act on the individual before the emergence of the situation and create awareness in the people about the possibilities of resolving the situation. Unexpected life situations addressed by social policy, which is also solvable through its tools, job loss or inability to continue to engage in employment. Both options associated with a decrease in working capacity, which addresses social policy through the provision of disability pensions. These covers Czech Social Security Administration through district administrations throughout the country. The State influences the amount of disability pensions minimum the setting of wages, the basis of assessment, determination of the percentage amount of disability pension, including its reduction limits or minimum time required insurance. The aforementioned indicators in the calculation of invalidity pension, which becomes a very individual matter, but is influenced by the rules of 441, 000 persons receiving this pension, which in the third. stage reaches an average amount of 10 262 CZK. With this funding slightly higher than the minimum wage, individuals must manage and deal with the new situation. Economic impacts caused by unexpected life situation affects not only the individual himself, but also its surroundings. To eliminate these negative economic impacts serve other instruments of social policy that could improve the financial situation. However, this is a significant administrative burden for which the required knowledge about the possibilities, which include care <b>allowances,</b> <b>mobility</b> <b>allowances,</b> certificate of persons with disabilities, but also the opportunity to appeal against the decision of the Czech Social Security Administration to withdraw and so improve its economic situation...|$|R
40|$|Personal {{transport}} is {{a leading}} contributor to fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse (GHG) emissions in the U. S. The U. S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that light-duty vehicles (LDV) are responsible for 61 % of all transportation related energy consumption in 2012, which is equivalent to 8. 4 {{million barrels of oil}} (fossil fuel) per day. The carbon content in fossil fuels is the primary source of GHG emissions that links to the challenge associated with climate change. Evidently, it is high time to develop actionable and innovative strategies to reduce fuel consumption and GHG emissions from the road transportation networks. This dissertation integrates the broader goal of minimizing energy and emissions into the transportation planning process using novel systems modeling approaches. This research aims to find, investigate, and evaluate strategies that minimize carbon-based fuel consumption and emissions for a transportation network. We propose user and system level strategies that can influence travel decisions and can reinforce pro-environmental attitudes of road users. Further, we develop strategies that system operators can implement to optimize traffic operations with emissions minimization goal. To complete the framework we develop an integrated traffic-emissions (EPA-MOVES) simulation framework that can assess the effectiveness of the strategies with computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy. ^ The dissertation begins with exploring the trade-off between emissions and travel time in context of daily travel decisions and its heterogeneous nature. Data are collected from a web-based survey and the trade-off values indicating the average additional travel minutes a person is willing to consider for reducing a lb. of GHG emissions are estimated from random parameter models. Results indicate that different trade-off values for male and female groups. Further, participants from high-income households are found to have higher trade-off values compared with other groups. Next, we propose personal <b>mobility</b> carbon <b>allowance</b> (PMCA) scheme to reduce emissions from personal travel. PMCA is a market-based scheme that allocates carbon credits to users at no cost based on the emissions reduction goal of the system. Users can spend carbon credits for travel and a market place exists where users can buy or sell credits. This dissertation addresses two primary dimensions: the change in travel behavior of the users and the impact at network level in terms of travel time and emissions when PMCA is implemented. To understand this process, a real-time experimental game tool is developed where players are asked to make travel decisions within the carbon budget set by PMCA and they are allowed to trade carbon credits in a market modeled as a double auction game. Random parameter models are estimated to examine the impact of PMCA on short-term travel decisions. Further, to assess the impact at system level, a multi-class dynamic user equilibrium model is formulated that captures the travel behavior under PMCA scheme. The equivalent variational inequality problem is solved using projection method. Results indicate that PMCA scheme is able to reduce GHG emissions from transportation networks. Individuals with high value of travel time (VOTT) are less sensitive to PMCA scheme in context of work trips. High and medium income users {{are more likely to have}} non-work trips with lower carbon cost (higher travel time) to save carbon credits for work trips. ^ Next, we focus on the strategies from the perspectives of system operators in transportation networks. Learning based signal control schemes are developed that can reduce emissions from signalized urban networks. The algorithms are implemented and tested in VISSIM micro simulator. Finally, an integrated emissions-traffic simulator framework is outlined that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. The integrated framework uses MOVES 2010 b as the emissions simulator. To estimate the emissions efficiently we propose a hierarchical clustering technique with dynamic time warping similarity measures (HC-DTW) to find the link driving schedules for MOVES 2010 b. Test results using the data from a five-intersection corridor show that HC-DTW technique can significantly reduce emissions estimation time without compromising the accuracy. The benefits are found to be most significant when the level of congestion variation is high. ^ In addition to finding novel strategies for reducing emissions from transportation networks, this dissertation has broader impacts on behavior based energy policy design and transportation network modeling research. The trade-off values can be a useful indicator to identify which policies are most effective to reinforce pro-environmental travel choices. For instance, the model can estimate the distribution of trade-off between emissions and travel time, and provide insights on the effectiveness of policies for New York City if we are able to collect data to construct a representative sample. The probability of route choice decisions vary across population groups and trip contexts. The probability as a function of travel and demographic attributes can be used as behavior rules for agents in an agent-based traffic simulation. Finally, the dynamic user equilibrium based network model provides a general framework for energy policies such carbon tax, tradable permit, and emissions credits system. ...|$|R

A mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation for the static scheduling problem of a multi-vehicle <b>Mobility</b> <b>Allowance</b> Shuttle Transit (MAST) system is proposed in this thesis. Based on the MIP formulation, we analyze the impacts of time headways between consecutive transit vehicles {{on the performance of}} a two-vehicle MAST system. An analytical framework is then developed to model the performance of both one-vehicle and two-vehicle MAST systems, which is used to identify the critical demand level at which an increase of the fleet size from one to two vehicles would be appropriate. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to find out the impact of a key modeling parameter, w 1, the weight of operations cost on the critical demand. In this paper, we develop an insertion heuristic for a multi-vehicle MAST system, which has never been addressed in the literature. The proposed heuristic is validated and evaluated by a set of simulations performed at different demand levels and with different control parameters. By comparing its performance versus the optimal solutions, the effectiveness of the heuristic is confirmed.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis "The {{reflection of}} the change in providing of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities {{from the perspective of the}} beneficiary" focuses on persons with disabilities and on the system which helps to reduce the impact of their disabilities and supports them to integrate into society. In the theoretical part of this thesis, the term disability is defined in various ways, especially from the perspective of the legislation in Czech Republic and from the perspective of international legal documents. The classification of disabilities and other related terms are also defined. Additionally this part of the thesis defines the basic necessities of life. Furthermore it describes the social welfare system in Czech Republic and the various ways of classification of the resulting social welfare benefits. Finally, the past and present legal frame that regulates the providing of welfare benefits for persons with disabilities is defined. The practical part is based on the qualitative research. For the purpose of the research the interviewing method was used, namely the in-depth interview. The respondents were chosen by purposive sampling technique. The collected data was evaluated by the method of open coding. The main goal of this thesis was to discover how the beneficiaries of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities perceive the change in providing of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities. The goal has been achieved by answering the research question: "Does the new system of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities saturate with the basic social needs of persons with disabilities?" The intermediate goals of this thesis were the analysis of the social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities, which were implemented in 2011 and 2012 and a survey on the opinion of the beneficiaries of the social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities on the social welfare system in the field of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities. By evaluating the collected data during the semi-structured, in-depth interviews, it was discovered that the respondents are not satisfied with the amount of the <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance</b> and with the receipt obligation of the "sKarta". Not only the amount of the <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance,</b> which doesn?t cover the whole transport costs, was described as inadequate, but also the unified amount and cancellation of any possible increase of the amount. The research also shows that the previous payment method, via postal order or current account, is preferred by the respondents. The disadvantages of the current system are seen in the insufficient financial support for persons taking care of a person with disabilities in home environment and in the amount of the <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance</b> mentioned above. Although the system is criticized for the insufficient financial support, it offers advantages, the special-requisite allowance for buying a vehicle being one mentioned. In general, it can be said that the respondents don´t have much awareness of the new system of providing social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities. This can be caused on the one hand, that they didn´t apply for welfare benefits since 2012, except for the <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance,</b> and on the other hand by the poor campaign of the responsible authorities. This bachelor thesis looks at a currently much discussed topic and offers a perspective from one of the groups of people for whom the help is intended, namely parents of persons with disabilities. It captures their reactions and opinions on the change that occurred in 2012 and on the help resulting from the system of social welfare. This thesis can be used to reflect upon the current system of providing of social welfare benefits for persons with disabilities and as a basis for potential improvement of this system...|$|E

40|$|The theoretic part of {{the thesis}} focuses on social benefits, {{received}} by people with a severe motor disability, which are already impacted by new legal regulations. These regulations have been in effect since 1. 2. 2012. As {{a result of the}} social reform carried out in 2012 the number of allowances has decreased. According to Act No. 329 / 2011 there are two new allowances, mobility and special aid allowances. ¨ The research {{part of the}} thesis strives, through a qualitative strategic research, to reflect on the situation of people with a severe motor disability. The main objective of the thesis was to identify how the social and economic situation had changed for people with a severe motor disability in connection with reforms in the benefit system valid since January 2012. A partial task was to find out how the administration workload has changed for the applicant and recipient of social benefits. The data was collected through a half-standardised interview. The questions were divided into two thematic sections according to defined thesis objectives. The first set of questions focuses on the social and economic situation, specifically the change in a social and economic situation in connection with the newly set up social benefits (in the area of mobility and aids for people with a severe disability), financial involvement in paying for the aid and the change of the level of dependability (and subsequently the level of the allowance for care) in connection with newly created needs. The basic group consists of people with a severe motor disability who receive social benefits for disabled people in the Czech Republic. A selected group contained 8 people in total with a severe motor disability who receive allowances as part of the social benefits system. In case of respondents who originally had been receiving the allowance for individual transportation, the amount was decreased and they now receive it as a <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance.</b> In case of the decrease of the amount for transportation, the respondents changed their own usual ways of transportation or found other sources of funds. However, the social and economic situation of the respondents, who before the change in legislation were not receiving any <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance</b> (transportation) and at the moment they receive the <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance,</b> has improved in this area. The number of respondents in both groups is the same so we can say that the changes in allowances regarding transportation (mobility) have not brought any significant change in a social and economic situation of people. The most common view in terms of the question regarding the financial participation in special aids was neutral. Most respondents stated that the level of dependability on care and subsequently the allowance had remained the same. From {{the point of view of}} the majority of respondents the administration workload has not changed as a result of the change in legislation in the area of benefits for people with a severe motor disability. The respondents have a negative view regarding the character (depth) of investigation of the social and financial situation and negatively perceive the approach of an officer. In other areas their views are neutral or they have not noticed any change after the change in legislation. To conclude, it is possible to state that from the respondents? point of view, the social reform has not been perceived as beneficial...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} an {{insertion}} heuristic for scheduling <b>Mobility</b> <b>Allowance</b> Shuttle Transit (MAST) services, an innovative concept that merges {{the flexibility of}} Demand Responsive Transit (DRT) systems with the low cost operability of fixed-route bus systems. A MAST system allows buses to deviate from the fixed path so that customers within the service area may be picked up or dropped off at their desired locations. Such a service already exists in Los Angeles County. Line 646 operates during nighttime, transporting passengers between a business area and a nearby bus terminal; since the current demand of the service is very low, the service is entirely manageable by the bus operator, but a higher demand would certainly require the help of information technologies {{by means of a}} scheduling algorithm. We carry out a set of simulations to show the performance of the algorithm in the service area covered by the existing MTA Line 646 at different demand levels. The results show that our approach can be used as an effective method to automate scheduling of this line and other services similar to it. Au t o r' P ers on a...|$|E
40|$|This lecture covers some {{subjects}} of direct {{concern to the}} medical profession contained within the Pearson Report. Each injury group was examined by the Royal Commission, both here and abroad, particular attention being paid {{to the relationship between}} tort and social security. By consensus it was proposed that in the majority of fields no-fault compensations should be extended but that the tort system should continue to have a role. Recommendations were also put forward that no damages should be permitted for non-pecuniary loss during the first 3 months and that the full value of the social security benefits should be deductible from all tort damages. Damages for permanent injury or death should be index-linked periodic payments. A new no-fault compensation scheme for road accidents was described as well as a new disabled children's allowance of 4 pounds per week with a <b>mobility</b> <b>allowance</b> at the lower age of 2 years. Medical injury was examined carefully, but it was decided that negligence liability should continue unchanged, with the proviso that the no-fault compensation schemes in New Zealand and in Sweden should be followed. These two schemes have therefore been described in some detail...|$|E
