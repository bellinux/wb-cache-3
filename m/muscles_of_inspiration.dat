40|$|This patient {{presented}} with tachypnea {{and use of}} the inspiratory accessory muscles. Chest auscultation revealed diffusely decreased air entry bilaterally and early inspiratory rales. A chest radiograph showed hyperinflation and increased radiolu-cency of the lungs. The results of pulmonary function tests were consistent with severe airflow obstruction that did not respond to bronchodilators (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV 1] 29 % predicted). On physical examination, we noticed circular, bilateral, hyperkeratotic skin patches above both knees (Figure 1). These lesions, also known as the “thinker’s sign,” 1 arise from irritation of the skin caused by pressure from the elbows in patients who spend long periods of time in the tripod posi-tion (Figure 1). The braced body position, a nonspecific finding in respiratory distress, max-imizes effectiveness of the accessory <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> Leaning forward also increases intra-abdominal pressure, allowing the flattened diaphragm to regain its natural shape and its ability to function as a piston. 2 Although it is most often observed in severe obstructive lung disease (FEV 1 < 30 % predicted), this sign can be seen in other conditions where respi-ratory distress occurs, including congestive heart failure.

40|$|Purpose: Skeletal muscle damage occurs {{following}} high-intensity or unaccustomed exercise; however, it {{is difficult}} to monitor damage to the respiratory muscles, particularly in humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} use clinical measures to investigate the presence of skeletal muscle damage in the inspiratory muscles. Methods: Ten healthy subjects underwent 60 minutes of voluntary inspiratory threshold loading (ITL) at 70 % of maximal inspiratory pressure. Maximal inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures, delayed onset muscle soreness on a visual analogue scale and plasma creatine kinase were measured prior to ITL, and at repeated time points after ITL (4, 24 and 48 hours post-ITL). Results: Delayed onset muscle soreness was present in all subjects 24 hours following ITL (intensity = 22 ± 6 mm; significantly higher than baseline p = 0. 02). Muscle soreness was reported primarily in the anterior neck region, and was correlated to the amount of work done by the inspiratory muscles during ITL (r = 0. 72, p = 0. 02). However, no significant change was observed in maximal inspiratory or expiratory pressures or creatine kinase. Conclusions: These findings suggest that an intense bout of ITL results in muscle soreness primarily in the accessory <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> however, may be insufficient to cause significant muscle damage in healthy adults...|$|E

40|$|The {{respiratory}} system {{works with the}} cardiovascular system to supply tissues with oxygen, to remove carbon dioxide, and to maintain a normal acid-base balance (i. e. blood gas homeostasis).

40|$|An {{animal model}} was {{developed}} to describe respiratory muscle work output, blood flow, and oxygen consumption during mechanical ventilation, resting spontaneous ventilation, and the increased unobstructed ventilatory efforts induced by CO 2 rebreathing. Almost all {{of the work of}} breathing was inspiratory work at all ventilatory levels; thus, only blood flows to the diaphragm and external intercostals increased in the transition from mechanical to spontaneous ventilation, and they further increased linearly as ventilatory work was incrementally augmented ninefold by CO 2 rebreathing. No other <b>muscles</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> manifest increased blood flows. A small amount of expiratory work was measured at high ventilatory volumes during which two expiratory muscles (transverse abdominal and intercostals) had moderate increases in blood flow. Blood pressure did not change, but cardiac output doubled. Arterial-venous oxygen content difference across the diaphragm increased progressively, so oxygen delivery was augmented by both increased blood flow and increased oxygen extraction at all work loads. Oxygen consumption increased linearly as work of breathing increased, so efficiency did not change significantly. The mean efficiency of the respiratory muscles was 15. 5 %. These results differ significantly from the patterns previously observed by us during increased work of breathing induced by inspiratory resistance, suggesting a different distribution of work load among the various muscles of respiration, a different fractionation of oxygen delivery between blood flow and oxygen extraction, and a higher efficiency when shortening, not tension development, of the muscle is increased...|$|E

40|$|The diaphragm, {{the main}} <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration,</b> is {{constantly}} subjected to mechanical loading. One {{of the very}} few occasions during which diaphragm loading is arrested is during controlled mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. Recent animal studies indicate that the diaphragm is extremely sensitive to unloading, causing rapid muscle fiber atrophy: unloading-induced diaphragm atrophy and the concomitant diaphragm weakness has been suggested to contribute to the difficulties in weaning patients from ventilatory support. Little is known about the molecular triggers that initiate the rapid unloading atrophy of the diaphragm, although proteolytic pathways and oxidative signaling {{have been shown to be}} involved. Mechanical stress is known to play an important role in the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>muscle</b> mass. Within the muscle's sarcomere titin is considered to play an important role in the stress-response machinery. Titin is the largest protein known to date and acts as a mechanosensor that regulates muscle protein expression in a sarcomere strain-dependent fashion. Thus, titin is an attractive candidate for sensing the sudden mechanical arrest of the diaphragm when patients are mechanically ventilated, leading to changes in muscle protein expression. Here, we provide a novel perspective on how titin, and its biomechanical sensing and signaling, might be involved in the development of mechanical unloading-induced diaphragm weakness...|$|R
40|$|Crocodilians use a {{combination}} of three muscular mechanisms to effect lung ventilation: the intercostal muscles producing thoracic movement, the abdominal muscles producing pelvic rotation and gastralial translation, and the diaphragmaticus muscle producing visceral displacement. Earlier studies suggested that the diaphragmaticus is a primary <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> in crocodilians, but direct measurements of the diaphragmatic contribution to lung ventilation and gas exchange have not been made to date. In this study, ventilation, metabolic rate and arterial blood gases were measured from juvenile estuarine crocodiles under three conditions: (i) while resting at 30 °C and 20 °C; (ii) while breathing hypercapnic gases; and (iii) during immediate recovery from treadmill exercise. The relative contribution of the diaphragmaticus was then determined by obtaining measurements before and after transection <b>of</b> the <b>muscle.</b> The diaphragmaticus was found to make only a limited contribution to lung ventilation while crocodiles were resting at 30 °C and 20 °C, and during increased respiratory drive induced by hypercapnic gas. However, the diaphragmaticus muscle was found to {{play a significant role in}} facilitating a higher rate of inspiratory airflow in response to exercise. Transection of the diaphragmaticus decreased the exercise-induced increase in the rate <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> (with no compensatory increases in the duration <b>of</b> <b>inspiration),</b> thus compromising the exercise-induced increases in tidal volume and minute ventilation. These results suggest that, in C. porosus, costal ventilation alone is able to support metabolic demands at rest, and the diaphragmaticus is largely an accessory muscle used at times of elevated metabolic demand...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Postoperative {{pulmonary}} complications {{are significant}} contributors to morbidity {{in patients who}} have undergone upper abdominal, thoracic, or cardiac surgery. The pathophysiology of these complications might involve postoperative inspiratory muscle weakness. The nature <b>of</b> postoperative inspiratory <b>muscle</b> weakness is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of surgery on {{the functioning of the}} diaphragm, the main <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration.</b> METHODS: Serial biopsies from the diaphragm and the latissimus dorsi muscle were obtained from 6 patients during thoracotomy for resection of a tumor in the right lung. Biopsies were taken as soon as the diaphragm had been exposed (t(0)) and again after 2 hours (t(2)). The contractile performance <b>of</b> demembranated <b>muscle</b> fibers, as well as fiber morphology and markers for proteolysis, was determined. RESULTS: In all patients, the force-generating capacity <b>of</b> diaphragm <b>muscle</b> fibers at t(2) was significantly reduced (~ 35 %) compared with that at t(0), with a more pronounced force loss in type 2 fibers compared with type 1 fibers. Diaphragm weakness was not part <b>of</b> a generalized <b>muscle</b> weakness as contractile performance of latissimus dorsi fibers was preserved at t(2). Diaphragm fiber size and myofibrillar structure were not different at t(2) compared with t 0, but myosin heavy chain type 2 was significantly reduced at t(2) and MuRF- 1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated at t(2).

Both unilateral cervical injury paradigms are reproducible with no mortality or need for breathing assistance, and are accompanied by phrenic motor neuron loss, phrenic nerve axon degeneration, diaphragm atrophy, denervation and subsequent partial reinnervation at the diaphragm neuromuscular junction, changes in spontaneous diaphragm EMG recordings, and reduction in phrenic nerve compound muscle action potential amplitude. These findings demonstrate significant and chronically persistent respiratory compromise following mid-cervical SCI due to phrenic motor neuron degeneration. These injury paradigms and accompanying analyses provide important tools both for understanding mechanisms of phrenic motor neuron and diaphragm pathology following SCI and for evaluating therapeutic strategies in clinically relevant cervical SCI models.

40|$|Objectives: The {{diaphragm}} is {{the primary}} <b>muscle</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> and provides life sustaining oxygen to the body (Voyvoda et al, 2011). It is active during relaxed and effort induced ventilation. Diaphragm contraction results in pressure changes within the thorax thereby assisting in airflow into the lungs and increasing lung volumes. During this inhalation process the diaphragm moves from a dome-shaped relaxed position into a flattened shortened position. Often during the increased work of breathing in patients suffering from {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), the diaphragm does not sit in its anatomical resting position; it shortens and weakens (Watson et al, 2001). Stretching <b>of</b> skeletal <b>muscles</b> is a physiotherapy treatment modality commonly used in clinical practice. The aim of this treatment modality is to increase the length <b>of</b> a shortened <b>muscle</b> thereby improving the range of motion <b>of</b> said <b>muscle</b> and improving the specific joint motion (Wepler and Magnusson, 2011). Head down tilt positions are commonly used in cardiopulmonary physiotherapy to utilise gravity to facilitate sputum drainage from different lung segments (Pryor & Prasad, 2008; Selsby & Jones, 1990). A head down tilt position could potentially have an influence on diaphragm length if applied for a sustained period of time due to likely abdominal content displacement from a caudal to cranial position resulting in a stretch on the diaphragm. The objective was to determine if diaphragm length could be influenced by providing a stretch using the abdominal contents. Moreover, to see if this hypothesized change in length would influence the diaphragm’s function. Method: A quasi-experimental study was conducted from January to April 2012 with undergraduate physiotherapy students as study participants. Seventy five study participants were assessed for baseline outcome measures at rest. They then underwent four body position changes after which each measurement was re-recorded. These body position changes were: • lying in a head down tilt position at 15 degrees for 30 seconds • lying in a head down tilt position at 15 degrees for two minutes • lying in a head down tilt position at 30 degrees for 30 seconds • lying in a head down tilt position at 30 degrees for two minutes Ultrasound was used to measure the diaphragm length. Its function was recorded in terms of the expiratory flow generated and the thoracic expansion measured. Dyspnoea was recorded for a subjective view of tolerance of the position and vital signs were monitored throughout for the volunteers’ safety. ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis, Bartlett’s test and the student’s t test were used for statistical analysis. Results: All 75 participants completed the entire study and none were withdrawn as a result of negative side effects. The results showed that the diaphragm could be stretched by using the abdominal contents in a head down tilt position (p= 0. 00). The mean and standard deviation for the greatest change from rest was 38. 78 mm (± 11. 51) on the left and 39. 38 mm (± 11. 92) on the right. There were no detrimental effects to the participants’ cardiovascular or pulmonary stability. Thoracic expansion and peak flow showed an insignificant change throughout the changes in position. Thoracic expansion had a mean change of 2. 48 cm (± 0. 86) with a p value of 0. 54. Peak expiratory flow rate had a change of 428. 94 L/min (± 95. 01) with a p value of 0. 98. These values were less than the normal expected values for the participants. Conclusion: A change in diaphragm length is possible by applying a stretch to the muscle. A stretch can be applied by placing the participant in a head down tilt position which allows the abdominal contents to push {{on the underside of the}} diaphragm in a cranial direction. No adverse effects occurred in healthy adult individuals during the different head-down tilt positions. Respiratory function did not show a significant improvement due to the change in diaphragm length as measured by peak expiratory flow rate and thoracic expansion...|$|R

The material for developing a progressive understanding <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> has been provided by hermeneutic interviews carried out with volunteers at different levels of organisational hierarchy from three participating organisations to identify the various meanings <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> and their use, as well as gain a richer understanding how inspiration affects people at work. The findings stemming from participants' accounts were then used to conceptualise inspiration in organisational settings. The results of the study indicate that inspiration is significant to the context of contemporary work organisations and is often intentionally sought out at all organisational levels. The account on inspiration created in this study signifies that currently use <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> in organisational contexts lacks theoretical underpinning, wherein inspiration is often merely used in a flexible lexical way to add either clarity or ambiguity to any communication, depending on its context. Overall, having explored inspiration in organisational settings, this study has identified it as an emerging concept, which fundamentally exists and is recognised in contemporary work organisations. The developed conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>inspiration</b> allow for the rethinking of various aspects of organisational contexts and leadership and motivation theory in particular.
