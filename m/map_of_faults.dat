We use published seismicity and re-fraction data, a new 5 'x 7. 5 ' free-air/Bouguer gravity and topography data set, and a detailed <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> obtained from high resolution SPOT imagery. Analysis of the gravity field over the North Baikal rift zone indicates significant asymmetry of the mechanical processes governing the deformation of the diverging sides of the rift. These anomalies cmmot be explained by a conventional continuous plate undergoing extension beneath the rift zone, whereas a strong mechanical discontinuity (wedge shaped detachment zone beneath the rift axis) is able to reproduce observations. Such a discontinuous model provides a good fit to the gravity and crustal thickness data and explains the deep seismicity reported there...|$|E

40|$|This work {{shows the}} results of a {{structural}} study of the faults observed at the Tempe Rift (northeastern Tharsis region), Mars. A new, detailed <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> and fault systems was used to geometrically characterize the fracture architecture of the Tempe Rift and to measure fault length, displacement, and spacing data, to analyze the spatial distribution of fault centroids, and to investigate the fractal nature of fault trace maps. A comparison with analog models and the use of conventional techniques of fault population analysis show that the Tempe Rift was most probably generated under sinistral oblique-rifting processes, which highlights the importance of the presence of inherited fractures in the tectonic evolution of the Noachian crust. The angle between the extension direction and the rift axis varies along the Tempe Rift, ranging from 50 º– 60 º at its central southern part to 66 º– 88 º to the southwest. Fault scaling relationships are similar to those found at midocean ridges on Earth with exponential fault length-frequency distributions. Localized, inhomogeneous deformation generated weakly interacting faults, spanning the entire thickness of the mechanical layer. This thickness decreased from southwest to northeast along the rift, along with distance from {{the central part of the}} Tharsis dome...|$|E
40|$|A <b>map</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> in a 60 km 2 {{area of the}} {{southern}} North Sea has been produced from three-dimensional seismic data. The faults shown on the map obey power-law cumulative-frequency distributions for throw (power-law exponent, D, nearly equal 2. 7) and length (D nearly equal 1. 1). Simulations {{have been carried out}} to correct for sampling biases in the data and to make predictions of the throw and length scaling characteristics of the faults. The most important bias is caused by poor resolution of the small displacement tip zones of faults. The raw data show considerable scatter in their length:throw ratios, but they more closely fit a linear relationship if a length of 500 m is added to each fault, thereby making up for the zones near the fault tips with throws (nearly equal 15 m) below seismic resolution. Further variability in the data may be caused by such geological factors as fault interaction. Tip lengths have been extended to simulate the actual fault pattern in the study area. Maps produced by this procedure can be used to estimate the true connectivity of the fault network. Extending the faults results in greater connectivity than shown by the raw data, which may cause greater compartmentalization of the rock mass. This greater compartmentalization has implications for hydrocarbon exploitation if the faults are sealing. A problem with the model, however, {{is that it does not}} deal effectively with the interaction of subparallel, noncoplanar faults. To test the reliability of the procedure, we analyzed exposure-scale faults in Somerset, United Kingdom, where the tips are well constrained. Both length-throw relationships and map-pattern connectivity for the simulated fault networks agree closely with the actual data. <br/...|$|E

Escarpments 1 [...] 10 meters high were formed along an earthquake rupture extending for 100 km. The deformation zone was markedly asymmetric, much wider in the hanging wall than the footwall. Trenches excavated across the escarpment showed well-preserved fault and fold structures at scales ranging from millimeters to meters. To understand the development of deformation zones and escarpment shapes during thrusting, I undertook several different modeling and observational approaches.

40|$|Abstract: In {{seismology}} {{the accurate}} <b>mapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>faults</b> and fault zones {{plays an important}} role as a crucial step for characterizing the earthquake potential of an area. Cross-hole seismic surveys for engineering site investigations can provide high resolution images of subsurface seismic velocity capable of delineating tectonic structures such as vertical or dipping faults juxtaposing different geological formations or step-like structures with good accuracy. The result of velocity reconstruction in travel time seismic tomography is restricted by factors such as ray aperture and distribution. These physical limitations cannot be completely surmounted even in cross borehole acquisitions where the ray coverage is the best one possible. The present paper studies the effects of staggering normal grids as a tool to increase resolution and reduce inversion vagueness and instability. Truncated Singular Value Decomposition as a mathematical tool of least demands on the final solution is utilized, and the inversion scheme is examined with respect to the number of available data. Numerical simulations of a model featuring a fault-like structure are performed and the resulting recovered images are compared against straight grid inversions. Reconstructed images using staggered grids provide a smoothed version o...|$|R
