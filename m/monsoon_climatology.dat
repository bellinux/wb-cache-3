40|$|The {{regional}} {{climate model}} HIRHAM {{has been applied}} over the Asian continent to simulate the Indian monsoon circulation under present-day conditions. The model is driven at the lateral and lower boundaries by European reanalysis (ERA 40) data for the period from 1958 to 2001. Simulations with a horizontal resolution of 50 [*]km are carried out to analyze the regional monsoon patterns. The focus in this paper is on the validation of the long-term summer <b>monsoon</b> <b>climatology</b> and its variability concerning circulation, temperature, and precipitation. Additionally, the monsoonal behavior in simulations for wet and dry years has been investigated and compared against several observational data sets. The results successfully reproduce the observations due to a realistic reproduction of topographic features. The simulated precipitation shows a better agreement with a high-resolution gridded precipitation data set over the central land areas of India and in the higher elevated Tibetan and Himalayan regions than ERA 40...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose to}} {{investigate}} the climatology, variability, and potential anthropogenic alter-ation of the austral summer monsoon in the CMIP 2 and CMIP 2 + CGCMs. The primary goal of this proposal will be to compare the monthly climatology of the austral sum-mer monsoon between the various CMIP 2 and CMIP 2 + models and observations. For models that produce a reasonable <b>monsoon</b> <b>climatology,</b> we will further investigate the interannual (for CMIP 2 and CMIP 2 +) and daily to intraseasonal (for CMIP 2 +) variabil-ity of the austral summer monsoon. Finally, the effect of anthropogenic forcing will be investigated using the transient CO 2 simulations provided in CMIP 2 and CMIP 2 +. Background The austral summer monsoon is a dominant feature of the tropical seasonal cycle, bring-ing heavy precipitation to Indonesia and northern Australia during the austral summer months. The monsoon onset varies from year to year, but typical progresses in a south-eastward direction from (about) October through January (see, e. g., Tanaka, 1994). Monsoon retreat generally follows the opposite path, occurring from February through April. Variability (from daily to interannual time scales) in the rate and duration of pre...|$|E
40|$|The Global Monsoons Model Inter-comparison Project (GMMIP) {{has been}} {{endorsed}} by the panel of Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP) {{as one of the}} participating MIPs in the sixth phase of CMIP (CMIP 6). The focus of GMMIP is on <b>monsoon</b> <b>climatology,</b> variability, prediction and projection, which is relevant to four of the “Grand Challenges” proposed by the World Climate Research Programme. At present, 21 international modelling groups are committed to joining GMMIP. This overview paper introduces the motivation behind GMMIP and the scientific questions it intends to answer. Three tiers of experiments, of decreasing priority, are designed to examine: (a) model skill in simulating the climatology and interannual-to-multidecadal variability of global monsoons in SST-forced experiments of the historical climate period; (b) the roles of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in driving variations of the global and regional monsoons; and (c) the effects of large orographic terrain on the establishment of the monsoons. The outputs of the CMIP 6 DECK, “historical” simulation and endorsed MIPs will also be used in the diagnostic analysis of GMMIP to give a comprehensive understanding of the roles played by different external forcings, potential improvements in the simulation of monsoon rainfall at high resolution and reproducibility at decadal time scales. The implementation of GMMIP will improve our understanding of the fundamental physics of changes in the global and regional monsoons over the past 140 years and ultimately benefit monsoons prediction and projection in the current century...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A modern summer-climate {{analogue}} {{of western}} United States 6 ka palaeoclimate, based on broad-scale patterns from proxy data and general-circulation-model simulations, provides details concerning its sum-mer synoptic climatology. August 1955 {{serves as a}} close analogue, featuring an amplified subtropical ridge aloft and anticyclonic flow near the surface over the central United States and stronger westerly flow along the Canadian/northwest United States border. The August 1955 summer-temperature pattern, similar to those from general-circulation-model simulations, exhibits positive anomalies {{throughout most of the}} continental interior. The August 1955 precipitation pattern corresponds very closely with patterns of effective moisture from proxy data, showing widespread aridity and some stronger monsoonal activity in the Southwest. The analogue suggests that the amplified subtropical ridge is a very important feature of 6 ka palaeoclimate, with the circulation pattern differing from that in the early Holocene, implying interactions between both Milankov-itch and sub-Milankovitch forcing factors.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the East Asian <b>monsoon</b> (EAM) on <b>climatology</b> and interannual {{variability}} of tropospheric ozone (O 3) over the coastal South China was investigated by analyzing 11 years of ozonesonde data over Hong Kong {{with the aid of}} Lagrangian dispersion modeling of carbon monoxide and calculation of an EAM index. It was found that the seasonal cycle of O 3 in the lower troposphere is highly related to the EAM over the study region. Ozone enhancements in the free troposphere are associated with the monsoon-induced transport of pollutants of continental anthropogenic and biomass burning origins. Lower tropospheric O 3 levels showed high interannual variability, with an annual averaged amplitude up to 61 % of averaged concentrations in the boundary layer (0 - 1 km altitudes) and 49 % below 3 km altitude. In spring and autumn, the interannual variability in boundary layer O 3 levels was predominately influenced by the EAM intensity, with high O 3 mixing ratios associated with northeasterly circulation anomalies.

40|$|This {{research}} thesis first {{examines the}} ability of Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and Community Climate System Model (CCSM) in simulating the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) summer precipitation in a framework of ensemble. On this basis, the climatic relevant singular vectors (CSVs) perturbation theory is applied to investigate the optimal error growth of SAM seasonal forecast due to the uncertainties in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Then, the ensemble prediction of SAM constructed by CSVs is evaluated, and further compared with one traditional ensemble method. It is found that CAM 4 adequately simulated monsoon precipitation, and considerably reduced systematic errors that occurred in its predecessors, although it tends to overestimate monsoon precipitation when compared with observations. In terms of monsoon interannual variability and its teleconnection with sea surface temperature (SST), CAM 4 showed modest skill. In the CCSM 4 coupled simulations, several aspects of the monsoon simulation are improved, including the cross-variability of simulated precipitation and SST. A significant improvement {{is seen in the}} spatial distribution of <b>monsoon</b> mean <b>climatology</b> where a too-heavy monsoon precipitation, which occurred in CAM 4, is rectified. A detailed investigation of precipitation reduction, using sensitivity experiments, showed that the large systematic cold SST errors in the northern Indian Ocean reduces monsoon precipitation and delays the monsoon onset by weakening local evaporation. The CSV analysis using CAM 4 revealed that the SST uncertainties in Indian Ocean can result in much larger error growth of SAM seasonal forecast than those in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. It is seen that the CSVs error growth rate changes significantly depending on the initial states whereas the CSVs patterns are insensitive to the initial conditions. The CAM 4 comparison with CCSM 4 coupled model indicated that the CSVs patterns from CAM 4 are similar to those from CCSM 4 while the error growth rate is lower in CAM 4 than in CCSM 4.

40|$|Proxy reconstructions of {{precipitation}} from central India, north-central China, and southern Vietnam reveal {{a series of}} monsoon droughts during the mid 14 th– 15 th centuries that each lasted for several years to decades. These monsoon megadroughts have no analog during the instrumental period. They occurred {{in the context of}} widespread thermal and hydrologic climate anomalies marking the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA) and appear to have {{played a major role in}} shaping significant regional societal changes at that time. New tree ring-width based reconstructions of monsoon variability suggest episodic and widespread reoccurrences of monsoon megadroughts continued throughout the LIA. Although the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays an important role in monsoon variability, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that these megadroughts were associated with anomalous sea surface temperature anomalies that were solely the result of ENSO-like variability in the tropical Pacific. Instead, the causative mechanisms of these megadroughts may reside in protracted changes in the synoptic-scale <b>monsoon</b> <b>climatology</b> of the Indian Ocean. Today, the intra-seasonal monsoon variability is dominated by ‘active’ and the ‘break’ spells – two distinct oscillatory modes of monsoon that have radically different synoptic scale circulation and precipitation patterns. We suggest that protracted locking of the monsoon into the “break-dominated” mode – a mode that favors reduced precipitation over the Indian sub-continent and SE Asia and enhanced precipitation over the equatorial Indian Ocean, may have caused these exceptional droughts. Impetus for periodic locking of the monsoon into this mode may have been provided by cooler temperatures at the extratropical latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere which forced the mean position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) further southward in the Indian Ocean...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA near-global grid-point nudging of the Arpege-Climat {{atmospheric}} General Circulation Model towards ECMWF reanalyses is used {{to diagnose}} the regional versus remote origin of the summer model biases and variability over West Africa. First part of this study revealed a limited impact on the <b>monsoon</b> <b>climatology</b> compared to a control experiment without nudging, but a significant improvement of interannual variability, although the amplitude of the seasonal anomalies remained underestimated. Focus is given here on intraseasonal variability of monsoon rainfall and dynamics. The reproducible part of these signals is investigated through 30 -member ensemble experiments computed for the 1994 rainy season, a year abnormally wet over the Sahel but representative of the model systematic biases. In the control experiment, Arpege-Climat simulates too few rainy days {{that are associated with}} too low rainfall amounts over the central and western Sahel, in line with the seasonal dry biases. Nudging the model outside Africa tends to slightly increase the number of rainy days over the Sahel, but has little effect on associated rainfall amounts. However, results do indicate that {{a significant part of the}} monsoon intraseasonal variability simulated by Arpege-Climat is controlled by lateral boundary conditions. Parts of the wet/dry spells over the Sahel occur in phase in the 30 members of the nudging experiment, and are therefore embedded in larger-scale variability patterns. Inter-member spread is however not constant across the selected summer season. It is partly controlled by African Easterly Waves, which show dissimilar amplitude from one member to another, but a coherent phasing in all members. A lowpass filtering of the nudging fields suggests that low frequency variations in the lateral boundary conditions can lead to eastward extensions of the African Easterly Jet, creating a favorable environment for easterly waves, while high frequency perturbations seem to control their phasing...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostics from {{observed}} precipitation and National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research re-analysis products {{reveal that}} after the 1976 - 77 climate shift in the Pacific there was {{a dramatic change in}} the response of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) to El Nino, particularly during the months of July and August. Based on 1950 - 75 (PRE 76) and 1977 - 2001 (POST 76) El Nino composites: the western North Pacific monsoon (WNPM) was stronger than normal in both periods; the ISM was weaker than normal during the entire monsoon season in PRE 76, but in POST 76 was weaker only during the onset and withdrawal phases. In terms of observed sea surface temperature (SST) during July-August, the major differences between the two periods are the presence of cold SST anomalies over the Indo-Pacific warm pool and the intensity of warm SST anomalies in the central Pacific in POST 76. The effect of these differences on the ISM is investigated in a suite of experiments with an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) that has a realistic <b>monsoon</b> precipitation <b>climatology.</b> Separate ten-member ensemble simulations with the AGCM were conducted for PRE 76 and POST 76 El Nino events with SST anomalies inserted as follows: (i) tropical Indo-Pacific (TIP), (ii) tropical Pacific only (TPO), and (iii) tropical Indian Ocean only (TIO). Qualitatively, TPO solutions reproduce the observed differences in the monsoon response in both periods. Specifically, during July-August of POST 76 the cold SST anomalies in conjunction with remote subsidence suppress precipitation (3 - 5 mm day(- 1)) over the maritime continent and equatorial central Indian Ocean. Inclusion of Indian Ocean SST anomalies in the TIP runs further suppresses precipitation over the entire equatorial Indian Ocean. The low-level anticyclonic circulation anomalies that develop as a Rossby-wave response to these convective anomalies increase the south-westerlies over the northern Indian Ocean, and favour a stronger ISM and WNPM. During PRE 76 the non-occurrence of cold SST anomalies over the Indo-Pacific warm pool reinforces El Nino's suppression on the ISM. In contrast, TIO solutions show a reduced ISM during July-August of POST 76; the solutions, however, show a significant effect on the WNPM during both PRE 76 and POST 76 periods. It is argued that SSTs over the entire tropical Indo-Pacific region need to be considered to understand the El Nino Southern Oscillation-monsoon linkage, and to make predictions of rainfall over India and the western North Pacific...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} {{extensive}} integrations produced for the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR 4) {{to examine the relationship}} between ENSO and the monsoon at interannual and decadal timescales. We begin with an analysis of the monsoon simulation in the 20 th century integrations. Six of the 18 models were found to have a reasonably realistic representation of <b>monsoon</b> precipitation <b>climatology.</b> For each of these six models SST and anomalous precipitation evolution along the equatorial Pacific during El Nino events display considerable differences when compared to observations. Out of these six models only four (GFDL{_}CM{_} 2. 0, GFDL{_}CM{_} 2. 1, MRI, and MPI{_}ECHAM 5) exhibit a robust ENSO-monsoon contemporaneous teleconnection, including the known inverse relationship between ENSO and rainfall variations over India. Lagged correlations between the all-India rainfall (AIR) index and Nino 3. 4 SST reveal that three models represent the timing of the teleconnection, including the spring predictability barrier which is manifested as the transition from positive to negative correlations prior to the monsoon onset. Furthermore, only one of these three models (GFDL{_}CM{_} 2. 1) captures the observed phase lag with the strongest anticorrelation of SST peaking 2 - 3 months after the summer monsoon, which is partially attributable to the intensity of simulated El Nino itself. We find that the models that best capture the ENSO-monsoon teleconnection are those that correctly simulate the timing and location of SST and diabatic heating anomalies in the equatorial Pacific, and the associated changes to the equatorial Walker Circulation during El Nino events. The strength of the AIR-Nino 3. 4 SST correlation in the model runs waxes and wanes to some degree on decadal timescales. The overall magnitude and timescale for this decadal modulation in most of the models is similar to that seen in observations. However, there is little consistency in the phase among the realizations, suggesting a lack of predictability of the decadal modulation of the monsoon-ENSO relationship. The analysis was repeated for each of the four models using results from integrations in which the atmospheric CO{sub 2 } concentration was raised to twice pre-industrial values. From these ''best'' models in the double CO{sub 2 } simulations there are increases in both the mean monsoon rainfall over the Indian sub-continent (by 5 - 25 %) and in its interannual variability (5 - 10 %). We find for each model that the ENSO-monsoon correlation in the global warming runs is very similar to that in the 20 th century runs, suggesting that the ENSO-monsoon connection will not weaken as global climate warms. This result, though plausible, needs to be taken with some caution because of the diversity in the simulation of ENSO variability in the coupled models we have analyzed. The implication of the present results for monsoon prediction are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the ability of}} the Advanced Research WRF (ARW) regional model to simulate Indian summer <b>monsoon</b> (ISM) rainfall <b>climatology</b> in different climate zones during the monsoon onset phase in the decade 2000 – 2009. The initial and boundary conditions for ARW are provided from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Project (NNRP) global reanalysis. Seasonal onset-phase rainfall is compared with corresponding values from 0. 25 ° IMD (India Meteorological Department) rainfall and NNRP precipitation data over seven climate zones (perhumid, humid, dry/moist, subhumid, dry/moist, semiarid and arid) of India to see whether dynamical downscaling using a regional model yields advantages over just using large-scale model predictions. Results show that the model could simulate the onset phase in terms of progression and distribution of rainfall in most zones (except over the northeast) with good correlations and low error metrics. The observed mean onset dates and their variability over different zones are well reproduced by the regional model over most climate zones. It has been found that the ARW performed similarly to the reanalysis in most zones and improves the onset time by 1 to 3 days in zones 4 and 7, in which the NNRP shows a delayed onset compared to the actual IMD onset times. The variations in the onset-phase rainfall during the below-normal onset (June negative) and above-normal onset (June positive) phases are well simulated. The slight underestimation of onset-phase rainfall in the northeast zone could be due to failure in resolving the wide extent of topographic variations and the associated multiscale interactions in that zone. Spatial comparisons showed improvement of pentad rainfall in both space and quantity in ARW simulations over NNRP data, as evident from a wider eastward distribution of pentad rainfall over the Western Ghats, central and eastern India, as in IMD observations. While NNRP under-represented the high pentad rainfall over northeast, east and west coast areas, the ARW captured these regional features showing improvement upon NNRP reanalysis, which {{may be due to the}} high resolution (30 km) employed. The onset-phase rainfall characteristics during the contrasting ISM of 2003 and 2009 are well simulated in terms of the variations in the strength of low-level jet (LLJ) and outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) ...|$|R
