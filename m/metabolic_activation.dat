25|$|Acrolein is a {{pyrolysis}} {{product that is}} abundant in cigarette smoke. It gives smoke an acrid smell and an irritating, lachrymatory effect and is {{a major contributor to}} its carcinogenicity. Like PAH metabolites, acrolein is also an electrophilic alkylating agent and permanently binds to the DNA base guanine, by a conjugate addition followed by cyclization into a hemiaminal. The acrolein-guanine adduct induces mutations during DNA copying and thus causes cancers {{in a manner similar to}} PAHs. However, acrolein is 1000 times more abundant than PAHs in cigarette smoke and is able to react as is, without <b>metabolic</b> <b>activation.</b> Acrolein has been shown to be a mutagen and carcinogen in human cells. The carcinogenicity of acrolein has been difficult to study by animal experimentation, because it has such a toxicity that it tends to kill the animals before they develop cancer. Generally, compounds able to react by conjugate addition as electrophiles (so-called Michael acceptors after Michael reaction) are toxic and carcinogenic, because they can permanently alkylate DNA, similarly to mustard gas or aflatoxin. Acrolein is only one of them present in cigarette smoke; for example, crotonaldehyde has been found in cigarette smoke. Michael acceptors also contribute to the chronic inflammation present in tobacco disease.|$|E

40|$|SummarySurvival during {{prolonged}} food deprivation {{depends on}} the activation of hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Here we show using cell-type-specific gene ablation that the winged helix transcription factor Foxa 2 is required for activation of the hepatic gluconeogenic program during fasting. Specifically, Foxa 2 promotes gene activation both by cyclic AMP, the second messenger for glucagon, and glucocorticoids. Foxa 2 mediates these effects by enabling recruitment of CREB and GR to their respective target sites in chromatin. We conclude that Foxa 2 is required for execution of the hepatic gluconeogenic program by integrating the transcriptional response of the hepatocyte to hormonal stimulation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryFatty acid synthase (FAS) is {{a central}} enzyme in {{lipogenesis}} and transcriptionally activated in response to feeding and insulin signaling. The transcription factor USF {{is required for the}} activation of FAS transcription, and we show here that USF phosphorylation by DNA-PK, which is dephosphorylated by PP 1 in response to feeding, triggers a switch-like mechanism. Under fasting conditions, USF- 1 is deacetylated by HDAC 9, causing promoter inactivation. In contrast, feeding induces the recruitment of DNA-PK to USF- 1 and its phosphorylation, which then allows recruitment of P/CAF, resulting in USF- 1 acetylation and FAS promoter activation. DNA break/repair components associated with USF induce transient DNA breaks during FAS activation. In DNA-PK-deficient SCID mice, feeding-induced USF- 1 phosphorylation/acetylation, DNA breaks, and FAS activation leading to lipogenesis are impaired, resulting in decreased triglyceride levels.

When administered orally the results showed prolongation of life expectancy and curing of L1210 and P388 leukemia in lab rats.
