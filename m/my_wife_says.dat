6000|$|... "But I {{say that}} there can be no insult in such a one as me asking such a one as her to be <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> To <b>say</b> that she doesn't {{remember}} my existence is absurd." ...|$|R

60|$|MARQ. DE POIV. He can't {{be serious}} there. What {{is the use}} of the people except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you must really let me have forty {{thousand}} roubles to-morrow? <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says</b> she must have a new diamond bracelet.|$|E

40|$|This article {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the Polish-Czechoslovak co-production What Will <b>My</b> <b>Wife</b> <b>Say</b> to This? (Co řekne žena, 1958, directed by Jaroslav Mach) as seen from the perspective of production-related and cultural factors. It provides a methodological background useful for the study of co-productions made in communist countries and presents the general circumstances of Polish-Czechoslovak co-operation in 1948 – 1958. The analysis of the film – the first Polish-Czechoslovak post-war co-production – shows the process of production as a field of conflicting goals and interests. This book was financially supported by the National Programme for the Development of Humanities: project “Cinema: Intercultural Perspective. Western-European Cinema in Poland, Polish Cinema in Western Europe. Mutual Perception of Film Cultures (1918 – 1939) ”...|$|R

60|$|MR. BARLOW. Does it?--does it?--Yes.--And as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says,</b> I {{leave it}} all to Gerald--this terrible situation. But I appeal to God, if {{anything}} in my power could have averted it, I would have averted it. I would have made any sacrifice. For {{it is a great}} and bitter trouble to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can {{you call}} that lovely head dreadful?" [...] asked the King. [...] "It's a much prettier face than he had before, to my notion, and <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says</b> I'm a good judge of beauty. Don't cry, little fox-boy.

6000|$|... "I ask, {{because at}} the present moment there is a woman in my {{quarters}} in barracks; how she got there I will tell you presently--she {{is in charge of}} <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> She <b>says</b> she is Mr. Harmer's grand-daughter; but whether truly or not, I cannot say. If she is, she is so much altered that I should not have known her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She was not {{averse to}} my father's company nor to mine {{a few years}} since;--no nor twelve months since. But I say nothing about that. Let her be averse. We cannot help it. I have come to {{you to say that}} I hope {{something}} may be done about the money before she becomes <b>my</b> <b>wife.</b> People <b>say</b> that you should have it." ...|$|R

"'Why, in {{the first}} place, I shall no sooner put them on than <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will <b>say,</b> [...] "My dear, {{you must have a}} new pair of knee-breeches," [...] and I shall get them. Then <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will <b>say,</b> [...] "My dear, how shabby your coat is! You must have a new one," [...] and I shall get a new coat. Then she will say, [...] "Now, my dear, that hat will never do," [...] and then I shall have a new hat; and then I shall say, [...] "My dear, it will never do for me to be so fine and you to wear your old gown," [...] and so <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will get a new gown; and then the new gown will require a new shawl and a new bonnet; all of which we shall not feel the need of if I don't take this pair of silk stockings, for, as long as we don't see them, our old things seem very well suited to each other.'" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says</b> {{that for}} ten years I was always either {{on the point of}} going somewhere, or just returning, and as I turn the pages of my diaries, I find this to be true, but also I find {{frequent}} mention of meetings with John Burroughs, Bacheller, Gilder, Alexander, Madame Modjeska, William Vaughn Moody and many others of my friends distinguished in the arts.|$|E
60|$|JONES. [Who leans {{with his}} arms on the dock behind, speaks in a slow, sullen voice.] Wot I say is wot <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says.</b> I 've never been 'ad up in a police court before, an' I can prove I took it when in liquor.

6000|$|The dinner {{went off}} very well. Neefit told {{how he had}} gone himself to the fishmonger's for that bit of salmon, how troubled his wife had been in mind about the lamb, and how Polly had made the salad.

6000|$|... "Scrunch 'em, sir," [...] {{returned}} the other, setting his heel {{heavily on the}} floor. [...] "You'll say you'll come? It's as much your interest as mine, you know, that the women should persuade each other that they're quiet and contented, and couldn't be better off. I know their way. Whatever one woman says, another woman is determined to clinch always. There's that spirit of emulation among 'em, sir, that if your <b>wife</b> <b>says</b> to <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> 'I'm the happiest woman in the world, and mine's the best husband in the world, and I dote on him,' <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> will <b>say</b> the same to yours, or more, and half believe it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Rook {{looked toward}} the bedroom door. [...] "Maybe you'll hear why, inside there. If I could have my way, you shouldn't see her--but she's not to be {{reasoned}} with. A caution, miss. Don't be too ready to believe what <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> may <b>say</b> to you. She's had a fright." [...] He opened the door. [...] "In my belief," [...] he whispered, [...] "she's off her head." ...|$|R
60|$|The man's face changed, and {{he looked}} anxiously at me. I {{did not know what}} <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> had been <b>saying,</b> but I had seen by her manner that she had been {{threatening}} him, and I shook my uplifted fist.|$|R

6000|$|... "I axe your pardon, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, a little abashed by Will's grave manner; [...] "didn't know they wos friends of yours. No offence, I 'ope.

6000|$|... "If anything, {{the house}} should be dearer than the {{household}} gear. Yet at each remove we drag a lengthening chain of tables, chairs, side-boards, portraits, landscapes, bedsteads, washstands, stoves, kitchen utensils, and bric-a-brac after us, because, as <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>says,</b> we cannot bear {{to part with}} them. At several times {{in our own lives}} we have accumulated stuff enough to furnish two or three house and have paid a pretty stiff house-rent in the form of storage for the overflow.

6000|$|MILLER, {{dropping}} on his knees, and fanning Mrs. Curwen: [...] "There! there! Wake up, Mrs. Curwen. I didn't mean to scold you for joking. I didn't, indeed.

6000|$|... "Ah, my friend, {{you are not}} a {{sanguine}} man by nature. If Mrs. Norman treats our poor Sydney just as {{a commonplace}} ill-tempered woman would treat her, I shall be surprised indeed. Say, if you like, that she will be insulted--of this I am sure, she will not return it; there is no expiation that is too bitter to be endured by that resolute little creature. Her fine nature has been tempered by adversity. A hard life has been Sydney's, depend upon it, in the years before you and I met with her. Good heavens! What would <b>my</b> <b>wife</b> <b>say</b> if she heard me? The women are nice, but they have their drawbacks. Let us wait till tomorrow, my dear boy; and let us believe in Sydney without allowing our wives--I beg your pardon, I mean my wife--to suspect in what forbidden directions our sympathies are leading us. Oh, for shame!" ...|$|R
60|$|Within a {{month we}} were wed {{on a certain}} October day in the church of St. Margaret's at Westminster. Once it was agreed all desired to push on this marriage, and not least Blanche herself. Sir Robert Aleys said that he wished to be gone from London to his estates in Sussex, having {{had enough of the}} Court and its ways, {{desiring}} there to live quietly till the end; I, being so much in love, was on fire for my bride, and Blanche herself vowed that she was eager to become <b>my</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>saying</b> that our courtship, which began on Hastings Hill, had lasted long enough. For the rest, there was nothing to cause delay. I cancelled Sir Robert's debt to me and signed a deed in favour of his daughter and her offspring, whereof I gave a copy to his lawyer and there was nought else to be done except to prepare my house for her which, with money at command, was easy.|$|R
