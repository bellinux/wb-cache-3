5000|$|The California <b>golden</b> <b>trout,</b> {{or simply}} the <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> [...] (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita), is a {{subspecies}} {{of the rainbow}} trout native to California. The <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> is native to <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek (tributary to the Kern River), Volcano Creek (tributary to <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek), and the South Fork Kern River. It is the state fish of California.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>trout</b> and Sunapee trout: Salvelinus aureolus oquassa (Bean 1887). Common names: blueback trout, Sunapee trout. Other names: blueback char, <b>golden</b> <b>trout,</b> white trout.|$|R
50|$|Morphologically, the Little Kern <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout,</b> sits {{somewhat}} {{in between the}} California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> and the typical coastal rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus). Compared to the California <b>golden</b> <b>trout,</b> the brilliance of coloration in the Little Kern <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> is usually a bit more subdued. Little Kern goldens {{tend to have more}} black spots along its back, especially anterior to the caudal peduncle, and onto its head in comparison to California <b>golden</b> <b>trouts.</b> Compared to coastal rainbow <b>trout,</b> Little Kern <b>goldens</b> tend to have fewer, larger, and rounder spots. Little Kern <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> in their native small stream habitat rarely exceed 12 in in length and any fish exceeding 10 in would be considered large.|$|R
5000|$|Mexican native trout (in Spanish [...] "Truchas Mexicanas") - Mexican {{rainbow trout}}, {{sometimes}} Baja rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss nelsoni) and <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) {{occur in the}} Pacific ocean tributaries of the Baja California peninsula and in the Sierra Madre Occidental of northwest Mexico {{as far south as}} Victoria de Durango in the state of Durango. Many forms of the Mexican rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss nelsoni and O. m. ssp.), subspecies of the rainbow trout, have been described. [...] The <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) is a recognized species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> is sexually dimorphic, males {{can easily}} be {{identified}} from females due to their much longer jaws or kype. <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> are brightly colored with blue parr marks on {{both males and females}} {{along the side of the}} body. Purple scaling is visible along the lateral line. Both sexes also have bright golden-yellow belly coloration. The top of the fish and the tailfin are covered in small black spots with much larger spotting on the dorsal fin. The pectoral fins, pelvic fin and anal fin are light orange in color with white tips. Due to their harsh and small stream habitat the <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> remains small even when fully grown. Adults rarely reach over a foot long with the maximum size probably being 10 inches (25 cm). Overall body shape and fin placement nearly identical to Rainbow trout Parr marks usually remain distinct throughout the fish's life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> {{are limited}} to small streams created by small cienegas (spring-fed marshes) above 5,000 feet. The {{surrounding}} landscape is dominated by deep canyons, scrub forest, evergreens and hardwoods.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita is one {{of three}} subspe-cies within the rainbow trout–redband trout complex endemic to the Kern River basin and his-torically {{restricted}} to <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek and the South Fork Kern River. Past allozyme studies have indicated that native populations of California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> in the <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek drainage may have become introgressed with rainbow trout alleles through interaction with hybrids of rainbow <b>trout</b> and California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> stocked into nearby headwater lakes that are connected to tributaries in the drainage. We used six microsatellites and a minisatellite marker to estimate the genetic diversity and levels of introgression in approximately 700 California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> taken from 23 locations in <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek, its tributaries, and surrounding lakes. Indications of introgression were found in {{all but one of the}} sampled <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek drainage locations, the lowest average levels (0 – 8 %) occurring in the lower reaches of <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek. The highest levels (12 – 17 %) were in the Cottonwood Lakes populations that have been used as Cal-ifornia <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> broodstock by the California Department of Fish and Game. Evidence of introgression was also found in fish sampled from the upper reaches of the South Fork Kern River. This suggests that past and present stocking policies and hybridization with introduced rainbo...|$|R
50|$|Later {{studies showed}} {{that one of the}} six populations used to form the Little Kern River <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> broodstock, {{clustered}} genetically with California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> and rainbow trout instead of Little Kern <b>golden</b> <b>trout.</b> This study also showed that one individual fish collected as broodstock from Deadman Creek genetically clustered entirely with hatchery rainbow trout reference populations. This individual was likely inadvertently mixed with pure Little Kern <b>Golden</b> <b>trout</b> at the Kern River Fish Hatchery. The consequence of these two oversights meant that fish hybridized with rainbow <b>trout</b> and California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> were reintroduced back into Little Kern habitat.|$|R
50|$|The Kern River {{rainbow trout}} {{is one of}} three {{subspecies}} of O. mykiss that are all endemic to the Kern River basin, sharing the headwaters of the river with the Little Kern <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> and <b>Golden</b> <b>trout.</b> Some of the existing range of the Kern River rainbow trout lies within the California <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Wilderness.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} small range and highly sensitive, {{isolated}} habitat, <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> are considered vulnerable. The biggest threats are human {{development and the}} possibility of competition/interbreeding with introduced rainbow trout.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) is {{a species}} of fish in the Salmonidae family. The species is endemic to high-elevation {{headwaters}} of the Fuerte River, Sinaloa River, and Culiacán River drainages in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, Paul Needham, a {{fisheries}} biologist {{with the}} U.S. Bureau of Fisheries {{began a series}} of explorations (1936, 1937 and 1938) into the Rio Santo Domingo drainage in Baja California seeking to bring back live specimens of the Baja rainbow trout as hatchery stock and further study. Although live specimens reached U.S. hatcheries, none ever survived to spawn. In 1952, 1955 and 1956 Needham again explored the Sierra Madre Occidental tributaries of the Gulf of California. Needham's explorations led to the publication of Rainbow Trout of Mexico and California (1959) with coauthor Richard Gard.

40|$|Abstract. —I used radio {{transmitters}} {{to determine}} the diel habitat use and movement patterns of California <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> Oncorhynchus mykiss aquabonita inside and outside cattle exclosures on the South Fork Kern River, <b>Golden</b> <b>Trout</b> Wilderness, California. Twenty-three <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> were monitored from September 10 to 19, 1993, during 216 diel-tracking hours at four study sites in upper and lower Ramshaw Meadow. No differences in distances moved or home ranges were detected between <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> inside and outside exclosures. Mean home ranges were 18. 5 - 54. 0 m inside the two exclosure sites and 36. 0 - 68. 7 m outside the two exclosures. Most <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> were found within 5 m of their previously recorded location at both upper (93. 5 % of 521 observations) and lower (92 % of 394 observations) Ramshaw Meadow sites. Movement of individual fish varied: five fish moved less than 5 m throughout the 10 -d study period, whereas 12 fish moved 100 - 608 m. <b>Golden</b> <b>trout</b> were active both day and night, and I observed them feeding throughout the night, even when water temperatures were as low as 2 °C. At all study sites inside and outside exclosures, <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> used three macrohabitats (pools, runs, and riffles) but selected pools in higher pro-portions than the more available runs.

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as the New Hampshire and Vermont lakes {{developed}} its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen {{who sought to}} increase their catches began to introduce new fish species into these lakes, and these eventually overwhelmed the native Sunapee <b>golden</b> <b>trout.</b> Lake trout, a larger char that holds the same ecological niche as Sunapee trout, only better, out-competed the Sunapee <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> and hybridized with it, further accelerating its decline.

50|$|In 1997, a {{group of}} {{approximately}} 40 ichthyologists, biologists and naturalists from several U.S. and Mexican institutions formed a collaborative group, Truchas Mexicanas, to study the diversity of Mexican native trout. Between 1997 and 2005, {{members of the group}} explored the rivers and streams of the Sierra Madre Occidental collecting specimens for study and documenting the diverse populations of Mexican native trout. In 2002, fisheries biologist Robert J. Behnke published Trout and Salmon of North America documenting a lifetime study of North American trout and salmon. In Trout and Salmon of North America, Behnke described two species of trout - the <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (O. chrysogaster) and the Mexican rainbow trout (O. m. nelsoni and O. m. ssp). He described a number of local forms of the Mexican rainbow trout primarily based on the river systems they occurred in.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Mexican native trout are {{considered}} subspecies {{of the rainbow}} trout (O. mykiss) and generally lumped as O. m. nelsoni Evermann (1908) or O. m. ssp. The exception is the <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (O. chrysogaster Needham and Gard (1964)) which achieved species status in 1964. [...] The first records of trout in northwest Mexico were published by paleontologist E. D. Cope in 1886 where he describes two specimens from Chihuahua as having the appearance of Salmo purpuratus a name sometimes incorrectly used for cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki). In 1898 and 1905, naturalist E. W. Nelson with the U.S. Biological Survey led explorations into the Mexican mainland (1898) and Baja California peninsula (1905) to document flora and fauna. In 1908, preserved specimens of trout that Nelson brought back from the Rio Santo Domingo (Santo Domingo creek) in the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir mountains of Baja California were described by ichthyologist B.W. Evermann as a new species Salmo nelsoni, the Baja rainbow trout.|$|E
40|$|Salmonid fishes {{are cold}} water piscivores with a native {{distribution}} spanning {{nearly the entire}} temperate and subarctic northern hemisphere. Trout in the genus Oncorhynchus are the most widespread salmonid fishes and {{are among the most}} important fish species in the world, due to their extensive use in aquaculture and valuable fisheries. Trout that inhabit northwestern Mexico are the southernmost native salmonid populations in the world, and the least studied in North America. They are unfortunately also facing threats to their contin-ued existence. Previous work has described one endemic species, the <b>Mexican</b> <b>golden</b> <b>trout</b> (O. chrysogaster), and one endemic subspecies, Nelson’s trout (O. mykiss nelsoni), in Mexico, but previous work indicated that there is vastly more biodiversity in this group than formally described. Here we conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of this important group of fishes using novel genetic markers and techniques to elucidate the biodiversity of trout inhabiting northwestern Mexico, examine genetic population structure of Mexican trout and their relationships to other species of Pacific trout, and measure introgression from non-native hatchery rainbow trout.
