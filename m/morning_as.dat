5|$|A new comedy duo called Supergirly {{were also}} {{introduced}} from January 2000 {{to fill the}} gap left by 'Ben, Gez and Rich' who had quit the show the previous series. Supergirly, which consisted of Louise McClatchy and Jai Simeone, (known as Lou and Jai) would feature in sketches throughout the <b>morning</b> <b>as</b> BBC make-up artists who were rude to the guests, either through a misunderstanding, by being tactless or by mistaking the guests as someone else.

In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.|$|E

The cavalry spent the night at the battlefield. In the next <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> the infantry (and Antonina) caught up, the whole army made for Carthage, where it arrived as night was falling. The Carthaginians had thrown open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E

5|$|At 2045 hrs, {{another person}} on {{duty in the}} control tower {{received}} a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, {{as though it had}} landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.|$|E

However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E

A blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. The next <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> the flight resumes, Blofeld sets off an avalanche; Tracy is captured, while Bond is buried but manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on residential lighting, which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the <b>morning.</b> <b>As</b> Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E
5|$|Early on December 5, RSMC Nadi {{started to}} issue special weather bulletins on Cyclone Daman as a {{tropical}} cyclone gale warning had been issued for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. Later that <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> the Cyclone moved over Rotuma, RSMC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert {{for the rest}} of Fiji. During that afternoon, RSMC Nadi canceled the tropical cyclone gale warning for Rotuma and then upgraded the cyclone alerts for the northwest of Fiji to a tropical cyclone gale warning later that day. Early the next day, as the storm was intensifying, they upgraded the gale warnings for parts of northwest of Fiji to storm warnings while expanding the warnings to the western and central sides of Viti Levu and the western side of Vanua Levu. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi further revised the warnings as Cyclone Daman had become a severe tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E

Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to break contact and fall back.

By the time they arrived, there were only enough men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E

In the ninth month, Ilā gave birth to Pururavas, who grew to become the first king of the Lunar dynasty. Then, as per the advice of Budha and Ila's father Kardama, Ila pleased Shiva with a horse sacrifice and Shiva restored Ila's masculinity permanently.|$|E

5|$|Later in August, the Germans set {{up another}} ambush for the British fleet, when they drew up plans for another High Seas Fleet raid on Sunderland (as {{had been the}} {{original}} intention in May). The German fleet planned to depart {{late in the day}} on 18 August and shell military targets the next <b>morning.</b> <b>As</b> in May, UB-6 was part of a group intended to attack the Harwich forces. As one of five boats forming the second line of boats from the Flanders Flotilla, UB-6 was stationed off Texel by the morning of 20 August. Once again, British intelligence had given warning of the impending attack and ambush, causing the Grand Fleet to sortie at 16:00 on 18 August, five hours before the German fleet sailed. Faulty intelligence caused Scheer initially to divert from Sunderland, and then to eventually call off the whole operation. Although U-boats to the north sank two British light cruisers, UB-6 and her group played no part in the action.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September Sercey raided Banda Aceh, {{capturing}} {{a number}} of merchant ships and on 7 September seized the small merchant ship Favourite off the northeastern coast of Sumatra en route to attack the British port of Penang. The following <b>morning,</b> <b>as</b> his squadron transferred rice from the prize, two large sails appeared in {{the distance to the}} northeast. These sails belonged to the 74-gun British ships of the line HMS Arrogant under Captain Richard Lucas and HMS Victorious under Captain William Clark. These ships had been sent to the East Indies from the Cape at the start of August on orders from Elphinstone and were engaged in protecting British trade with China. When news reached Penang that Sercey was in the region, Lucas ordered Clark to join him in a search for the French in the Straits of Malacca.|$|E
5|$|On the DVD Commentary, series creator Rob Thomas {{opined that}} the {{relationship}} between Veronica and Keith was the core of the series and listed the scene in which Keith stays up all night before scaring Veronica in the <b>morning</b> <b>as</b> one of his favorite examples of their chemistry in the season. Thomas highlighted the scene in which a girl shows Veronica around the sorority as indicative of Hansen's comedic talents; in addition, it marked the first appearance of David Tom in the season, a guest star in season two who was brought back for a recurring role in this season. The actress who played the girl showing Veronica around, Keri Lynn Pratt, previously appeared in the film Drive Me Crazy, which Thomas co-wrote.|$|E
