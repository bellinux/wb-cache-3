After winning the New York 1924 chess tournament (1½ points ahead of Capablanca) and finishing second at Moscow in 1925 (1½ points behind Efim Bogoljubow, ½ point ahead of Capablanca), he effectively retired from serious chess.|$|E

5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from {{competitive}} play.

5|$|The reigning {{champion}} of the competition is automatically invited {{to play in the}} other three majors for the next five years, and is exempt from qualifying for the PGA Championship for life.

The prize of the tournament is the Wanamaker Trophy, which the champion keeps until the following year's competition. The PGA Championship was originally a <b>match</b> <b>play</b> event; however, in 1958 it was changed to a stroke play event.|$|E

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice and Match are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, <b>match</b> <b>play</b> or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only to be unable to keep the ball in <b>match</b> <b>play.</b> Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|The Ryder Cup is contested in a <b>match</b> <b>play</b> format, which {{involves}} different {{methods of the}} format. A foursomes match is contested with two members from each team playing alternate shots. A fourball match consists of two players from either team, who each play their own shot throughout the round. The player that completes {{the hole in the}} lowest number of shots wins the hole. Singles matches are also played, with players from each team contesting a one-on-one match. The winner of each match scores a point for their team, if a match is tied after 18 holes then each team is awarded a ½ point. The format of the competition has changed throughout its history. Originally, foursome matches were played one day, with singles matches over 36 holes the next. Since 1979, the format has consisted of 28 matches held over three days, with each match worth a point. The first two days consist of eight matches; four foursomes and four fourball matches. The final day sees all 12 members of each team competing in singles matches.|$|E

5|$|Woods {{began his}} 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) {{where he started}} off well, but {{struggled}} on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture <b>Match</b> <b>Play</b> Championship, where he was knocked out {{in the second round}} by missing a 5-foot putt, Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories; a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.|$|E
5|$|World-class <b>match</b> <b>play</b> (i.e., {{a series}} of games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E
5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled and <b>match</b> <b>play</b> continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E
