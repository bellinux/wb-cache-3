5|$|Scotland made a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the {{intellectual}} life of Europe, {{particularly in the}} Enlightenment, producing major figures including the economist Adam Smith, philosophers Francis Hutcheson and David Hume, and scientists William Cullen, Joseph Black and James Hutton. In the 19th century major figures included James Watt, James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin and Sir Walter Scott. Scotland's economic contribution to the Empire and the industrial revolution included its banking system {{and the development of}} cotton, coal mining, shipbuilding and an extensive railway network. Industrialisation and changes to agriculture and society led to depopulation and clearances of the largely rural highlands, migration to the towns and mass immigration, where Scots made a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the development of countries including the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The work of John Coles and the Somerset Levels Project was {{recognised}} in 1998 {{when they}} won the ICI Award for the best archaeological project offering a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to knowledge, and in 2006 with the award of the European Archaeological Heritage Prize.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the overall {{dramatic}} effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities. Crosten writes: 'These massive developed sections are the chief glory of the Meyerbeerian opera, for {{they are not only}} big in volume but big in their structural design'.|$|E

5|$|Ops (B) was a {{deception}} planning department {{within the}} Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) during the Second World War. Established in the United Kingdom in April 1943, the section {{was in charge}} of operational deception planning for the Western Front. Their <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> was to Operations Cockade and Bodyguard, the latter being the cover plan for their Allied invasion of Normandy in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Sun Bowl was {{established}} in the mid-1930s along with the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, the Orange Bowl in Miami, and the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. While the Sun Bowl historically followed the southern racial segregation policies, the 1949 Sun Bowl made a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the future desegregation of college sports.|$|E
5|$|The World of Science {{centered}} on the United States Science Exhibit. It also included a NASA Exhibit that included models and mockups of various satellites, {{as well as the}} Project Mercury capsule that had carried Alan Shepard into space. These exhibits were the federal government's <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the fair.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1940, the Tripartite Pact united Japan, Italy and Germany to formalise the Axis Powers. The Tripartite Pact {{stipulated that}} any country, with the {{exception}} of the Soviet Union, not in the war which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three. The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact. Romania would make a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> (as did Hungary) to the Axis war against the USSR, partially to recapture territory ceded to the USSR, partially to pursue its leader Ion Antonescu's desire to combat communism.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's {{greatest}} {{concerns were}} {{the maintenance of}} the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice. Scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to the realms of language and of cultural identity. His prose helped to guide the development of the English language, and the Book of Common Prayer is a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to English literature that influenced many lives in the Anglophone world. It guided Anglican worship for four hundred years.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was {{the last}} film of special effects {{supervisor}} Derek Meddings, to whom the film was dedicated. Meddings' <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> was miniatures. It {{was also the first}} Bond film to use computer generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes into the tank, and the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm, {{where he}} married Greta Knutson, {{with whom he}} had a son, Christophe (born 1927). A former student of painter André Lhote, she was known for her {{interest}} in phenomenology and abstract art. Around the same period, with funds from Knutson's inheritance, Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos, a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich, to build him a house in Paris. The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara, built in Montmartre, was designed following Tzara's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art. It was Loos' only <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> in his Parisian years.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the {{institution}} {{was made into}} an independent school and named to honor Lewis and Dorothy Rosenstiel after a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> from the Rosenstiel's foundation to support progress in atmospheric and marine sciences. In 1977, the school began a joint undergraduate program with Miami's College of Arts & Sciences. The school bought Research vessels and built more facilities to further research projects. From 2003 to 2008, the school operated the Pew Institute for Ocean Science as {{a joint venture with}} the Pew Charitable Trusts, and in 2008, the program relocated to SUNY at Stony Brook.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Scotland made a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the British {{participation}} in {{the two world wars}} and suffered relative economic decline, which only began to be offset with the exploitation of North Sea Oil and Gas from the 1970s and the development of new technologies and service industries. This was mirrored by a growing sense of cultural and political distinctiveness, which {{towards the end of the}} century, culminated in the establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament within the confines of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} funds himself, Brown {{convinced the}} financier Jack C. Massey to provide 60 {{percent of the}} acquisition capital, and provided a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> himself, with smaller contributions from franchise holder Pete Harman and company officials Lee Cummings and Harlan Adams. Sanders then began to have doubts about selling the company, as some {{members of his family}} were against it. The group acquired the company in 1964 for US$2 million (around US$15 million in 2013). The contract included a lifetime salary for Sanders and the agreement that he would be the company's quality controller and trademark.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew the heart and vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to medical science.|$|E
5|$|New {{organizations}} were formed and new cross ocean routes {{were established in}} the face of the enemy and under difficult conditions. George took the ferrying command from 130 obsolescent aircraft to 3,000 modern military transports, and expanded the personnel from 11,000 to 300,000. For this <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to his country, George received the Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross, and Air Medal, as well as decorations from Great Britain, France, Brazil, Peru and China.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} serious post-war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was Crosten's 1948 book Grand Opera: An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and {{standards}} for much subsequent research. A <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to revival of interest in Meyerbeer {{was the work of}} the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert Letellier has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a 'Meyerbeer Fan Club' in America has stimulated interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} common blackbird is, {{together with}} the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the song thrush (Turdus philomelos) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs. It eats {{a wide range of}} native and exotic fruit, and makes a <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to endemic birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{training}} of B-29 aircrews and {{the testing of}} prototype atom bombs was the last <b>major</b> <b>contribution</b> of Wendover Field during World War II. After war's end, some crew training continued, but at a reduced level. For a while, B-29s which had returned from the Marianas were flown to Wendover for storage. In the summer of 1946, the Ogden Air Technical Service Command at Hill Army Air Field north of Salt Lake City assumed jurisdiction over all operations at Wendover Field except engineering and technical projects.|$|E
