For the clinician {{it is interesting to}} be able to predict these physiological proceedings from an early point of development to evaluate treatment need for a patient, possible self-corrections and interference of treatment with ongoing physiological maturation. AIM OF THIS STUDY: To describe longitudinal changes in <b>molar</b> <b>relation</b> from the early mixed to the permanent dentition as a result of normal development and to study associations between the change in <b>molar</b> <b>relation</b> and different dental parameters with special focus on the space conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental casts of fifty orthodontically untreated children were evaluated longitudinally at the age 7, 11 and 13 years. A space analysis for each quadrant was performed and the molar relationship was registered at each stage. To evaluate the effect of space conditions and possible molar migration on the existing molar relationship the upper and lower molars were mentally transferred to a position in the dental arch, which is neutralizing the existing surplus or lack of space in each quadrant. The relation of the lower molar to the upper one in the new position is called “corrected occlusion”. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The mean molar occlusion has a tendency for developing a less distal relation during establishment of the permanent dentition. Self-corrections do occur, but not in a frequency warranting reduced importance of early initiating of orthodontic screening and treatment. When the cases were grouped according to variable «corrected occlusion», a rather good agreement between the early mixed and permanent dentition was demonstrated; indicating a certain stability of the <b>molar</b> <b>relation</b> after isolating the effect of the space conditions...|$|E

The postural angles between the head and the cervical column termed; craniovertical, craniocervical, cervicohorizontal, and cervical curvature, were measured. The malocclusal traits studied was; <b>molar</b> <b>relation,</b> crowding, spaces, overbite, overjet, crossbites, and midline displacements. Results show that a relationship between crowding and head posture could only be found in subjects with upper arch crowding, and cervical curvature (p< 0. 01). A significant difference in craniocervical and cervicohorizontal angles was observed in subjects with overbite, compared to subjects without overbite (p< 0. 01, p< 0. 001). The influence of gender on overbite and head posture was also found to be strongly correlated (p< 0. 05). With regards to <b>molar</b> <b>relation,</b> Class II malocclusion showed a stronger relation with craniovertical and cervicohorizontal angles than both other classes (p< 0. 05, and p< 0. 01).

Serpentinite {{was introduced in the}} autumn of 2008 on all plots while other fertilizers (N, P, NP and NPK) in the spring of 2009. Based on the chemical composition of soil solutions collected in lysimeters placed at the depth of 20 cm in the autumn 2008 and the spring and autumn 2009, ecochemical parameters were calculated: acid neutralization capacity (ANCaq), alkalinity (ALK), the degree of soil acidity (Ma%), acidic cations (Ma), saturation of the exchangeable complex of the soil solid phase (Mb) with alkalis, saturation with alkalis (BS), <b>molar</b> <b>relations</b> Ca/Al, Mb/Al, BC/Al. After the winter, soil solutions became acidic, especially in the Wisła Forest District. The saturation of the studied soils demonstrates moderate flexibility of soils in the Wisła Forest District in relation to acid load, and high flexibility of the Ujsoły soils. The opposite trend was observed for the degree of acidity of soils. Acid neutralization capacity and alkalinity of the waters showed significant variations in soil pH even in the case of small variations in the composition of the solution, if they were caused by the inflow of the anions of NO 3 - and SO 42 -. After application of the fertilizers, an increase of Mg, Ca and Mb was noted in the soil solution, determined in the overlaying highly acidic organic horizons trough the ion-exchange buffering mechanism of highly protonated functional groups with high buffering capacity. Highly improved content of Mg in a soil, and in some cases – also the content of N, P and K, present potential improvement of forest growth capacity without the hazard of adverse side-effects of liming.
