The removal of inhert AAEMs shifts N-containing species release to a high-temperature zone according to volatile release behavior because of the increase in activation energy.

This thesis pays attention to theoretical studies on kinetics of photo-induced processes, including photo-chemical reactions, radiative and non-radiative transitions (intersystem crossing and internal conversion) in molecular and bio-related systems. One- or multi- dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) not only provide qualitative mechanistic explanation for excited state decay, but also make it possible to perform kinetic simulations. We have constructed several types of PESs by using computational methods of high-accuracy for a variety of systems of interest. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) and couple cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method are employed to build PESs of the ground and lowest triple states. For medium-sized molecules, the complete active space self-consistent (CASSCF) method is used for constructing the PESs of excited states. Various kinetic theories for the decay processes of excite states are briefly introduced, in particularly adiabatic and nonadiabatic Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel -Marcus (RRKM) approaches for the kinetics of nonradiative decay of excited 2 -aminopridine molecule. Special attention has been devoted to Monte Carlo transition state theory which can provide an efficient way to predict the rate of nonradiative transitions of polyatomic molecules on multi-dimensional PESs.

We have constructed a QM/MM model to simulate the hydrogenation <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> on amorphous solid water surfaces to form formamide. The binding energy of HNCO on the ASW surface varies significantly between different binding sites, we found values between ∼ 0 and 100 kJ mol^- 1. The barrier for the hydrogenation reaction is almost independent of the binding energy, though. We calculated tunneling rate constants of H + HNCO → NH_ 2 CO at temperatures down to 103 K combining QM/MM with instanton theory. Tunneling dominates the reaction at such low temperatures. The tunneling reaction is hardly accelerated by the amorphous solid water surface compared to the gas phase for this system, even though the activation energy of the surface reaction is lower than the one of the gas-phase reaction. Both the height and width of the barrier affect the tunneling rate in practice. Strong kinetic isotope effects were observed by comparing to rate constants of D + HNCO → NHDCO. At 103 K we found a KIE of 231 on the surface and 146 in the gas phase. Furthermore, we investigated the gas-phase reaction NH_ 2 + H_ 2 CO → NH_ 2 CHO + H and found it unlikely to occur at cryogenic temperatures.

In vitro experiments and clinical studies have suggested the potential involvement of carbamylated proteins (CPs) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) complications like atherosclerosis, but their metabolic fate in vivo is still unknown. To address this issue, we evaluated protein carbamylation in the plasma and tissues of control and 75 % nephrectomised C 57 BL/ 6 J mice by LC-MS/MS assay of homocitrulline, the major carbamylation-derived product (CDP). A basal level of carbamylation was evidenced under all conditions, showing that carbamylation is a physiological process of protein modification in vivo. CP plasma concentrations increased in nephrectomized vs. control mice over the 20 weeks of the experiment (e. g. 335 ± 43 vs. 167 ± 19 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 001) 20 weeks after nephrectomy). Simultaneously, CP content increased roughly by two-fold in all tissues throughout the experiment. The progressive accumulation of CPs was specifically noted in long-lived extracellular matrix proteins, especially collagen (e. g. 1264 ± 123 vs. 726 ± 99 μmol homocitrulline/mol lysine (p< 0. 01) in the skin of nephrectomized vs. control mice after 20 weeks of evolution).

40|$|Free radical-initiated peptide {{sequencing}} (FRIPS) {{mass spectrometry}} derives advantage from {{the introduction of}} highly selective low-energy dissociation pathways in target peptides. An acetyl radical, formed at the peptide N-terminus via collisional activation and subsequent dissociation of a covalently attached radical precursor, abstracts a hydrogen atom from diverse sites on the peptide, yielding sequence information through backbone cleavage as well as side-chain loss. Unique free-radical-initiated dissociation pathways observed at serine and threonine residues lead to cleavage of the neighboring N-terminal C_α–C or N–C_α bond rather than the typical Cα–C bond cleavage observed with other amino acids. These reactions were investigated by FRIPS of model peptides of the form AARAAAXAA, where X is the amino acid of interest. In combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the experiments indicate the strong influence of hydrogen bonding at serine or threonine on the observed free radical chemistry. Hydrogen bonding of the side-chain hydroxyl group with a backbone carbonyl oxygen aligns the singly occupied π orbital on the β-carbon and the N–C_α bond, leading to low-barrier β-cleavage of the N–C_α bond. Interaction with the N-terminal carbonyl favors a hydrogen-atom transfer process to yield stable c and z• ions, whereas C-terminal interaction leads to effective cleavage of the C_α–C bond through rapid loss <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid.</b> Dissociation <b>of</b> the C_α–C bond may also occur via water loss followed by β-cleavage from a nitrogen-centered radical.

40|$|This study uses {{a global}} {{chemical}} transport model {{to estimate the}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> (HNCO). HNCO is toxic, and concentrations exceeding 1 ppbv have been suggested to have negative health effects. Based on fire studies, HNCO emissions were scaled to those of hydrogen cyanide (30 %), resulting in yearly total emissions of 1. 5 Tg for 2008, from both anthropogenic and biomass burning sources. Loss processes included heterogeneous uptake (pH dependent), dry deposition (like formic acid), and reaction with the OH radical (k = 1 × 10 − 15 molecule− 1 cm 3 s− 1). Annual mean surface HNCO concentrations were highest over parts of China (maximum of 470 pptv), but episodic fire emissions gave much higher levels, exceeding 4 ppbv in tropical Africa and the Amazon, and exceeding 10 ppbv in Southeast Asia and Siberia. This suggests that large biomass burning events could result in deleterious health effects for populations in these regions. For the tropospheric budget, using the model-calculated pH the HNCO lifetime was 37 days, with the split between dry deposition and heterogeneous loss being 95 %: 5 %. Fixing the heterogeneous loss rate at pH = 7 meant that this process dominated, accounting for ∼ 70 % of the total loss, giving a lifetime of 6 days, and resulting in upper tropospheric concentrations that were essentially zero. However, changing the pH does not notably impact the high concentrations found in biomass burning regions. More observational data is needed to evaluate the model, {{as well as a}} better representation of the likely underestimated biofuel emissions, which could mean more populations exposed to elevated HNCO concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The chlorine-Hercosett {{process has}} been {{dominant}} in the wool shrink-proofing industry for more than 30 years. Hypochlorite breaks the hydrophobic nature of wool surface; Hercosett (cationic polyamide epichlorhydrin resin) covers wool and prevents wool from shrinking. From today's modem point of view, however, the chlorineHercosett process shows a number of drawbacks which make the search for an ecologically clean alternative worthwhile: poor handle, yellowing of wool, difficulties in dyeing and most importantly today, environmental impact (rdlease of absorbable organic halogens- AOX to the effluents). As a result, many researches {{have been carried out}} for Non-AOX rapid oxidation of wool. Potassium peroxomonosulphate (PMS), hydrogen peroxide and some per acids have been concerned as possible alternatives, but only little commercial successes. It was well known that Hercosett will not deposit on the PMS or hydrogen peroxide treated wool. The key difference. in terms of polymer compatibility between chlorinated and PMS, hydrogen peroxide treated wool is the surface energy (wettability). Surface energy has influence on the spreading properties of Hercosett and wool/polymer interfacial adhesion. Resent researches have shown that this difference is associated with the removal of a fatty acid (lipid), namely IS-methyleicosanoic acid (IS-MEA), which is thought to be chemically bound to the surface of wool fibre by a thio-ester linkage. In common words, chlorination can remove this fatty acid but PMS and hydrogen peroxide treatments can not. The wool shrink-proofing research in this thesis is f<?cused on wool delipidisation. Total delipidisation (97 % of the IS-MEA was removed) is achieved by a cationic surfactant/nucleophile process. During the treatement, hydrophobic complexes between the cationic surfactant and nucleophile are formed which can diffuse into the wool lipid shell. The nucleophile will attack the eletrophilic thio-ester linkage of the wool lipid and liberate the free lipid as its carboxylate salt into water. The wool top after delipidisation, oxidative sulphitolysis and Hercosett 125 treatment shows some significant shrink resist properties when compared to the untreated wool fibre. The same wool top was spun, knitted and wash tested using the standard TM 31 wash test procedure. Such wool fabric has passed 3 x 5 A wash cycles. It was also worth mentioning that the same wool fabric has soft handle and bright shade when compared to the chlorine-Hercosett treated wool. Wool bleaching and photo-yellowing are also important subjects in wool research. The proportion of wool which is bleached is approximately IO% of the total world production. The photo-yellowing effect of ~unlighton bleached wool is greater than on untreated wool. The relationship ofwool bleaching and wool photo-yellowing is studied. FTIR studies shows that there are more wool disulphide bonds cleaved during the reduction bleaching than the oxidation bleaching. The photo-yellowing effect of sunlight on the reductive bleached wool is greater than on the oxidative bleached wool. The reduction in wool cystine residue content is a key effect in preventing photo-yellowing in bleached wool. The decomposition reaction <b>of</b> urea to <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> and the subsequent reaction <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> with nucleophiles such as the hydroxyl groups in cotton cellulose are studied. The properties of the modified. carbamoylated cellulose have been investigated including the ease of bleaching it when tea stained and its dyeing properties with reactive dyes.

40|$|Many organic {{molecules}} {{have been observed}} in the interstellar medium thanks to advances in radioastronomy, and very recently the presence of urea was also suggested. While those molecules were observed, {{it is not clear}} what the mechanisms responsible to their formation are. In fact, if gas-phase reactions are responsible, they should occur through barrierless mechanisms (or with very low barriers). In the past, mechanisms for the formation of different {{organic molecules}} were studied, providing only in a few cases energetic conditions favorable to a synthesis at very low temperature. A particularly intriguing class of such molecules are those containing one N [...] C [...] O peptide bond, which could be a building block for the formation of biological molecules. Urea is a particular case because two nitrogen atoms are linked to the C [...] O moiety. Thus, motivated also by the recent tentative observation of urea, we have considered the synthetic pathways responsible to its formation. We have studied the possibility of forming urea in the gas phase via different kinds of bi-molecular reactions: ion-molecule, neutral, and radical. In particular we have focused on the activation energy of these reactions in order to find possible reactants that could be responsible for to barrierless (or very low energy) pathways. We have used very accurate, highly correlated quantum chemistry calculations to locate and characterize the reaction pathways in terms of minima and transition states connecting reactants to products. Most of the reactions considered have an activation energy that is too high; but the ion-molecule reaction between NH$_ 2 $OH$_ 2 ^+$ and formamide is not too high. These reactants could be responsible not only for the formation of urea but also <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is an organic molecule also observed in the interstellar medium.

40|$|The {{selective}} {{catalytic reduction}} (SCR) of NOx by NH 3 has been extensively studied in the literature, mainly because of its high potential to remediate the pollution of diesel exhaust gases. The implementation of the NH 3 -SCR process into passenger cars {{requires the use of}} an ammonia precursor, provided by a urea aqueous solution in the conventional process. Although the thermal decomposition and hydrolysis mechanisms of urea are well documented in the literature, the influence of the direct use of urea on the NOx reduction over SCR catalysts may be problematic. With the aim to evaluate prototype powdered catalysts, a specific synthetic gas bench adjusted to powdered material was developed, allowing the use of NH 3 or urea as reductant for direct comparison. The design of the experimental setup allows vaporization of liquid urea at 200 °C under 10 bar using an HPLC pump and a micro injector of 50 μm diameter. This work presents the experimental setup of the catalytic test and some remarkable catalytic results towards further development of new catalytic formulations specifically dedicated to urea-SCR. Indeed, a possible divergence in terms of DeNOx efficiency is evidenced depending {{on the nature of the}} reductant, NH 3 or urea solution. Particularly, the evaluated catalyst may not allow an optimal NOx conversion because of a lack in ammonia availability when the urea residence time is shortened. This is attributed to insufficient activity <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> (HNCO) hydrolysis, which can be improved by addition upstream of an active solid for the hydrolysis reaction such as ZrO 2. Thus, this µ-scale synthetic gas bench adjusted to powdered materials enables the specific behaviour of urea use for NOx reduction to be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Trace gases {{comprise}} {{less than}} 1 % of the Earth's atmosphere, but {{are responsible for}} numerous processes of public concern, including public health, visibility, pollution, and climate change. The interaction between oceanic emissions (sea-spray aerosol, biological emissions, etc.) and urban outflow in the marine boundary layer provide a unique environment for atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the sources and fates of individual trace gases in the atmosphere becomes important in developing {{a better understanding of}} the processes occurring and how they impact larger atmospheric phenomena. In this work, I describe the use of a novel, compact chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer for the sensitive and selective detection <b>of</b> <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> formic acid, and reactive halogen species, including HCl, Cl₂, HOCl, and chloroamines, in the marine boundary layer. I investigate the influence of primary emissions on the HCl budget and estimate the chlorine atom production rate for HCl during the CalNex 2010 field campaign. Sampling of reactive chlorine gases from chlorinated swimming pools follows these observations and ultimately result in a box model calculation of the Cl₂ emission rate from pools, a previously unconstrained primary source of reactive halogens. Organic acids are also investigated in this work, specifically the sources and loss processes affecting their tropospheric budget. The first study of HNCO in the marine boundary layer is described. A potentially toxic molecule emitted from combustion reactions, the primary (i. e., ship emissions) and secondary sources of HNCO are shown as well as the loss processes and rates in this region. Lastly, emissions of formic acid, one of the most abundant organic acids, are measured from ocean-going vessels and compared with emissions from light-duty gasoline vehicles measured at the California Air Resource Board in El Monte, CA. As a whole, these studies highlight the need for sensitive and selective instrumentation with fast time resolutions to measure trace gases, their sources, and their transformatio...|$|R
