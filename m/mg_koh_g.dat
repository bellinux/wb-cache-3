40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to produce {{biodiesel}} from methyl esters of groundnut (Arachis hypogea) oil and blend with Petrol diesel. The fuel quality of the biodiesel and its blend (B 10) was assessed and compared with the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards. The groundnut oil was characterized for specific gravity, kinematic viscosity, moisture content, ash content, acid value, free fatty acid, saponification value, iodine value and peroxide value, refractive index and flash point. The biodiesel produced was analyzed for the same parameters including calorific value. The results obtained for the biodiesel showed that while the moisture and ash content were satisfactorily found in trace quantities, the other parameters also had satisfactory results within the specification of 0. 88 (specific gravity), 5. 16 mm 2 sec - 1 (kinematic viscosity), 4. 96 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> <b>g</b> - 1 (acid value), 2. 49 % (free fatty acid), 244. 74 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> <b>g</b> - 1 (saponification value), 52. 45 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> <b>g</b> - 1 (iodine value), 3. 23 mEq kg - 1 (peroxide value), 1. 463 (refractive index), 202 C (flash point) and 39, 114. 29 J g - 1 (calorific value).

There was obviously very little change in the parameters of the biodiesel when it was blended except for the flash point which was only slightly below the recommended minimum ASTM value of 130 C. This indicates that the biodiesel produced could be blended with petrodiesel (B 10) to give satisfactory fuel with properties not too different from the biodiesel produced...|$|E

Proportion of alfalfa meal in feed mixtures was 4 and 6 %. The results were compared to the control group without alfalfa meal in feed mixtures. At the end of the experiment (day 38), 6 pcs of broiler chickens from each group with an average live body weight over 1 800 g were randomly selected. The samples for chemical analysis consisted of identical proportion of breast and thigh muscle, and about 1 cm 2 of skin with subcutaneous fat. Fat from the meat was obtained after the samples drying. A fat was determined by extraction by means of laboratory instrument Det N Gras Selecta P. The oxidative stability of meat on the basis of acid number of fat was determided by chemical analysis. Chicken meat was stored at - 18 °C for 12 months and 18 months. The acid number of fat of stored meat for 12  months was 7. 38 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per <b>g</b> in the control group, 7. 42 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per <b>g</b> in the group with a proportion of 4 % alfalfa meal, and 11. 18 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> per <b>g</b> in the group with proportion 6 % alfalfa meal.

Chicken meat is notably sensitive to lipid oxidation because of its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Legislation in Title 5 of Part 3 of the Codex Alimentarius of the Slovak Republic and the Government Regulation No. 286 / 2003 Coll. in the Annex 4 in Part B provide the requirements for animal fats and meat products. Regulation of the European Parliament and Council (EC) No. 853 / 2004 lays down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. In particular, determination of free fatty acids content of rendered animal fat (tallow, lard, other animal fat). Legislative regulation does not contain requirements for the quality of chicken meat, the acid number of   fat of fresh or frozen chicken meat, respectively. A chicken meat is preferred over other kinds of meat. It is characterized by certain dietary and nutritional properties that consumer prefers. A price of this kind of meat remains attractive. In terms of human health, oxidative stability of chicken meat is important, especially of stored meat. In general terms, the various food additives are currently used to maintain the food stability. Great attention is currently paid to additives of natural origin. Similar focus is presented in our study. We can state, {{on the basis of the}} oxidative stability results of chicken meat, that natural feed component has its justification. This issue requires further research.

ABSTRACT Waste {{of rubber}} seeds is found {{only as a}} solid waste and has not fully exploited. Waste of rubber seed oil used in the research contains high free fatty acids, about 97. 77 % and higher acidity number, namely 6. 2 mg KOH / g oil, so it needs esterification to reduce the free fatty acid content to be changed into ester. Methanol (20 % volume of oil) reacted with  waste of rubber seed oil to become methyl ester with sulfuric acid 98 % (0, 5 % volume of oil) as a catalyst. In the operations of transesterification variations of the optimization of catalyst 0. 5 % until 1. 5 % KOH was used with operating temperature of 60 o C in methanol to oil ratio of 1 : 3 (volume). In the process of transesterification used stirring speed equal to speed of  producing the higher concentration product of methyl ester or biodiesel. The product of biodiesel with higher concentration  was found by reaction of transesterification with catalyst of KOH 0. 75 % and operating temperature of 60 o C.

Carboxylates of variable valency metals were synthesized in a high-energy ultrasound field using a generator USG 13 - 0. 1 / 22. Mixed thermal and ultrasound effects contribute to an increase in the yield of metal carboxylates. The maximum yield of prooxidates was over 84 % (by weight). When carrying out the {{synthesis of}} carboxylates of metals of variable valence, ion activity was revealed in the exchange reactions with sodium salts on the basis of a mixture of fatty acids in the following order: Co 2 + >Cu 2 + >Fe 2 +. The synthesis of carboxylates of variable valence metals is a multifactor system and depends on temperature regimes, metal activity, viscosity and structural characteristics of a fatty acids mixture. The formation of metal carboxylates was carried out in a water-alcohol medium at a high rate for the heterogeneous systems, which are the exchange reactions between strong alkali salts and carbon acids. It should be noted that an increase in the synthesis temperature above 60 ° C with simultaneous ultrasound exposure reduced the yield of products and influenced the quality composition of the carboxylates of metals of variable valency. We should also take into account that ultrasound impact allows to obtain a prooxidant of the required dispersity and it is extremely important in the production of multifunctional and targeted additives. The use of ultrasound fields of high intensity in the synthesis of carboxylates of metals of variable valence is preferable in a less viscous medium due to the better ultrasound sprea...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Development of {{circular}} economy requires significant {{advances in the}} technologies for valorisation of waste, as waste becomes new feedstock. Food waste is a particularly important feedstock, containing large variation of complex chemical functionality. Although most food waste sources are complex mixtures, waste from food processing, no longer suitable for the human food chain, may also represent relatively clean materials. One such material requiring valorisation is cocoa butter. RESULTS: Epoxidation of a triglyceride from a food waste source, processing waste cocoa butter, into the corresponding triglyceride epoxide was carried out using a modified Ishii-Venturello catalyst in batch and continuous flow reactors. The batch reactor achieved higher yields due to the significant decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the laminar flow tubular reactor. Integral and differential models describing the reaction and the phase transfer kinetics were developed for the epoxidation of cocoa butter and the model parameters were estimated. Ring-opening of the epoxidised cocoa butter was undertaken to provide polyols of varying molecular weight (M_w = 2000 - 84 000 Da), hydroxyl value (27 - 60 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g^- 1) and acid value (1 - 173 <b>mg</b> <b>KOH</b> g^- 1), using either aqueous ortho-phosphoric acid (H_ 3 PO_ 4) or boron trifluoride diethyl etherate (BF_ 3 ·OEt_ 2) -mediated oligomerisation in bulk, using hexane or tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvents. The thermal and tensile properties of the polyurethanes obtained from the reaction of these polyols with 4, 4 '-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) are described. CONCLUSION: The paper presents a complete valorisation scheme for a food manufacturing industry waste stream, starting from the initial chemical transformation, developing a process model {{for the design of}} a scaled-up process, and leading to synthesis of the final product, in this case a polymer. This work describes aspects of optimisation of the conversion route, focusing on clean synthesis and also demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of the development projects, requiring input from different areas of chemistry, process modelling and process design.
