Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its sleeping car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, <b>minus</b> <b>the</b> sleeping car.|$|E

In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 years or more, and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years.

5|$|Achilles {{missed the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 {{because she was}} refitting. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, <b>minus</b> <b>the</b> II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. During the Grand Fleet's sortie, Achilles spotted a U-boat. During another sortie by the High Seas Fleet on 18 October 1916, Achilles and three other armoured cruisers were ordered to patrol the northern end of the North Sea, between the approaches to Pentland Firth and Hardangerfjord in Norway, but they saw no German ships.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), <b>minus</b> <b>the</b> logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However {{the margin of error}} for this result is relatively large.|$|E
5|$|Auf der Maur {{promoted}} the album with an almost-constant tour across Europe, the United Kingdom and North America during 2004.

During the tour, Auf der Maur performed at various summer festivals including Curiosa in the United States, Pukkelpop in Belgium, Lowlands Festival in the Netherlands, Reading Festival, Leeds Festival in the United Kingdom, and Independents Day Festival in Italy. During the entire tour, Auf der Maur published photography from the shows on her official web site.|$|E
25|$|The en dash is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> sign, when <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> sign character is not available, since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit Macintosh character set had an en dash, useful for <b>the</b> <b>minus</b> sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable <b>minus</b> sign. However, <b>the</b> en dash cannot be used for a minus sign in programming languages because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.|$|R

She became the flagship of Vice Admiral Sir Philip Vian, the newly appointed second {{in command of the}} BPF on 31 January. She continued a relaxed schedule of training and port visits until she began a refit on 15 March in Sydney, that lasted until 29 April, when she put to sea to fly on her aircraft and to dump overboard the 16 Lend-Lease Avengers belonging to 828 Squadron (Britain had to either pay for them or dispose of them {{with the end of the}} war, and lacked the means to do the former). She sailed for home on 5 May and reached Devonport on 3 June, where Vian struck his flag.|$|E

The campaign proved to be short-lived, as the Allies were quickly pushed back by the advancing Germans, and the battalion was subsequently withdrawn around the end of April and early May, having fought major actions around the Aliakmon River, Servia Pass, Lamia and Mount Olympus. During the evacuation, elements of three companies were taken aboard the transport Costa Rica, which was later attacked by German aircraft. As the vessel was sinking, the troops on board were evacuated by Royal Navy destroyers and landed on Crete, <b>minus</b> <b>the</b> majority of their equipment which was lost at sea.|$|E
5|$|The Casino Royale {{episode was}} lost for decades after its 1954 {{broadcast}} until {{a black and}} white kinescope of the live broadcast was located by film historian Jim Schoenberger in 1981. It also aired on TBS as part of a Bond film marathon. However, the original 1954 broadcast had been in color; moreover the VHS release and TBS presentation did not include the last two minutes, which were at that point still lost. Eventually, the missing footage (<b>minus</b> <b>the</b> last seconds of the end credits) was found and included on a Spy Guise & Cara Entertainment VHS release. MGM subsequently included the incomplete version on its DVD and bluray releases of the 1967 spoof version of Casino Royale.|$|E
