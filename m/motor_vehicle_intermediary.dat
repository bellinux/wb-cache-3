The progress does not only bring positive impact, but also negative impact for instance the rising of crime number i. e. <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery. The aims of this research are 1) mapping <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery data as the distribution map and identifying <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot base on distrbution map; and 2) studying the correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with physical environment phenomena, i. e. land use type and settlement pattern. The research method consists of two parts; they are <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis and the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery and physical environment analysis. <b>Motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cluster analysis is using distribution data, which analyzes the distribution into <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with nearest neighbor tehnique. Contingency coefficient and frequency distribution analysis is {{used to analyze the}} correlation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot and physical environment. Contingency coefficient is used to study the relation of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot polygon with physical environment condition, whereas frequency distribution is used to study the distribution of <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery in the hot spot with physical environment condition. Physical environment which consists of land use type, housing density, house regularity pattern, and the average of building size, are obtained from interpretation of black and white panchromatic aerial photograph year 2000, in the scale 1 : 20. 000. the most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot is found on the settlement area, 68, 3 % from 378 <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery cases in the hot spot. The seond level is found on the education area (16. 4 %). The most <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> hot spot in the settlement is found on the hight density and irregular settlement, which have big size buildings. The calculation of contingency coefficient shows that there was a significant correlation between <b>motor</b> <b>vehicle</b> robbery hot spot with land use type and settlement pattern, but it has low correlation value.
