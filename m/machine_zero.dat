40|$|A {{modified}} {{pressure gradient}} method is developed for solving the incompressible two-and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in primitive variables. Velocity and pressure gradient vectors, {{rather than the}} velocity and pressure, are considered as dependent variables. This choice of the dependent variables {{is consistent with the}} flow physics as the velocity field of incompressible flows is not dependent on the pressure, but rather the pressure gradient. This introduces one and two additional dependent variables for two- and three-dimensions respectively. To close the system of equations, additional equations are obtained from the identity that the curl of the pressure gradient is zero. This choice of dependent variables also leads to Dirichlet boundary conditions for the pressure gradient, which improves numerical stability and convergence rates. The modified pressure gradient method includes a pressure gradient averaging term in the momentum equations to stabilize the solution. This term is extended here to general curvilinear coordinates. The system of equations is discritized using a conservative finite volume formulation. Time integration is achieved with a fully implicit scheme, including implicit boundary conditions.

It is done as, while the VM is running on the source node, and without disrupting any active network connections, even after the VM is moved to the target node. It is considered ―live‖, since the original VM is running, while the migration is in progress. Huge benefit of doing the live migration is the very small (almost zero) downtime {{in the order of}} milliseconds. There exists a model in which the load is balanced among the servers according to their processor usage or their IO usage and keeping virtual <b>machines</b> <b>zero</b> downtime.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to accurately compute the viscous flow in three-dimensional (3 -D) enclosures. This method is the 3 -D extension of a two-dimensional (2 -D) method developed for the calculation of flow over airfoils. The 2 -D method has been tested extensively and {{has been shown to}} accurately reproduce experimental results. As in the 2 -D method, the 3 -D method provides for the non-iterative solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by means of a fully coupled implicit technique. The solution is calculated on a body fitted computational mesh incorporating a staggered grid methodology. In the staggered grid method, the three components of vorticity are defined at the centers of the computational cell sides, while the velocity components are defined as normal vectors at the centers of the computational cell faces. The staggered grid orientation provides for the accurate definition of the vorticity components at the vorticity locations, the divergence of vorticity at the mesh cell nodes and the conservation of mass at the mesh cell centers. The solution is obtained by utilizing a fractional step solution technique in the three coordinate directions. The boundary conditions for the vorticity and velocity are calculated implicitly as part of the solution. The method provides for the non-iterative solution of the flow field and satisfies the conservation of mass and divergence of vorticity to <b>machine</b> <b>zero</b> at each time step. To test the method, the calculation of simple driven cavity flows have been computed.

40|$|The kinetic schemes, {{also known}} as Boltzmann schemes {{are based on the}} moment-method-strategy, where an upwind scheme is first {{developed}} at the Boltzmann level and after taking suitable moments we arrive at an upwind scheme for the governing Euler or Navier-Stokes equations. The Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS) scheme, which belongs to the family of kinetic schemes is being extensively used to compute inviscid as well as viscous flows around many complex configurations of practical interest over the past two decades. To resolve many flow features accurately, like suction peak, minimising the loss in stagnation pressure, shocks, slipstreams, triple points, vortex sheets, shock-shock interaction, mixing layers, flow separation in viscous flows require an accurate and low dissipative numerical scheme. The first order KFVS method even though is very robust suffers from the problem of having much more numerical diffusion than required, resulting in very badly smearing of the above features. However, numerical dissipation can be reduced considerably by using higher order kinetic schemes. But they require more points in the stencil and hence consume more computational time and memory. The second order schemes require flux or slope limiters in the neighbourhood of discontinuities to avoid spurious and physically meaningless wiggles or oscillations in pressure, temperature or density. The limiters generally restrict the residue fall in second order schemes while in first order schemes residue falls up to <b>machine</b> <b>zero.</b> Further, pressure and density contours or streamlines are much smoother for first order accurate schemes than second order accurate schemes. A question naturally arises about the possibility of constructing first order upwind schemes which retain almost all advantages mentioned above {{while at the same time}} crisply capture the flow features. In the present work, an attempt has been made to address the above issues by developing yet another kinetic scheme, known as the low dissipative modified KFVS (m-KFVS) method based on modified CIR (MCIR) splitting with molecular velocity dependent dissipation control function. Different choices for the dissipation control function are presented. A detailed mathematical analysis and the underlying physical arguments behind these choices are presented. The expressions for the m-KFVS fluxes are derived. For one of the choices, the expressions for the split fluxes are similar to the usual first order KFVS method. The mathematical properties of 1 D m-KFVS fluxes and the eigenvalues of the corresponding flux Jacobians are studied numerically. The analysis of numerical dissipation is carried out both at Boltzmann and Euler levels. The expression for stability criterion is derived. In order to be consistent with the interior scheme, modified solid wall and outer boundary conditions are derived by extending the MCIR idea to boundaries. The cell-centred finite volume method based on m-KFVS is applied to several standard test cases for 1 D, 2 D and 3 D inviscid flows. In the case of subsonic flows, the m-KFVS method produces much less numerical entropy compared to first order KFVS method and the results are comparable to second order accurate q-KFVS method. In transonic and supersonic flows, m-KFVS generates much less numerical dissipation compared to first order KFVS and even less compared to q-KFVS method. Further, the m-KFVS method captures the discontinuities more sharply with contours being smooth and near second order accuracy has been achieved in smooth regions, by still using first order stencil. Therefore, the numerical dissipation generated by m-KFVS is considerably reduced by suitably choosing the dissipation control variables. The Euler code based on m-KFVS method almost takes the same amount of computational time as that of KFVS method. Although, the formal accuracy is of order one, the m-KFVS method resolves the flow features much more accurately compared to first order KFVS method but the numerical dissipation generated by m-KFVS method may not be minimal. Hence, the dissipation control vector is in general not optimal. If we can find the optimal dissipation control vector then we will be able to achieve the minimal dissipation. In the present work, the above objective is attained by posing the minimisation of numerical dissipation in m-KFVS method as an optimal control problem. Here, the control variables are the dissipation control vector. The discrete form of the cost function, which is to be minimised is considered as the sum of the squares of change in entropy at all cells in the computational domain. The number of control variables is equal to the total number of cells or finite volumes in the computational domain, as each cell has only one dissipation control variable. In the present work, the minimum value of cost function is obtained by using gradient based optimisation method. The sensitivity gradients of the cost function with respect to the control variables are obtained using discrete adjoint approach. The discrete adjoint equations for the optimisation problem of minimising the numerical dissipation in m-KFVS method applied to 2 D and 3 D Euler equations are derived. The method of steepest descent is used to update the control variables. The automatic differentiation tool Tapenade has been used to ease the development of adjoint codes. The m-KFVS code combined with discrete adjoint code is applied to several standard test cases for inviscid ﬂows. The test cases considered are, low Mach number flows past NACA 0012 airfoil and two element Williams airfoil, transonic and supersonic flows past NACA 0012 airfoil and finally, transonic flow past Onera M 6 wing. Numerical results have shown that the m-KFVS-adjoint method produces even less numerical dissipation compared to m-KFVS method and hence results in more accurate solution. The m-KFVS-adjoint code takes more computational time compared to m-KFVS code. The present work demonstrates that it is possible to achieve near second order accuracy by formally first order accurate m-KFVS scheme while retaining advantages of first order accurate methods...|$|E
