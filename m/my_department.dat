His living at Batu Gajah merely means an excessive amount of travelling.|$|E

Beauregard successfully lobbied with Jefferson Davis's military adviser, Braxton Bragg, to prevent significant units of his small force from being transferred north of Richmond {{to the aid}} of Lee. His timely action, coupled with the military incompetence of Butler, bottled up the Union army, nullifying its threat to Petersburg and Lee's supply line. Now that this sector was stable, pressure began to rise to transfer troops from Beauregard's front to Lee's. Beauregard did send a division (Maj. Gen. Robert Hoke's) to Lee for the Battle of Cold Harbor, but Lee urgently wanted more and took the step of offering Beauregard command of {{the right wing of the}} Army of Northern Virginia for his cooperation. Beauregard replied in a passive–aggressive manner, [...] "I am willing to do anything for our success, but cannot leave <b>my</b> <b>Department</b> without orders of War Department." ...|$|E

[...] Johnson concluded, [...] "The threat of foreign terrorist fighters requires the comprehensive efforts of all our partner agencies and allied nations. We will continue to adapt to this evolving threat and take necessary action to protect the American public.

For example, recently I was updating <b>my</b> <b>department’s</b> reading list on research methods for the comprehensive exam in comparative politics, and I added a chapter by Lakatos (Lakatos 1970) {{to it and}} sent it to my colleagues for feedback.

30|$|Such {{statements}} {{reveal a}} number of underlying notions and assumptions: that non-citizens who commit crimes are prima facie a risk to security; that non-citizens (regardless {{of the length of}} their residency) have no right to remain in Australia; that staying in Australia is a privilege; that those who are not citizens are ‘foreigners’, regardless of how long they have lived in Australia or their ties with the Australian community; and that the risk posed by non-citizens can be effectively managed by the Government. Whilst noting that the new cancellation powers would result in separation of the family unit, the Minister explained that the amendments were necessary to ‘enhance the Act’s powers in the interest of national security and maintaining public order and safety, by strengthening <b>my</b> <b>department’s</b> ability to identify, assess and reduce any risk to the Australian community that a non-citizen may present’ (Explanatory Memorandum, 2014, Attachment A).|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} this article is that {{sociology}} suffers from continuous quarrels over methodological doctrines that have become foci for contesting camps. I examine four such doctrines — quantitative and qualitative, survey and comparative-historical methods, ethnomethodology, and micro-macro phenomena — and conclude that all reify false distinctions and, therefore, are not appropriate principles for guiding research. I suggest, instead, that research requires a clear sense of problem and purpose and that, when this condition is met, we must use logic to resolve several recurrent dilemmas that occur in all studies. To improve sociological research, those solutions need to be devised for each study and not adopted routinely. The announcement of the plan to close the Washington University Department of Sociology came just as I had to decide on a theme for these annual meetings of the Southern Sociological Society. I was reminded of <b>my</b> <b>department's</b> experience with retrenchment, the terminated department at the University of Rochester, and several other close personal connections to the announcement...|$|R

40|$|Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern) : The {{critical}} {{issue is the}} level of overall funding made available for the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy and in that regard I am fully satisfied with the amount of € 43 m made available this year under the Vote of <b>my</b> own <b>Department.</b> The earmarking of particular revenues for specific expenditure purposes is generally avoided as it is much more cumbersome to operate than utilising a central fund. In any case, the allocation of drugs-related CAB money to drugs misuse programmes would imply uncertain and variable amounts coming available and the process of releasing such money takes a number of years. Furthermore, the allocation of CAB receipts would not necessarily imply an increase in overall funding. The fact is that the Government’s overall spend on drugs initiatives amounts to much more than the amount taken in by CAB over the years. For example, in 2005 in the region of € 195 m was allocated by the Government for drugs related programmes across the Votes of a number of Departments. This figure far outstrips any CAB receipts that would have been available in the same period. The allocation of € 43 m to <b>my</b> <b>Department’s</b> Vote for the Drugs Initiative/Young People’s Facilities and Services Fund in 2006 represents an increase of 37 % on the original 2005 allocation and a massive 61 % increase on the 2004 allocation. Overall, I am satisfied that current Government expenditure on drugs is sufficient {{to meet the needs of}} those involved in tackling the effects of the misuse of drugs...|$|R
