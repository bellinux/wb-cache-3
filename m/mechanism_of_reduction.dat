50|$|NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 2, {{also known}} as NQO2 or QR2, is a human gene. It is a phase II {{detoxification}} enzyme which can carry out two or four electron reductions. Its <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> is via a covalently bound zinc ion and a cocrystalized FAD. NQO2 contains two chains homologous in AA sequence but 7% different in structure. As a result, NQO2 contains two similar yet unique active sites. An important function of NQO2 is its activation on NRH. NQO2 can be inhibited by resveratrol.|$|E

It plays {{a vital role}} in enabling the cytochrome a3- CuB binuclear center to accept four electrons in reducing molecular oxygen to water. The <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> was formerly thought to involve a peroxide intermediate, which was believed to lead to superoxide production. However, the currently accepted mechanism involves a rapid four-electron reduction involving immediate oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage, avoiding any intermediate likely to form superoxide.|$|E
5000|$|Tetrazolium dye {{reduction}} {{is dependent on}} NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase enzymes largely in the cytosolic compartment of the cell. [...] Therefore, reduction of MTT and other tetrazolium dyes depends on the cellular metabolic activity due to NAD(P)H flux. Cells with a low metabolism such as thymocytes and splenocytes reduce very little MTT. In contrast, rapidly dividing cells exhibit high rates of MTT reduction. It {{is important to keep}} in mind that assay conditions can alter metabolic activity and thus tetrazolium dye reduction without affecting cell viability. In addition, the <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> of tetrazolium dyes, i.e. intracellular (MTT, MTS) vs. extracellular (WST-1), will also determine the amount of product.|$|E

40|$|Various free {{radicals}} formed on pulse radiolysis of aqueous solutions {{have been used}} to investigate the <b>mechanisms</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> cytochrome(III) c by inter- and intramolecular electron transfer.

Fast optical changes in the 1 (- 500) -mus region correspond to <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the iron center; whereas the slower changes in the 10 (- 500) -ms region are attributed to postreduction conformational changes.

40|$|Shock-boundary layer {{interaction}} (SBLI) {{is a kind}} {{of problem}} which is frequently met in supersonic engine inlet flow and external flow. A detail study on <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> of shock induced flow separation by MVG is carried out by high order implicit large eddy simulation (LES). To generate the fully developed turbulent flow, a series of turbulent profiles are given by previous DNS simulation results. The <b>mechanism</b> <b>of</b> <b>reduction</b> of shock induced flow separation was originally considered as a result of plump velocity profile caused by turbulent kinetic energy. It was acclaimed that turbulent flow has so stronger kinetic energy that the velocity profile is changed to be plump, which lead to reduction of shock induced flow separation. However, according to our detail study in this paper, the shock wave breaks down when ring-like vortices generated by MVG are passing through it, while the vortex structure never breaks down and is even little influenced. Therefore, the flow separation induced by shock is reduced by break-down of shock wave, not plump velocity profile. More details of the investigation on the mechanism are reported in this paper...|$|E

Aurivillius Bi 2 WO derivatives exhibit a two steps mechanism (Bi 0  Bi 2 + and Bi 2 + Bi 3 +), similar to pure bismuth oxide. In contrast the investigated bismuth molybdenum oxides (Bi 26 Mo 10 O 69 related phases and Bi 2 Mo 3 O 12) revealed a one step mechanism (Bi 0 - Bi 3 +). A better stability was therefore revealed for Bismuth-molybdenum oxides which are well known for their catalytic properties.
