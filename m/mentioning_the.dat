5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} in whether the depression would attain tropical storm status or not, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Punta San Telmo, Michoacán to Acapulco, Guerrero. Prior to affecting the coastline, the Mexican meteorological agency issued a heavy rainfall advisory, also <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> potential for flooding and mudslides, for the states of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. Officials prepared 21shelters in the region.|$|E
5|$|During the Arab Spring {{in early}} 2011, {{the number of}} hashtags <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased.

5|$|Only one runestone <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire {{has been}} found on Gotland. This may be due both {{to the fact that}} few rune stones were raised on Gotland in favour of image stones, {{as well as to the}} fact that the Gotlanders dealt mainly in trade, paying a yearly tribute to the Swedes for {{military}} protection.|$|E
5|$|Some Iranian {{newspapers}} avoided <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> character, {{presumably to}} avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from {{a delegation of}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and unfair portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|The first {{document}} <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> {{existence of}} this community is the town charter granted by Mathieu d'Alsace in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders, Count of Boulogne; Calais thus {{became part of the}} county of Boulogne. In 1189, Richard the Lionheart is documented to have landed at Calais on his journey to the Third Crusade.|$|E

50|$|It is {{frequently}} mistakenly repeated that Ramsey <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> Knights Templar in his Discourse, {{when in fact}} he did not <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> Order at all - he <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> Knights Hospitaller. But perceptive listeners would have understood his <b>mention</b> of <b>the</b> Crusader knights to be an indirect reference to the Knights Templar, the memory of whom was still controversial in France and {{may have led to}} the Pope's indictment of the organization a year later.|$|R
5000|$|Also of note are cards #33 (Vic Raschi) and #163 (Dave Philley); some {{versions}} <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> player being traded, {{while others}} do not (<b>the</b> cards which <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> trades are more valuable). To add to the confusion, {{there is a third}} Philley card which <b>mentions</b> <b>the</b> trade and also credits him with having played more games the previous year (157 rather than 152).|$|R
5|$|After a whistle-blower {{reported}} that the MSDF's preference had been improperly changed an investigation was launched. On December 16 2016 the Japanese Ministry of Defense (the Defense Agency having been upgraded to a ministry in 2007) stated {{that it had not}} confirmed lobbying efforts but the ministry admonished Tomohisa Takei, the JMSDF chief of staff, for <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> MCH-101 by name during the procurement process to his subordinates. This had come after MSDF officials had {{reported that}} the Mitsubishi-built SH helicopters may be best.|$|E
5|$|Jobs rants to {{marketing}} executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan – he denies {{he is the}} father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and his refusal to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{attempts}} to find her brother by exploring the Squidport for clues. She learns from Grampa that black sedans that have been appearing around town are connected to Bart's disappearance, she also learns from Chief Wiggum that government-style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area. Lisa destroys the sedans, but finds them to be empty. After completing a task for the Sea Captain, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart {{got out of it}} and boarded a ship. She finds Bart on the ship; he appears to have memory loss and is mumbling unintelligibly, as well as soiling his pants, while occasionally <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> sedans and Buzz Cola.|$|E

5|$|The British and German ad {{program for}} an LTO variant called the Cheesy Bacon XXL {{featured}} an edited {{version of the}} Manthem commercial created by Crispin Porter + Bogusky that was originally used for the company's LTO Texas Double Whopper. The line <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Whopper was edited out and replaced and {{the picture of the}} product was digitally replaced with one of the Cheesy Bacon XXL. The ad was sung entirely in English; all signage, including road signs license plates on vehicles, etc., was not translated into German.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} Life article {{did more}} than provide the public with {{an image of the}} group, looking more like bankers than irascible. It placed the picture larger and before the pictures of the Metropolitans competition winning art works. It also reiterated the word advanced, echoing the Madison Avenue advertising speak of the day. The picture caption also referred to the protest as in keeping with avant-garde tradition, <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Salon des Refusés of 1863 and the Ashcan School.|$|E
5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if they did so. Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E

5|$|ESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted {{a picture}} of a Flag of Canada redone in Michigan's team colors of maize and blue at Crisler Arena on December 4. One of her {{followers}} noted that the big version on the wall was a general Stauskas fan flag and that a little version of the flag was added next to it for each three-pointer Canadian Stauskas made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, the students in the Maize Rage (Michigan student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.|$|E
5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> field Jacob allotted to Joseph, and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel Balāṭa.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{spent the}} rest of 1971 and early 1972 trying to raise {{financing}} for the American Graffiti script. During this time, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures all turned down the opportunity to co-finance and distribute the film. Lucas, Huyck and Katz rewrote the second draft together, which, in addition to Modesto, was also set in Mill Valley and Los Angeles. Lucas also intended to end American Graffiti showing a title card detailing the fate of the characters, including the death of Milner and the disappearance of Toad in Vietnam. Huyck and Katz found the ending depressing and were incredulous that Lucas planned to include only the male characters. Lucas argued that <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> girls meant adding another title card, which he felt would prolong the ending. Because of this, Pauline Kael later accused Lucas of chauvinism.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Jatakas also <b>mention</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of loan deeds. These were called rnapatra or rnapanna. The Dharmashastras also supported {{the use of}} loan deeds. Kautilya has also <b>mentioned</b> <b>the</b> usage of loan deeds. Loans deeds were also called rnalekhaya.|$|R

5|$|The {{four of them}} head to the warehouse, {{where they}} find the gas stored inside asthma inhalers. Suddenly, Mulder arrives to arrest them, but two dark-suited men come to take Susanne. They fire at Mulder, hitting the boxes behind him and exposing him to the gas. The {{exposure}} causes Mulder to strip naked, hide in the box, and hallucinate about seeing aliens in the warehouse. Susanne shoots the men and escapes. More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination. X's unconvincing denial—"I heard it was a lone gunman"—becomes {{the origin of the}} trio's name. X leaves, just as the police arrive and arrest the Lone Gunmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{petrification}} motif {{also appears}} in non-scriptural works. The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa (generally dated 4th century CE) {{notes that the}} wife of Gautama (unnamed here) momentarily becomes the wife of Indra. Without explicitly <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> curse, it relates further that she regains her beautiful form and casts away her stony appearance, owing to the grace provided by the dust of Rama's feet, which redeems her. Gautam Patel, author of many works about Kalidasa, credits him as {{the first person to}} introduce the petrification motif. In the Ramavataram too, Rama does not have to touch Ahalya with his foot; the dust from his feet is enough to bring her back to life. As in other versions of the tale, the repentant Ahalya is turned to stone, only to be liberated by Rama, and Indra runs away disguised as a cat but is cursed to bear the marks of a thousand vulvae. The Ramavataram {{is an example of the}} Bhakti-era poets who exalt Rama as a saviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Hungarian army, {{on its way}} to Transylvania, {{was stopped}} by a blockade; there they decided to bury the 500 cannons and other treasures, so the Moldavians {{would not be able to}} capture them. According to Długosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another Vlach (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery. The Moldavian-German Chronicles say that someone named Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed. Around 10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons escaped with their king. A Hungarian chronicle mentions 7,000 casualties for the Moldavians. This chronicle is disputed though, due to it being the only one <b>mentioning</b> <b>the</b> Moldavian casualties in numbers; and because the Hungarians did not have the opportunity to calculate the numbers of their fallen enemy. The entire conflict, with the Hungarian invasion and retreat, took around forty days.|$|E
