6000|$|I {{think it}} may be assumed that most of us here present know {{something}} about travelling. I do not mean in distant regions or foreign countries, although I dare say some of us have had experience in that way, but at home, and within the limits of the United Kingdom. I dare say most of us have had experience of the extinct [...] "fast coaches," [...] the [...] "Wonders," [...] "Taglionis," [...] and [...] "Tallyhos," [...] of other days. I daresay most of us remember certain modest postchaises, dragging us down interminable roads, through slush and mud, to little country towns with no visible population, except half-a-dozen men in smock-frocks, half-a-dozen women with umbrellas and pattens, and a washed-out dog or so shivering under the gables, to complete the desolate picture. We can all discourse, I dare say, if so minded, about our recollections of the [...] "Talbot," [...] the [...] "Queen's Head," [...] or the [...] "Lion" [...] of those days. We have all been to that room on the ground floor {{on one side of the}} old inn yard, not quite free from a certain fragrant smell of tobacco, where the cruets on the sideboard were usually absorbed by the skirts of the box-coats that hung from the wall; where awkward servants waylaid us at every turn, like so many human man-traps; where county members, framed and glazed, were eternally presenting that petition which, somehow or other, had made their glory in the county, although nothing else had ever come of it. Where the books in the windows always wanted the first, last, and <b>middle</b> <b>leaves,</b> and where the one man was always arriving at some unusual hour in the night, and requiring his breakfast at a similarly singular period of the day. I have no doubt we could all be very eloquent on the comforts of our favourite hotel, wherever it was--its beds, its stables, its vast amount of posting, its excellent cheese, its head waiter, its capital dishes, its pigeon-pies, or its 1820 port. Or possibly we could recal our chaste and innocent admiration of its landlady, or our fraternal regard for its handsome chambermaid. A celebrated domestic critic once writing of a famous actress, renowned for her virtue and beauty, gave her the character of being an [...] "eminently gatherable-to-one's-arms sort of person." [...] Perhaps some one amongst us has borne a somewhat similar tribute to the mental charms of the fair deities who presided at our hotels.|$|E

50|$|Different {{strains of}} PSTVd exist and {{symptoms}} range from mild to severe. Mild strains produce no obvious symptoms. Symptoms in severe strains {{are dependent on}} environmental conditions and are most severe in hot conditions. Symptoms may be mild in initial infections but become progressively worse in the following generations. Common symptoms of severe infections include colour changes in the foliage, smaller leaves and spindle like elongation. Sprouting also occurs at a slower rate than in unaffected potatoes. Infected tomatoes are slower to show symptoms which include stunted growth with a ‘bunchy top’ caused by shortened internodes. Leaves become yellow or purple and often become curled and twisted. Necrosis eventually occurs in the veins of the bottom and <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> and the top leaves don’t die but are reduced in size. Fruit ripening is also affected leading to hard, small, dark green tomatoes.|$|E

The <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> are the largest, they range from being oval to broadly lanceolate, usually with a few blunt edges along their margins, and their bases are either sessile or clasp the stem.

40|$|Experiment was {{performed}} in a pot to examined the effect of leaf locations on the concentrations of some plant toxins (cyanide, nitrate, soluble and total oxalates), and nutrients viz; beta-carotene (provitamin A), vitamin C and mineral elements (Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Ca Na and K) at market maturity (vegetative phase) of Corchorus olitorius grown in nitrogen and non – nitrogen treated soil. The leaves of Corchorus olitorius were harvested at three different leaf locations (basal, middle and upper positions) and they were subjected to chemical analysis.

40|$|Outbreaks of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 infections {{have been}} linked {{increasingly}} to leafy greens, particularly to lettuce. We present here the first evidence that this enteric pathogen can multiply on the leaves of romaine lettuce plants. The increases in population size of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in the phyllosphere of young lettuce plants ranged from 16 - to 100 -fold under conditions of warm temperature {{and the presence of}} free water on the leaves and varied significantly with leaf age. The population size was consistently ca. 10 -fold higher on the young (inner) leaves than on the <b>middle</b> <b>leaves.</b> The growth rates of Salmonella enterica and of the natural bacterial microflora were similarly leaf age dependent. Both enteric pathogens also achieved higher population sizes on young leaves than on <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> harvested from mature lettuce heads, suggesting that leaf age affects preharvest as well as postharvest colonization. Elemental analysis of the exudates collected from the surfaces of leaves of different ages revealed that young-leaf exudates were 2. 9 and 1. 5 times richer in total nitrogen and carbon, respectively, than middle-leaf exudates. This trend mirrored the nitrogen and carbon content of the leaf tissue. Application of ammonium nitrate, but not glucose, to <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> enhanced the growth of E. coli O 157 :H 7 significantly, suggesting that low nitrogen limits its growth on these leaves. Our results indicate that leaf age and nitrogen content contribute to shaping the bacterial communities of preharvest and postharvest lettuce and that young lettuce leaves may be associated with a greater risk of contamination with E. coli O 157 :H 7...|$|E
40|$|Pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of leaf positions on the concentrations of some phytotoxins (cyanide, nitrate, soluble and total oxalates), micronutrients namely; vitamin C, β-carotene (provitamin A) and mineral elements (Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Ca Na and K) at vegetative phase of Telfairia occidentalis grown in nitrogen and non – nitrogen treated soil. The leaves of Telfairia occidentalis were harvested and analysed at three different leaf locations, namely; basal, middle and upper positions. The result obtained showed that no significant differences was observed in the cyanide concentration between basal and <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> and between middle and upper leaves, however, basal leaves had significant (p< 0. 05) higher concentration of cyanide than upper leaves irrespective of soil nitrogen levels. The concentrations of nitrate and β-carotene in control and nitrogen fertilized Telfairia occidentalis were significantly (p< 0. 05) highest in upper, followed by middle and lowest in the basal leaf position. The soluble and total oxalates content in Telfairia occidentalis were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the basal and <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> than the upper leaves irrespective of soil nitrogen levels. While the vitamin C concentration in the vegetable was significantly elevated in basal leaves than the leaves obtain from middle and upper leaf locations. Analysis of mineral elements showed that Fe, Mg, Zn and Ca were concentrated more in the basal and <b>middle</b> <b>leaves</b> than the upper leaves while the K concentration was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in the middle and upper leaves than the basal leaves in control and nitrogen treated Telfairia occidentalis. The results conclude that concentrations of most of the plant toxins are higher in the older leaves than younger ones. Thus inclusion of the younger leaves of Telfairia occindentalis in our meal will reduce the negative health effect associated with high ingestion of the phytotoxins...|$|E

The experiment was free from insecticide application. A total of 15 plant samples were taken diagonally from each plot {{and the number of}} nymphs and adults found on every leaf were recorded. Analysis of leaf nutrient contents was done at the Biotechnology Research Center, Bogor. Leaf factors observed were the protein content, total sugar, fat, mineral and thickness of leaves. Sample leaves were taken from three different positions: upper, middle and lower stratum, at four different ages of plant: 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks after planting (WAP). The results showed that T. palmi invaded potato plants since the terminal shoots emergence stage. The adults were found on the upper leaves (first to fifth), while nymphs were mostly found on the <b>middle</b> <b>leaves.</b> Appropriate nutritional and physical factors of plant leaves caused the adults of T. palmi to choose the upper leaves as their food source and a place to lay eggs.
