5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|An avid cyclist, Bonds {{chose the}} {{activity}} to be a {{primary means of}} keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made it <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape. As {{a result of the}} cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.|$|E

5|$|During heavy rains, it was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese {{troops and}} {{vehicles}} found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, {{were able to}} flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many brown dwarfs, which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse brown dwarfs in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while brown dwarfs in older clusters have faded and are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> study.|$|E
5|$|Chetro Ketl's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} using three bulk materials: stone, clay-sand, and water. Two types of stone were used: a hard gray-brown tabular sandstone {{that forms the}} bench above Chaco Canyon's cliffs, and a softer, tan, massively bedded sandstone that forms the cliffs themselves. Chacoans preferred the harder, tabular stone as {{it was easier to}} shape, but much of it had to be dug up and levered out of the ground with wooden poles. Because the massive tan stone of the cliff faces was easier to procure, but <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> work, the Chacoans probably used it only after the more easily quarried gray-brown stone beds had been depleted.|$|E
50|$|HD 16152 {{is a white}} {{main-sequence star}} located {{approximately}} 431 light years away, in the constellation Cetus. Its apparent magnitude is 7.12.

60|$|Against {{the first}} of these {{annoyances}} we have always been able to guard ourselves, at least in a measure, and our man and the cook declare that they have become so used to them that they do not mind them; but to guard against burglars is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult,</b> and <b>to</b> become used to them would, I think, require a great deal of practice.|$|R
5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be very easy to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> fly than had been expected, {{and would not be}} safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic {{view of the world}} which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine Elster and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. A rare and highly radioactive metal with no stable isotopes, polonium is chemically similar to selenium and tellurium, though its metallic character {{resembles that of}} its horizontal neighbors in the periodic table: thallium, lead, and bismuth. Due to the short half-life of all its isotopes, its natural occurrence is limited to tiny traces of the fleeting polonium-210 (with a half-life of 138days) in uranium ores, {{as it is the}} penultimate daughter of natural uranium-238. Though slightly longer-lived isotopes exist, they are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> produce. Today, polonium is usually produced in milligram quantities by the neutron irradiation of bismuth. Due to its intense radioactivity, which results in the radiolysis of chemical bonds and radioactive self-heating, its chemistry has mostly been investigated on the trace scale only.|$|E
50|$|Go is {{considered}} <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> for computers <b>to</b> win than other games such as chess, because its much larger branching factor makes it prohibitively <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> use traditional AI {{methods such as}} alpha-beta pruning, tree traversal and heuristic search.|$|R
50|$|Mt. Whyte {{is usually}} {{combined}} with Mount Niblock (2976 m) when {{done as a}} scramble. However, while Mt. Niblock is rated a moderate scramble, Mt. Whyte is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> due <b>to</b> additional exposure and loose rock. The scramble should not be attempted in snowy conditions due to considerable fall distance which would likely prove fatal. A route description {{can be found in}} Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies.|$|R
50|$|They {{are limited}} in the number and timing of {{injection}} events that can be commanded during a single combustion event. While multiple injection events are possible with these older systems, it is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> and costly <b>to</b> achieve.|$|R
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, {{the quality of the}} surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the differential analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the differential analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the differential analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the differential analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> hunt than deer; {{approaching}} one {{with only a}} sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to}} the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860, Crittenden rejected the idea that secession was inevitable and continued {{to work for the}} preservation of the Union. He believed that the current sectional crisis could—like all past disagreements in U.S. history—be resolved through compromise. However, he believed that this compromise must not be a simple legislative action, which could be altered or even repealed by a successive Congress, but amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which would be <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> change. To that end, he proposed the Crittenden Compromise—a package of six constitutional amendments and four congressional resolutions—in December 1860. Among the resolutions were a condemnation of Northern personal liberty laws and an assertion of the constitutionality of the fugitive slave law. The amendments would have restored the Missouri Compromise line and extended it to California as a line of demarcation between slave and free territories. Crittenden's other amendments would have further guaranteed that slavery would remain legal indefinitely in Washington, D.C., so long as it was legal in either Maryland or Virginia and that slaveholders would be reimbursed for runaway slaves. Also, the amendments denied Congress any power to interfere with the interstate slave trade or with slavery in the existing Southern states and made the fugitive slave law and Three-Fifths Compromise perpetual in duration.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the animation-related work was done in Hyderabad; the {{remaining}} ten percent was completed in the United States. In an Indo-Asian News Service interview, Draper said he collaborated with thirteen experts and a large team of animators to design the fly. Because the film's fly's eyes comprise 80 percent of its face, Rajamouli felt they could make it expressive; he used the 1986 Pixar American short film Luxo Jr. for inspiration. The output of the first team of animators, using the reference material prepared, was unsatisfactory and Rajamouli reworked the fly's detailing. Using a powerful lens, the film team conducted an arduous photographic shoot of unconscious flies in a bottle stored in a refrigerator. After enlarging the details, Rajamouli made cosmetic changes to the fly's face {{to make it look}} appealing onscreen. A new team including Draper, three concept artists, three modellers, two shader designers, two hair and fur designers, three riggers and several animators, designed the animated fly in two months. Its head and fur were designed after shaping its body and wings. The fly was refined daily using clay models to expedite the process. The animators found the sequences between Sudeep and the fly <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> execute because the latter had to express emotions only though its slender arms rather than its face.|$|E
5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few survivals of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
50|$|Accurate {{prediction}} and forecasting {{are very}} difficult in some areas, such as natural disasters, pandemics, demography, population dynamics and meteorology.

50|$|Similar to {{engraved}} or painted stone works, {{the subjects}} of the bone pieces were typically game animals and symbols.

5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run {{by the end of the}} period. Some of these regions were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width, and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. The Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands; two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the Highlands, from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands. But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism.|$|E

The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season and, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians, this was an ice free season of four months or less and for much of the Highlands and Uplands of seven months or less. The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, of worldwide colder and wetter weather, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century. In 1564 there were thirty-three days of continual frost, and rivers and lochs froze. The 1690s marked its lowest point, leading to the Seven ill years of famine.|$|E

5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems {{keeping up with the}} latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, in spite of its relatively low speeds.

50|$|Another second-year {{project was}} known as the pottery. Students were faced with a <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> space <b>to</b> address: one in an {{existing}} urban environment. This meant that street space and a house on the lot would interact significantly with the structure they designed, including even a common courtyard-type exchange between the two structures. The location as well as function was specified for students: the building was to be a pottery business, including a shop and a studio. The process again went through many steps and revisions in order to reach its final outcome.|$|R
