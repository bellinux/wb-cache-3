40|$|The direct <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharges</b> in rivers can be {{time-consuming}} and costly. The discharge is commonly estimated indirectly {{by means of}} a curve, relating water level to discharge. This so-called rating curve is traditionally determined by fitting a curve to a number of observations, which induces several uncertainties and difficulties: 1) the curve is approximated by a function type, 2) in general there are no observations for high flow conditions and 3) it needs to updated regularly due to cross sectional changes. In this research a physics-based rating curve is developed and evaluated that is more reliable and easy to update. By the use of a photogrammetry techtnique 3 D surface maps of river banks are generated by pictures obtained from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The topography of the main channel is determined by using an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) or it is approximated by the making use of expert judgement and the method developed by Lane (relates the water depth of the channel to the width and natural angle of repose). By knowing the geometric profile of a river reach, only the roughness coefficient and water surface slope are the unknown parameters to derive the rating curve, where the Manning’s formula acts as the basis of the rating curve. In this way, the rating curves can be made physically substantiated and the calibration parameter is the combination of roughness and water surface slope. Instead of using the power law function as a approximate function of the rating curve, it is used as approximation of the conveyance-water level relationship. Therefore, the exponents in the power law function are physical substantiated and reduce uncertainties in the extrapolation zone of the traditional method, because the profile during high flow conditions is also known. Further more, the local invariabilities that are specific to single cross-section analyses are minimized by analysing river reaches. It is demonstrated that local invariabilities arises easily in natural rivers that are causing non-uniform flows, which make in general the the open-channel flow analysis much more complex. However, the average conveyance of a reach may led to the a valid assumption of a uniform flow (which is part of the assumption in the Manning’s formula), depending on how the local variabilities behave. The calibration of rating curves are much easier compared with the traditional way. Instead of collecting new discharge measurements during dispersed flows, you just have to visit the area ones with a drone and surveying equipment. During this visit, the new new geometric profile can be captured and the rating curve can be updated, assuming that the roughness and water surface slope remains constant. Additional thesi...|$|E

30|$|In the {{trajectory}} method, all the flow {{in a stream}} is diverted into a pipe (Yan 1996; Hudson 2004; Salguero et al. 2008). Flow from a horizontal pipe can be estimated using either the California pipe method developed by van Leer (1924) or {{the trajectory}} method developed by Greeve (1928). This flow measurement technique is based on measuring brink depth {{at the end of}} the pipe (Berkowitz 2013). The diverted water is discharged with pressure so that the rate of flow can be estimated from <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the jet (Rohwer 1943; Boman and Shukla 2009). At least two <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>discharging</b> jet are required to calculate the rate of flow of the water (Yan 1996; Liu et al. 2014).

Fast transit velocities in conjunction with low dispersion values suggest that the tracer was routed through a hydraulically efficient, channelized drainage system.

This finding underlines the difficulty of detecting a possible drainage system evolution based on single tracer tests conducted at coarse temporal intervals. Furthermore, the obtained velocity-discharge relationships display pronounced hysteresis.

40|$|Abstract: A {{method for}} calculating stage-discharge {{relations}} (rating curves) and suspended sediment concentrations in gravel bedded streams is presented {{and applied to}} a reach downstream from a U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) gaging station on Little Prickly Pear Creek, MT. The approach uses a fluid-mechanically based model to convert <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> stage into <b>discharge</b> and boundary shear stress fields appropriate for determining sediment transport. The model does not use empirical roughness coefficients, such as the Manning coefficient, but rather determines channel roughness from field <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> the channel geometry and the dominant physical and biological roughness elements in the modeled reach. The theoretical flow rating curve produced by the model is in excellent agreement with direct <b>measurements</b> <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> made by the USGS. An empirical relation between the concentration of fine sediment near the bed {{and the rate of}} bedload transport is developed using station sediment data. This relation and a point <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> concentration as a function of grain size are employed by the model to calculate suspended sediment concentration fields and fluxes in the reach. The approach also can be used to generate a sediment rating curve. Our method has the potential of providing accurate estimates of stream flow and suspended sediment loads less expensively than conventional gaging methods...|$|R
