5|$|The {{partition}} was {{controversial and}} violently disputed. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million {{were killed in}} religious riots as 10–12million non-Muslims (Hindus, Sikhs mostly) migrated from Pakistan into India, and Muslims migrated from India into Pakistan, across the newly created borders of India, West Pakistan and East Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Building {{upon the}} gene-chromosome theory of {{heredity}} that originated with Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), August Weismann (1834–1914) proved that inheritance only takes place through gametes. No other cells can pass on inherited characters. The work of Katherine Esau (1898–1997) on plant anatomy {{is still a}} major foundation of modern botany. Her books Plant Anatomy and Anatomy of Seed Plants have been key plant structural biology texts for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century.|$|E

5|$|A Message from Earth (AMFE) is {{a high-powered}} digital radio signal {{that was sent}} on 9 October 2008 towards Gliese 581c, a large {{terrestrial}} extrasolar planet orbiting the red dwarf star Gliese 581. The signal is a digital time capsule containing 501 messages that were selected through a competition on the social networking site Bebo. The message was sent using the RT-70 radar telescope of Ukraine's State Space Agency. The signal will reach the planet Gliese 581c in early 2029. <b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million people including celebrities and politicians participated in the AMFE project, which was the world's first digital time capsule where the content was selected by the public.|$|E

5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson {{kept her}} promise and burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry for <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Fitzgerald {{received}} a safety award {{for eight years}} of operation without a time-off worker injury. The vessel ran aground in 1969, and she collided with SS Hochelaga in 1970. Later that same year, she struck {{the wall of a}} lock, an accident repeated in 1973 and 1974. During 1974, she lost her original bow anchor in the Detroit River. None of these mishaps, however, were considered serious or unusual. Freshwater ships were built to last <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century, and Fitzgerald should still have had a long career ahead of her when she sank.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} Jamaican High School Championships, in 2003, he broke both the 200 m and 400 m records with times of 20.25 s and 45.35 s, respectively. Bolt's runs were a {{significant}} improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> second and the 400 m record by almost a second. While Bolt improved upon the 200 m time three months later, setting the still-standing World youth best at the 2003 Pan American Junior Championships. The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> {{century after}} {{the capture of}} Jerusalem, in 691, the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik {{commissioned}} {{the construction of the}} Dome of the Rock over a large outcropping of bedrock on the Temple Mount. The 10th-century historian al-Muqaddasi wrote that Abd al-Malik built the shrine in order to compete in grandeur with the city's Christian churches. Whatever the intention, the impressive splendor and scale of the shrine is seen as having helped significantly in solidifying the attachment of Jerusalem to the early Muslim faith.|$|E
5|$|Scotch Run {{begins in}} a lake in a valley in eastern Beaver Township. It flows west and {{slightly}} south for several miles between Nescopeck Mountain and McCauley Mountain. The stream eventually passes through the unincorporated community of Mifflin Cross Roads. Near this community, it turns south briefly before turning west-southwest again and flowing between Nescopeck Mountain and Dry Ridge. A short distance later, the stream exits Beaver Township and enters Main Township. In Main Township, it flows between Nescopeck Mountain and Full Mill Hill for slightly <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile. It then reaches its confluence with Catawissa Creek.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles: Rock Band {{was well}} {{received}} by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music {{and history of the}} Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession.|$|E
5|$|The CenturyLink Field Event Center {{connects to}} the stadium's west field plaza and {{consists}} of two exhibition halls, a conference room, and a concourse. The center hosts pre-game events for the Seahawks and Mariners. According to the Public Stadium Authority's website, the event center contributes <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> billion dollars to the region's economy. The center was renamed the CenturyLink Field Event Center in June 2011, following the acquisition of Qwest Communications by CenturyLink and the renaming of the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The Ghetto {{is south}} of {{downtown}} Dayton but {{north of the}} city of Oakwood. The Great Miami River is just <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile to the west, and Interstate 75 is just more than a mile to the west. In its current form, it is bounded by Brown Street to the west, Irving Avenue to the south, Trinity Avenue and Evanston Avenue to the east, and Caldwell Street and Stonemill Road to the north. This gives the area a roughly triangular shape.|$|E

5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, but in practice words with <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E
5|$|When an {{infected}} person sneezes or coughs, <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million virus particles can be spread to those close by. The close quarters and massive troop movements of World War I hastened the pandemic, and probably both increased transmission and augmented mutation; the war {{may also have}} increased the lethality of the virus. Some speculate the soldiers' immune systems were weakened by malnourishment, {{as well as the}} stresses of combat and chemical attacks, increasing their susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Soviet government's efforts, on June 14, 1987, about 5,000 people {{rallied to}} commemorate the victims of Soviet deportations. This event, {{organized}} by the human rights group Helsinki-86, {{was the first time}} after the Soviet occupation that the flower-laying ceremony took place, as the practice was banned by the Soviet authorities. In response the Soviet government organized a bicycle race at the monument at the time when the ceremony was planned to take place. Helsinki-86 organized another flower-laying ceremony on August 23 in the same year {{to commemorate the}} anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, at which the crowd was dispersed using jets of water. Yet the independence movement grew in size, amounting in some events to <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million participants (about one quarter of Latvia's population) and three years later, on May 4, 1990, the re-establishment of the independence of Latvia was declared.|$|E
