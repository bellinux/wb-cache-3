40|$|As family physicians, we {{are often}} asked to prepare medico-legal reports on behalf of our {{patients}} who have sustained personal injuries. Cervical myofascial injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents {{are by far the}} most common of all injuries seen in this setting. An awareness of the problem of cervical whiplash is essential.

40|$|Abstract Background Impingement {{syndrome}} and shoulder pain {{have been reported}} to occur in a proportion of patients following whiplash injuries to the neck. In this study we aim to examine these findings to establish the association between subacromial impingement and whiplash injuries to the cervical spine. Methods and results We examined 220 patients who had presented to the senior author for a <b>medico-legal</b> <b>report</b> following a whiplash injury to the neck. All patients were assessed for clinical evidence of subacromial impingement. 56 / 220 patients (26 %) had developed shoulder pain following the injury; of these, 11 / 220 (5 %) had clinical evidence of impingement syndrome. Only 3 / 11 patients (27 %) had the diagnosis made prior to evaluation for their <b>medico-legal</b> <b>report.</b> In the majority, other clinicians had overlooked the diagnosis. The seatbelt shoulder was involved in 83 % of cases (p Conclusion After a neck injury a significant proportion of patients present with shoulder pain, some of whom have treatable shoulder pathology such as impingement syndrome. The diagnosis is, however, frequently overlooked and shoulder pain is attributed to pain radiating from the neck resulting in long delays before treatment. It is important that this is appreciated and patients are specifically examined for signs of subacromial impingement after whiplash injuries to the neck. Direct seatbelt trauma to the shoulder is one possible explanation for its aetiology. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} of this audit was to examine whether the content of medico-legal reports regarding psychiatric injury following motor vehicle accidents {{was influenced by the}} role of the report writers. Method: The audit consisted of a retrospective review, using a novel rating scale, of archived documents from 559 consecutively examined insurance claims following motor vehicle accidents in New South Wales. Results: Treating practitioners wrote less complete reports than experts representing the plaintiff or defendant. Treating practitioners and plaintiffs' experts were more likely to diagnose posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, while defendants' experts were more likely to find no psychiatric disorder. Limitations of the study were that it was retrospective and examined report writing between 1989 and 1994. The completeness, rather than quality, of the medico-legal reports was measured. Conclusion: Further training and quality assurance procedures may improve <b>medico-legal</b> <b>report</b> writing. Reform of the rules regulating the content of experts' reports may reduce {{the extent to which the}} role of the report writer influences their opinion...|$|E
40|$|Forty-four {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} concussion for whom a <b>medico-legal</b> <b>report</b> {{had been written}} were followed up for 3 - 4 years after their accidents. Three cases were still pending {{at the end of}} the study. Fifty-seven per cent complained of symptoms when the medico-legal reports were written (mean interval from accident 12. 9 months), 39 % had symptoms at the time of settlement (mean interval 22. 1 months) and 34 % had symptoms one year later. When these results were compared with a general series from the same department some years earlier, it was found that the symptoms at the time of writing the reports were not significantly different from symptoms at 6 weeks in the earlier series, but the symptoms one year after settlement were almost two-and-a-half times greater than the symptoms at 12 months in the general series. No evidence could be found to suggest any organic basis for the higher symptom rate in the litigation series. It is suggested that the litigation process itself is a factor in the persistence of symptoms and this effect continues after legal settlement has been reached. Early settlement of the cases might significantly reduce morbidity...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. This study {{focuses on}} the role of the Educational Psychologist in the medico-legal process, with {{specific}} reference to the <b>medico-legal</b> <b>report</b> written for motor-vehicle accident compensation claims. Every year in South Africa approximately 10 000 people die and another 150 000 people are injured in road traffic accidents (www. raf. co. za). This results in thousands of injured people instituting claims against the Road Accident Fund for compensation for their injuries. In determining the injuries sustained and expected outlook for the future of these victims in terms of future education and/ or employment, such compensation claims require the opinions of numerous experts such as doctors, accident reconstruction experts, psychologists and other paramedical therapists. However, due to the adversarial nature of our legal system, many psychologists are reluctant to assess victims for compensation claims and become medico-legal experts, as they have no set guidelines to follow in this often treacherous arena. It is thus felt that a structure for the writing of medico-legal reports should be created to provide an acceptable format for the guidance of Educational Psychologists as well as to delineate their role and purpose as expert witnesses in court. The researcher will explain the current report-writing procedures in medico-legal cases and compare them with the requirements of legal teams who handle such matters. These comparisons will be used to compile useful guidelines for Educational Psychologists in the writing of medico-legal reports for motor vehicle accident claims. In this research, a generic qualitative research design will be conducted, using the constant comparative method of data analysis. The data for this study will be collected by means of interviews and documented text. A purposeful sample will be used to ensure that Educational Psychologists and lawyers with the necessary experience will be interviewed. A literature study will be provided to indicate the formal research that exists in the field of medico-legal reports. The proposed guidelines are provided in the final chapter to serve as a framework for Educational Psychologists to use in the writing of medico-legal reports for motorvehicle accident claims. The researcher hopes that this will create a better understanding between lawyers and psychologists so that they can work together more effectively...|$|E

40|$|Lightning is {{a serious}} danger, and {{constitutes}} one of our country’s deadliest weather phenomena. A review of the southern African medical literature shows a paucity of published data on lightning fatalities, with most reports coming from the lay press. A retrospective descriptive study for the period 1997 - 2000 of lightning fatalities on the South African Highveld 1 has shown that area to have a lightning ground-flash density of 6 - 9 flashes/km 2 /year, with {{a high incidence of}} thunderstorm days per year (some 40 - 70) (Tracey Gill, South African Weather Service – personal communication). The mean annual lightning death rate in our country ranges from 1. 5 to 8. 8 deaths per million inhabitants, which represents one of the highest rates in the world. When lightning deaths are witnessed, the medico-legal examination is greatly facilitated. However, when such deaths are not witnessed the investigation can be extremely difficult. In South Africa many non-specialist medical practitioners perform autopsies on lightning-related fatalities, with a resultant lack of uniformity in the <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reporting.</b> A call is therefore made for greater attention to detail in the <b>medico-legal</b> investigation and <b>reporting</b> of lightning-associated deaths.

40|$|Background: Domestic {{violence}} (DV) {{is still}} a significant public health problem, especially in women’s health. Few studies have reported the prevalence and domestic violence in Indonesia. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the prevalence, type of violence, and forensic examination on domestic violence victims in emergency departments. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of domestic violence victims observed in the Emergency Department at the Bhayangkara Hospital, Pekanbaru, Indonesia, between 2010 and 2014. The determinations of DV cases are based on the <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> (visum et repertum) and the police’s official inquiry letters. Results: Out of 6, 876 <b>medico-legal</b> injury <b>reports</b> of living victims were reviewed, and 755 (10, 9 %) cases were DV. The majority of victims in DV were women (93. 8 %) with childbearing age group as the highest frequency (77. 9 %). Most of the DV victims were housewives (67. 0 %). Moreover, physical assault was the most common DV types (98. 7 %). Bruise was the predominant type of wound among the DV victims (76. 2 %), and almost half of the victims had abrasions (48. 1 %). Head and limbs were the predominant sites of wound. Blunt injury was found in more than three-quarters of the victims (88. 5 %).

30|$|Violence is not {{inevitable}} problem {{and we can}} do much to prevent it through improving parenting skills; promoting awareness among people about the negative impact of violence on a family. We also should stress the principle of gender equality and the need for safeguarding and providing a secure livelihood for the family through effective prevention strategies performed by government and non-governmental organization services, with enforcement of law legal punishment against domestic violence and honor crimes. The study also recommended more researches to investigate the problems and the cultural effects on violence particularly in rural and Bedouin areas. As the study faced many difficulties regarding data registration in <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports,</b> a more specific comprehensive scheme is recommended, including data about the offenders and their relation to victims together with the need to address substance use, unemployment and other risk factors of violence among Jordanians to make the process of registration more accurate and convenient.|$|R
40|$|AIM: During forensic-medical autopsies experts must {{very often}} assess degree {{and the role}} of acute alcohol intoxications in {{mechanisms}} of death. This becomes more actual in the cases of sudden death from different diseases especially cardiac, brain and liver origin, mechanical injuries, mechanical asphyxia etc. METHOD: This study aims to show that blood concentration of alcohol must not be only criteria during assessment of severity of intoxications and their influence on patogenesis. Epidemiological screening of 320 <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> assesses the role of sex, age, ethnicity and other peculiarities. RESULTS: Special histochemical investigations of ethanol oxidizing enzymes were also conducted on materials taken from 167 autopsies.

40|$|Abstract: When {{they take}} {{legal action against}} their employers, sufferers of an alleged workplace-induced illness often undergo a bitter medico-legal battle, which can {{severely}} impact on their illness experience. Using ethnographic data collected in Western Australia, this paper draws upon several case-studies of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) and similar chemical injuries. In these cases, {{not only are the}} workers attempting to prove the existence of a condition that is shrouded in uncertainty, but the defence is trying equally hard to disprove it. Thus the collection of evidence both for and against the worker involves the production of <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> (half of which report the worker’s condition is psychosomatic); testimonies from friends and family regarding the worker’s decline in functioning; and surveillance from the defence who seek visual proof of malingering. Although sufferers of a contested illness like MCS enter the legal system for recognition, compensation and redress, the adversarial nature of the medico-legal battle can merely place them under more scrutiny from both the medical and legal professions and ultimately impede healing...|$|R

The reports relating these variations to a specific etiological factor are few. This study aims to describe the positions and lengths of vermiform appendix among Sudanese cadavers. Methods: This descriptive study {{was carried out in}} Omdurman Teaching Hospital Morgue and Omdurman Islamic University-Sudan. Sixty Sudanese cadavers (30 male and 30 female), were dissected in the period from June 2013 to June 2014. The positions and the lengths of vermiform appendix were measured in millimeters. The data was analyzed by SPSS version 20. Results: The cadavers’ age ranged between 20 to 80 years according to their <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports.</b> Retrocaecal position was mainly observed in 60 %, pelvic in 35 %, post-ileal in 3. 3 %, and pre-ileal in 1. 7 %. The lengths of the appendix was found 110 mm in 16. 7 %, also the study showed insignificant difference between the lengths and ages (p < 0. 08), and between males and females (p = 0. 23).

We performed a retrospective study of <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> in all the sexual assault cases reported in Tours (France) during a seven-year period. We defined two groups of victims: children under 15 years old and victims aged 15 years or more. Legal outcomes were obtained from courtroom proceed-ings. The relationship between the outcomes and the circumstances of the case was analyzed by logistic regression. We enrolled a total of 756 cases during the study period. The mean age of the study population was 16. 5 years and 68. 3 % of the cases involved children under 15 years old. In 57 % of these cases, the assailant was a family member. 31. 7 % of all the victims were aged 15 years or more. The assailant was an acquaintance of the victim in 62. 2 % of the cases. Drug-facilitated assault was suspected in 2. 9 % of the cases. In 46. 2 % of the cases, formal criminal charges were not filed due to insufficient evidence; 36. 3 % of the assailants were convicted.

40|$|The {{sexual abuse}} of a child or young person {{constitutes}} a major social and public health problem and there is recent evidence that intra-familial (IF) sexual abuses are more serious in their consequences than extra-familial (EF). However, there are no studies on this phenomenon in Portugal. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study is to contribute to a better characterization of these types of abuses and to identify possible differences between IF and EF cases. A retrospective study was preformed based on <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> related to victims below the age of 18, suspected of being sexually abused (n = 764), corresponding to 67 % of the total of observed sexual crimes. Results revealed that 34. 9 % of the abuses are IF and they show statistically significant differences when compared to EF cases. These are due to the following factors found in IF situations: a) lower victim age; b) closeness between victim and abuser; c) abusers with a higher rate of previous sexual abuse; d) sexual practices of reduced physical intrusion; e) decreased physical violence but increased emotional violence; f) greater delay between last abuse and the forensic exam; g) reduced number of injuries or biological evidence (none in the great majority of the cases). Results point out the existence of several characteristics in IF abuse that have been identified as factors that influence the severity of the abuse consequences. Among them are: a) lower victim age; b) greater proximity to the abuser; c) increased amount of emotional violence. These factors account for the reduced visibility of this kind of cases and therefore explain their delayed disclosure and diagnosis. The association of this fact with the reduced intrusiveness of this sort of practice and the consequent decrease in number of injuries and other evidence leads to a marked reduction of the number of cases where evidence of the abuse can be found by physical examination alone. The above aspects underlie the need of using different strategies to diagnose and support the victims, namely, systematic denouncement by professionals who suspect this type of abuses, and systematic forensic psychological examination for better valorization of the victim's testimony as well as the veracity of its content.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> regarding age estimation {{on the basis of}} oral cavities, but none on the relationship between alveolar process resorption and age. The author took 600 X-ray photos (males 300, females 300, aged 20 - 99 years) of each proximal alveolar process except for wisdom teeth. A straight line between the mesial cervical point and the distal cervical point, was made on each photograph. A line of falseness, parallel to the first line and the tooth root apex, was set up. The distance (A) from the cervical line (cement-enamel junction, CEJ), the distance (B) from the deepest point that the alveolar process is absorbing, to the tooth root apex from the falseness line was measured, and the index of the alveolar process resorption for each region was calculated by the following formula : Index of the alveolar process resorption = the deepest point of the alveolar process-root apex distance (B) × 100 /CEJ -root apex distance (A). There was a tendency for the index of the alveolar process resorption to decrease with increasing age, and {{it was found that the}} index and age were negatively correlative (coefficient of correlation r = - 0. 909 ～ - 0. 982, P＜ 0. 001) both in the anterior and posterior groups of both jaws. The following formulae were established : All teeth examined group, Y = - 1. 84 X + 19194 (± 4. 06 years); Upper anterior teeth group, Y = - 2. 17 X + 222. 89 (± 4. 03 years); Upper molar teeth group, Y = - 1. 82 X + 188. 41 (± 4. 56 years); Lower anterior teeth group, Y= - 1. 60 X + 173. 49 (± 3. 48 years); Upper molar teeth group, Y= - 1. 77 X + 182. 95 (± 4. 11 years) where Y = estimated age, and X = the average of the indicies of alveolar process resorption in each group. The age estimation equations showed accuracies of 82. 9 % or more for the age range of ± 5 years, and 99. 1 % for ± 7 years in the all teeth examined group.

40|$|Introduction: In medico-legal {{evaluation}} of trauma patients, the bio-psychological {{effects of the}} trauma and {{the severity of the}} injuries require to be evaluated. In this study, assuming the fact that psychiatric assessment are not taken into consideration in physical trauma cases, we have planned to bring up the presence of psychological trauma in our medico-legally evaluated patients due to different types of traumas and review the mental findings and diagnoses in trauma victims. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the hospital records of 1975 patients aged 18 years or older who presented to the Department of Forensic Medicine at Dokuz Eylul University School of Medicine for medico-legal evaluation between 1999 and 2009. Psychiatric assessment was performed in 142 patients by Consultation and Liaison Psychiatry Section of the university hospital. Data contained in <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> and patient records were then examined with respect to patients’ age, gender, nature of traumatic events, psychiatric diagnoses, descriptive characteristics of patients, severity of trauma, and past history of mental disorder and trauma experience. Results of the medico-legal evaluations were also analyzed. Results: Of the 142 patients, 80 (56. 3 %) were female and their average age was 40. 30 ± 17. 17 years. The most frequent traumatic events were traffic accidents (29. 6 %) and violence-related blunt force trauma (28. 9 %). The distribution of foremost psychiatric diagnoses were anxiety disorders in 69 cases (48. 6 %), adjustment disorders in 16 cases (11. 3 %) and mood disorders in 12 cases (8. 5 %). Among anxiety disorders, acute stress disorder (n= 39) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (n= 27) were the most accounted ones. In 27 cases of the 142, it was determined that, psychiatric symptoms and findings did not cover the diagnostic criteria. Being diagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder did not significantly associated with traumatic experiences, comorbidity, marriage status, education level, and lack of health insurance. Conclusion: We assume that, the presence of a psychological trauma is crucial to be introduced not only for the health benefit but also for legal rights of the patient. The necessity of considering merely the international diagnostic criteria in determining the existence of psychiatric trauma and its severity level can bring forth some difficulties in medico-legal evaluation.

40|$|Patient safety {{has only}} {{recently}} been subjected to wide-spread systematic study. Healthcare differs from other high risk industries in being more diverse and multi-contextual, and less certain and regulated. Also many patient safety problems are low-frequency events associated with many, varied contributing factors. The subject {{of this paper is}} the epistemology of patient safety (the science of the method of finding out about patient safety). Patient safety research is considered here on the background of a risk management framework which requires researchers to: •  Understand the context - as a subset of healthcare quality, services and systems research, with technical and human behavioural (cultural) components and a range of external and internal organisational influences, a wide range of research disciplines is necessary •  Identify the risks - identify the things that go wrong and the frequency and nature of different types of incidents from sources such as medical record review, observational studies, audit, incident and <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> •  Analyse the risks - deconstruct the things that go wrong, identifying contributing factors and trying to detect trends and patterns in contributing factors, detection, mitigation factors, ameliorating factors and actions taken to reduce risk •  Evaluate the risks - decide on priorities, identifying preventive and corrective strategies and judging the risk- and cost-benefit of potential corrective strategies such as standardisation or simplification of a process or device •  Manage the risk - evaluate and scope preventive and/or corrective strategies and then implement these, or place the problem on a risk register pending solution, or accept that what is needed is unaffordable •  Communicate and consult - use interactive sessions, audit, on-going feedback, reminders and patient mediated prompts •  Monitor and review the state of the problem - get baseline trends and patterns so that changes can be tracked and properly attributed to an intervention A hierarchy of levels of evidence has been proposed for clinical research and we argue that insufficient weighting has been given to lower ranked levels of research and to qualitative research, although critical interpretive synthesis is now gaining acceptance in mainstream thinking (e. g. by the Cochrane Collaboration). Fundamental challenges remain including how to grasp the elusive concept of patient safety, how to quantify, characterise and cost the problems, how to judge the extent to which harm can be attributed to errors, violations or system failures, how to identify contributing factors {{and the extent to which}} they can be implicated, how to judge whether incidents or their precursors are preventable, how to generate strong evidence to make healthcare safer and how to translate research into practice. Future directions include addressing the mundane as well as rare, dramatic events, and developing further research in non-hospital settings and in developing countries. In summary, a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, using information from all available data sources and combining retrospective, real time and prospective study designs, is necessary to address some of the more difficult patient safety problems.

Material and Methods There were 109 (90. 8 %) males aged 19 – 81 and 11 females aged 19 – 73. 18. 3 % were over 60 years of age. There were 6 children (boys) aged between 2 – 6. A retrospective review was undertaken of 16, 140 <b>medico-legal</b> autopsy <b>reports</b> by the Department of Forensic Medicine in Wroclaw between 1991 – 2011, which included 120 fatal farm-related incidents. The study protocol included gender, age, date and cause of death, all injuries found, circumstances and mechanism of death, place of death and blood alcohol concentration. Results The most common (33 / 120; 27. 5 %) causes of death, both in men and women, were traffic accidents, the second being hit, crushed or buried by materials and falling objects. The most common injury was multi-organ damage (27 / 120; 22. 5 %), less common were cranio-cerebral injury (17 / 120; 14. 2 %) and thoracic blunt trauma (11 / 120; 9. 2 %). In multi-organ and thoracic traumas the mechanism of death was almost always exsanguinations. 85. 3 % of victims died at the place found. 37. 2 % of victims were drunk. Conclusions In Poland, fatal injuries occurring in agriculture are mostly related to the misuse of transport and machinery. The main efforts to prevent accidents are engineering improvements, use of personal protective equipment, alcohol intake prevention and appropriate education of the workforce. Special prevention programmes should take gender and age differences into account...|$|R
40|$|Background: Determining the {{prevalence}} of alcohol intoxication {{and the level of}} intoxication in victims of fatal occupational accidents is necessary to improve work safety. The circumstances of the accident and the time between alcohol consumption and death are important factors. Material and Methods: A retrospective review of 18 935 <b>medico-legal</b> autopsy <b>reports</b> and toxicological reports performed in the Department of Forensic Medicine at the Wroclaw Medical University, Poland, in the years 1991 – 2014. The study protocol included circumstances, time and cause of death, injuries, quantitative testing for the presence of ethyl alcohol, gender and age. Results: There were 98 farm-related fatalities. There were 41. 8 % (N = 41) of victims who had been intoxicated – 95. 1 % (N = 39) of them were males aged 19 – 70 years old, 4, 9 % (N = 2) were females aged 37 – 65 years old. In 8 cases the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 50 – 150 mg/dl; in 15 cases it was 150 – 250 mg/dl and in 18 cases it was > 250 mg/dl. In 21 cases, the BAC was determined using alternative material and 76 % (N = 16) victims were in the alcohol elimination phase with 19 % (N = 4) victims in the alcohol absorption phase. The most common causes of death were traffic accidents, drowning and deaths resulting from being caught in or hit by moving parts of machinery or equipment. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption is a crucial risk factor in fatal agricultural accidents. In order to establish the time of alcohol consumption, all victims of agricultural accidents should be tested for alcohol concentration in their blood and urine or vitreous. Improving safety at work requires that the sobriety of employees should be monitored before and during work. Med Pr 2017; 68 (1) : 23 – 3...|$|R
40|$|All medico-legal {{cases of}} {{unexpected}} death during hospitalisation or accommodation in rest or nursing homes, which were investigated at the Department of Forensic Medicine during a 30 -year-period, have been reviewed. In {{the majority of}} cases, the fatal outcome was bedrail or restraint related, but falls out of bed or from a patient hoist lift can also trigger a death. As expected, the manner of death was mainly accidental. In about 70 % of cases, mechanical asphyxia (such as smothering and thoraco-abdominal compression) was substantiated as the mechanism of death. A substantial number of the patients had important medical antecedents, such as cognitive impairment due to cerebro-vascular accidents. In {{about half of the}} cases, human negligence was clearly related to the event whereas in only 15 % of cases was there a technical mistake. We believe that some sudden and unexpected fatalities, due to physical restraint or other devices (such as a patient hoist lift), are under-reported because of the <b>medico-legal</b> implications. However, <b>reporting</b> such events could induce better precautions and prevent recurrences. Therefore, this study may be important not only for forensic pathologists, but also for a larger group of social workers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 12 months, {{as an expert}} in {{pediatric}} laparoscopy and/or court-appointed technical consultant, I {{have been asked to}} give advice in five court actions: in 2 cases some pediatric surgeons had received a notification and in 3 cases a request for compensation for the complications that occurred during a pediatric laparoscopic operation. Starting from the investigation of those cases, we will make some useful observations as for medico-legal aspects of MIS in pediatric age, considering that there are few reports in literature on this topic. In all the 5 cases the surgeons were expert in pediatric laparoscopy. As concerns the prosecuted operations, in 2 cases the patients had been splenectomized in laparoscopy for splenomegaly of hematologic origin, in 1 case a patient had undergone orchidopexy due to intrabdominal testis, in 1 case a herniorraphy for groin hernia, and in another case a cholecystectomy due to idiopathic cholelithiasis. In all cases the surgeon was accused of performing the operation in laparoscopy instead of the required laparotomy. In particular, in all the cases there was the report made by the party’s surgeon—which had not been made by an expert in laparoscopic surgery—which underlined that the surgeon had run the further risk of operating the patient in laparoscopy and that anyway the operation would have been safer if performed in open surgery. Besides, the party’s <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reports</b> criticized the new laparoscopic devices used in some operations to produce hemostasis, such as the ultrasonic scalpel or the clips applicator, by assessing that those devices were not as reliable as the suture ligatures carried out in open surgery. Moreover, the patients’ parents said that they were not clearly informed by the surgeons, although all of them had signed the confirmed consent, and some parents said that itwas not the operating surgeon to show them the informed consent. From the technical point of view, in all cases we saw that the informed consents of the operations written by the surgeons were not very accurate as well as the description of the operation was too synthetic, summed up in few lines without the details necessary to defend the surgeon. Probably, considering the ever-increasing number of lawsuits for compensation against surgeons, it is crucially important that the operating surgeon should verbally inform the patient’s parents at least 24 hours before the operation and then make them sign the informed consent. The presence of a witness—who is going to sign the consensus too—on signing the consent can be an useful device to attest that the surgeon has given a correct and complete information to the patient’s parents. Of extreme importance are the attention and the greatest accuracy of the surgeon in giving {{a detailed description of the}} surgical operation in the registry of operations also in routine operations, such as inguinal hernia, impalpable testis, and cholecystectomy. In our opinion, the international scientific associations, such as the IPEG, APSA, andEUPSA, should define some guidelines on the treatment of single pathologies, which could be adopted by laparoscopic surgeons in their clinical practice. Some guidelines have been already published by few associations (e. g., IPEGguidelines) but they tackle only very fewoperations. In addition, it is important for the surgeon to refer to the international literature, and therefore, laparoscopic surgeons should publish also the case studies on the complications of the operations and not only on the successes or improvements in laparoscopic surgery. Surely the national associations can play an important role in defending prosecuted laparoscopic surgeons, as it has been done by the Italian Society of Videosurgery in Infancy, which constituted a medico-legal commission of experts in laparoscopy that gives free assistance to its members being prosecuted following a laparoscopic operation. We believe that court actions against laparoscopic surgeons will represent a crucial problemin laparoscopy in the following years, and only through the joint work of scientific associations and the minimally invasive surgeons groups it will be possible to reduce it, which is ever increasing almost in Italy. Indeed, if it is not reduced it will produce a great increase in the cost of the surgeons’ insurance policies, with further devastating impacts on the whole National Health Service...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Wenckebach second-degree (Mobitz I) A-V block in apparently normal persons still provides a puzzle for the cardiologist, as the benign {{nature of this}} event has been recently questioned. This problem becomes more intriguing when Wenckebach A-V block is encountered in asymptomatic top-ranking athletes, because of <b>medico-legal</b> implications. We <b>report</b> 10 cases of highly-trained athletes, including three with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) features, with a spontaneous or induced Wenckebach second-degree A-V block. Previous ECGs of six subjects, dating from a maximum of 6 years to a minimum of 18 months, were available. Deterioration of A-V conduction has never been documented and all six cases have remained asymptomatic for the whole follow-up period. Athletes have been submitted to a protocol study consisting of ECG recording at rest, during, and after vagal and sympathetic reflex maneuvers, drug administration (isoproterenol and atropine), submaximal and maximal exercise. Nine subjects have been considered to have "normal" responses of the A-V node to provocative tests, since conduction disturbances were improved or normalized by reflex sympathetic stimulations and were completely normalized by autonomic drug administration and exercise. One athlete showed "abnormal" responses to tests. In order to give a conclusive prognostic and medico-legal assessment, we advised him to submit to an invasive electrophysiological investigation. Wenckebach second-degree A-V block in athletes {{may be a more}} common finding than so far described, especially when a systematic search is made. In our opinion, this event can still be considered a vagally-induced benign feature of athlete's heart, provided that an immediate improvement of A-V conduction is obtained in response to reflex sympathetic maneuvers, and that a complete normalization after sympathomimetic and vagolytic drug administration and physical exercise is observed. The clinical histories of our athletes and the observed complete disappearance of conduction disturbances after detraining, strongly support this opinion. Wenckebach second-degree A-V block in asymptomatic athletes with MVP features probably does not affect the prognosis if similar favorable responses to the aforesaid tests are observed...|$|R
40|$|Forensic {{science is}} growing {{rapidly in the}} world today. During the past decade, medico-legal {{investigations}} have been highly expanded to include all areas of forensic science. The present study investigated three important aspects of forensic biology. First, this present project investigated, a total number of 5, 703 <b>reported</b> <b>medico-legal</b> cases diagnosed as un-natural deaths by The Forensic Department in Kuwait, during the year 2003 - 2009. The results show that accidental, homicidal and suicidal deaths accounted for 86 %, 8 % and 6 %, respectively. The results showed that most people who died of unnatural deaths were more predominant in the age group 20 - 29 years (third decade). Road Traffic Accidents accounted for 65 % of accidental deaths, and 4 % out of them were related to alcohol consumption. The results also illustrated that {{the highest rate of}} homicide in Kuwait was due to stab wound injuries (38 %) compared to the lower rate of homicidal pattern for infanticides (3 %). Similarly, the study showed that the most common method of suicide in Kuwait was death by hanging and this accounted for (60 %). This study further demonstrated the effectiveness of virtual autopsy technique as a new tool in forensic investigations to determine various un-natural death causes. A total of thirty (30) male forensic cadavers were employed in this project. The cases were RTA (11), firearm injuries (10), drowning (4), head injuries (3) and lastly strangulation (2). All these cases were compared to the findings of traditional autopsy. The results show similar findings for virtopsy compared to traditional autopsy. This study clearly revealed that virtopsy could be an effective alternative in certain situation, being noninvasive and rapid. The present project also investigated 28 samples of human blood, saliva or semen. The experiments were done at four different temperatures (55 °C, 37 °C, 24 °C and 4 °C) and four different humidity ranges (41 %, 55 %, 58 % and 61 %), respectively. The results showed that, DNA quantity in blood, saliva and semen samples remained {{more or less the same}} at temperatures of 4 °C, 24 °C and 37 °C compared to values for day one with all other days. In contrast, when the temperature was raised to 55 °C, the DNA started to degrade with time until it reached zero at day 12 for saliva and day 15 for blood, but not for semen. The results clearly show that DNA in saliva and blood samples is extremely sensitive to heat compared to semen. In conclusion, the study reveals the different causes of unnatural deaths, the value of virtual autopsy and the need for early DNA measurement in Kuwait...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInscription, instruction, sanction: The 'in-between' doing of a norm in {{the process}} of medical record {{computerization}} In this communication, we focus on the practical and agency of the norm rather than on the institutional dimensions by which it is usually studied. In doing so, we propose to question the norm's specificities that makes it a source of what Latour (1994, 2000) names the 'making-do' [le faire-faire]. As such, the norm is both the object of people's agency - what they act upon - and an agent that makes people act - what they deal with. The term of 'making-do' suggested by Latour underlines this dialectic dimension of agency. Following Souriau, we propose therefore to explore the 'in-between' of the doing of a norm, identifying the way it acts and the way people act under and possibly upon the norm. This communication is issued from a collective research program between two research teams, namely CERTOP - ECORSE in Toulouse, and ComSanté, in Montréal. The norm under study was enacted by the French National Healthcare Authority (Haute Autorité de Santé, hereafter HAS). This norm is nowadays the basis for the certification of French healthcare establishments, whose activities depend on this agreement. This communication is based on a longitudinal long-term case study, engaged in 2008, in a French hospital (and more specifically wards dedicated to oncology), involved {{in the process}} of computerization of medical records. Our observations began six months before the first implementation, that took place step by step, wards after wards, during nearly a year, with a follow up since then. For this paper, we will focus on an in-depth interview with a head nurse involved in the project team. This hour-and-a-half filmed interview has as main subject the evolution of clinical records, from the previous paper records and related practices to the current electronic ones, with demonstration and specific focus on main transformations all along the overall process of computerization. This process considered as a whole took place during more than ten years. Based on a discourse analysis, we have chosen to follow up the manifestation of one of the HAS' norms, that is the <b>medico-legal</b> <b>reporting.</b> With the computerization of medical records, the norm and its enactment have gained a renewed materiality that gives rise to an improved agency. To question this evolution, we rely on the notion of inscription as developed firstly in Science and Technology Studies, and mobilized thereafter in Organizational Studies (Akrich, 1992; Joerges & Czarniawska, 1998; Latour, 1993; Verbeek, 2006, Taylor & Van Every, 2000, 2011). We will focus more precisely on the forms of textualization of the norm that take place in the electronic medical records. The notion of inscription is useful here for analyzing the way the norm is textualized (or even more, in this case, instrumentalized) in the electronic medical records; this focus highlights the writing practices (who writes, when, where, how) involved in the medical record computerization as well as the authoring issues that the HAS' norm puts forward. The norm as textualized in/by the toolThe HAS advice specified in its certification handbook and followed up by the experts in charge of auditing provided the main arguments for medical record computerization. These arguments refer to an 'ideal' way of producing information, with great emphasis on a single registration of information, and on the continuity and control of data flows. According to this, the paperless wards and the computerization extended to the totality of the activities was seen as guarantying a good information treatment (Harper & al., 1997; Sellen & al., 2001). The medicolegal norm is put forward to legitimate the computerization, with a related argument concerning the potential legalization of the patient-practitioner relationship. A law published in France on March 2002 has strengthened the possibility for the patients to get access to their medical record. The patient is thus one of the quoted figures to legitimate the implementation of the electronic tool. The underlined quality of the tool is its capacity of strictly registering who wrote a specific information, who is the author and therefore the responsible for the medical act; so doing, the tool enables to decide who accounts for and who is accountable for. Because of the renewed materiality of the norm, of its inscription {{in the form of the}} computerized medical record, the norm's agency appears to be less visible, it seems more neutral, its origin is decontextualized, its authority is blurred. The apparently main agent is neither the norm nor the accreditation process, it is a supposed-to-be-neutral entity - that is to say, the technology - that is meant to treat the information efficiently and insure the accurate follow up of the patients. The enrolled norm is formally detached from its author; it is hidden behind the computerization process. Meanwhile, this norm gives form to the tool, setting up the framework of the dedicated software and databases, designed and operationalized according to the legal definition of employee territories and of tracking requirements. The related objective of the tool deals with being able to account for responsibilities through inscriptions. The incorporated norm prescribes the territories of agencies, their relations, and the people who are held responsible. So doing, it renews a traditional and legal hierarchy according to which the physicians are the writing masters. Writing practices and authoring issuesIn the hospital we studied, the computerization process is seen as an opportunity for the staff and the project team to select the authorized practices, to sustain the 'best' ones, and to bring back each employee to his/her authorized professional territory. Physicians are legally the exclusive authors of medical decisions. When implementing electronic medical records, the project team took this opportunity to specify who is authorized to write according to the type of documents and information that is required for the patient's follow-up. This writing practice in the electronic medical record strongly links an author/authority and a domain of information. Access codes and parameters play as filters to reallocate the roles and authorized practices to employees according to legal texts and registered protocols. In so doing, the link is strengthened between the norm, responsibility and potential sanction. The equipped norm helps specifying the practiced territories and related authorities. It aims at countering the inscriptions that were previously crossing the barriers, setting up forms of inter-relation and translation. Such translations and relations are set up to facilitate cure and care practices through the reconstruction of patient stories. However, part of these practices was infringing the legal rules. With the electronic tool, such practices are not possible anymore. This is more specifically the case of an element of the paper medical record that has been excluded from the electronic version. Conclusion: From authoring traces to de-authored texts [...] . a broken promise of the power of the norm?The computerization of medical record has been stated as a guarantee against gaps between legal authority and daily practices. It was supposed to supply a continuous tracking of activities in the case of potential sanction through identifying responsibilities. It was supposed to be a magic and powerful tool, capable to tell who does what, where and when. However, effective practices partly escape from this close-meshed net. The problem the tool was supposed to solve reoccurs somewhere else. Moreover, the main issue deals with sense making, with the meaning of the global text and its accuracy for care and cure. The produced text is made of a diversity of locally registered and signed writings. Taken as a whole, it can be seen as a de-authoredtext (Taylor & Van Every, 2011), the product of a collective writing (Callon, 2002), where authoring/authority is distributed and sometimes blurred in the mechanics of the computerization process. In the electronic tool design, a great concern as been devoted in identifying the local inscriptions and their authors. Yet the question of the overall sense making of the patient stories stays unanswered, as well as the plots discussed during the passing on (Boudes & al., 2005; Browning, 1992). With the focus dedicated to reallocating each employee in the limits of his legal territory, it seems that there is no possibility left to related stories, discussed plots, and translations. These plots and related stories give way to new forms of writing, which are non-authorized ones; they are also shared in conversations. Therefore, they escape from the tool and weaken the tracing project, the very reason for equipping the norm through a supposed to be omnipotent tool. Dans cette communication nous proposons d'appréhender la norme, non pas tant d'un point du vue institutionnel que du point de vue de l'action. Il s'agit alors de s'interroger sur les spécificités de la norme qui font d'elle une source de faire-faire (Latour, 1994) : ce sur quoi on agit mais qui en même temps nous fait agir. L'expression faire-faire comme le suggère Latour (2000) souligne le caractère dialectique de l'action redoublant les deux maîtrises, celle de la norme et celle de ceux qui la mobilisent. À l'instar de Souriau nous proposons ainsi d'explorer les entre-faire de la norme afin d'y déceler ce qu'elle fait et ce qui en est fait. Cette communication s'inscrit dans un programme de recherche associant deux équipes, l'une en France l'autre au Québec. La norme envisagée est celle qui est édictée en France par la Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), et qui sert désormais de base à la certification des établissements de soins. Au fil du temps, cette certification est passée du statut de démarche recommandée pour|$|R
