2500|$|The {{recovered}} NGL {{stream is}} sometimes processed through a fractionation train consisting of three distillation towers in series: a deethanizer, a depropanizer and a debutanizer. The overhead product from the deethanizer is ethane and the bottoms are fed to the depropanizer. The overhead product from the depropanizer is propane and the bottoms are fed to the debutanizer. The overhead product from the debutanizer {{is a mixture}} of normal and iso-butane, and the bottoms product is a C5+ mixture. The recovered streams of propane, butanes and C5+ may be [...] "sweetened" [...] in a Merox process unit to convert undesirable mercaptans into disulfides and, along with the recovered ethane, are the final NGL by-products from the gas processing plant. Currently, most cryogenic plants do not include fractionation for economic reasons, and the NGL stream is instead transported as a <b>mixed</b> <b>product</b> to standalone fractionation complexes located near refineries or chemical plants that use the components for feedstock. In case laying pipeline is not possible for geographical reason,or the distance between source and consumer exceed 3000km, natural gas is then transported by ship as LNG (liquefied natural gas) and again converted into its gaseous state {{in the vicinity of the}} consumer.|$|E
60|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is quite a}} distinct matter. Here, in all these cases, what is required is the detachment of two portions of the parental organisms, which portions we know as the egg and the spermatozoon. In plants it is the ovule and the pollen-grain, as in the flowering plants, or the ovule and the antherozooid, as in the flowerless. Among all forms of animal life, the spermatozoa proceed from the male sex, and the egg {{is the product of}} the female. Now, what is remarkable about this mode of {{reproduction is}} this, that the egg by itself, or the spermatozoa by themselves, are unable to assume the parental form; but if they be brought into contact with one another, the effect of the mixture of organic substances proceeding from two sources appears to confer an altogether new vigour to the <b>mixed</b> <b>product.</b> This process is brought about, as we all know, by the sexual intercourse of the two sexes, and is called the act of impregnation. The result of this act {{on the part of the}} male and female is, that the formation of a new being is set up in the ovule or egg; this ovule or egg soon begins to be divided and subdivided, and to be fashioned into various complex organisms, and eventually to develop into the form of one of its parents, as I explained in the first lecture. These are the processes by which the perpetuation of organic beings is secured. Why there should be the two modes--why this re-invigoration should be required on the part of the female element we do not know; but it is most assuredly the fact, and it is presumable, that, however long the process of asexual multiplication could be continued, I say there is good reason to believe that it would come to an end if a new commencement were not obtained by a conjunction of the two sexual elements.|$|E
30|$|The <b>mix</b> <b>product</b> {{is defined}} as the set of part types in a factory which can be {{produced}} and each factory looks for the best <b>mix</b> <b>product.</b> The <b>mix</b> <b>product</b> and value of demand for each <b>product</b> in the <b>mix</b> <b>product</b> due to customized products, shorter product life cycles, and unpredictable patterns of demand, are not known exactly at the time of designing the manufacturing cells. The composition of the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is determined by demand and is probabilistic in nature. Seifoddini (1990) proposed a stochastic CF model in which for each <b>mix</b> <b>product</b> a probability had been attributed. He calculated the expected intercellular material handling cost for each machine cell arrangement under all possible <b>product</b> <b>mixes.</b> Madhusudanan Pillai and Chandrasekharan (2010) evaluated the CF problem under probabilistic <b>product</b> <b>mix.</b> Each <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is specified with a scenario and to each scenario has been attributed probability of occurrence. They minimized inter-cell material handling. Jayakumar and Raju (2011) presented a mathematic model for the CF problem in which for each scenario probability of occurrence has been attributed. The objective function of this model is to minimize the total machine constant (investment) cost, the operating cost, the inter-cell material handling cost, and the intra-cell material handling cost for a particular <b>product</b> <b>mix.</b>|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, an {{operation}} is a calculation from zero or more input values (called operands) to an output value. The number of operands is the arity of the operation. The most commonly studied operations are binary operations of arity 2, such as addition and multiplication, and unary operations of arity 1, such as additive inverse and multiplicative inverse. An operation of arity zero, or 0-ary operation is a constant. The <b>mixed</b> <b>product</b> {{is an example}} of {{an operation}} of arity 3, or ternary operation. Generally, the arity is supposed to be finite, but infinitary operations are sometimes considered. In this context, the usual operations, of finite arity are also called finitary operations.|$|E

5000|$|The {{resignation}} of Kamaraj was {{a cause of}} deeply declining popularity of Congress all over India and especially in Madras State. Kamaraj sensed that DMK was rapidly gaining popularity {{in the state and}} coupled with his fear of the fall of Congress-governments in several other states of India as well as the center instigated many other Congress leaders to relinquish cabinet positions. At one point even Jawaharlal Nehru volunteered to resign to strengthen the party, but was advised not to, given the sensitivity of the issue.After Nehru's death the Indian National Congress had weakened nationally. More than half of the population by then were under age 35 and represented the post-Gandhian era. Nevertheless, the reasons for the resentment found within the Indian masses were more to do with everyday life rather than just the political turmoil. There were food shortages in several parts of the country, and the state of Bihar was close to a famine.After Kamaraj's resignation, the next Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, didn't have the charm of his predecessor.

Other spacing restrictions relate to <b>mixing</b> <b>products</b> with nearby television, air-traffic control, and two-way radio systems {{as well as other}} FM broadcast stations.

Advanced {{process control}} (APC) has been {{recognized}} as a proper tool for maximizing profitability of semiconductor manufacturing facilities by improving efficiency and product quality. Run-to-run (RtR) process control with good quality and reliable performance for APC applications are most applicable. Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is part of critical processing module in semiconductor manufacturing. This paper proposes a new RtR control scheme, modified double EWMA controller (m-dEWMA), which is adaptive to the <b>mixed</b> <b>product</b> CMP processes. The m-dEWMA controller combined thread dEWMA with the drift compensation scheme {{to deal with the}} drift and shift disturbances caused by tool and products, respectively. Comparing recently <b>mixed</b> <b>product</b> control schemes: threaded EWMA controller, JADE control and threaded prediction correction controller (threaded PCC), the simulation results show that the m-dEWMA has better control performance than other controllers.
