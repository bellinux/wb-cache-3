40|$|The 2 -Dimensional Finite Bin Packing Problem is a NP hard {{problem with}} it being {{observed}} {{in many of the}} process industries like woodcutting, textile manufacturing and steel industry. Here the scenario is a fiberglass <b>mesh</b> <b>manufacturing</b> industry, whose prime objective is to reduce material wastages due to cutting. We evaluate a few exact methods and a few heuristic techniques, which have been proposed to solve this problem. We further select Finite Best-Strip algorithm for implementation. We make modification to that technique to handle guillotine constraints. An after effect of this technique is observed in order tracking, which is reduced using k-way graph partitioning technique. The problem is tested for its performance by using datasets provided by the company. The results obtained are compared with the actual scenario. The experimental results show that this technique performs much better than the currently used technique and also a much better upper bound on the solution is observed when compared to previously known upper bounds for problems of these types. We also discuss on the future scope and enhancements possible for this technique to obtain better results...|$|E

The thickness and width were 0. 8 mm and 2. 7 mm, respectively. The composite wick structure {{is made of}} sintered copper foam-mesh wick (CFMW).

The thermal resistances of UTHPs increase gradually with the heat power before drying out. Too low or too high filling ratios will reduce the heat transfer efficiency of UTHPs by increasing the thermal resistances.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{three different}} antenna systems for mobile vehicle applications. The antennas are either patches or derivatives in all cases. The {{first is a}} dual-band telephone antenna with a low profile and wide bandwidth. Operating at 900 MHz and 1800 MHz, with a VSWR of better than 1 · 7, it is a hybrid construction combining a monopole with a top-loading patch shorted to the ground-plane. Extra-shorted pins provide the upper frequency band coverage. It provides monopole radiation characteristics and can be hidden under a plastic panel or mounted on the vehicle roof. The second is a microstrip patch antenna integrated into a laminated glass windscreen for a vehicle. It is fed using a coplanar waveguide feed printed on the innermost layer of the glass, avoiding {{the need for a}} contacting feed within the laminate. The patch and ground plane are <b>meshed</b> for <b>manufacturing</b> in the glass to avoid distorting the heat profile when the glass is shaped and laminated. The patch is easily fed from inside the vehicle and is potentially a very low cost design. The final antenna discussed is a dual-band patch antenna specifically designed for the Globalstar satellite telephone system at 1 · 6 GHz and 2 · 45 GHz. It also covers the Iridium band at 1 · 6 GHz.

40|$|Amongst other {{cardiovascular}} stent {{materials such}} as stainless steel, titanium, Ni-Ti shape memory alloys or polymers, magnesium stands out as a promising new option in terms of three essential features: biocompatibility, biodegradability, and good mechanical properties. Magnesium, as an element already present in the human body, is highly compatible to the body tissues; due to its relatively low corrosion resistance in human body fluids its degradation is intrinsic and as a metal it exhibits good mechanical properties {{in terms of strength}} and recoil properties. Overall, this combination of properties would result in a less intrusive treatment of cardiovascular pathologies. In addition to the medical aspects, Mg stents need to be studied in terms of design and manufacturability owing to the use of Mg as innovative material for the biomedical sector. This would involve the selection of the appropriate Mg alloy, the design of the adequate stent <b>mesh,</b> the <b>manufacturing</b> of the semi-finished tubular material and the reproduction of the stent mesh on it. This work reports the study of extrusion, laser micromachining and chemical etching of AZ 31 magnesium alloy for the manufacturing of cardiovascular stents with a novel mesh design. Primarily a new conceptive stents was investigated and a 3 D stent mesh was modelled with optimised mechanical properties in terms of scaffolding ability. Second, high-temperature properties and extrusion behaviour of AZ 31 alloy were studied by hot compression testing in the temperature range 350 - 450 °C. Hollow, small diameter tubes were then extruded from the same alloy according to the parameters defined by the hot-compression tests. At this point a pulsed fiber laser system operating in nanosecond pulse regime was employed for the micromachining phase. Finally, chemical etching was applied to remove spatter and complete the scrap separation from the stent geometry...|$|R

By {{the time a}} civilization is ready to use this technology, the carbon nanotube's manufacturing might be optimised {{enough for them to}} have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m2, and the average sail density with rigging might be kept to 0.3 g/m2 (a [...] "spin stabilized" [...] light sail requires minimal additional mass in rigging). If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density, a space habitat the size of the L5 Society's proposed O'Neill cylinder—500km2, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3 tons—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4 kg. For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind it is early stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.|$|R
40|$|Planetary gear {{noise and}} {{vibration}} are primary concerns in their applications in helicopters, automobiles, aircraft engines, heavy machinery and marine vehicles. Dynamic analysis {{is essential to the}} {{noise and vibration}} reduction. This work analytically investigates some critical issues and advances the understanding of planetary gear dynamics. A lumped-parameter model is built for the dynamic analysis of general planetary gears. The unique properties of the natural frequency spectra and vibration modes are rigorously characterized. These special structures apply for general planetary gears with cyclic symmetry and, in practically important case, systems with diametrically opposed planets. The special vibration properties are useful for subsequent research. Taking advantage of the derived modal properties, the natural frequency and vibration mode sensitivities to design parameters are investigated. The key parameters include mesh stiffnesses, support/bearing stiffnesses, component masses, moments of inertia, and operating speed. The eigen-sensitivities are expressed in simple, closed-form formulae associated with modal strain and kinetic energies. As disorders (e. g., <b>mesh</b> stiffness variation. <b>manufacturing</b> and assembling errors) disturb the cyclic symmetry of planetary gears, their effects on the free vibration properties are quantitatively examined. Well-defined veering rules are derived to identify dramatic changes of natural frequencies and vibration modes under parameter variations. The knowledge of free vibration properties, eigen-sensitivities, and veering rules provide important information to effectively tune the natural frequencies and optimize structural design to minimize noise and vibration. Parametric instabilities excited by mesh stiffness variations are analytically studied for multi-mesh gear systems. The discrepancies of previous studies on parametric instability of two-stage gear chains are clarified using perturbation and numerical methods. The operating conditions causing parametric instabilities are expressed in closed-form suitable for design guidance. Using the well-defined modal properties of planetary gears, the effects of mesh parameters on parametric instability are analytically identified. Simple formulae are obtained to suppress particular instabilities by adjusting contact ratios and mesh phasing...|$|R
40|$|The PhD thesis {{with the}} title “Investigation of several {{critical}} issues in screen <b>mesh</b> heat pipe <b>manufacturing</b> and operation” presented hereafter describes work carried out in four main areas. Initially the relevant literature is reviewed and presented, followed by the presentation of theoretical work regarding screen mesh heat pipe fill calculations, heat pipe processing and {{an investigation into the}} capillary or lifting height for screen mesh heat pipes. Further, the possibility of tailoring screen mesh heat pipes towards certain applications was investigated and it was found that further work is required in this area to allow a conclusive judgement whether a coarser or finer wick at the wall provides a distinguish advantage over two wraps of a medium coarse type. Within this approach a calculation method for the determination of the optimum working fluid fill of a screen mesh heat pipe based on geometrical parameters of the wick was developed and successfully implemented for the production of the later tested samples. The investigation into the effects of bending on the heat pipe performance, both using single phase flow CFD as well as experimentation, was performed using five different geometrical cases, each with five samples. These were tested in order to minimise the effects of sample variation. The test cases investigated contained the deformation angles of 0 ° (straight), 45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °. During all test cases the orientation of the samples was kept constant at 0 ° to minimise additional influences like the effects of gravity on the reduction of available power handling capability. The test results show in deviation from CFD results that screen mesh heat pipe performance is significantly affected when bends are introduced and the reduction in power handling capability can be up to nearly 50 % of a straight heat pipe value. Finally this thesis advances into the field of water heat pipe freeze thaw and the possibility of screen mesh heat pipes with changed shapes to withstand multiple freeze thaw cycles. It was found that correctly engineered screen mesh copper water heat pipes can be used in applications where they are subjected to multiple freeze thaw cycles. The fluid charge for water heat pipes subjected to these conditions needs to be adjusted in such a way, that accumulation of working fluid in certain areas, regardless of orientation or process variation during filling, is avoided.

40|$|Layered {{manufacturing}} plays {{important role}} in industry. Conventional pro-cess planning takes polygon soup as input and has high quality requirements on these polygonal model such as no self-intersection, no degenerate polygon et al. A growing number of models, especially for those in complex shape are acquired from reverse engineering. Implicit representation always serves as intermediate representation and ¯nally need to be tesselated into polygonal <b>mesh</b> for layered <b>manufacturing</b> applications. However, the present tessellation techniques have difficulties to provide topologically faithful and self-intersection free polygonal mesh from implicit model. On the other hand, implicit representation are mathematically compact and robust, which is important for presenting complex freeform models. I develop a robust and efficient approach to directly slicing implicit solids. Different from prior slicing techniques that reconstruct contours on the slicing plane by tracing the topology of intersected line segments, which is actually not robust, I generate contours through a topology guaranteed contour extraction on binary images sampled from given solids and a subsequent contour simplification algorithm which has the topology preserved and the geometric error controlled. The resultant contours are free of self-intersection, topologically faithful to the given r-regular solids and with shape error bounded; therefore, correct objects can be fabricated from them by layered manufacturing. Moreover, since I {{do not need to}} generate the tessellated B-rep of given solids, my direct slicing approach is memory efficient - only the binary image and the finest contours on one particular slicing plane need to be stored in-core. My method is general and can be applied to any implicit representations of solids. Moreover, I also investigate techniques for support generation for layered manufacturing in image space. Region subtraction is a crucial operation for support generation. I develop a robust and reliable region subtraction method on implicit solid slicing. Compared with the conventional approach in which support regioncontours are produced from part slicing contours by polygonal operations, my approach calculates reasonable support region on binary image for each layer. I investigate a conservative growing-swallow technique to remove as much as possible the support material for self-support region while still guarantee the safety of building process. My region subtraction can serve as core technique for many layered manufacturing processes. In my research, I demonstrate region subtraction technique in both Fused Decomposition Modeling(FDM) and Stereolithography(SLA). A region cleaning technique which can reduce topology complexity of calculated support structure region is developed to fulfil specific requirement of FDM. With all the operations involved being discrete on binary image, my approach is more robust compared with the polygonal operations which are based on numerical computation. Moreover, processing on binary image makes my approach highly parallelizable. My self-intersection free contour extraction technique used in direct slicing can also be adopted to extract support structure contour on binary image if necessary. Huang, Pu. "October 2012.
