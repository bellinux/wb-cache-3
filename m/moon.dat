5|$|Titan is {{the sixth}} {{ellipsoidal}} <b>moon</b> from Saturn. Frequently {{described as a}} planet-like <b>moon,</b> Titan is 50% larger than Earth's <b>Moon,</b> and it is 80% more massive. It is the second-largest <b>moon</b> in the Solar System, after Jupiter's <b>moon</b> Ganymede, and {{is larger than the}} smallest planet, Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known <b>moon</b> of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's <b>Moon</b> and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the <b>Moon</b> from Earth.|$|E
5|$|A 5,000-year-old rock carving at Knowth, Ireland, may {{represent}} the <b>Moon,</b> {{which would be the}} earliest depiction discovered. The contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria creates the patterns seen by different cultures as the Man in the <b>Moon,</b> the rabbit and the buffalo, among others. In many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the <b>Moon</b> was personified as a deity or other supernatural phenomenon, and astrological views of the <b>Moon</b> continue to be propagated today.|$|E
5|$|A Walmart {{exclusive}} {{edition of}} Transformers: Dark of the <b>Moon</b> also {{was released on}} September 30, 2011. The PAL DVD and Blu-ray Discs of Transformers: Dark of the <b>Moon</b> was released on November 28, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Uranus has 27 named <b>moons,</b> five {{of which}} are massive enough to have {{achieved}} hydrostatic equilibrium. There are another 13 inner <b>moons</b> that orbit within Uranus's ring system, and another nine outer irregular <b>moons.</b> Unlike most planetary <b>moons,</b> which are named from antiquity, all the <b>moons</b> of Uranus are named after characters from the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope's work The Rape of the Lock.|$|R
5|$|Twenty-four of Saturn's <b>moons</b> are regular satellites; {{they have}} {{prograde}} orbits not greatly inclined to Saturn's equatorial plane. They include the seven major satellites, four small <b>moons</b> {{that exist in}} a trojan orbit with larger <b>moons,</b> two mutually co-orbital <b>moons</b> and two <b>moons</b> that act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring. Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular <b>moons</b> orbit near {{the outer edge of}} the A Ring, within G Ring and between the major <b>moons</b> Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{asteroid}} <b>moons,</b> {{such as the}} <b>moons</b> of 87 Sylvia.|$|R
5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric <b>moon</b> {{dust cloud}} exists around the <b>Moon,</b> created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting <b>moon</b> dust above the <b>Moon.</b> The dust stays above the <b>Moon</b> approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the <b>Moon,</b> rising to 100 kilometers above the surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers above the surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer <b>moon</b> dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and <b>Moon,</b> pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the <b>Moon</b> passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the <b>Moon</b> fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new <b>moon</b> when the Sun and the <b>Moon</b> are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the <b>Moon.</b> In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|After Apollo 12 {{placed the}} second of several seismometers on the <b>Moon,</b> the S-IVBs on {{subsequent}} missions were deliberately crashed on the <b>Moon</b> instead of being sent to solar orbit, as an active seismic experiment to induce vibrations in the <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jupiter has 69 <b>moons</b> {{with known}} orbits, of which 60 have {{confirmed}} orbits and have thus received permanent designations; of these, 51 have been named. Its eight regular <b>moons</b> are grouped into the planet-sized Galilean <b>moons</b> {{and the far}} smaller Amalthea group. They are named after lovers of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter. Its 61 known irregular <b>moons</b> are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and two others in groups of one. The retrograde <b>moons</b> are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups, {{as well as some}} isolated <b>moons.</b>|$|R
500|$|No {{additional}} <b>moons</b> {{were discovered}} {{for two decades}} but, between October 1999 and February 2003, researchers found and later named another 34 <b>moons</b> using sensitive ground-based detectors. These are tiny <b>moons,</b> in long, eccentric, generally retrograde orbits, and averaging [...] in diameter, with the largest being just [...] across. All of these <b>moons</b> {{are thought to have}} been captured asteroidal or perhaps comet bodies, possibly fragmented into several pieces; but very little is known about them. Since 2003, 18 additional <b>moons</b> have been discovered but not yet named, bringing the total number of known <b>moons</b> of Jupiter to 69. As of 2017, this is the most of any planet in the Solar System; but additional undiscovered, tiny <b>moons</b> may exist.|$|R
50|$|Alexandrian covens meet on new <b>moons,</b> full <b>moons</b> {{and during}} Sabbat festivals.|$|R
5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and <b>Moon</b> are exactly {{in line with the}} Earth, but the {{apparent}} size of the <b>Moon</b> is smaller than that of the Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|An older {{technique}} to quantify migration involves observing {{the face of}} the <b>moon</b> towards full <b>moon</b> and counting the silhouettes of flocks of birds as they fly at night.|$|E
5|$|Anthony <b>Moon</b> is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC soap opera EastEnders, played by Matt Lapinskas. He was introduced on 25 July 2011 {{as an extension}} to the <b>Moon</b> family. The son of Eddie <b>Moon</b> (David Essex), half brother of Michael <b>Moon</b> (Steve John Shepherd) and brother of Tyler <b>Moon</b> (Tony Discipline), his storylines {{have focused on the}} friendship between him and Tyler, and his relationships with Poppy Meadow (Rachel Bright), Jodie Gold (Kylie Babbington), Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas) and Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks).|$|E
5000|$|Four of Jupiter's <b>moons</b> (the Galilean <b>moons)</b> {{are readily}} visible from Earth.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge gained of the 17 Saturn <b>moons</b> with {{observations}} by the Voyager spacecraft are reviewed. Titan {{was found}} to have the only atmosphere, which is opaque and precludes geologic inferences. Synchronous rotation is experienced by the 14 inner <b>moons,</b> with a constant inner face turned toward the planet. Phoebe is too far away from the planet to lose its spin to planetary tidal forces, and has an orbit inclined 150 deg from the equatorial plane, while Iapetus is inclined 14. 7 deg in its orbit. The abundance of ice on the <b>moons</b> is accepted as evidence of condensation formation of the <b>moons</b> at very low temperatures. Newly discovered <b>moons</b> of Saturn, including both the shepherd <b>moons,</b> which are suspected to maintain the rings in place, and the <b>moons</b> discovered by earth-based astronomy, are discussed. Finally, photographs of all the <b>moons</b> are examined for definitive details...|$|R
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} <b>moons,</b> which orbit it at a distance much greater than that of Oberon, the furthest of the large <b>moons.</b> All the irregular <b>moons</b> are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular <b>moons</b> discovered so far. The <b>moons</b> above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|R
5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new <b>moon.</b> For an eclipse to occur, the <b>Moon</b> must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the <b>Moon,</b> and of the <b>Moon</b> by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the <b>Moon</b> is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and <b>Moon,</b> but only when the <b>Moon</b> is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the <b>Moon</b> crossed it.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the <b>moon</b> in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the <b>moon.</b> Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure that all the characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the <b>moon.</b> Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted <b>moon,</b> as a source for lighting.|$|E
25|$|There are 22 Mars-crossing asteroids with <b>moons</b> with a {{total of}} 23 <b>moons.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ganymede is {{the largest}} and most massive <b>moon</b> in the Solar System. Its {{diameter}} of 5,268km is 0.41 times that of Earth, 2% larger than that of Saturn's Titan (the second-largest <b>moon),</b> 1.08 times Mercury's, 1.09 times Callisto's, 1.45 times Io's and 1.51 times the Moon's. Its mass is 10% greater than Titan's, 38% greater than Callisto's, 66% greater than Io's and 2.02 times that of the <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, <b>Moon,</b> and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the <b>Moon</b> and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the <b>Moon,</b> and that a solar eclipse occurred when the <b>Moon</b> obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|Hergé had {{developed}} {{the idea of}} setting an Adventure of Tintin on the <b>moon</b> while producing Prisoners of the Sun. He began serialisation of Destination <b>Moon,</b> {{the first of a}} two part arc followed by Explorers on the <b>Moon,</b> in Tintin magazine in March 1950. In September 1950, Hergé broke off the story, feeling the need for a break from work, having fallen back into clinical depression. He and Germaine went on holiday to Gland before returning to Brussels in late September. Many readers sent letters to Tintin asking why Explorers on the <b>Moon</b> was no longer being serialised, with a rumour emerging that Hergé had died. Explorers of the <b>Moon</b> would resume after an eighteen month hiatus, returning in April 1952.|$|E
50|$|There are 81 Trans-Neptunian {{objects with}} <b>moons,</b> {{with a total}} of 87 <b>moons.</b>|$|R
5|$|There are 69 known <b>moons</b> of Jupiter. This gives Jupiter {{the largest}} number of <b>moons</b> with {{reasonably}} stable orbits of any planet in the Solar System. The most massive of the <b>moons</b> are the four Galilean <b>moons,</b> which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. From the end of the 19th century, dozens of much smaller Jovian <b>moons</b> have been discovered and have received the names of lovers or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean <b>moons</b> are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 65 <b>moons</b> and its rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.|$|R
5|$|As of October 2009, 190 {{asteroid}} <b>moons</b> and 63 trans-Neptunian <b>moons</b> {{had been}} discovered.|$|R
5|$|In 2004, Belgian Post {{celebrated its}} own seventy-fifth anniversary, {{as well as}} the fiftieth anniversary of the {{publication}} of Explorers on the <b>Moon,</b> and the thirty-fifth anniversary of the <b>moon</b> landings with a souvenir sheet of five stamps based upon the Explorers on the <b>Moon</b> adventure.|$|E
5|$|In Proto-Indo-European religion, the <b>moon</b> was personified as {{the male}} god *Meh1not. The ancient Sumerians {{believed}} that the <b>moon</b> was the god Nanna, who {{was the father of}} Inanna, the goddess of the planet Venus, and Utu, the god of the sun. Nanna was later known as Sîn, and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery. In Greco-Roman mythology, the Sun and the <b>Moon</b> are represented as male and female, respectively (Helios/Sol and Selene/Luna); this is a development unique to the eastern Mediterranean and traces of an earlier male <b>moon</b> god in the Greek tradition are preserved in the figure of Menelaus.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 interview, Armstrong {{explained}} that NASA limited his <b>Moon</b> walk {{to two hours}} because they were unsure how the spacesuits would handle the extreme temperature of the <b>Moon.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Moons</b> are classed in two {{separate}} categories according to their orbits: regular <b>moons,</b> which have prograde orbits (they orbit {{in the direction of}} their planets' rotation) and lie close to the plane of their equators, and irregular <b>moons,</b> whose orbits can be pro- or retrograde (against the direction of their planets' rotation) and often lie at extreme angles to their planets' equators. Irregular <b>moons</b> are probably minor planets that have been captured from surrounding space. Most irregular <b>moons</b> are less than [...] in diameter.|$|R
