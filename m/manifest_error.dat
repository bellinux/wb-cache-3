2500|$|To make a text {{available}} {{representative of}} the earliest copies of the Vulgate and summarize the most common variants between the various manuscripts, Anglican scholars at the University of Oxford began to edit the New Testament in 1878 (completed in 1954), while the Benedictines of Rome began an edition of the Old Testament in 1907 (completed in 1995). Their findings were condensed into an edition of both the Old and New Testaments first published at Stuttgart in 1969, created with the participation of members from both projects. These books are the standard editions of the Vulgate used by scholars. [...] From the original Oxford Vulgate, the editors of these critical editions adopted two major critical principles; firstly to present the text in sense lines [...] per cola et commata, with no other indications of punctuation; and secondly, to reconstruct the earliest text solely on the authority of primary manuscript witnesses dating from before the 11th century (a few later Bibles are selectively cited in the apparatus, but not used for the texts).

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the change in the <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> (ΔM), the change in apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> and changes in the apical corneal power or the maximum change in corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> and the change in apical corneal power, and the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> and the maximum change in corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, the change in apical corneal power underestimated the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, the maximum change in corneal power overestimated the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: The change in apical corneal power underestimates the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> in ortho-K, whereas the maximum change in corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, the change in apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error.</b> Although the maximum change in corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> than the change in apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error,</b> as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter. Initial corneal asphericity measured by the Medmont E 300 corneal topographer has limited usage in predicting the change in <b>manifest</b> refractive <b>error</b> in overnight ortho-K.

6000|$|This {{fruit is}} {{remarkable}} {{on account of}} the number of species which have been cultivated, and from their rapid improvement within the last fifty or sixty years. Let any one compare the fruit of one of the largest varieties exhibited at our Shows with that of the wild wood strawberry, or, which will be a fairer comparison, with the somewhat larger fruit of the wild American Virginian Strawberry, and he will see what prodigies horticulture has effected. (10/100. Most of the largest cultivated strawberries are the descendants of F. grandiflora or chiloensis, and I have seen no account of these forms in their wild state. Methuen's Scarlet (Downing 'Fruits' page 527) has [...] "immense fruit of the largest size," [...] and belongs to the section descended from F. virginiana; and the fruit of this species, as I hear from Prof. A. Gray, is only a little larger than that of F. vesca, or our common wood-strawberry.) The number of varieties has likewise increased in a surprisingly rapid manner. Only three kinds were known in France, in 1746, where this fruit was early cultivated. In 1766 five species had been introduced, the same which are now cultivated, but only five varieties of Fragaria vesca, with some sub-varieties, had been produced. At the present day the varieties of the several species are almost innumerable. The species consist of, firstly, the wood or Alpine cultivated strawberries, descended from F. vesca, a native of Europe and of North America. There are eight wild European varieties, as ranked by Duchesne, of F. vesca, but several of these are considered species by some botanists. Secondly, the green strawberries, descended from the European F. collina, and little cultivated in England. Thirdly, the Hautbois, from the European F. elatior. Fourthly, the Scarlets, descended from F. virginiana, a native of the whole breadth of North America. Fifthly, the Chili, descended from F. chiloensis, an inhabitant of the west coast of the temperate parts both of North and South America. Lastly, the pines or Carolinas (including the old Blacks), which have been ranked by most authors under the name of F. grandiflora as a distinct species, said to inhabit Surinam; but this is a <b>manifest</b> <b>error.</b> This form is considered by the highest authority, M. Gay, to be merely a strongly marked race of F. chiloensis. (10/101. 'Le Fraisier' par le Comte L. de Lambertye 1864 page 50.) These five or six forms have been ranked by most botanists as specifically distinct; but this may be doubted, for Andrew Knight (10/102. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 1820 page 207.) who raised no less than 400 crossed strawberries, asserts that the F. virginiana, chiloensis and grandiflora [...] "may be made to breed together indiscriminately," [...] and he found, in accordance with the principle of analogous variation, [...] "that similar varieties could be obtained from the seeds of any one of them." ...|$|E

40|$|An {{error that}} occurs in a {{microkernel}} operating system service can potentially result in state corruption and service failure. A simple restart of the failed service {{is not always the}} best solution for reliability. Blindly restarting a service which maintains client-related state such as session information results in the loss of this state and affects all clients that were using the service. CuriOS represents a novel OS design that uses lightweight distribution, isolation and persistence of OS service state to mitigate the problem of state loss during a restart. The design also significantly reduces error propagation within client-related state maintained by an OS service. This is achieved by encapsulating services in separate protection domains and granting access to client-related state only when required for request processing. Fault injection experiments show {{that it is possible to}} recover from between 87 % and 100 % of <b>manifested</b> <b>errors</b> in OS services such as the file system, network, timer and scheduler while maintaining low performance overheads. ...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{a random}} sample of ballots to conduct a risk-limiting audit {{generally}} requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups, for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be missing from the manifest, {{it is not necessary to}} make worst-case assumptions about those ballots [...] for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of missing ballots [...] to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them automatically become more conservative if the ballot <b>manifest</b> has <b>errors.</b> The modification [...] phantoms to evil zombies (~ 2 EZ) [...] requires only an upper bound on the total number of ballots cast. ~ 2 EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the <b>manifest</b> <b>errors.</b> This ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit. On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~ 2 EZ has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk limit...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} new {{understanding}} of Article 106 (2) TFEU using composite legal and economic interrogative frameworks. Article 106 (2) provides that under specified conditions, any Treaty rule may be disapplied with respect to services of general economic interest (‘SGEIs’). The underlying research tests two principal claims concerning Article 106 (2). The first is that it is the central Treaty provision for reconciling EU and Member State interests concerning SGEIs, and the second, {{is that it is a}} strict exception. The purely legal component of the analysis comprises internal and external accounts of Article 106 (2). The former concerns its operation on a standalone basis, with the latter dissecting its interaction with other TFEU derogation mechanisms. The internal analysis reveals the seeming volatility of the <b>manifest</b> <b>error</b> standard and considers the effects of enduring difficulties concerning proportionality review. The external account discloses the ubiquitous contingency of Article 106 (2), resulting in it being side-lined in a variety of ways. In overall terms, Article 106 (2) is shown not to be the central Treaty mediating mechanism for SGEIs that it may be capable of being. The combined legal and economic component of the thesis is based on deploying the theory of market failure and its analogue, government failure, in order to test whether Article 106 (2) is a strict exception. Market failure is used to assess SGEI verification. Government failure is used to assess the disapplication of other Treaty provisions under Article 106 (2). The market failure analysis reveals that <b>manifest</b> <b>error</b> control is strict for efficiency related market failures, for EU circumscribed distributional objectives, and occasionally, elsewhere. The government failure analysis discloses significant but avoidable weaknesses in disapplication review, but with pronounced change over time, including a relative recent partial revival of its strictness following Altmark. In the aggregate, the combination of legal and economic analysis shows Article 106 (2) not to be a strict exception, except in limited circumstances. In the light of the findings on centrality and strictness, proposals for the reorientation of Article 106 (2) are made...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{many decades}} of research, the {{management}} of errors in a live operating system remains a challenging problem. This thesis presents CuriOS, an operating system that incorporates several new error management techniques that significantly improve reliability. Errors detected by both hardware and software are signaled using language exception handling mechanisms. Unhandled exceptions do not crash the operating system and are dispatched to recovery routines. The architecture of CuriOS is influenced by microkernel design principles. Individual operating system services are assigned separate protection domains. This componentization provided by traditional microkernel designs helps confine errors. However, an error that occurs in a microkernel operating system service can potentially result in state corruption and service failure. A simple restart of the failed service {{is not always the}} best solution for reliability. Blindly restarting a service which maintains client-related state such as session information results in the loss of this state and affects all clients that were using the service.
