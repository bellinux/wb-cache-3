40|$|Effect of heat {{treatment}} on the microstructure and hardness of 9 Cr 13 Mo 3 Co 3 Nb 2 V steel was studied systematically by metallographic examination and hardness testing. The {{results show that}} after quenching, cryogenic treatment and <b>multiple</b> <b>tempering,</b> the retained austenite of 9 Cr 13 Mo 3 Co 3 Nb 2 V steel is adequately transformed into tempered martensite, and the significant secondary hardening effect is brought. Consequently the steel gains stable microstructure and high hardness. Secondary carbide begins to precipitate and the secondary hardening effect emerges when the tempering temperature is above 350 ℃, and the tempering hardness reaches the maximum value when tempering temperature range is from 480 ℃ to 520 ℃...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe heat {{treatment}} applied to {{high speed steel}} is in large measure dictated by the necessity of decreasing the residual austenite content. After hardening, {{a large amount of}} residual austenite it is found in the structure; this is unwanted because it is less hard than practical necessities and also unstable in time. As a result, the {{heat treatment}} has the purpose to conferee to tools mechanical properties that are required in exploitation, and in the same time, stable from structural point of view and of mechanical characteristics. In this purpose there are known several processes, as for example <b>multiple</b> <b>tempering</b> and treatment below zero degrees. In this paper, it is proposed the analysis of residual austenite from 1. 3343 high steel speeds subject to multiple heat treatment operations, by determining after each, the quantity of residual austenite; this was made with X ray diffraction using a software package program. Research has revealed the decrease of residual austenite content with the number of tempering {{as well as with the}} treatment below zero degrees...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) of hard {{coatings}} onto steels requires thorough controlling of dimensions and hardness. Dimensional and hardness problems {{depend on the}} metallurgical properties of the base and the heat treatments which are applied to the steel before and at the application of CVD. Some information on {{the control of the}} dimensions and the hardness of high-carbon high-chromium tool steels which have to be coated with hard compounds by CVD at high temperatures (HTCVD) was already presented some years ago (1). The paper which is now proposed will deal with some dimensional and hardness problems which are connected to the production of {{hard coatings}} on tool steels by means of CVD at medium temperatures (MTCVD). Such processes are usually applied to tools which have been already heattreated (at least quenched and tempered) and finally worked (ground and polished). Thus MTCVD involves an additional heat treatment (tempering) and may provoke metallurgical reactions in the base which cause changes in dimensions and hardness. Starting with some components in the microstructure of steels and their specific volumes, an introduction into the dimensional changes of steels due to hardening, tempering and subcooling will be presented. The dimensional stability of steels depends predominantly on the retained austenite and the degree of supersaturation with alloying elements. The hardness of high-carbon high-chromium tool steels will be discussed by means of spatial diagramms which show the hardness HV 30 as a function of austenitizing temperature Ta and tempering temperature Tt at constant tempering time tt, and also as a function of Ta and tt at constant Tt. The influence of <b>multiple</b> <b>tempering</b> will be discussed with respect to the application of MTCVD...|$|E
40|$|K-anonymity is {{a simple}} yet {{practical}} mechanism to protect privacy against attacks of re-identifying individuals by joining multiple public data sources. All existing methods achieving k-anonymity assume implicitly that the data objects to be anonymized are given once and fixed. However, in many applications, the real world data sources are dynamic. In this paper, we investigate the problem of maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates, and propose a simple yet effective solution. We analyze how inferences from <b>multiple</b> releases may <b>temper</b> the k-anonymity of data, and propose the monotonic incremental anonymization property. The general idea is to progressively and consistently reduce the generalization granularity as incremental updates arrive. Our new approach guarantees the kanonymity on each release, and also on the inferred table using multiple releases. At the same time, our new approach utilizes the more and more accumulated data to reduce the information loss. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, laser {{hardening}} is {{a sufficiently}} mature process to be industrially applied {{as a substitute}} for traditional heat treatments that are more expensive and less flexible. The bottleneck of the process is the difficulty in pre-determining the proper laser parameters able to produce the desired hardness depth and profile into the work-piece without trial and error tests which are very time consuming. To overcome this limitation and to increase the diffusion of laser hardening in industry, a low time consuming but accurate model of the laser hardening process is presented in this paper. The process simulation is able to determine the hardness depth in both single and <b>multiple</b> passes, considering <b>tempering</b> effects in the overlapping zones. The experimental procedure for the evaluation of thermo-dynamic parameters governing micro-structural transformations is also explained. The proposed process simulation can be used for two and three-dimensional analyses indistinctly and has been validated in the present work on an industrial benchmark (the surface hardening of an AISI 9840 cam) ...|$|R

50|$|Treatments for the {{condition}} {{vary depending on}} its severity. The most immediate and effective treatment {{in the majority of}} cases is a surgical repair to close the fistula/s and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other. Although this is usually done through an incision between the ribs on right side of the baby, a technique using three small incisions (thoracoscopy) is being used at some centers. In a minority of cases, the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge. In some of these so-called long gap cases, though, an advanced surgical treatment developed by John Foker, MD, may be utilized to elongate and then join together the short esophageal segments. Using the Foker technique, surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together. The result is a normally functioning esophagus, virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed. Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat difficult to replicate by other surgeons and the need for <b>multiple</b> operations has <b>tempered</b> enthusiasm for this approach.|$|R
