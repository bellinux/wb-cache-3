During the late 1980s Starr helped Carey secure a record contract while she worked as Starr's backup singer.

According to Carey, the song [...] "reminds me of the fact that not long ago I was a teenage girl with nothing to my name but a demo tape, my voice, and <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> write songs. Brenda K. Starr treated me like a 'star' and gave me a shot." [...] Another song Carey and Stevie J co-produced was a cover of, [...] "Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)" [...] (1975) by Diana Ross. The latter song was the third non-original song on the album, and experienced a limited release throughout few countries in Europe. During a press release for the album, it was reported that an exclusive live version of [...] "Hero" [...] would be included. However, the idea fell through and was never released.|$|E

2500|$|From a humanism-psychotherapeutic {{point of}} view, the {{question}} of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as [...] "What is the meaning of my life?" [...] This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question. [...] For example, Viktor Frankl argues for [...] "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life.

2500|$|On December 17, 2013, Snowden {{wrote an}} open letter to the people of Brazil {{offering}} to assist the Brazilian government in investigating allegations of U.S. spying, and added that he continued to seek, and would require, asylum.

[...] Brazil had been in an uproar since Snowden revealed that the U.S. was spying on Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, her senior advisors, and Brazil's national oil company, Petrobras. Rousseff and officials of the Brazilian foreign ministry said in response that they could not consider asylum for Snowden because they had not received any formal request. A representative of the foreign ministry said that a fax requesting asylum had been sent to the Brazilian embassy in Moscow in July but it had not been signed and could not be authenticated. David Miranda, the Brazilian partner of Glenn Greenwald, launched an Internet petition urging the Brazilian president to consider offering Snowden asylum.|$|E
2500|$|Kasparov {{spoke out}} several times about Putin's antigay {{laws and the}} {{proposed}} Sochi Olympics boycott.

[...] Kasparov added that Putin's anti-gay law was [...] "only the most recent encroachment on the freedom of speech and association of Russia’s citizens," [...] which the international community had largely ignored. Instead of supporting a games boycott, which would [...] "unfairly punish athletes," [...] Kasparov called for athletes and others to [...] "transform Putin’s self-congratulatory pet project into a spotlight that exposes his authoritarian rule for the entire world to see." [...] In September, Kasparov expanded on his remarks, saying that [...] "forcing athletes to play a political role against their will is not fair" [...] and that politicians should not [...] "hide behind athletes." [...] Instead of boycotting Sochi, he suggested, politicians should refuse to attend the games and the public should [...] "put pressure on the sponsors and the media." [...] Coca-Cola, for example, could put [...] "a rainbow flag on each Coca-Cola can" [...] and NBC could [...] "do interviews with Russian gay activists or with Russian political activists." [...] Kasparov also emphasized that although he was [...] "still a Russian citizen," [...] he had [...] "good reason to be concerned about <b>my</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> leave Russia if I returned to Moscow." ...|$|E
