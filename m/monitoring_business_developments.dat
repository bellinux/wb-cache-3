40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve {{instructional}} system design at Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers by developing a best practice model for assessing client training needs. Two research questions were addressed: 1. Is self-directed learning an appropriate framework for instructional system design at Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers? 2. What are the components of a self-directed learning-based model for assessing the training needs of Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center clients in Small Business Management programs? The theoretical framework that guided the research was constructivism. METHODS: Data collection included: 1) reviews of self-directed learning, instructional system design, needs assessment and Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center literature; 2) preliminary interviews of Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers clients and instructors and university professors; 3) facilitation of a Delphi Method (using email); and 4) final interviews of the Delphi panelists. Analysis included qualitative and quantitative techniques. Findings included the compatibility of self-directed learning with Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center educational practices and Delphi panel consensus on 34 training needs assessment items. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The conclusions were: 1. Self-directed learning is an appropriate framework for instructional system design at Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers. 2. Knowles' Andragogical Process Model is an appropriate foundation upon which to design instructional systems for Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers. 3. A self-directed learning-based training needs assessment model that incorporates the components of Knowles' Andragogical Process Model serves the needs of clients enrolled in the Small Business Management program at Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers. 4. Self-directed learning-based instructional systems for graduate programs in business and adult education will prepare personnel qualified to improve Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center and other adult education programs. A model for assessing client training needs at Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Centers was developed from this study. The model illustrates the integration of self-directed learning with instructional design in Small Business Management programs. Recommendations were made for program development and further research. Self-directed learning-based instructional designs were recommended for Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center and adult education program developers. Research is needed to test the model and to conduct action research that includes Small <b>Business</b> <b>Development</b> Center instructors and clients and university professors...|$|R
