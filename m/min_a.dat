25|$|The first {{quadripartite meeting}} {{ended with the}} {{students}} reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators. However, Aung <b>Min,</b> <b>a</b> President’s Office Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president {{the responsibility of the}} students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 2007-2008 {{academic}} year, {{the full}} school day lasted from 8:00 am to 4:30 pm and {{began with a}} 10 min IGS followed by 24 modules (commonly referred to as [...] "mods") that lasted 18 min each; there were 3 min after each mod. (Each 3-module class was 60 <b>min.)</b> <b>A</b> revised schedule was implemented in the 2007-8 school year. Each module was now only 15 min, IGS was now 4 min, {{and the number of}} mods raised to 27. The Principal's Advisory Team strongly supported this schedule, giving students more time for electives and interaction. Classes still typically last three mods, or 51 minutes. Each 3-module class is 54 min. The school day lasts from 8:00 AM to 4:10 PM.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that Rabbi Zerachiah ben Isaac Ha-Levi Gerondi (Hebrew: רבינו זרחיה הלוי), the Baal Ha-Maor (author of the book Ha-Maor), went as far as to write that [...] "he who does not eat warm food (on Shabbos) should be checked out to see if he is not a <b>Min</b> (<b>a</b> heretic)". The reasoning beyond such austerity is that the Karaites interpreted the Torah verse, [...] "You shall not [...] (Heb: bi‘er the pi‘el form of ba‘ar) a fire in any of your dwellings on the day of Shabbat" [...] to indicate that fire should not be left burning in a Jewish home on Shabbat, regardless of whether it was lit prior to, or during the Sabbath. In Rabbinic Judaism however, the qal verb form ba‘ar is understood to mean [...] "burn", whereas the pi`el form (present here) is understood to be not intensive as usual but causative. (The rule being that the pi'el of a stative verb will be causative, instead of the usual hif'il.) Hence bi`er means [...] "kindle", which is why Rabbinic Judaism prohibits only starting a fire on Shabbat.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, state {{broadcaster}} China Central Television (CCTV) {{broadcast a}} news story further characterizing Windows 8 {{as a threat to}} national security. The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan, who stated that operating systems could aggregate [...] "sensitive user information" [...] {{that could be used to}} [...] "understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society", and alleged that per documents leaked by Edward Snowden, the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information. Yang <b>Min,</b> <b>a</b> computer scientist at Fudan University, also stated that [...] "the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security." [...] Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo, which stated that the company had never [...] "assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients" [...] or provided client data to the U.S. government, never [...] "provided any government the authority to directly visit" [...] or placed any backdoors in its products and services, and that it had never concealed government requests for client data.|$|E
