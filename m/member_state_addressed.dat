40|$|Summary: This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} and function {{of the right to}} a fair trial in Brussels I. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the European Court of Justice balances the right to a fair trial against the free movement of judgments. This question will be answered in terms of whether the ECJ perceives the right to a fair trial to constitute an autonomous source of obligations or whether it interprets (and if so, how it does so) PIL mechanisms {{in the light of the}} requirements of a fair trial. In particular, the paper will analyse to what extent the courts in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>addressed</b> may review compliance with the right to a fair hearing of the court originally seized. Finally, the proposal of the European Commission to abolish the exequatur will be examined from a fundamental rights perspective...|$|E
40|$|The Brussels I Regulation ((EU) No 1215 / 2010) {{governs the}} {{division}} of jurisdiction between the Member States of the European Union and provides for the circulation of judgments within the Member States in civil and commercial matters. Arbitration is excluded from {{the scope of the}} Regulation, and the Regulation should not affect the application of the New York Convention in the Member States. The arbitration exclusion reflects a traditional understanding that the systems of international civil procedure and international arbitration are expected to function autonomously. Despite this, the two systems occasionally collide as parties to a dispute attempt to initiate parallel court and arbitral proceedings. Further, if parallel court and arbitral proceedings on the same matter and between the same parties cannot be prevented, they may result in two at least partially overlapping and conflicting decisions. This study concerns first whether parallel court and arbitral proceedings can be prevented in ways that are compatible with the Regulation and the New York Convention. The second research question concerns on which grounds a Member State court is able to refuse recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment that conflicts with an arbitral award. The study is based on doctrinal research, and the objectives of the study are twofold. First, the study examines the prevailing interpretation of the Regulation’s interface with arbitration and secondly, the study aims at presenting a recommendation regarding the application of the Regulation in case a Member State court is requested to enforce a judgment conflicting with an arbitral award. Regarding the first research question, the study examines the availability of measures restricting or discouraging parallel court and arbitral proceedings. The prohibition of court-ordered anti-suit injunctions established in the case-law of the CJEU under the old Brussels I Regulation ((EC) No 44 / 2001) remains applicable under the recast Regulation. Further, the assessment of whether Member State courts are permitted to order damages for breach of arbitration agreement appears to give a negative answer as such damages are argued to be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between Member State courts. On the contrary, the recognition and enforcement of anti-suit injunctions ordered by arbitrators and arbitral awards ordering damages for breach of arbitration agreement appear to be outside the scope of the Regulation but national laws of the Member States strongly limit the availability and enforceability of such measures. This leads to a conclusion that parallel court and arbitral proceedings cannot be effectively prevented under the Regulation. As a main rule, the decision which is rendered first is to be recognised and enforced in other Member States on the application of a party regardless of any pending parallel proceedings. The Regulation particularly prescribes that it shall not affect the application of the New York Convention, which has led to a discussion concerning the possibility of anti-enforcement injunctions directed against the enforcement of a judgment that has been rendered prior to an arbitral award on the same matter and between the same parties. Such injunctions appear, however, both incompatible with the Regulation and unnecessary with regard to the unaffected application of the New York Convention. If a Brussels I regime judgment has been given first, it can be enforced in accordance with the Regulation. The same applies to an arbitral award under the New York Convention if the recognition and enforcement of the award is sought first. The Regulation does not address on which grounds a Member State court may refuse the enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment in case the enforcement is requested only after a conflicting arbitral award is recognised and enforced in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>addressed.</b> It appears clear that the enforcement must be refused in such situation but, on the other hand, the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment are exhaustively listed in the Regulation. The study discusses four alternative grounds for refusing the enforcement. It is concluded that the enforcement of a conflicting Brussels I regime judgment should be refused on the grounds of being contrary to the public policy in the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> <b>addressed</b> since the national public policy cannot accommodate recognition and enforcement of two irreconcilable decisions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is first, to gain insight into how the European <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have <b>addressed</b> the concept of {{sustainability}} in their building regulatory frameworks; and second, to gain insight in the effects of harmonization attempts of these frameworks by the European Commission (EC). Design/methodology/approach - Data on the member states' building regulatory regimes were gathered using a survey questionnaire. The survey questionnaire addressed over 60 different aspects of sustainable construction that may, in various ways, be regulated by the <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Findings - The data obtained show mixed results. Some aspects of sustainable construction show far-reaching homogeneity, whilst others do not. It appears that current EC directives have a positive effect on homogeneity of sustainable construction regulation throughout Europe. However, this does not provide a firm base to advise more directives, as these often appear a too resource-intensive tool to achieve sustainable construction in a timely fashion. Additional and complementary approaches to such directives are proposed. Originality/value - The paper presents an overview of how European <b>member</b> <b>states</b> have <b>addressed</b> various aspects of sustainable construction in their construction regulatory frameworks. This provides valuable insights for further studies on regulatory change, regulatory convergence and divergence, and policy outcomes related to sustainable construction in the European Union. Also, the study presents a number of approaches to achieve homogeneity that may complement earlier approaches taken by the EC...|$|R
40|$|In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{published}} {{a report on}} the state of development of legal frameworks with regard to e-health. The report is based on the findings of the WHO’s Second Global Survey on E-Health, which analysed, amongst other things, {{the extent to which the}} legal frameworks in the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> <b>addressed</b> the need to protect patients’ privacy in the use of electronic healthcare applications. Based on the results obtained, the WHO stressed the fact that although in most member countries there exists a high level of legal protection of the general privacy of health-related information, this does not go beyond the common human right of privacy. There exists little specific e-health related privacy protection legislation and much remains to be explored in terms of other legal safeguards. This article intends to broaden the WHO’s analysis and go somewhat further, exploring not only the challenges and opportunities with regard to privacy protection, but also liability laws, which could have a significant impact on the use and adoption of these technology applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a simple, and largely empirical, research question: is the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent high level commitment to reducing inequality translated into concrete action in its dealings with <b>member</b> <b>states?</b> <b>Addressing</b> this research question is significant in several respects. First, {{the high level}} rhetorical commitment to reduce inequality {{might be seen as}} paradoxical because the IMF, alongside other institutions of global economic management, has long been criticised for its role in promoting economic reform in member countries, partly on the basis that this increases inequality (Peet et al. 2009; Kentikelenis et al. 2016 : 550 - 1). It is therefore important to assess the extent to which recent pronouncements on inequality by the Fund suggest a change in emphasis or a genuine institutional commitment. Second, addressing the question contributes to a contemporary academic literature on more technical aspects of how we should understand and interpret IMF policy advice and conditionality. This literature currently focusses on a range of aspects of IMF policy advice, but does not address the recent interest of the Fund in inequality. The paper addresses this lacuna...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the difficulties of}} reconciling the values promoted by multiculturalism with the objectives of harmonization. In the event of conflict, examples from English and French law show that harmonization of private law rules does not always achieve its aim of approximating national laws but, on the contrary, often backfires. The question of whether and why these divergences produce Europhile or Eurosceptic positions amongst <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> is <b>addressed.</b> It appears that when maximum harmonisation clashes with multiculturalism {{this can lead to}} legal nationalism, whereas minimum harmonization has less negative effects and can stimulate legal experimentation. It is suggested that harmonization requires a mutual listening and learning process in order to accommodate the multiculturalism of <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and enable Europhilia to flourish in the European Union. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{transposition}} {{and implementation of}} the Habitats Directive in four European <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> namely Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece, and Romania, and the role that institutional misfits have played in more or less successful implementation processes. Departing in the ‘Worlds of Compliance’ literature, it also explores if this typology can be useful for understanding the ways <b>member</b> <b>states</b> <b>address</b> institutional adaptation pressures in the implementation steps following the transposition phase. The requirements in the Habitats Directive expanded most member states’ nature conservation frameworks, especially in the obligation to introduce pro-active conservation, and it also laid down a number of steps to be taken for creating the European Natura 2000 network. It was found that the transposition did mostly follow general compliance types, but that these types also helped understand the extent and adequacy of adaptations and changes to the institutional framework in the implementation processes following the directive’s adoption. Implementation challenges were different for different countries. They showed a need to align institutional frameworks for a) Natura 2000 in areas with several existing types of landscape protections and ensuing spatial and institutional overlaps; b) clarifying the roles and responsibilities of various authorities involved in implementation; c) ensuring coordination with the other sectorial policy areas that interact with the Habitats Directive (such as the Nitrate Directive and the Water Framework Directive). It turned out {{that there could be a}} need for more flexible and less-top-down European legislation, providing a larger room-for-manoeuvre for integration with domestic approaches...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, post-communist states {{experienced}} a fascinating political journey, from using {{the rule of law}} concept in the most general way as an early signal of the coming constitutional and political transformation, to specifically (as EU <b>Member</b> <b>States)</b> <b>addressing</b> the problem of the supremacy of EU law and its effect on emerging national democracy and constitutional sovereignty. In other words, they moved from asking the question ‘which rule of law?’ to the question ‘the rule of which law?’ This move itself indicates the capacity {{of the rule of law}}, which is discussed in this article, to operate as a political ideal and a power technique at the same time. This duality of the rule of law operations will be outlined against the background of the process of European integration and its challenges to the traditional constitutional notions of sovereignty and legal unity. I shall argue that post-communist states initially had to embrace the substantive concept of the rule of law drawing on liberal and democratic values, which became a valid ticket for ‘The Return to Europe’ journey. However, the very process of European integration involved technical uses of law often challenging the substantive notion of the democratic rule of law and constitutionalism. The accession of post-communist states to the EU thus highlights the Union's more general problem and intrinsic tension between instrumental legitimacy by outcomes and substantive legitimacy by democratic procedures and values...|$|R

40|$|The Ressano Garcia Border Post on the Mozambique {{side and}} the Lebombo Border post on the South African side {{represent}} the link {{between two of the}} three Maputo Corridor countries that receives the largest amount of freight traffic along the Corridor. The link has been identified as a major obstacle to the free movement of goods. As a result the process of the establishment of a One Stop Border Post was mooted by the former president Thabo Mbeki and his counter-part in Mozambique Mr. Joaquim Chissano in a bilateral agreement between these two countries. The reasons for these developments are prompted by the protracted problems that have beset intra-regional trade. For example, transport infrastructure in the region imposes significant costs on intra-regional and regional trade transactions. Long delays at border posts add to the intra-regional trade costs. The requirements by the 1996 SADC trade protocol, the basis of the FTA — that <b>member</b> <b>states</b> eliminate non-tariff barriers — poses special problems as it represents different things to different SADC <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> <b>Addressing</b> the SADC summit on 16 August 2006, the then South African President Thabo Mbeki said “the launch of the FTA was much more than a simple acknowledgement that the majority of traded goods in the region are duty-free. Rather we should view the achievement of this milestone as a major step towards addressing the fundamental challenges of poverty and underdevelopment through deeper integration and economic development” (Mbeki, 2006 : 16). Now that there will be one centre that clears all the documents for the transporters this will effectively culminate in the speedy processing of the documents.

But however great, the challenges of enlargement pale in comparison with the challenges of accession that will be faced by the new <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> especially those which until a decade ago were governed by Communist parties that presided over centrally-planned and predominantly-collectivized economies. This paper explores five of the most critical challenges that will face the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of post-Communist Europe: 1) administering the acquis; 2) deepening and extending the reform and transformation of the economy; 3) reducing the high levels of unemployment and large government, trade, and current account deficits; 4) financing accession {{in the face of the}} EU's budgetary constraints and financial provisions; and 5) coping with all of those challenges in the face of low levels of support for enlargement in many of the <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and high levels of ambivalence and skepticism about membership in most of the new <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> The chapter concludes by noting the low levels of trust in the national government and satisfaction with the way democracy works that exist in most of the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and suggests that those low levels of trust and satisfaction will make it difficult for the governments in the new <b>member</b> <b>states</b> to <b>address</b> these challenges while also maintaining sufficient public support to retain office...|$|R
