In this case it is helpful to have a bypass such that the EAHX is disconnected and air taken directly from outside. A differential temperature sensor with a <b>motorized</b> <b>valve</b> can control the bypass function.|$|E

Typically the valve has three {{positions}} for loading the sample loop, for injecting the sample from the loop into the column, and for connecting the pumps {{directly to the}} waste line to wash them or change buffer solutions. The injection valve has a sample loading port through which the sample can be loaded into the injection loop, usually from a hypodermic syringe using a Luer-lock connection.|$|E

There are various types of position control techniques of a <b>motorized</b> <b>valve.</b> The position control systems used in different applications need to meet the high performance, accuracy and reliability to achieve the desired output. Microcontrollers can be used as suitable means for meeting these needs. In the present paper, a position control scheme of a <b>motorized</b> <b>valve</b> has been described using microcontroller-based configuration for controlling stepper motor as actuator. The final calibration data reported in the paper reveal the linearity and reliability of the control system. ...|$|E
50|$|Commands {{can be sent}} using {{separate}} Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios to {{the thrust}} termination system (TTS). Use of the TTS by range safety will close two <b>motorized</b> <b>valves</b> which shut off the flow of liquid oxygen and methane to the engine - thereby terminating engine thrust. These TTS valves are completely independent {{from the rest of}} the vehicle systems. The TTS also stops the laser in the ALHAT's Hazard Detection System from firing - since Type IV lasers are not eye safe.|$|R

The solar field of a typical 50 MW power plant with 7 hours of storage capacity consists of 150 loops and 600 motors, while a similar plant without storage uses 100 loops and 400 motors. <b>Motorized</b> <b>valves</b> for mass flow control in the loops rely on more copper. Mirrors use {{a small amount of}} copper to provide galvanic corrosion protection to the reflective silver layer. Changes {{in the size of the}} plants, size of collectors, efficiencies of heat transfer fluids will also affect material volumes.|$|R
50|$|Variable-flow {{systems have}} risen in {{popularity}} primarily because they reduce a system’s energy consumption. They use variable-speed, inverter-driven pumps, {{the speed of}} which is changed to match the load. 2-port, <b>motorized</b> control <b>valves</b> are often used to control flows to terminal fan-coil units, or thermostatic radiator valves are used to regulate flow to radiators in heating-only systems. Current solutions in variable-flow systems also include a combination of differential-pressure control valves (DPCVs) {{which can be used}} on branches and/or across air-handling units, with double regulating valves to proportionately balance and limit flows to all terminal valves.|$|R

Different component features (the control program, the supervision interface, the physical device) and the human tasks are modeled using timed automata.

40|$|The {{application}} of Geographic Information Systems in Khartoum Water Distribution Network, will give solutions {{to most of}} the problems hindering the operation of the network. After processing the data available through maps, official records and personal investigations with those who have long working experience in charge of the distribution network; the solutions for those problems can be set up and the plans for future needs can be proposed. The core of this study is a computerized model based on the above technology; on which the main components of Khartoum water distribution network were constructed over a digital base map for Khartoum metropolitan area. The programs used are AutoCAD MAP 2000 i, ArcView GIS 3. 1 and ArcView GIS 3. 2 a. The attribute database (descriptive information linked with the map elements) is represented internally in the system, and could be recalled when required. The method applied in constructing the database is the Dual Independent Map Encoding Structure (DIME), which involves scanning from a hard copy, transferring to vector data and then manipulating through GIS Software. The attributes are entered using the keyboard via dialogue boxes. The major problem solved here, is the construction of a digital map for Khartoum metropolitan area Network, which is considered as a model area for network deficiencies; according to senior engineers in charge of the network. An archived database, containing all information of the network, which can be linked with locational data, was constructed. Moreover, some of the experience of Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority (ADWEA) and Abu Dhabi Town Planning was utilized to construct the attribute database. By precise locational data (i. e. accurately constructed maps), many problems in the network could be avoided. e. g. Breakages occur due to road and building construction works. Furthermore, a system for monitoring the network operation (e. g. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition-SCADA); breakdowns, leakages, flow and pressure variations can be adopted and linked directly via microwave or cable telephone line to a central control room, to help coping with any emergent case at instant. The role of the GIS is to feed the system with the exact location of the breakdown, in addition to any maintenance information previously fed to the system. By monitoring the water pressure and flow in the network, many breakdowns could also be avoided, especially during night time and winter season, by the aid of <b>motorized</b> <b>valve</b> systems. 13 To reflect the feasibility of GIS technology to KSWC, some samples of locational queries and data retrieval such as Bill of Quantities were given. Finally, some recommendations to contribute in solving the dilemma of Khartoum State Water Supply system and future predictions, using GIS technology were give...|$|E

The conventional actuating device consisting of <b>motorized</b> control <b>valve</b> and finned heat-exchanger is much more suitable to PID control instead of fuzzy control. To achieve a good control performance for heating or cooling coil by the fuzzy control method, an innovative finned heat-exchanger with adjustable area has been proposed in this paper.

50|$|Traditional {{control valve}} sizing for {{constant}} flow systems involves a Kv calculation, actual pressure drop calculation and {{a check to}} ensure minimum valve authority is met. This method is complicated and inflexible, as the changes in design flow, circuit pressure, and required pressure drops can change the required valve, and reduce control-ability. This method also relies on having the correct design information. Pressure independent control valves are used to limit the flow to the fan coil terminal and air handling unit. This flow is not affected by changes in inlet pressure. A diaphragm within the valve keeps the outlet pressure constant, and this delivers a constant flow to the terminal. The added advantage of pressure independent control valves is that, when fitted with an actuator, they replace the manual balancing <b>valve</b> and <b>motorized</b> control <b>valve</b> with a single valve, thus reducing installation cost.|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry faces problems in transportation of crude petroleum be- {{cause of the}} deposition of paraffins, hydrates and asphaltenes on the insides of the pipeline. These are conventionally removed using either chemical inhibitors or mechani- cal devices, called pigs, which travel through the pipeline and mechanically scrape away the deposits. These pigs are propelled by the pipeline product itself and hence travel at the same velocity as the product. Research has indicated that cleaning {{would be better if}} the pigs are traveling at a relatively constant velocity of around 70 % of the product velocity. This research utilizes the concept of regulating the bypass flow velocity {{in order to maintain the}} pig velocity. The bypass flow is regulated by the control unit based on the feedback from the turbine flowmeter, which monitors the bypass flow. A <b>motorized</b> butterfly <b>valve</b> is used for actually controlling the bypass flow. In addition to cleaning, the proposed pig utilizes on-board electronics like accelerom- eter and pressure transducers to store the data gathered during the pig run. This data can then be analyzed and the condition of the pipeline predicted. Thus, this research addresses the problem of designing a pig to maintain a constant velocity in order to achieve better cleaning. It also helps gather elementary data that can be used to predict the internal conditions in the pipe...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{injection}} analysis {{provides a}} convenient {{platform for the}} use of biosensors in the monitoring of bio-processes. A major requirement in bioprocess monitoring is real time information about various process parameters like concentration of products and substrates, flow rates, and injection volumes. Depending on the application, the monitoring requirements vary and this results in a need for different measurement flow schemes. Common flow schemes employed with biosensing are FIA, SIA, BIA and multi-commuted flow. In this work, a versatile platform to employ biosensors for continuous analysis of bioprocesses with precise control of flow, volume and defined events has been developed. The system is based on National Instruments LabVIEW and employs piston-, peristaltic pumps, <b>motorized</b> injection <b>valves</b> and 2 -way and 3 -way solenoid valves. The system supports data acquisition, controls interface with devices and visualization of data from multiple detectors used in biosensing. The system was successfully evaluated for the analysis of a model analyte, human immunoglobulin G (IgG), employing continuous flow-ELISA in competitive mode with optical detection. The flow-immunosensor showed very good linearity; from 5 to 400 mu g/ml. The system had excellent reproducibility and stability with a relative standard deviation of 4. 75 %. The immunosensor was also subjected to a model first order kinetics of target analyte concentration and the results from the sensor agreed well with the estimated concentration. The flexibility of the system gives that different flow configurations easily can be set up and the dynamic range of analysis can be adapted by varying different flow conditions for measurement, thereby controlling different reaction times in the biosensor system. The system could be useful for online analysis and control of bioprocesses employing biosensors. Further, with automated data collection and analysis, the system provides excellent basis for cross platform data communication for integrated control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
