5|$|Tim Roth as General ThadeA {{sinister}} chimpanzee {{military commander}} who wants {{control over the}} ape civilization. Thade also intends to marry Ari, but she dismisses him. Roth turned down the role of Severus Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone because of his commitment to Planet of the Apes. Alan Rickman was eventually cast as Snape. Roth rewrote some scenes to give his character a <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> presence.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{meets with}} Principal Clemmons and finds Veronica in the closet. Veronica talks to Mr. Wu {{about one of}} his students, Peter, who had {{feelings}} for Mr. Wu. However, Mr. Wu is not gay. That night, Veronica has a dream about Peter, who “asks” her why he would even {{want to go to}} a baseball stadium. Veronica talks to Beaver, who was pushed into a wall by Cervando, a PCHer who died in the bus crash. Keith solves a case for Principal Clemmons about students who get diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder from the same doctor for better grades. Angie wins the experiment competition, and we learn that Angie was one of the students who was diagnosed with GAD for money. Principal Clemmons revokes exceptions for GAD students. Veronica has a dream about Cervando, who says that the perpetrator was probably in the vicinity of the bus crash. Veronica learns that the “I am God” image is actually an album cover. Keith tells Veronica that the perpetrator was probably targeting Dick and Beaver. Veronica has another, <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> dream.|$|E

25|$|Moria (Evil) – The {{subterranean}} {{realm of}} Khazad-dûm {{was built by}} the Dwarves, but it was taken by Evil. Now it is infested with Goblins and Cave Trolls, and <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> creatures such as the Balrog are the centerpiece of Moria forces. Goblins are weak but inexpensive to field, making them numerous in games, and can be strengthened by Goblin Drums and Goblin Shamans. Moria allies with Isengard in the books and Games Workshop have also added Angmar, Dol Guldur, and Barad-dûr, and the Nazgûl to their allies list.|$|E
25|$|One {{episode of}} Harry & Paul {{featured}} a sketch, {{split in two}} parts called On the TARDIS, which was a cross between Doctor Who and On the Buses. Stan Butler (Harry Enfield) played the Doctor while Jack Harper (Paul Whitehouse) was the companion. The pair were planning to flee from Olivia (finding her far <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> than the Daleks) {{to go to the}} planet Raving Nympho to be with lots of girls. Instead, they land on the planet Woolly Woofter and encounter camp people. In Part 2, Blakely turned up as The Master before the lads got what they wanted: three gorgeous girls.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} was made to send a squadron to help General Denikin's White Russian forces in the Russian Civil War and Collishaw was chosen to be in command. His squadron found itself fighting against the Bolsheviks, who had skilled German pilots manning some of their aircraft. This campaign initially went well but eventually turned into a retreat then a rout during which the squadron was withdrawn. Collishaw added another victory to his total during this conflict, as well as managing to sink an enemy gunboat with a bomb dropped from his Sopwith Camel. He admitted in his autobiography that his experiences in, and particularly his escape from, Russia were far <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> than those on Western Front.|$|E

25|$|Giger {{conceived}} the Alien as being vaguely human but a human in full armor, protected from all outside forces. He mandated that the creature have no eyes, {{because he felt}} that it made them much <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> if you could not tell {{they were looking at}} you. Giger also gave the Alien's mouth a second inner set of pharyngeal jaws located at the tip of a long, tongue-like proboscis which could extend rapidly for use as a weapon. His design for the creature was heavily influenced by an aesthetic he had created and termed biomechanical, a fusion of the organic and the mechanic. His mock-up of the Alien was created using parts from an old Rolls Royce car, rib bones and the vertebrae from a snake, molded with plasticine. The Alien's animatronic head, which contained 900 moving parts, was designed and constructed by special effects designer Carlo Rambaldi. Giger and Rambaldi together would win the 1980 Academy Award for Visual Effects for their design of the Alien.|$|E
500|$|The Aberdeen Press & Journal {{described}} the episode as [...] "one of the darkest episodes of the Simpsons". In their {{section on the}} episode in the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood comment: [...] "Undoubtedly the most disturbing episode of the series, with Bart's nightmare of losing his soul— illustrated by a macabre playground where all the souls of his playmates are visible, and his is tagging along with Milhouse— <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> than funny. ... An illustration of just how far the series could go by this point." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1996 game Valentine wears {{a police}} uniform {{consisting}} of combat boots, tactical pants, a tight-fitting blue shirt, shoulder pads and a beret. She {{was not used}} in the 1998 sequel, Resident Evil 2, because the production team felt the game would be <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> with new characters, but she returned as the sole protagonist of the 1999 title, [...] In that game, she wears a blue tube top, black miniskirt, knee-high boots, and white sweater wrapped around her waist. The reason given by Capcom for her informal clothing is that she had just resigned from her professional duties before escaping a city overrun by zombies.|$|E

500|$|Konner and Rosenthal were {{rewriting}} the script even as sets were being constructed. Ari, Helena Bonham Carter's character, was originally a princess. She {{was changed to}} [...] "a Senator's daughter with a liberal mentality". One of the drafts had General Thade, Tim Roth's character, as an albino gorilla, but Burton felt chimpanzees were <b>more</b> <b>frightening.</b> Limbo, Paul Giamatti's character [...] "was supposed {{to turn into a}} good guy. There was supposed to be this touching personal growth thing at the end," [...] Giamatti reflected. [...] "But Tim [...] and I both thought that was kind of lame so we decided to just leave him as a jerk into the end." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with many}} other films in the series, Maneater was heavily panned by critics. Felix Gonzalez, Jr. of DVDReview.com {{referred}} to the film as [...] "another Z-grade extravaganza of gore and mayhem" [...] and {{felt that it was}} typical of most Sci Fi original movies in that it contained [...] "horrendous writing and nonsensical characters." [...] He considered Busey's being the headliner was the first sign of trouble, stating that [...] "with his ill-fitting suit and incomprehensible facial expressions, (Busey) is actually <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> than the tiger." [...] Matt Paprocki from Blogcritics felt the original novel was superior to its film adaptation, and felt the movie was [...] "an appallingly bad creature feature that barely qualifies as such" [...] with multiple plot holes, unexplored subplots, and stereotypical characters plagued by bad acting.|$|E
500|$|P.T. was {{designed}} to take players {{at least a week}} to complete, and Kojima intended the puzzles to be very enigmatic and difficult. Despite this, a few gamers reportedly finished the game within hours after the release, surprising him. Kojima also intended for P.T. to be a mystery {{in order to make it}} a <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> experience. There is little, if not cryptic, information given in the game on events that take place, and there are few clues as to how to solve the puzzles. He chose the corridor as the setting as opposed to [...] "a ruin" [...] because he wanted the teaser to emotionally affect the player regardless of [...] "cultural background". Kojima elaborated that P.T. and Silent Hills have no canonical and direct relation, and that Silent Hills would have been enhanced by elements that were never in P.T. He based his concept of P.T. on horror films and other media that he found frightening. When creating the game, Kojima refrained from using graphic violence to build up suspense, as he felt that too many horror games rely on the trope. He wanted to elicit a more [...] "genuine, thoughtful and permeating" [...] type of fear.|$|E

500|$|The script {{described}} Gort as nanotechnology by {{the time}} the director signed on, although it did not specify Gort's appearance. The 15th draft of the script had depicted the robot as a four-legged [...] "Totem" [...] that stands upright after firing its weapon beam. Okun explained there were many more [...] "horrific" [...] or [...] "amazing" [...] concepts, but it made sense that the robot would assume a familiar human shape. He cited the Monolith from [...] as an inspiration for Gort's texture, noting [...] "it's a simple shape, it has no emotion [...] it just simply is", which makes Gort <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> because the audience cannot tell what he is thinking. The animators estimated the computer-generated robot as [...] tall, whereas in the original he was played by the [...] tall Lock Martin. Gort's computer model was programmed to reflect light, and the filmmakers spent time on motion-capture sessions to guide the performance. An actor wore weights on his hands and feet, allowing the animators to bring a sense of weight and power to Gort. His destructive capabilities were based on locust swarms, although the idea of metal-eating insects goes back to Stephen Vincent Benét's 1933 poem [...] "Metropolitan Nightmare".|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly rated [...] "Irresistible" [...] a B+, {{saying it was}} based on [...] "an unsettling concept to begin with" [...] that was reinforced by [...] "Chinlund's skin-crawling one-man show". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode A, praising the acting, particularly of Chinlund as Pfaster, and describing it as [...] "legitimately scary, a sign of a show that was pushing itself in new and interesting directions". The only criticism was for the scenes where Scully hallucinates Pfaster shapeshifting as [...] "pretty silly, almost feeling like an attempt to make sure something vaguely paranormal is in the episode so the fans don't get bored with what is ultimately a very good episode". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+ grade. Writing for Den of Geek, Nina Sordi ranked [...] "Irresistible" [...] the sixth best X-Files episode, saying that [...] "excluding CSM and his cronies, Pfaster has got to be the most disturbing villain that our favorite agents have encountered". Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named it the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the second season, describing it as [...] "a genuinely creepy 45-minute horror movie". Connie Ogle of Popmatters listed Pfaster among the best monster-of-the-week characters of the series, and IGN's Christine Seghers ranked Chinlund the seventh best guest star {{in the history of the}} show, considering that [...] "what makes him all the <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> is how downright passive and polite he is up until the moment he's going to kill; the perfect camouflage for a modern-day monster." [...] TV Guide listed Pfaster among the [...] scariest X-Files monsters describing him as [...] "evil incarnate".|$|E
500|$|Destructoids Zack Furniss {{felt that}} the primary {{accomplishment}} of Resident Evil 7 concerned its pacing, which was praised as [...] "masterful". Furniss' apprehensive expectations of how the story would unfold were subverted to his liking, deeming the result a blend similar to the horror and comedy found in The Evil Dead films. He found a sense of finality in the combat and lauded it for having produced lasting tension. What held more sway, however, was the priority of survival horror, with the management of limited resources meeting a positive response. Furniss considered the boss fights to be [...] "harrowing" [...] and welcomed the consistent surreality of the game. His playthrough with the PlayStation VR inspired unease, unpredictable jump scares and ultimately an [...] "intuitive" [...] experience. Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly favored the atmosphere's constant mood of anxiety, which was partly impacted by the interiors of the main setting. The sound design was also thought to complement this sense of dread, increasing the level of player involvement. He noted the slow narrative build as the game's most substantial achievement, and likened its efficacy to that of earlier games in the series. Like Furniss, Carsillo expressed appreciation for the pacing, and opined that it brought considerable intrigue, accommodating lengthy play sessions. Playing with the virtual reality headset was [...] "even <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> than doing it normally", according to Carsillo, echoing Furniss' view that it made the game more immersive. Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner commended the [...] "tense, unsettling, overly gory" [...] atmosphere for providing a competent introduction to Resident Evil 7. The Baker house {{and the nature of}} exploring it posed significant interest to him, for together, they would present new aspects regarding the occupants and be enhanced by the first-person perspective. Scott Butterworth at GameSpot enjoyed the narrative overall, valuing its memorable moments and the thematic consistency of the writing. He was impressed with the reliance of atmosphere as opposed to jump scares to heighten the feeling of danger. Using the Baker family to multifarious ends of gameplay was complimented as a logical extension of the established world; the interactive VHS tapes were approved of for the same reason, said to serve [...] "beautifully as both a narrative device and a way to break up Ethan's exhausting mission". On PlayStation VR, Butterworth mentioned that, in its employment, the element of horror appeared more realistic.|$|E

2500|$|One {{character}} {{quotes from}} the writings of 18th century Christian mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. Matheson bases his descriptions of the death experience itself on studies by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and Raymond Moody. When reading these accounts, Matheson found that revived suicides told a far <b>more</b> <b>frightening</b> story than anyone else who had [...] near death experiences. Matheson's bibliography consists more of [...] "New Age" [...] material than mainstream religious sources, and the novel shows reincarnation as more voluntary than major world religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism usually depict it.|$|E
