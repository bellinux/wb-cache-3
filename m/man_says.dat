5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he has trouble seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the <b>man</b> <b>says</b> that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E

Sigurd tells the old man that he is going to choose a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old <b>man</b> <b>says</b> that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltjörn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and {{handsome}} grey horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old <b>man</b> <b>says</b> that the horse is from [...] "Sleipnir's kin" [...] and that [...] "he must be raised carefully, because he will become better than any other horse." [...] The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds that the old man was none other than (the god) Odin.|$|E

The story was broken by The Sunday Mirror; writing for the paper, Lara Gould characterised the lessons as [...] "secret", while writers for The Daily Mail claimed that the lessons were [...] "likely to upset fellow contestants", and were evidence that Smith was [...] "already being groomed for stardom". During her participation in the competition, Smith was offered record deals, but {{she and her family}} turned them down. Her father, Tony Smith, said [...] "We have had offers from people interested in Faryl. But when Simon Cowell, the big <b>man,</b> <b>says</b> your daughter is special, you listen."

500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying this is a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why he is here, who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young <b>man</b> <b>says</b> he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E

2500|$|In 1933, Hitchcock {{was once}} again working for Michael Balcon at Gaumont British. His first film for the company The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) was a success and his second The 39 Steps (1935) is often {{considered}} one of the best films from his early period, with the British Film Institute ranking it the fourth best British film of the 20th century. The film was acclaimed in the UK, and it made Hitchcock a star in the US, and established the quintessential English [...] "Hitchcock blonde" [...] Madeleine Carroll as the template for his succession of ice cold and elegant leading ladies. Screenwriter Robert Towne remarked, [...] "It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that all contemporary escapist entertainment begins with The 39 Steps." [...] This film {{was one of the first}} to exploit a [...] "MacGuffin", a rather peripheral driver of the narrative. In The 39 Steps, the MacGuffin is a stolen set of design plans. In 1966, Hitchcock explained to French director François Truffaut: might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men in a train. One <b>man</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "What's that package up there in the baggage rack?" [...] And the other answers, [...] "Oh, that's a Macguffin."

Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night."

[...] "If I am what that <b>man</b> <b>says,</b> I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man."

[...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire.
