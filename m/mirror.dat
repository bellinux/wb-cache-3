5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating <b>mirror.</b> Because the <b>mirror</b> keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant <b>mirror</b> and back, the light is reflected from the rotating <b>mirror</b> at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant <b>mirror</b> the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary <b>mirror</b> had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical <b>mirror</b> ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a <b>mirror</b> focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E

5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} that {{is associated with}} social and communicative deficits. A single cause of autism has yet to be identified, but the mu wave and <b>mirror</b> neuron system have been studied specifically for their role in the disorder. In a typically developing individual, the <b>mirror</b> neuron system responds when he or she either watches someone perform a task or performs the task him- or herself. In individuals with autism, <b>mirror</b> neurons become active (and consequently mu waves are suppressed) only when the individual performs the task him- or herself. This finding has led some scientists, notably V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues, to view autism as disordered understanding of other individuals' intentions and goals due to problems with the <b>mirror</b> neuron system. This deficiency would explain the difficulty people with autism have in communicating with and understanding others. While most studies of the <b>mirror</b> neuron system and mu waves in people with autism have focused on simple motor tasks, some scientists speculate that these tests can be expanded to show that problems with the <b>mirror</b> neuron system underlie overarching cognitive and social deficits.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Edward Witten {{introduced}} topological string theory, {{a simplified}} version of string theory, and physicists {{showed that there}} is a version of <b>mirror</b> symmetry for topological string theory. This statement about topological string theory is usually taken as the definition of <b>mirror</b> symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of <b>mirror</b> symmetry in topological string theory. Known as homological <b>mirror</b> symmetry, this conjecture formalizes <b>mirror</b> symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent sheaves on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its <b>mirror.</b>|$|E
5|$|In physics, <b>mirror</b> {{symmetry}} {{is justified}} on physical grounds. However, mathematicians generally require rigorous proofs {{that do not}} require an appeal to physical intuition. From a mathematical point of view, the version of <b>mirror</b> symmetry described above is still only a conjecture, but there is another version of <b>mirror</b> symmetry in the context of topological string theory, a simplified version of string theory introduced by Edward Witten, which has been rigorously proven by mathematicians. In the context of topological string theory, <b>mirror</b> symmetry states that two theories called the A-model and B-model are equivalent in the sense that there is a duality relating them. Today <b>mirror</b> symmetry is an active area of research in mathematics, and mathematicians are working to develop a more complete mathematical understanding of <b>mirror</b> symmetry based on physicists' intuition.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{of string}} theory, <b>mirror</b> {{symmetry}} {{is used to}} understand aspects of quantum field theory, the formalism that physicists use to describe elementary particles. For example, gauge theories are a class of highly symmetric physical theories appearing in the standard model of particle physics {{and other parts of}} theoretical physics. Some gauge theories which {{are not part of the}} standard model, but which are nevertheless important for theoretical reasons, arise from strings propagating on a nearly singular background. For such theories, <b>mirror</b> symmetry is a useful computational tool. Indeed, <b>mirror</b> symmetry can be used to perform calculations in an important gauge theory in four spacetime dimensions that was studied by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten and is also familiar in mathematics in the context of Donaldson invariants.

Yoga is a promising strategy for promoting positive body image. However, certain social-environmental variables might undermine yoga’s benefits. Previous {{research indicates that}} <b>mirrors</b> alter women’s psychological responses to exercise, but the effects of practicing yoga with <b>mirrors</b> are unknown. The present study examined the effect of <b>mirrors</b> on women’s state body image, affect, and self-efficacy in a yoga class. A secondary aim {{was to examine the}} effect of <b>mirrors</b> on social comparison and mindfulness. Potential moderators were also examined. Ninety-seven college-aged females were randomly assigned to complete a 60 -minute beginner level yoga class in either a <b>mirrored</b> or non-mirrored setting. Surveys were completed prior to and immediately after class. As hypothesized, the non-mirrored condition had significantly lower state social physique anxiety (SPA) after yoga than the <b>mirrored</b> condition. The <b>mirrored</b> condition reported significantly higher appearance-based social comparison than the non-mirrored condition, and social comparison mediated the relationship between <b>mirrors</b> and state SPA. There were no significant moderator effects. <b>Mirrors</b> appeared to lead to higher levels of state SPA in the <b>mirrored</b> vs. non-mirrored condition by fostering appearance comparisons with other participants and the yoga instructor. To encourage internal body awareness and minimize appearance comparisons in yoga classes, instructors in <b>mirrored</b> studios may want to consider structuring classes so students face away from <b>mirrors,</b> and reminding students to focus on how poses feel rather than how they look.
