40|$|Abstract—A time-domain design {{method for}} the digital {{controller}} of pulsewidth <b>modulation</b> dc–dc <b>converters</b> was developed. The proposed approach {{is based on}} the fact that the closed-loop response of a digitally controlled system is largely determined by the first few samples of the compensator. This concept is used to fit a digital PID template to the desired response. The proposed controller design method is carried out in the time domain and, thus, bypasses errors related to the transformation from the continuous to discrete domain and to discretization. The method was tested by simulations and experimentally. Digital PID controllers for experimental buck- and boost-type converters were designed according to the proposed method and implemented on a TMS 320 LF 2407 DSP core. The measured closed-loop attributes were found to be in good agreement with the design goals. The study was further expanded to investigate the possible realistic closed-loop performance that can be obtained from a system that is controlled by a PID template controller, as well as the stability boundaries of the proposed time-domain controller design approach. The results of the study delineate a normalized map of deviation from the target closed-loop performance goals possible for PID control of switchmode converters and the areas in which the use of this control law is feasible.

40|$|The preponderant {{application}} of rectifier circuits is the powering of dc loads from the ac utility line. Ordinary rectifier circuits present a nonlinear load impedance to the utility line, thereby generating harmonic currents, {{and contributing to}} the harmonic current problem. There are many active and passive rectifier circuits offering reduced harmonic currents, and in this work a methodology is developed by which these circuits may be analyzed and compared. Rectifier circuits can be classified as either active or passive. A passive rectifier circuit contains passive components (inductors, capacitors, saturable reactors, etc.), and passive switches (rectifier diodes) only. Active rectifier circuits use at least one controllable active switch (power transistor), in addition to passive switches and passive components. The performance characteristics of these circuits can be assessed {{with respect to a}} fictional device called the ideal rectifier. This assessment allows direct comparison of various approaches, passive or active, using the ideal rectifier as the common reference.

40|$|Recently, matrix {{converter}} {{has received}} considerable interest {{as a viable}} alternative to the conventional back-to-back PWM (Pulse Width <b>Modulation)</b> <b>converter</b> in the ac/ac conversion. This direct ac/ac converter provides some attractive characteristics such as: inherent four-quadrant operation; absence of bulky dc-link electrolytic capacitors; clean input power characteristics and increased power density. However, industrial application of the converter is still limited because of some practical issues such as common mode voltage effects, high susceptibility to input power disturbances and low voltage transfer ratio. This dissertation proposes several new matrix converter topologies together with control strategies to provide a solution about the above issues. In this dissertation, a new modulation method which reduces the common mode voltage at the matrix converter is first proposed. The new method utilizes the proper zero vector selection and placement within a sampling period and results in the reduction of the common mode voltage, square rms of ripple components of input current and switching losses. Due to the absence of a dc-link, matrix converter powered ac drivers suffer from input voltage disturbances. This dissertation proposes a new ride-through approach to improve robustness for input voltage disturbances. The conventional matrix converter is modified with the addition of ride-through module and the add-on module provides ride-through capability for matrix converter fed adjustable speed drivers. In order to increase the inherent low voltage transfer ratio of the matrix converter, a new three-phase high-frequency link matrix converter is proposed, where a dual bridge matrix converter is modified by adding a high-frequency transformer into dc-link. The new converter provides flexible voltage transfer ratio and galvanic isolation between input and output ac sources.
