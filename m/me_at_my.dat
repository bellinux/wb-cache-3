25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
500|$|Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is {{mentioned}} numerous times throughout the song, including the famous quote [...] "I'm selfish, impatient {{and a little}} insecure. I make mistakes, I am {{out of control and}} at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> best." [...] However, it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this. Minaj liked the track, as [...] "it spoke to me as a woman. I'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe. I had a moment with that song where I was like, 'Oh my God, every woman in this world needs to hear that'. No, we're not perfect. Sometimes, we think, 'What's wrong with us?' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves. I needed to hear that, 'I'm not perfect, but I'm worth it'. It resonated with me. I felt like the world needed to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|End of the Century was {{described}} by the band as an album written solely to gain popularity, resulting in more of a pop punk sound. Joey failed {{to contribute to the}} best of his abilities on the album and recalled: [...] "I think that some of the worst crap I ever wrote went on the album. That was <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> worst." [...] Johnny also felt that the album was far from the band's prime.|$|E

2500|$|The group's fourth studio album, Love This City, was {{released}} in November 1999, which peaked at No.3 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It was recorded with the line-up of Freedman with Ben Fink on guitar, Bill Heckenberg on drums and Cottco Lovett on bass guitar, together with a large cast of guest musicians including Marcia Hines, Jackie Orszaczky, Chris Abrahams, Garry Gary Beers and members of Machine Gun Fellatio. [...] The album had four producers: Freedman, Taylor, Daniel Denholm and Joe Hardy and was recorded in Sydney and Memphis (a reflection of the considerably larger budget that Freedman had to work with). The three singles from the album [...] "Thank You (For Loving <b>Me</b> <b>at</b> <b>My</b> Worst)" [...] (January 2000), [...] "Blow Up the Pokies" [...] (May) and [...] "Made Me Hard" [...] (September 2001) all charted in the top100 singles charts in Australia. [...] "Blow Up the Pokies" [...] was their highest charting single – it peaked at No.21.|$|E
2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit {{that one of the reasons}} I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of Timbaland protégés such as Candice Nelson, Steve [...] "Static" [...] Garrett, and co-producer Walter Millsap III the pair worked on several tracks for Norwood's fourth album, {{including}} [...] "Who Is She 2 U." [...] The song {{was one of the}} first songs on Afrodisiac, Norwood and Timbaland collaborated on. Incorporating a sample of the 1968 song [...] "Instant Love," [...] written by Jacqueline Hilliard and Leon Ware, it was penned by Nelson, Millsap and Timbaland, while production was handled by the latter two. Norwood's vocals were recorded at The Criteria Hit Factory in Miami, Florida and Amerycan Recording Studios, Los Angeles, California, with production overseen by herself. Timbaland and Jimmy Douglass mixed the track, while Douglass, Blake English, Demacio Castellon, Jeremal Hicks, and Halsey Quemere all assisted in the audio engineering of the track. Lyrically, the song's protagonist describes a confrontation with her cheating boyfriend, who [...] "tries to two-time, three-time and even four-time his way into multiple relationships." [...] Described as [...] "a caught-in-the-act tale set to throwback soul" [...] by Newsday, [...] "Who Is She 2 U" [...] was basically written for Norwood's female audience. [...] "It's a song I'm sure so many females have experienced," [...] she elaborated. [...] "And I've definitely experienced this before, just like, 'Who's that? Let me know what's going on!'" [...] She also termed the song [...] "reminiscent of a vintage Mary J. Blige. I was expressing my innermost feelings about life, love and relationships. It was <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>my</b> most raw. He [...] really encouraged me to do my best." ...|$|E
