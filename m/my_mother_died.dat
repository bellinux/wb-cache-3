500|$|Đurić {{was drafted}} into the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) {{at the age of}} 17, and became an officer during his service. With the {{impending}} Bosnian War, his father wanted either him or his brother to leave the country in order to preserve the family line. He was instructed to leave his hometown as he was younger and a sportsman. Đurić recalls: [...] "My father fought in this war, my brother for almost five years and my mother was killed in 1993 by the Muslim army. They bombed our village and it hit my home directly. A really big bomb and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> instantly [...] So many people like me lost mothers and fathers in this bloody civil war but for me I hold no grudges. I don’t look at race, I look at people by their hearts and here in Singapore I adopted a Muslim child." [...] With just 300 Deutsche Marks on him, Đurić left for Serbia where he played football in the second division for one season and then Sweden, where he trained with AIK and was offered refugee status which he rejected. The breakup of Yugoslavia left him stranded in Hungary without a recognised passport. He wandered through the cafes and restaurants of Szeged before a family offered him accommodation and a trial at local club Szeged LC in the second tier of the Hungarian football league.|$|E
500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b> After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E
2500|$|He also {{commented on}} [...] "Willow": [...] "It's kind of about how <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> {{as it was}} a black area and I hadn't {{realised}} what had happened until I saw my brother. He told me what went on with the family and I never really knew until a year afterwards, and I wrote it down directly after that".|$|E
6000|$|... "He will have,--when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>dies.</b> Of course I can't {{speak of}} doing {{anything}} for anybody at present. I may die before my uncle. Nothing is more likely. But then, if I do, Jack would be my uncle's heir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{belong to}} me alone, Annot," [...] said Allan, {{interrupting}} her; [...] "they were <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>dying</b> bequest. They are all I can call my own, except my plaid and my claymore. Take them, therefore--they are to me valueless trinkets--and keep them for my sake--should I never return from these wars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so," [...] she finished, [...] "though I do not {{remember}} much about it myself, I do remember <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>dying</b> words, which were 'to mind what the doctor had told her, and never to have any child of mine vaccinated, no, not if they crawled on their knees to ask it of me.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Richard {{remained}} forever grateful {{and loving}} to Cis throughout his life, later {{going on to}} say: [...] "When <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> she, my sister, had become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been... I was immensely proud of her... she felt all tragedies except her own." [...] Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent. Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor [...] "ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand". He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, Richard said he [...] "would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic". The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams believed Richard [...] "had distinct possibilities as a player".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second of}} three children, Lady Annabel {{was born in}} London into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family with its roots in Ulster and County Durham. [...] Lady Annabel Vane-Tempest-Stewart was born the {{daughter}} of Robin Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, who later became the 8th Marquess of Londonderry, and Romaine Combe, who {{was the daughter of}} Major Boyce Combe, from Surrey. [...] She became Lady Annabel as a young girl in February 1949 when her father became Marquess on the death of his father, the famous Ulster Unionist politician the 7th Marquess of Londonderry. Her mother died of cancer in 1951, but the illness was kept a secret by her parents. [...] She later said, [...] "Cancer was such a taboo then – Mummy didn't even tell her sisters." [...] Subsequently, her father became a chronic alcoholic and died from liver failure at 52 on 17 October 1955. [...] "My father was a really wonderful man but after <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died,</b> we couldn't talk to him as we had done before. He couldn't face life without her and he turned into Jekyll and Hyde almost overnight", she explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alan sent me {{to school}} at Miss Lawler's when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died,</b> and there I have been ever since, while he has been these three years and a half on the African station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is. He took <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> for {{his woman}} {{after he had}} killed Wettin. But <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> will <b>die</b> soon--she is very old--and then the man to whom I belong will become king." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "People who own things," [...] she remarked, [...] "never {{look upon}} them with proper reverence. Don't {{you see that}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is <b>dying</b> for some bridge?" ...|$|R
60|$|So it went {{on until}} a sad thing happened, since on {{returning}} from one of these forays in which I had punished a tribe that had murdered some Ethiopian hunters and we had taken many thousands of their cattle, I found <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>dying.</b> She had been smitten by a fever which was common at that season of the year, and being old and weak had no strength to throw it off.|$|R
60|$|EILEEN. It'd be fine if they would. I'd {{like to have}} one, too--to practice. I learned {{stenography}} at {{a business}} college and then I had a position for a year--before <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b>|$|E
60|$|When <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> I {{was very}} young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could {{scarcely}} cry ‘Weep! weep! weep! weep!’ So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> {{suddenly}} and, it {{was thought}} by Lady Drew, inconsiderately, the following spring. Her ladyship instantly fled to Folkestone with Miss Somerville and Fison, until the funeral should be over and my mother's successor installed.|$|E
6000|$|... "May I ask {{how things}} are proceeding?" [...] he said. [...] "Do your {{investigations}} point to <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> having <b>died</b> a natural death--or--or must we prepare ourselves for the worst?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated {{and seemed}} to gather {{encouragement}} from my face. I could not, I would not, for a moment share his fear when I thought steadfastly about it. I thought of <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>dying,</b> with a saint-like peace upon her face, in Mr. Ravenor's arms. I thought of the calm, sorrowful dignity of her life, and the idea refused {{for a moment to}} linger in my mind. Some other great cause for estrangement there must have been between them, but not that--not that! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no; I can't {{say that}} I am contented. I hardly think that anybody {{ought to be}} contented. Should <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>die</b> and Dorothy remain with my aunt, or get married, I should be utterly alone in the world. Providence, or {{whatever}} you call it, has made me a lady after a fashion, so that I can't live with the ploughmen's wives, {{and at the same}} time has so used me in other respects, that I can't live with anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one at all. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> when I was {{a little}} child, in Smyrna. Since then we have wandered all about; we were {{a long time in}} Algiers, and we were at Marseilles, and then in London." ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> I {{was very}} young, [...] And my father sold me while yet my tongue [...] Could {{scarcely}} cry [...] "Weep! weep! weep! weep!" [...] So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! yes! I {{remember}} the Bible--it {{was the one}} my aunt gave me--God bless her! She, Aunt Lizzie--took care o' me when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died,</b> an' {{she told me to}} read it every day--an' I did, most o' the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The letter {{came from}} Paris, but no address was given. It was when <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b> He {{wrote to me}} then, with some {{instructions}} and some advice, and I have never heard from him since." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{that moment}} the nurse came hurrying in and whispered {{something}} in his ear. My father's face turned deadly pale. He clutched at the table to support himself, then staggered from the room. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> was <b>dying!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} loving her dearly. They were intimate, and Mrs. Finn {{used to be}} with her very much {{when she was in the}} country. She was at Matching just now, when <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b> Why does she want to see you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mabel, I'm {{not used}} to talking with one like you, or saying all I think and feel with any. I never had a sister, and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> when I was a child, so that I know little what your sex most likes to hear--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have cried until I cannot cry any more. I am so unhappy. We were {{children}} together, and I have always loved {{him better than}} any one since <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b> To have him back again and then to lose him! Oh! I cannot bear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once," [...] she remarked, reflectively, [...] "I, too, went {{a little}} way into the world. I was a school-teacher at Norwich. I was very fond of some one there; we were engaged. Then <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> and I {{had to come back}} to look after father." ...|$|E
60|$|So the {{old house}} held us to its dismal bosom; and not until within its homely but unlovely arms, first my aunt, and later on <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had <b>died,</b> and I had said good-bye to Amy, crying {{in the midst of}} {{littered}} emptiness, did I leave it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorrows we have, too," [...] softly {{said the}} fourth swallow. [...] "He would not envy me, {{if he knew}} how my nest fell, and all my {{children}} were killed; how my dear husband was shot, and <b>my</b> old <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> of fatigue on our spring journey from the South." ...|$|R
5000|$|... …The most {{important}} thing that happened to me in the wake of <b>my</b> <b>mother’s</b> death wasn’t the strengthening of my feelings against religion. It was the strengthening of my feelings for disbelief. I believe that there are just as many of the “Christian virtues” to be found among the faithless as the faithful. Furthermore, these qualities are explored and developed along individual paths. We have no God whom we can burden with the responsibility for our actions. Loss of faith: it sounds so negative. I didn’t lose faith. I gained faith. Faith in people. I am proud to describe myself as a humanist. Last year I joined the British Humanist Association, and I don’t think I would have made this move if I had not seen <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>die</b> that sunny Sunday morning.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My {{father was}} {{master of the}} horse to the king of my country, and after <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died</b> he married another wife. At first all went well, {{but as soon as}} she had babies of her own she hated me, and I fled, lest she should do me harm.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{ten years}} old when the first serious misfortune that I can {{remember}} fell upon me. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died,</b> worn out in the prime of her life. And not long afterward the strolling company, brought to the end of its resources by a succession of bad seasons, was broken up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mary Erskine, [...] "I {{always was}} very young. I {{was very young}} when my father died; and afterwards, when <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>died,</b> I was very young to be left all alone, and {{to go out to}} work and earn my living. And now I am very young, I know. But then I am eighteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, teacher, it's {{just three}} years today since <b>my</b> little <b>mother</b> <b>died.</b> It's such a long, long time but it hurts {{just as much as}} ever [...] . and I miss her just as much as ever. Sometimes {{it seems to me that}} I just can't bear it, it hurts so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely not," [...] {{said the}} old woman. [...] "I'm sure I don't. It is like going to sleep on <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> breast to <b>die.</b> So good night, dear Seppy!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} bear to hear my old nurse so decried, and made the subject of such a wish. I told my aunt that indeed she was mistaken. That Peggotty was the best, the truest, the most faithful, most devoted, and most self-denying friend and servant in the world; who had ever loved me dearly, who had ever loved <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> dearly; who had held <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>dying</b> head upon her arm, on whose face <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had {{imprinted}} her last grateful kiss. And my remembrance of them both, choking me, I broke down as I was trying to say that her home was my home, and that all she had was mine, and that I would have gone to her for shelter, but for her humble station, which made me fear that I might bring some trouble on her--I broke down, I say, as I was trying to say so, and laid my face in my hands upon the table.|$|R
