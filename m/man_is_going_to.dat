2500|$|He said to them, [...] "The Son of <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be betrayed {{into the}} hands of men. They will kill him, and after three days he will rise." [...] But they did not {{understand}} what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it.|$|E
2500|$|Antuofermo {{lost his}} title later to British boxer Alan Minter, who gave Hagler his second title shot. Hagler went to Wembley Arena to face Minter. The tense {{atmosphere}} was stoked further when Minter {{was quoted as}} saying that [...] "No black <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take my title"—Minter would later insist he meant [...] "that black man". Hagler took command and his slashing punches soon opened up the cut prone Minter. The referee halted the contest after 3 rounds. At the conclusion of this bout a riot broke out and Hagler and his trainers had to be carried away to their locker rooms by the police, {{in the middle of a}} rain of beer bottles and glasses. [...] After 7 years and 50 fights, Hagler was World Middleweight Champion.|$|E
2500|$|Race in {{a broader}} context is also {{addressed}} in The Mystery of the Sea, but to a much lesser extent than nationality. Smith connects the theme of race to the political context of the Spanish–American War, arguing that Americans constructed [...] "fantasies of conflict" [...] in order to transform the war into a [...] "moral crusade against the Spanish". In the popular imagination, Cubans were presented as white, while the Spanish were imagined as [...] "swarthy", adding a racial dimension to the fighting. This ideological (and inaccurate) racial construction was largely unsuccessful after American forces had actually gone into Cuba, but these ideas, namely judgment based on skin color, are important in The Mystery of the Sea. Stoker paints {{the character of the}} [...] "negro" [...] kidnapper as inherently depraved and inferior to the white men (Archibald even {{goes so far as to}} declare that he is [...] "the active principle of whatever evil might be"), and Archibald fears that this dark-skinned <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> rape Marjory. Smith sees this man as a representation of the Cubans, a [...] "common enemy" [...] of both Catholic and Protestant forces as the Spanish–American War progressed. Archibald eventually murders this man while saving Marjory, exulting in the murder and soliloquizing at length about how a justified murder is an exhilarating deed. It is unclear whether this apparent justification stems from the fact that the potential assailant was black or from the crime he was about to commit, but Stoker nonetheless presents only a negative picture of people of African descent, and one that is in accord with the tensions of the time period.|$|E

60|$|JAMES. You {{may depend}} on it, my boy, if a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do this sort of}} thing he'll do it, {{pressure}} or no pressure; if he isn't nothing'll make him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe you!" [...] Miss Ellen nodded. [...] "Mark my words, Mr. Meredith, that <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight {{somebody}} yet. He's ACHING to. He {{is going}} to set the world on fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{turned white}} {{when the doctor}} {{told him that the}} <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die--that day, perhaps, or next day. When the doctor was pouring out the {{medicine}} he turned pale again and trembled. While the doctor was taking the photograph he trembled again. I think, sir--I really think--that he knew all along that the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die, {{but when it came to}} the moment, he was afraid. If it had depended on him, Oxbye would be alive still." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Very extraordinary,' said Mr. Pickwick, {{going back}} into his room, and seating himself {{at the table in}} a musing attitude. 'What can that young <b>man</b> <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is {{the very}} reason why you ought {{to find out whether}} the <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> dress, and let him know. He would never think of it himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, my dear. I {{never believe}} {{stories of this}} kind. When I hear that a young <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be married to a young lady, then I {{believe that they are}} in love with each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's what I mean {{by being}} school-manned to death,' said my {{acquaintance}} wickedly. 'Why, she bored 'em stiff; {{but they are}} so well brought up, they didn't even know they were bored. Some day the American <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> revolt.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then why do {{you talk}} to me about scruples? I wanted money, and I gave powder in exchange. How could I know that some of your wretched <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown up? Scruples! Pah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will ask, {{naturally}} enough, {{what this}} perverse <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next. I don't scruple {{to say that}} he is bent on committing suicide. Pray do not be alarmed! There is no fear of the pistol, the rope, or the river. Julian is simply courting death--within the limits of the law.|$|E
6000|$|My fear is lest {{this sort}} of thing shall lead to a demand {{on the part of the}} public for {{condensed}} novels.

60|$|Both {{the young}} <b>men</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> danger, perhaps to death. Colonel Washington was taking leave of her, {{and she was}} to see him no more before the campaign. No wonder the widow was very much moved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which of {{you three}} young <b>men</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{fall in love}} with her?" [...] she asked bluntly. [...] "You call her a child, but she is almost a woman, and she is beautiful. She will be very beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she said, [...] "you {{are safe}} up the stairs." [...] Tom {{opened his eyes}} very wide, and his mouth too; for he had not, as he thought, moved a single step. But, when he looked round him, {{there could be no}} doubt that he was safe up the backstairs, {{whatsoever}} they may be, which no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell you, for the plain reason that no man knows.|$|E
6000|$|The view he {{took was}} so plainly the right one, {{that there was}} no more to be said. As I rose to conduct him to my lady's room, he asked if Mr. Franklin wished to be present. Mr. Franklin answered, [...] "Not unless Lady Verinder desires it." [...] He added, in a whisper to me, as I was {{following}} the Sergeant out, [...] "I know what that <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say about Rachel; and I am too fond of her to hear it, and keep my temper. Leave me by myself." ...|$|E
60|$|He halted. In his boyish way {{the first}} thing he thought was that it was an ambush. He had a vision of that large man suspecting his {{presence}} and lying in wait for him with a revolver. This was not a comforting thought. Of course, if a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fire a revolver at you it makes little difference whether he is a giant or a pygmy, but Mr Pickering was in no frame of mind for nice reasoning. It was the thought of Bill's physique which kept him standing there irresolute.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. Are you {{the other}} <b>man</b> they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get? That's why Lord Dreever {{went up to}} London, {{to see if he}} couldn't find somebody.
