To control group of animals during 10 days were hypodermically entered by histochrome in a doze of 10 mg/kg (n = 15). Experimental animals preliminary oral received 50 mg/kg of chloramphenicol before three hours of histochrome introduction (n = 16). In both groups of animals measured volume daily excretion of water, creathinin, sodium and potassium ions excretions in experimental rats each two days. The initial level of parameters of excretory kidneys functions were estimated before introduction of preparations at animals. Long-term histochrome’s injection was followed by a fivefold increasing of water excretion and simultaneously creathinin growth one. Allocation of ions of sodium was statistically significantly increased by 11 -th day of experiment, and potassium ions – since the ninth day of histochrome injection. In conditions preliminary chloramphenicol applications volume daily daily urine output and creathinin excretion were essentially less control parameters. Allocation with urine of ions of sodium was decreased almost twice in comparison with the values, fixed at introduction histochrome. Excretion potassium ions ware corresponded to an initial level during all period of supervision.

The kinetics of inhibition by pyrazole or 4 -methylpyrazole in all microsomal preparations were mixed, as the Km for ethanol was elevated while Vmax was lowered. However, Ki values for pyrazole (about 0. 35 mM) and especially 4 -methylpyrazole (about 0. 03 - 0. 10 mM) were much lower than those found with the saline controls (about 0. 7 - 1. 1 mM).

Ethanol treatment resulted in a specific increase (3 -fold) of the <b>microsomal</b> ethanol <b>oxidation</b> and NADPH consumption per nmol of P- 450. A form of P- 450 was purified to apparent homogeneity from the ethanol-treated rats and characterized with respect of amino acid composition and N-terminal amino acid sequence. Specific ethanol induction of a cytochrome P- 450 species having a catalytic-centre activity of 20 /min for ethanol and consuming 30 nmol of NADPH/min could account for the results observed with microsomes. Phenobarbital treatment caused 50 % decrease in the rate of ethanol oxidation and NADPH oxidation per nmol of P- 450. The rate of oxidation of the hydroxyl-radical scavenger Me 2 SO was increased 3 -fold by ethanol or phenobarbital treatment when expressed on a per-mg-of-microsomal-protein basis, but the rate of Me 2 SO oxidation expressed on a per-nmol-of-P- 450 basis was unchanged. Addition of iron-chelating agents to the three different types of microsomal preparations caused an 'uncoupling' of the electron-transport chain accompanied by a 4 -fold increase of the rate of Me 2 SO oxidation.

Furthermore, certain metals inhibited ferrochela-tase activity but {{had no effect on}} cobalt chelatase. Although both delta aminolevulinic acid synthetase and ferrochelatase are located in a similar region in the mitochondria, the time course of induction for ferrochelatase is different than that observed for delta aminolevulinic acid synthetase. One of the earliest measurable responses to inducers of microsomal mixed function oxidase reactions is the induction of delta aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALAS), {{the catalyst}} for the first step in heme synthesis (1, 2,X). Within 2 hours after the administration of phenobarbital or 3, 4 -benzpyrene significant increases in ALAS are observed (3) which coincide with increased incorporation of glycine- 2 - 14 C into microsomal heme and which precede elevations in microsomal protoheme, P- 450 and certain <b>microsomal</b> <b>oxidations.</b> Since ALAS and ferrochelatase (protoheme ferrolyase) are both associated with the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (4, 5) and since ferrochelatase mediates the critical last step in heme synthesis, it was of interest to examine whether it is induced by phenobarbital and, if so, whether it would be increased at a rate which is similar to the rate of in-crease of ALAS.

Four analogues of SECO were used to investigate substituent effects on lignan metabolism and formation of reactive quinones. HPLC methods were developed for analysis of SECO analogues and their metabolites. The stability of SECO analogues (1 mM) in a 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 buffer at pH 6. 0 and 7. 4 were quantified. Enzymatic oxidation experiments using mushroom tyrosinase and microsomes harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats were performed with and without a GSH trapping system.

Life Technologies was contracted to perform IC 50 inhibition assays on SECO and the SECO analogues against CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5, CYP 2 C 9 and CYP 2 C 19 cytochrome P 450 isoforms. All SECO analogues were stable at pH 6. 0. SECO- 2 was stable at pH 7. 4 but SECO- 1, - 3 and - 4 were unstable at pH 7. 4. Autoxidation of SECO - 1, - 3 and - 4 were 1 st order reactions with t 1 / 2 of 9. 0 h, 1. 7 h and 7. 0 h respectively. Mushroom tyrosinase oxidations were performed to generate ortho-quinone standards. SECO- 1 - 3 and - 4 were oxidized by mushroom tyrosinase but SECO- 2 was not.

The process was strongly inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium, a known inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, and by nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of lipoxygenases. This led us to suggest that both enzymes could be involved. With the purpose of identifying natural compounds present in food with the ability to decrease the production of acetaldehyde in mammary tissue, in the present studies, several plant polyphenols having inhibitory effects on lipoxygenases and of anti-oxidant nature were tested as potential inhibitors of the rat mammary tissue microsomal pathway of ethanol oxidation. We included in the present screening study 32 polyphenols having ready availability and that were also tested against the rat mammary tissue cytosolic metabolism of ethanol to acetaldehyde. Several polyphe-nols were also able to inhibit the <b>microsomal</b> ethanol <b>oxidation</b> at concentrations as low was 1050 mM. The results of these screening experiments suggest the potential of several plant polyphenols to prevent in vivo production and accumulation of acetaldehyde in mammary tissue...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{deficit in}} concentration of cytochrome P- 450 and in activity of drug-oxidative and electron transport enzymes in liver microsomes of newborn rats and rabbits has been shown. In rats, {{the rate of}} maturational development of drug-oxidative activity appears to be limited by development of electron transfer capacity, while in rabbits there is a closer relationship between increasing drug <b>oxidation</b> and increasing <b>microsomal</b> concentration of P- 450. In immature male rats, NADPR cytochrome P- 450 reductase activity increases more gradually than microsomal P- 450 and consequently drug oxidation remains below adult levels until 5 weeks of age although P- 450 reaches adult concentration by 3 weeks of age. This underdevelopment of mechanisms for the reduction of P- 450 may be partly overcome in vitro through enhancement of NADPR cytochrome P- 450 reductase by a Type l substrate (aminopyrine). Phenobarbital {{has been shown to}} "induce" all components of hepatic microsomal drug metabolism to adult levels or greater within 2 weeks of birth and this implies that the gene-expression system in the newborn rat hepatocyte is complete and capable of full synthetic activity in response to appropriate exogenous or endogenous stimuli. Preliminary data from humans suggest age-related deficiencies in hepatic <b>microsomal</b> drug <b>oxidation</b> and electron transport during infancy and during the sixth decade of life...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{investigations}} exist {{about the}} alterations that oxygen free radicals can provoke on biomolecules; these modifications {{can be prevented}} and/or reversed by different antioxidants agents. On the other hand, 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), a stable nitrogen synthetic radical, is {{used to evaluate the}} antioxidant capacity of medicinal herbal products; however, the structural changes that this radical provoke on the herbal active principles are not clear yet. In this work, we compared the redox reactivity of oxygen free radicals and DPPH radical on phospholipids and protein thiol groups present in rat liver microsomes. Cu 2 +/ascorbate was used as generator system of oxygen free radical and as antioxidant, an extract of Buddleja globosa’s leaves. Cu 2 +/ascorbate provoked microsomal lipid peroxidation, <b>microsomal</b> thiols <b>oxidation</b> and oxygen consumption; all of these phenomena were inhibited by B. globosa extract. On the other hand, DPPH was bleached in different extension by the herbal extract and phosphatidyl choline; beside, DPPH decreased microsomal thiols content, but this phenomenon were not prevented by the herbal extract. Furthermore, DPPH did not induce oxygen consumption and neither modified the oxygen consumption induced by Cu 2 +/ascorbate. Distinct redox mechanisms may explain the differences between the reactivity of DPPH and oxygen free radicals on biomolecules, which is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out to {{characterize}} and compare the effects of pyrazole and 4 -methylpyrazole, potent inhibitors of alcohol dehydrogenase, on <b>microsomal</b> <b>oxidation</b> {{of a variety of}} drugs and alcohols. Whereas pyrazole treatment of rats (200 mg/kg b. wt. /day for 2 days) resulted in an enrichment of a cytochrome P- 450 isozyme with a molecular weight of about 52, 000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, 4 -methylpyrazole treatment re-suited in increased amounts of two or three P. 450 isozymes, one of which appeared to be similar to the isozyme increased by pyrazole. The qualitative induction of two or three isozymes of P- 450 as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis correlates with a 2 -fold increase in total content of P- 450 by 4 -methylpyrazole. Microsomes from the pyrazole-treated rats dis-played increased activity (expressed per milligram of protein o...|$|E

40|$|Ethanol is metabolized to {{acetaldehyde}} {{mainly by}} the alcohol dehydrogenase pathway and, {{to a lesser}} extent, through <b>microsomal</b> <b>oxidation</b> (CYP 2 E 1) and the catalase-H 2 O 2 system. Acetaldehyde, {{which is responsible for}} some of the deleterious effects of ethanol, is further oxidized to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), of which mitochondrial ALDH 2 is the most efficient. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model for ethanol metabolism by cloning, expressing, and characterizing the zebrafish ALDH 2. The zebrafish ALDH 2 cDNA was cloned and found to be 1892 bp in length and encoding a protein of 516 amino acids (M r � 56, 562), approximately 75 % identical to mammalian ALDH 2 proteins. Recombinant zebrafish ALDH 2 protein was expressed using the baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography.

40|$|Cobalt ions (Co 2 +) are potent {{inducers}} of haem oxygenase in {{liver and}} inhibit <b>microsomal</b> drug <b>oxidation</b> probably by depleting microsomal haem and cytochrome P- 450. Complexing of Co 2 + ions with cysteine or glutathione (GSH) blocked {{ability of the}} former to induce haem oxygenase. When hepatic GSH content was depleted by treatment of animals with diethyl maleate, the inducing effect of Co 2 + on haem oxygenase was significantly augmented. Other metal ions such as Cr 2 +, Mn 2 +, Fe 2 +, Fe 3 +, Ni 2 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Cd 2 +, Hg 2 + and Pb 2 + were also capable of inducing haem oxygenase and depleting microsomal haem and cytochrome P- 450. None of these metal ions had a stimulatory effect on hepatic haem oxidation activity in vitro. It is suggested that the inducing action of Co 2 + and other metal ions on microsomal haem oxygenase involves either the covalent binding of the metal ions to some cellular component concerned directly with regulating haem oxygenase or non-specific complex-formation by the metal ions, which depletes some regulatory system in liver cells of an essential component involved in controlling synthesis or activity of the enzyme...|$|R
40|$|CLASSIFICATION: {{hormonal}} agent Special pediatric considerations are noted when applicable, otherwise adult provisions apply. MECHANISM OF ACTION: Nilutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen which competitively inhibits the binding of androgens to the androgen receptor. 1 It is devoid of other endocrine activity. Nilutamide is structurally and pharmacologically related to bicalutamide and flutamide. Prostate {{cancer is a}} mostly androgen-dependent cancer and can be treated with surgical or medical castration. Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists (LHRHa) suppress pituitary release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and result in medical castration. Unlike medical castration, nonsteroidal antiandrogens do not decrease the production of androgens. The initial stimulation of the pituitary caused by LHRHa produces an acute increase in the concentration of plasma testosterone accompanied by temporary worsening of symptoms (flare reaction). To avoid the flare reaction, antiandrogens should be given concurrently with the first administration of LHRHa. Antiandrogens are also used in combination with LHRHa to inhibit the effects of testicular and adrenal androgens (maximum androgen blockade). In some patients with metastatic prostate cancer (15 - 20 %), 2 antiandrogen withdrawal {{may lead to a}} paradoxical decrease in serum prostate-specific antigen level (antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome). 1 PHARMACOKINETICS: Oral Absorption rapid and complete steady-state achieved within 14 days cross blood brain barrier? no information found volume of distribution no information found Distribution plasma protein binding 84 % hepatic, involves the hepatic <b>microsomal</b> enzyme <b>oxidation</b> system active metabolite hydroxymethylnitro derivative Metabolism inactive metabolite(s) 3 hydroxylated derivatives and secondary alcohols urine 3, 4 < 78 %, < 1 - 3 % unchanged feces 1 - 7 % terminal half life 56 h (range 23 - 87 h) Excretion clearance no information found Adapted from standard reference 1 unless specified otherwise.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to other metabolic functions, {{the role of}} dietary antioxidants and oil on <b>microsomal</b> lipid <b>oxidation</b> has been less extensively studied. This study examines ascorbate−Fe 2 + and NADPH-induced lipid peroxidation of hepatic microsomes of rats that were fed for three weeks high-oleic-acid oils (high-oleic sunflower oil, HOSO; olive oil, OO; or olive pomace oil, OPO) containing different concentrations of the antioxidants α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid. The fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes of Wistar rats that were fed for three weeks with the above-mentioned oils had lower proportions of C 16 : 0, C 18 : 2 n 6, and C 22 : 6 n 3 and higher proportions of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 n 9 than rats fed the control diet. Light emission by hepatic microsomes increased, in the first 180 min, 2 -fold after ascorbate-Fe 2 + addition compared with NADPH addition. Both increases were less pronounced in microsomes of OPO-fed rats and to a smaller extent in microsomes of OO-fed rats. Smaller increases in light emission were associated positively with higher concentrations of dietary α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, and oleanolic acid but were not associated with changes in fatty acid composition of hepatic microsomes. Addition of α-tocopherol, erythrodiol, or oleanolic acid decreased light emission of hepatic microsomes with a greater inhibition in microsomes of rats fed the control diet. Our data suggest that erythrodiol and oleanolic acids partly explain the protective effect of dietary OPO on microsomal lipid peroxidation in rats.
