50|$|Early {{records of}} {{education}} in Metamora date back to 1836, a time which saw classes being held in a log house by Betty Page. The village's first public school was built in 1845. This building was sold in 1850 and a more substantial two-story building was constructed {{on the corner of}} Partridge and Hanover Streets, offering a one-year high school curriculum. This structure was used until 1872 when it burnt down and a new building was built in its place. Built at a cost of $8000 by Soloman E. Egbert, the two-story brick building featured 4 rooms, a grammar department being on the lower floor and a high school being on the second. With an enrollment of 32 students and 4 teachers in its first year of operation in its new building, the school added a second year to its secondary curriculum in 1878. In 1896, another teacher was added at the intermediate level and a third year was added to the high school program. During this time, the Sisters of Saint Francis operated an orphanage on Madison Street in the village. When the orphanage moved to Peoria in 1915, the Metamora school board purchased the grounds, added a fourth year and several additional classes to the secondary curriculum, and established Metamora Township High School District 122.Metamora Township High School was established on October 11, 1915 and has functioned as a public high school ever since. With an original enrollment of 60, the school has experienced much growth and expansion since then. Most recently, profound population growth in both Metamora and neighboring Germantown Hills saw a massive expansion of MTHS in 2000. In 2008, MTHS moved toward alternative energy with the construction of a 165-foot <b>meteorological</b> <b>tower</b> adjacent to the school's grounds, aimed at educating students about weather science and assessing the possibility of a permanent wind turbine to power the school.|$|E

Atmospheric dispersion from this site is of concern for routine operations and for potential Incidents during waste retrieval operations. Indian lands are located In the dominant downwind direction within 500 m from the site and provide further incentive to understand the potential and actual impacts of waste disposal operations. The permanent network of <b>meteorological</b> <b>towers</b> at LANL have been located primarily at mesa-top locations to coincide with most laboratory facilities and as such do not resolve the effects of channeling in the canyons and the influence this has on potential surface releases.
