40|$|Introduction: Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) is a {{very common}} condition in clinical practice, affecting an estimated 50 % of all adult women during a lifetime. The most common causative agent is E. coli; UTI may also be caused by S. saprophyticus, Enterobacteria (Klebsiella sp and Serratia sp.), Enterococcus sp., and P aeruginosa. Recurrent UTIs occur at least twice per semester {{or three times a}} year. Prophylactic measures to prevent recurrent UTIs include changes in contraception methods, cranberry products, increased fluid intake, urination after intercourse, vaginal estrogen therapy for post-menopausal women, antibiotics, and urinary tract antiseptic agents. Objectives: To evaluate the use of a combination of methenamine and methyl-thioninium chloride in the prophylaxis of recurrent uncomplicated lower UTIs, with respect to: • Signs and symptoms of UTI • Etiologic agent(s) • Recurrence rates • Need for antibiotic therapy in case of recurrence • Incidence of adverse events associated with the treatment, including any reported alterations of laboratory tests Materials & methods: A descriptive, analytic, restrospective study was performed at Hospital Universitário Constantino Otaviano - UNIFESO. Medical charts from patients presenting recurrent uncomplicated lower UTI attended from 2001 -present were analyzed, including the following information: Demographic data (age, gender, weight, ethnicity, living conditions) : medical history/signs and symptoms of UTI; identification of treatment and dosing regimens; treatment duration; recurrence rates and need for antibiotic therapy in case of recurrence; other medications prescribed; and records of adverse events. Results: E. coli was identified as etiologic agent in 80 % of the patients. Following antibiotic therapy, all patients received prophylactic treatment with the combination of methenamine and <b>methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Treatment duration ranged from three to six months. Adverse events were observed in 13 / 60 patients (21. 7 %). At the end of the respective treatment periods, a statistically significant (p< 0. 0001) number of patients showed no UTI recurrence. Conclusion: Based on the results from the collected data, we conclude that an orally administered combination of methenamine and <b>methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride</b> is safe and effective in the prophylactic treatment of recurrent uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. © Copyright Morelra Jr. Editora...|$|E
40|$|Methaemoglobinaemia {{can cause}} {{significant}} tissue hypoxia, leading to severe, potentially life-threatening clinical features and/or death. Over recent years {{there have been}} increasing reports of methaemoglobinaemia related to recreational drug use. There have been 25 articles describing methaemoglobinaemia related to recreational use of volatile nitrites (poppers) and more recently, four reports of methaemoglobinaemia in association with recreational cocaine use. In this article we discuss the mechanisms by which methaemoglobinaemia occurs {{in relation to the}} use of both volatile nitrites and cocaine, and summarize the published cases of recreational drug-related methaemoglobinaemia. The volatile nitrites can cause methaemoglobinaemia directly through their activity as oxidizing agents. However, with cocaine, methaemoglobinaemia is related to adulterants such as local anaesthetics or phenacetin, rather than to the cocaine itself. Clinicians managing patients with acute recreational drug toxicity {{should be aware of the}} potential for methaemoglobinaemia in these patients, particularly in patients with cyanosis or unexplained low oxygen saturations on pulse oximetry, and ensure that appropriate and timely management is provided, including, where appropriate, the use of <b>methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride</b> (methylene blue) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} substance of A. chinense saponins (ACSs) was isolated using ethanol extraction and purified with the D 101 macroporous adsorption resin approach. We investigated the anticancer activity of ACSs in the B 16 melanoma and 4 T 1 breast carcinoma cell lines. <b>Methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride</b> and hematoxylin-eosin staining with Giemsa dyestuff were used when {{the cells were}} treated with ACSs. The {{results showed that the}} cells morphologies changed significantly; ACSs induced cell death in B 16 and 4 T 1 cells based on acridine orange/ethidium bromide double fluorescence staining, with the number and degree of apoptotic tumor cells increasing as ACS concentration increased. ACSs inhibited the proliferation of B 16 and 4 T 1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. They also inhibited cell migration and colony formation and exhibited a concentration-dependent effect. In addition, ACSs apparently inhibited the growth of melanoma in vivo. The preliminary antitumor in vivo assay revealed that early medication positively affected tumor inhibition action and effectively protected the liver and spleen of C 57 BL/ 6 mice from injury. This study provides evidence for the cytotoxicity of ACSs and a strong foundation for further research to establish the theoretical basis for cell death and help in the design and development of new anticancer drugs...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{trials of}} drugs aimed at {{preventing}} or clearing β-amyloid pathology {{have failed to}} demonstrate efficacy {{in recent years and}} further trials continue with drugs aimed at the same targets and mechanisms. The Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangle is composed of tau and the core of its constituent filaments are made of a truncated fragment from the repeat domain of tau. This truncated tau can catalyse the conversion of normal soluble tau into aggregated oligomeric and fibrillar tau which, in turn, can spread to neighbouring neurons. Tau aggregation is not a late-life process and onset of Braak stage 1 peaks in people in their late 40 s or early 50 s. Tau aggregation pathology at Braak stage 1 or beyond affects 50 % of the population over the age of 45. The initiation of tau aggregation requires its binding to a non-specific substrate to expose a high affinity tau–tau binding domain and it is self-propagating thereafter. The initiating substrate complex is most likely formed as a consequence of a progressive loss of endosomal–lysosomal processing of neuronal proteins, particularly of membrane proteins from mitochondria. Mutations in the APP/presenilin membrane complex may simply add to the age-related endosomal–lysosomal processing failure, bringing forward, but not directly causing, the tau aggregation cascade in carriers. <b>Methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride</b> (MTC), the first identified tau aggregation inhibitor (TAI), offers an alternative to the amyloid approach. Phase 3 trials are underway with a novel stabilized reduced form of methylthioninium (LMTX) that has improved tolerability and absorption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential efficacy of staining with <b>methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride</b> (MC) for the diagnosis of fungal keratitis. A total of 70 cases of fungal keratitis were included in the study from January 2009 to December 2010. The corneal scraping specimens of the patients were collected and stained with MC or a 10 % potassium hydroxide (KOH) ‑based smear prior to microscopic examination. The staining results were confirmed with fungal culture and strain identification, which are recognized as ‘gold standards ’ for the diagnosis of fungal keratitis. Among the 70 cases of fungal keratitis, 58 cases were positive and the positive rate was 82. 86 %. MC staining showed a positive rate of 62. 86 %, with higher levels of sensitivity (70. 69 %) and specificity (34. 61 %) compared with staining with the 10 % KOH‑based smear. The KOH‑based smear showed a positive rate of 44. 29 % (P< 0. 05), a level of sensitivity of 44. 83 % (P< 0. 05) and a specificity of 17. 95 % (P< 0. 05). In addition, the MC staining showed false positive and negative rates of 25. 00 and 29. 31 %, respectively, an accuracy index of 5. 30 % and positive and negative predictive values of 93. 18 and 34. 61 %, respectively. The results indicate that MC staining is a fast and effective method for the early diagnosis of fungal keratitis...|$|E
40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} carried out in {{patients}} with neuropathic pain in order to assess the analgesic effects and changes in protein biomarkers after the administration of methylene blue (MB), a diaminophenothiazine with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and with inhibitory effects on nitric oxide. Materials and methods: Ten patients with chronic refractory neuropathic pain were randomized to receive either MB (10 mg/mL <b>Methylthioninium</b> <b>chloride)</b> 2 mg/kg (MB group) or MB 0. 02 mg/kg (control group) infused over 60 minutes. Sensory function and pain (Numerical Rating Scale) were evaluated at baseline and at 60 minutes after the start of the infusion. The patients kept a pain diary during the next 24 hours and for the following 4 days. Plasma and urinary concentrations of 8 -isoprostane-prostaglandin F 2 α (8 -iso-PGF 2 α) and plasma protein biomarkers prior to and after the infusions were measured with radioimmunoassay and with proximity extension assay. Results: A decrease of the Numerical Rating Scale at 60 minutes in comparison with baseline was observed in the MB (P= 0. 047) group. The decrease was significant between the MB and the control group on the day of and day after MB infusion (P= 0. 04 and P= 0. 008, respectively). There was no difference in systemic protein expressions between groups except for prolactin (PRL) (P= 0. 02). Three patients demonstrated diminished dynamic mechanical allodynia. Conclusion: MB decreased the pain levels in patients with chronic therapy-resistant neuropathic pain on the first 2 days after administration. Known as an endocrine modulator on the anterior pituitary gland, MB infusion produced a decrease of PRL. The detailed role of PRL effects in chronic neuropathic pain remains undetermined...|$|E
