6000|$|... "And to my aunt!" [...] exclaimed Gertrude. [...] "I wish <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> {{be persuaded}} to dispose of his estates in Carolina, and come northward, to reside the whole year." ...|$|E
60|$|OCTAVIUS. Yes: we {{must face}} it, Mr Ramsden. But I owed {{him a great}} deal. He did {{everything}} for me that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> have done if he had lived.|$|E
60|$|FOR {{the rest}} of the day, and through the night, I was kept a close {{prisoner}} in my room, watched by a man on whose fidelity <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> depend.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should scarce {{have brought}} you, Richard," [...] said Lord Talbot, {{as soon as}} they had left the {{presence}} chamber, [...] "had I known you would venture on such folly. Know you not how incensed she is? Naught but your proved loyalty and <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> <b>could</b> have borne you off this time, and it would be small marvel to me if the lad's appointment were forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>my</b> <b>father</b> knew--he <b>could</b> stop this!" [...] wailed Elsie, {{in sudden}} {{realization}} of her helplessness. [...] "He could wire {{the authorities in}} Pinon City. I know they would listen to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{clung to}} <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> I <b>could</b> hold him tight in the dark, and the flambeaux only {{cast in a}} fitful {{flickering}} light. 'Oh, sir,' said I, 'you cannot wish to part with your little Meg!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can have}} become of Doctor Rochecliffe?" [...] said Alice; [...] "he {{that is so}} ready with advice;--where can they be gone? Oh, if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> but rouse himself!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The jackass in Goroko, you mean," [...] I interrupted. [...] "How can you, {{who are a}} Christian, talk such rubbish about spirits? I {{only wish}} that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> hear you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was not the}} dinner, but the man," [...] said Norman. [...] "It is {{incomprehensible to}} me how <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> take to him. I'd as soon have Harvey Anderson for a friend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Man," [...] {{she said}} to him, [...] "I have seen you shoe many of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> nags. Who <b>could</b> have thought that you would live to use your honest skill upon his daughter!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LESLIE. What is my honour {{but your}} happiness? In what else does it consist? Is it in denying me my heart? {{is it in}} visiting another's sin upon the innocent? Could I do that, and be my mother's son? Could I do that, and bear <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> name? <b>Could</b> I do that, and have ever been found worthy of you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True! I had {{not thought}} of that. But, {{instead of going to}} <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I <b>could</b> {{denounce}} the rascal to the city magistrate on suspicion of having abducted my sister. Van der Meer would give me the command of the town guard sent out to arrest him, I could search him myself and take possession of all his papers ere I bring him before the magistrate." ...|$|R
6000|$|I can't move, or breathe, or think--if I {{could only}} be taken back--if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> see me as I am now! Night again--the dreams that will come--always of home; sometimes, the untried home in heaven, {{as well as the}} {{familiar}} home on earth-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came, {{hoping for}} forgiveness; but he, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>could</b> {{not forget the}} past. I found him living in grim and fierce solitude, shunned and dreaded by every one, ever {{brooding}} over my sin and his dishonour. He made me stay, yet he cursed me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think thee what {{thou art}} saying, Bertrade?" [...] he cried. [...] "Dost forget that I be a low-born knave, knowing not {{my own mother}} and {{questioning}} even the identity of <b>my</b> <b>father?</b> <b>Could</b> a De Montfort face the world with such a man for husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fool!" [...] she answered. [...] "Fool! I've known <b>my</b> own <b>father,</b> who <b>could</b> put a {{dozen of}} you in his pipe and push them down with his finger-end. Don't I know what a fool you are!" ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{the opening}} verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking {{for a way}} out of this confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of <b>my</b> <b>fathers,</b> <b>could</b> you carry me home." [...] In his {{interpretation}} of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained [...] "Gil sings of 'looking {{for a way out}}' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he’s too far away from home, there is no way out—instead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar." [...] Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the [...] "river" [...] to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently says [...] "Africa".|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Wellmere!" [...] cried young Wharton {{in astonishment}} as they entered, [...] "has the fortune of war been thus cruel to you also? But {{you are welcome}} {{to the house of}} <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> {{although}} I <b>could</b> wish the introduction to have taken place under more happy circumstances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louisa!" [...] roared {{my father}} down the kitchen stairs, [...] "are you all asleep? Here have I {{had to answer}} the front door myself." [...] Then my father strode into his office, and the door slammed. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> be very angry when nobody was by.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Most likely,' said Felix; 'but {{if there}} had been any good in my hearing, <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> have told me himself. How well I {{remember}} his giving me my first ride along this lane! Do you smell the bean field? I don't believe I have thought of the scent since.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Harvey sat up, mopped his nose, {{and told}} the story of the missing wad of bills. [...] "I'm not crazy," [...] he wound up. [...] "Only--your father has never seen more than a five-dollar bill at a time, and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> buy up this boat once a week and never miss it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> and I <b>could</b> {{not help}} {{laughing}} at the rough sailor's very unorthodox way of proclaiming his orthodoxy. The mate, however, was evidently in deadly earnest, and proceeded to state his case, marking off the different points upon the rough, red fingers of his left hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} thank you before <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> but neither <b>could</b> I {{let you go}} without a word," [...] she said, with a quiet {{composure}} which, because she must have guessed at the struggle within him, was the badge of courage. [...] "You have won my undying gratitude, and----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{wondered}} why I asked you those questions. I will tell you. You {{did not see}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> affix his signature to either of those documents. The one being certainly the transfer of some of Cumming's shares to him. The other being, as I believe, the mortgage that, as you doubtless heard, Mr. Brander held over <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> estate. How <b>could</b> you tell those two signatures were not clever forgeries?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> deny her nothing, {{though he}} {{showed that the}} sight of her made the entreaty all the harder to him; and she pleaded, 'But you know this was not his doing. I never was strong, and it had begun before. Only think how sad it would have been for him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Why I {{bought them}} I {{did not know}} at the time, and I do not know now. My mother cried when she saw them. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> get no further than: [...] "But {{what are you going}} to do with them?" [...] to which I was unable to reply. My aunt, alone, {{attempted}} comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not let me}} take a farm? <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>could,</b> at any rate, {{manage a}} couple of {{thousand}} pounds or so for me to stock it. That would not be asking much. If he could not give it me, I would not scruple to borrow so much elsewhere." [...] And Frank bethought him of all Miss Dunstable's offers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{childhood}} and adolescence that Shearer once described as [...] "a pleasant dream" [...] ended in 1918, when her father's company collapsed and older sister, Athole, suffered her first serious mental breakdown. Forced {{to move into a}} small, dreary house in a [...] "modest" [...] Montreal suburb, the sudden plunge into poverty only strengthened Shearer's determined attitude: [...] "At an early age, I formed a philosophy about failure. Perhaps an endeavor, like <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> business, <b>could</b> fail, but that didn't mean Father had failed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] said Mr. Dashwood, [...] "I {{believe you}} are {{perfectly}} right. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> certainly <b>could</b> mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described. When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{can picture}} his outbursts {{at the very}} thought of it; I can hear him reasoning, upbraiding, storming. But he was as an ocean of energy hurling himself against the impassive rock of my mother's pietistic obstinacy. She had vowed me to the service of Holy Church, and she would suffer tribulation and death so that her vow should be fulfilled. And hers was a manner against which that strong man, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> never <b>could</b> prevail. She would stand before him white-faced and mute, never presuming to return an answer to his {{pleading}} or to enter into argument.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure, Banks, that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> have known nothing of those letters, or of any plot against William's life. I have heard him speak so often of the {{assassination}} plot, and how disgraceful it was, and how, apart from its wickedness, it had damaged the cause, that I am certain {{he would not have}} listened to a word about another such business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That thick English air has dimmed your wits, cousin,' said she, {{shaking her}} stately head at me. 'But I can speak freely now that I {{know that this}} plan would be as hateful to you as to me. You must know, then, that if <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>could</b> have married us he would have united all claims to the {{succession}} of Grosbois. Then, come what might--Bourbon or Buonaparte--nothing could shake his position.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is old Andries over again! He {{was poor}} enough, heaven knows; and I {{have known him}} {{actually}} suffer, {{in order to do}} his duty by this girl, and to make a proper appearance at the same time, as a captain in the New York line; yet none of us, not even <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>could</b> ever induce him to borrow a single dollar. He would give, but he would not receive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was married}} to M. Adrien Cazalès a month ago," [...] she said, [...] "but we had perforce to keep our {{marriage}} a secret, because Mr. Farewell once vowed to me that unless I became his wife he would destroy all my papers of identification, and then--even if I ever succeeded in discovering who were the English lawyers who had charge of <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> money--I <b>could</b> never prove it to them that I {{and no one else}} was entitled to it. But for you, dear M. Ratichon," [...] added the cruel and shameless one, [...] "I should indeed never have succeeded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{was then}} {{carefully}} replaced {{as they had}} found it; and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> at once rode off, with six of the leading tenants--three Protestants and three Catholics--and laid a complaint before the general. The latter professed himself much shocked, and lamented the impossibility of keeping strict discipline among the various regiments stationed in the towns. However, he went down with them at once to the barracks of the regiment, ordered them to be formed up, and asked <b>my</b> <b>father</b> if he <b>could</b> identify the culprits.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not mad," [...] I cried energetically; [...] "the {{sun and the}} heavens, {{who have}} viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the assassin of those most {{innocent}} victims; they died by my machinations. A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have saved their lives; but I <b>could</b> not, <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> indeed I <b>could</b> not sacrifice the whole human race." ...|$|R
