50|$|In 2006, Huberman cofounded Novadrug. He and {{his team}} focus their {{research}} on developing broad spectrum anti-viral drugs. Novadrug received an NIH grant totalling $245, 000 in 2010 {{for the development of}} novel anti-hepatitis C virus drugs from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program. Huberman holds numerous patents, most recent being a patent for a drug that treats Hepatitis C, but is also promising in the treatment of both Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> <b>disease</b> for which Novadrug has an ongoing collaboration with the U.S. Army. Novadrug has several other patents pending approval.|$|E

40|$|Uganda has {{reported}} five (5) Ebola virus disease outbreaks and three (3) <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>disease</b> outbreaks from 2000 to 2016. Peoples' knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>disease</b> impact on {{control and prevention}} measures especially during outbreaks. We describe knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks in two affected communities in Uganda to inform future outbreak responses and help {{in the design of}} health education and communication messages. The study was a community survey done in Luweero, Ibanda and Kamwenge districts that have experienced outbreaks of Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>diseases.</b> Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire and triangulated with qualitative participatory epidemiology techniques to gain a communities' knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>disease.</b> Out of 740 respondents, 48. 5 % (359 / 740) were categorized as being knowledgeable about Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>diseases,</b> whereas 60. 5 % (448 / 740) were having a positive attitude towards control and prevention of Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>diseases.</b> The mean knowledge and attitude percentage scores were 54. 3 (SD = 23. 5, 95 %CI = 52. 6 - 56. 0) and 69. 9 (SD = 16. 9, 95 %CI = 68. 9 - 71. 1) respectively. People educated beyond primary school {{were more likely to be}} knowledgeable about Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>disease</b> than those who did not attain any formal education (OR = 3. 6, 95 %CI = 2. 1 - 6. 1). Qualitative data revealed that communities describe Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>diseases</b> as very severe diseases with no cure and they believe the diseases spread so fast. Respondents reported fear and stigma suffered by survivors, their families and the broader community due to these diseases. Communities in Uganda affected by filovirus outbreaks have moderate knowledge about these diseases and have a positive attitude towards practices to prevent and control Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> viral <b>diseases.</b> The public health sector should enhance this community knowledge gap to empower them more by supplying educational materials for epidemic preparedness in future using appropriate communication channels as proposed by the communities...|$|R

40|$|<b>Marburg's</b> <b>disease</b> (MD) is an {{extremely}} rare and aggressive form of multiple sclerosis (MS). In some cases, MD presents with tumefactive demyelinating lesions with a “tumor-like” appearance in MRI images, for which {{it may be difficult}} to achieve a form of differential diagnosis between definitive tumors or abscesses. Here we report a case of MD histopathologically confirmed after neuronavigationguided biopsy. Postoperative course was uneventful and following discharge, the patient attended outpatient follow-up appointments and received i. v. cyclophopsphamide, achieving progressive clinical remission. A nine-month follow-up brain MRI scan with gadolinium showed no signs of progressing demyelinating disease with an evident reduction of the biopsied lesion, and almost complete retrogression of the other two lesions. In our opinion, and through the analysis of currently available literature, early neuronavigation-guided biopsy is a highly recommend, valuable, and safe diagnostic tool; it is also preferable to stereotactic biopsy, since its benefits include a very low bleeding rate and brain damage risk, with minimum mortality and morbidity rates. It also allows the identification of the specific histological pattern, helping to select the best medical treatment approach and contributing to increase patient outcome and life expectancy...|$|R

Eligibility criteria initially included comparative studies on Ebola and <b>Marburg</b> virus <b>diseases</b> reported in English or French, but criteria were expanded to studies on other viral hemorrhagic fevers and non-comparative designs due to the paucity of studies. After title and abstract screening (two people to exclude), full-text reports of potentially relevant articles were assessed in duplicate. Fifty-seven percent of extraction information was verified. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to inform the quality of evidence assessments. Thirty non-comparative studies (8 related to Ebola virus disease) were located, and 27 provided data on viral transmission. Reporting of personal protective equipment components and infection prevention and control protocols was generally poor.
