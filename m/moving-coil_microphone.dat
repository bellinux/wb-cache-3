5|$|Elgar {{has been}} {{described}} as the first composer to take the gramophone seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings of his works. The introduction of the <b>moving-coil</b> <b>microphone</b> in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{microphone}} (also {{known as the}} <b>moving-coil</b> <b>microphone)</b> works via electromagnetic induction. They are robust, relatively inexpensive and resistant to moisture. This, coupled with their potentially high gain before feedback, makes them ideal for on-stage use.|$|E
2500|$|In a <b>moving-coil</b> <b>microphone,</b> the {{diaphragm}} {{is attached to}} a light movable coil that generates a voltage as it moves {{back and forth between the}} poles of a permanent magnet. In ribbon microphones, a light metal ribbon is suspended between the poles of a magnet. As the ribbon vibrates, a voltage is induced at right angles to both the ribbon velocity and magnetic field direction and is picked off by contacts at the ends of the ribbon. [...] Ribbon microphones are also called [...] "velocity microphones" [...] because the induced voltage is proportional to the velocity of the ribbon and thus of the air particles in the sound wave, unlike in some other microphones where the voltage is proportional to the displacement of {{the diaphragm}} and the air.|$|E

50|$|The rugged {{elements}} of <b>moving-coil</b> <b>microphones</b> {{can have a}} dynamic range of up to 140 dB (at increased distortion), while condenser microphones are limited by the overloading of their associated electronic circuitry. Practical considerations of acceptable distortion levels in microphones combined with typical practices in a recording studio result in a useful operating range of 125 dB.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, the German audio {{equipment}} manufacturer Sennheiser, {{at that time}} called Lab W, working with the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), exhibited a wireless microphone system. From 1958 the system was marketed through Telefunken {{under the name of}} Mikroport. The pocket-sized Mikroport incorporated a dynamic <b>moving-coil</b> cartridge <b>microphone</b> with a cardioid pickup pattern. It transmitted at 37 MHz with a specified range of 300 ft.|$|R
