5|$|The {{onset of}} World War I {{led to his}} leaving Eatons and enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force serving in Europe, but seeing little if any action.

50|$|Dillon {{eventually}} <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to France, {{where he}} met Barthélemy de Lesseps, the only living survivor of the La Pérouse expedition. De Lesseps had served the expedition as a Russian interpreter; he'd left the expedition in Petropavlovsk, Siberia and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> overland <b>back</b> to Europe. He identified the items brought back by Dillon as items that had been carried on the French ships.|$|R

5|$|Captain Robert L. Cardenas, USAAF, {{served as}} a B-24 {{aircraft}} pilot in the European Theater of Operations with the 506th Bombardment Squadron. He was awarded the Air Medal and two oak leaf clusters for bombing missions before being shot down over Germany in March 1944. Despite head wounds from flak, he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Allied control. On October 14, 1947, Cardenas flew the B-29 launch aircraft that released the X-1 experimental rocket plane in which Charles E. Yeager became {{the first man to}} fly faster than the speed of sound. Cardenas retired as brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E

Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed {{to stay at the}} hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got visits from the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E
5|$|James Abbott McNeill Whistler {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son of George Washington Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on Whistler.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz {{volunteered to}} help defend Ceuta against the Moors in 1790 {{and was given}} command of an {{artillery}} battery. He remained in North Africa {{to assist with the}} defence of Oran in 1791, spending part of the time with a unit of miners. Daoíz was commended by his superiors, including artillery Brigadier Andres Aznar, for his courage and zeal in the battles and was promoted to lieutenant on 28 February 1792. After Spain joined the First Coalition against Revolutionary France, Daoíz participated in the War of Roussillon, in the Pyrenees, from March 1794 but was captured in a French counterattack on 25 November 1794. He was held as a prisoner of war at Toulouse where he turned down an offer of freedom and a commission in the French Army, which was short of artillery officers. After the Peace of Basel ended the war between France and Spain on 22 July 1795, Daoíz was released and <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to El Puerto de Santa Maria.|$|E
50|$|Brincat played 103 {{times for}} the Maltese {{national}} football team, scoring five goals.

Brincat is in third place for the all time list of appearances for the Maltese national team.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} claimed in popular literature, {{following}} a conjecture by the amateur historian Kenneth McIntyre in 1977, that {{the ruins of}} an old stone building at Bittangabee Bay represents {{the remains of a}} 16th century Portuguese fort, testifying to the putative Portuguese priority in the discovery of Australia. For McIntyre it was a wintering place erected by Cristóvão de Mendonça as he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> imagined <b>way</b> <b>back</b> up the coast from Corio Bay. The ruin actually is what is left of a structure partially raised, but left unfinished, dating to the 1840s.|$|R
60|$|As {{none of the}} porters {{spoke to}} him, Foster thought he had managed the thing neatly and made it {{look as if he}} had come to see {{somebody}} off instead of having been left behind. For all that, he waited a minute or two, studying a time-table, to avoid the risk of overtaking the hotel porter; and then <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> by <b>back</b> streets out of the town. For some miles, the road he took ran south up a well-cultivated valley, past turnip and stubble fields and smooth pasture; and then changed to a rough stony track that climbed a hill.|$|R
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited {{by the idea of}} leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to London.|$|E
5|$|Brannan {{was born}} in Saco, Maine, to Thomas and Sarah Emery Brannan. Because of {{problems}} with his abusive father, when he was fourteen years old Brannan moved with his sister (Mary Ann) and her husband (Alexander) to Painesville, Ohio. It was there that Brannan learned the printer's trade. During their journey to Ohio, the trio found themselves listening to two men whom they would later know as Orson Hyde and Heber C. Kimball. Brannan's brother-in-law bought {{a copy of the}} Book of Mormon from these street corner missionaries. In the neighboring town of Kirtland, Ohio, Brannan, Alexander, and Mary Ann all joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1842. After his father's death, Brannan inherited a decent sum of money, bought himself out of his last year of his apprenticeship, and invested the rest in a patch of land near Cleveland. Soon after making his investment and hoping to get rich because of said investment, the market crashed and his land was worthless. He made a quick visit to Maine in order to see his ailing mother and then made his way to New Orleans where his brother Thomas was living. The Brannan brothers bought a press and type with what little money they had, but Thomas was taken by yellow fever shortly thereafter. After this tragedy, Brannan <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the North, stopping in Indianapolis to promote a paper which ultimately failed, before he returned to Painesville.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War {{the running}} of Gibb and Partners fell largely to Paton and James Guthrie Brown. Gibb and Partners gained {{a large number of}} {{government}} contracts and within a few weeks of {{the start of the war}} in September 1939 the workforce increased by 2000. Paton designed and sited several Royal Ordnance Factories; and in March 1940 travelled to Turkey to construct an iron and steel works there. Whilst in Turkey he was contracted to build emplacements to contain guns from mothballed battleships in the Dardanelles. The construction of the emplacements was completed but the guns would later be prevented from reaching the site by the Axis occupation of Greece. Paton <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Britain via Greece, Italy and France and arrived home two days prior to the Italian declaration of war against the Allies on 10 June 1940. He also constructed a plant at Barry in South Wales for the extraction of Magnesium Hydroxide from the sea, a turbine factory for British Thomson-Houston Company and a £7 million underground aircraft engine factory. From 1943-44 Paton supervised the construction, in London Docks, of the precast concrete caissons required for the construction of Mulberry Harbours following the Normandy Landings. From 1944-45 he was in charge of the rebuilding of houses damaged by V-2 rockets in the London districts of Wanstead and Woodford.|$|E
50|$|Conflicted and {{disturbed}} {{about what}} they have witnessed, they return to the main camp to find that Défago - the real Défago this time - has <b>made</b> <b>his</b> own <b>way</b> <b>back,</b> suffering from delirium, exposure and frostbite.

Punk alone could have explained it to them, but he fled home as soon as he caught the terrible odour that Défago carried with him. As an Indian, he instantly understood that Défago had seen the Wendigo.|$|R
2500|$|Mitterrand {{built up}} a {{resistance}} network (ref unknown), composed mainly of former POWs.

50|$|Malins practised as {{an equity}} {{draughtsman}} and conveyancer in Fig Tree Court, Temple, {{and later in}} New Square and in Stone Buildings, Lincoln's Inn.

5000|$|After settling, Philips {{married and}} gained a {{precarious}} living by teaching the virginals to children. In 1593 {{he went to}} Amsterdam [...] "to sie and heare an excellent man of his faculties", doubtless Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, whose reputation had by then long been <b>made.</b> On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back,</b> Philips was denounced by a compatriot for complicity in a plot on Queen Elizabeth's life, and he was temporarily imprisoned at the Hague, where he probably composed the pavan and galliard Doloroso (Fitzwilliam Virginal Book nos. LXXX and LXXXI). Philips himself translated the accusations made against him during his trial, revealing that he could by then speak Dutch. He was acquitted and released without further charges.|$|R

The plots have the Monster pursuing his own, evil agenda, unafraid of the weaker humans. Even people who try to help or reason with him are just as likely to be killed by the inhuman fiend.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Isopescu-Grecul <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Bukovina, {{an adviser}} of the Romanian governments and an {{investor}} in forestry businesses.

60|$|The two {{officers}} stood paralysed. Charlie {{walked to the}} door, and sprang up the cabin stairs; and, as he did so, heard shouts for assistance from behind. He gained the deck, walked quietly to the bulwark and, placing his hand upon it, sprang over the side into the river. He swam to shore and, climbing up the bank, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> along it <b>back</b> to the fort, where he arrived without any misadventure.|$|R
60|$|Cecil drifted away, and Andrew {{glanced at}} his card. There were two dances {{for which he was}} still engaged, and he <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>back</b> to the ballroom. There was a slight block at the entrance, and he had to stand aside to let several couples pass out. One of the last of these was Jeanne, on the arm of young Bellamy Smith. Andrew stood quite still looking at her. He saw her start for a moment as she {{recognized}} him, and her eyes swept him over with a half incredulous, half startled expression. She drew a little breath. And then Andrew saw her suddenly and instinctively stiffen. She looked him in the face and bowed very slightly, without the vestige of a smile.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned slowly}} back with baffled anger and vindictiveness. However, he had {{prevented}} something, although he knew not what. The principal had got away, {{but he had}} identified his confederate, {{and for the first}} time held a clue to his mysterious visitant. There was no use to alarm the household, which did not seem to have been disturbed. The trespassers were far away by this time, and the attempt would hardly be repeated that night. He <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> quietly <b>back</b> to the corral, let loose his horse, and regained the casa unobserved. He unlocked the arched door in the wall, reentered the darkened passage, stopped a moment to open the door of the boudoir, glance at the closely fastened casement, and extinguish the still burning candle, and, relocking the door securely, <b>made</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to <b>his</b> own room.|$|R
