40|$|In this paper, the {{fundamental}} properties of four tropical woods, Campnosperma sp., Calophyllum sp., Endospermum sp. and Octomeles sp. are investigated. Specimens are obtained from pith to sapwood continuously {{as shown in}} Fig. 1. The following are examined. 1) Anatomical structure by mean of optical microscope, crystallinity index and <b>micellar</b> <b>angle</b> by mean of X ray 2) Physical properties, i. e., the distributon of the specific gravity in air dry and shrinkage at radial transversal direction, and moisture movement 3) Mechanical properties, i. e., bending, compression, shearing and impact bending test, cleavage resistance and hardness. The experimental results are summarized in Photos. 1 - 4, Figs. 2 - 15 and Tables 1 - 4. From {{the relation between the}} these experimental results and sampling position of specimens and also specific gravity in air dry, {{it will be able to}} estimated at {{the fundamental}} properties of untested woods in these genus when the specific gravity in air dry and the sampling position of specimens are determined. 熱帯産 4 属の木材について基礎的材質を検討した。供試材はCampnosperma sp., Calophyllum sp., Endospermum sp. およびOctomeles sp. に属する原木で，各 1 本から，原木の横断面において，樹心から樹皮まで，原則として連続的に試料を採取した。調査した基礎的材質は次の通りである。 1 ）光学顕微鏡による組織構造とX線による相対結晶化度およびミセル傾角 2 ）物理的性質として収縮率と水分移動性 3 ）機械的性質として曲げ，圧縮，剪断，割裂，硬さ，衝撃曲げ得られた試験結果と試験体の採取された部位，あるいは比重との対応を検討した結果，同属の木材について，比重と部位を定めれば基礎的材質を推定しうるものと考える...|$|E
40|$|The {{review of}} {{existing}} information has identified the following: - the juvenile core in Araucaria is probably {{contained within the}} first 15 growth rings in the pith, with spiral grain being a chief determinant of its extent within the stem; - a reduction in rotation length for a given site index will reduce ASV and mature wood volume, {{with an increase in}} the proportion of juvenile wood; - for a given rotation length, lower ASV stems were estimated to contain a lower proportion of juvenile wood (based on the assumptions made and crude simulations using WEEDS, PL YSIM and STEPS software); regardless of juvenile wood proportions, smaller stems will yield a higher proportion of pith-in material; - an increase in the proportion of juvenile wood, due to a reduction in rotation length, could affect wood quality due to an increase in the proportion of the recovery containing high spiral grain, shorter tracheids and higher micellar angle; - high spiral grain and high <b>micellar</b> <b>angles</b> adversely impact on wood quality through their influence on twist and longitudinal shrinkage, respectively; - positive outcomes from a reduction in rotation length might include an increase in the proportion of live knots in upper stem sections and a reduction in the extent of brown-stain heartwood; - the uniformity in basic density within Araucaria stems means reduced rotation lengths and lower stem ASVs are unlikely to {{have a major impact on}} this wood property, and - the effect of a reduction in rotation length on the incidence of compression wood and timber susceptible to kiln staining could not be established from the available information...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatically driven coassembly of poly(acrylic acid) -block-poly(acrylamide), PAA-b-PAAm, and poly(2 -methylvinylpyridinium iodide), P 2 MVP, {{leads to}} {{formation}} of micelles in aqueous solutions. Light scattering and small angle neutron scattering experiments {{have been performed}} to study the effect of concentration and length of the corona block (N-PAAm = 97, 208, and 417) on <b>micellar</b> characteristics. Small <b>angle</b> neutron scattering curves were analyzed by generalized indirect Fourier transformation and model fitting. All scattering curves could be well described {{with a combination of}} a form factor for polydisperse spheres in combination with a hard sphere structure factor for the highest concentrations. Micellar aggregation numbers, shape, and internal structure are relatively independent of concentration for C-p < 23. 12 g L- 1. The Guinier radius, average micellar radius, hydrodynamic radius, and polydispersity were found to increase with increasing N-PAAm. Micellar mass and aggregation number were found to decrease with increasing N-PAAm...|$|R
