5|$|Around {{the time}} it first reached peak intensity, Greta was an {{extraordinarily}} large hurricane, with the gale-diameter of the storm extending roughly 1,200mi (1,930km). After attaining its peak intensity, the storm began to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> cooler waters, resulting in the circulation becoming elongated, however it did not weaken {{over the next couple}} days. On the morning of November 6, Greta transitioned into an exceptionally large and intense extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{after the}} first year's worth of Oswalds, Walt Disney {{attempted}} to renew his contract with Winkler Pictures, but Charles Mintz, who had taken over Margaret Winkler's business after marrying her, wanted to force Disney to accept a lower advance payment for each Oswald short. Disney refused, and as Universal owned the rights to Oswald rather than Disney, Mintz set up his own animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons. Most of Disney's staff was hired away by Mintz to <b>move</b> <b>over,</b> once Disney's Oswald contract was done in mid-1928.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the Whadjuk Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a tribe of around 60 people whose name, {{according}} to Robert Lyon, was Beeliar. Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people {{may have been a}} family subgroup (or clan) of a larger tribe whom Daisy Bates called Beelgar. According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the Swan and Canning rivers, as far south as Mangles Bay. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as Lake Monger and northeast to the Helena River. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.|$|E

5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could <b>move</b> <b>over</b> ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E
5|$|Males tend to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> longer {{distances}} than females. The {{average home}} range size in Fleming's study was 1.33hectares (3.3acres); males had larger home ranges on average. Specimens {{that were once}} captured tended to be captured more frequently than those {{that had never been}} captured. Fleming estimated that population densities reached peaks of up to 4.3 per ha (1.7 per acre) late in the rainy season (October–November), but dropped to near zero around June; however, these figures may well be underestimates. In central Venezuela, population densities vary from 5.5 to 9.6 per ha (2.2 to 3.8 per acre).|$|E
5|$|Most {{stony corals}} extend their tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can <b>move</b> <b>over</b> their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E

5|$|On 7August the 6th Airborne {{division}} {{was ordered to}} prepare to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> to the offensive, with its objective being {{the mouth of the}} River Seine. The division began to advance as the Germans retreated from France following their defeat in the Battle of Falaise. The 6th Airlanding Brigade, now commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, had the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade and the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade under its command. Together they would form the left flank of the division's advance, moving along the French coast, while the remainder of the division advanced further inland.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is {{a host of}} {{the widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern goldcrest subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice <b>move</b> <b>over</b> the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
5|$|The last {{storm of}} the 1957 season, Hurricane Nina, was an unusually late-forming system. It was first {{identified}} on November29 as {{a tropical storm}} to the southwest of Hawaii. Steadily tracking north-northeast, the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, by which time it was given the name Nina. As it approached Hawaii, the National Weather Bureau issued warnings for the storm, advising residents to take precaution and possibly evacuate. However, the storm turned westward before moving over the Hawaiian Islands with winds of 85mph (140km/h). Gradual weakening took place as the storm continued to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> open waters. Nina eventually dissipated after turning south on December6.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the southwestern {{periphery of the}} subtropical ridge, Maria turned to the north as its forward motion slowed considerably. Strong vertical wind shear over the system began to relax by September14, allowing Maria to slowly restrengthen as the convection redeveloped near its center. At 1800UTC on September15, Maria reached Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale while located roughly 135mi (215km) northwest of Bermuda. Embedded within increasing atmospheric flow, the hurricane's forward motion accelerated towards the northeast. At 0000UTC on September16, Maria attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mbar (29.03inHg). Continuing on a northeastward course, Maria began to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> an area with cooler sea surface temperatures and higher vertical wind shear. Around 1800UTC, Maria weakened to a tropical storm and made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland at 1830UTC with winds of 70mph (110km/h). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone's circulation was absorbed by a frontal system over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, on September 18.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Breville the {{division}} was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20June. Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20July, when the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into {{the line between the}} 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Division. On 7August Gale was ordered to prepare the division to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne together became I Corps; its commander, Lieutenant General John Crocker, knowing that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not expect it to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine, the division would have to cross three major rivers. There were two main lines of advance, the road running along the coast and another road further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer. The commando brigade and the two parachute brigades would use the inland route, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade being responsible for the breakout when the time was right.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning back}} to the northwest, the {{convection}} around Linfa became even more symmetrical, although the circulation became slightly elongated. At 06:00UTC on July4, the storm reached a preliminary peak intensity, with 10minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) according to the JMA. As Linfa neared the northern Philippines, the bulk of the convection was shifted to the southern periphery, due to the continued wind shear. Late on July4, the center of Linfa made landfall over Palanan, Isabela, on the island of Luzon. Moving westward across the island, the circulation became disorganized as the core convection diminished. By late on July5, Linfa emerged into the South China Sea. Once over open waters, Linfa began moving to the north-northwest, still moving around the subtropical ridge, and it was expected to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> Taiwan. The circulation remained well-defined but exposed, with the deep convection displaced to the south. With the isolated thunderstorms and unfavorable wind shear, the JTWC noted the potential for the circulation to dissipate over open waters. By July7, easing wind shear allowed the convection to rebuild and for the structure to improve in organization. By that time, the future of the storm was still uncertain, although a turn to the northwest toward China was expected. Also on July7, PAGASA issued its final bulletin on the storm as Linfa exited their area of responsibility.|$|E

5|$|MD 10 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway) in Pasadena. The highway heads north as a four-lane freeway to a partial interchange with MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway). There is no access from northbound MD 10 to eastbound MD 100 or from westbound MD 100 to southbound MD 10. MD 10 and MD 100 briefly run concurrently northwest as an eight-lane freeway and diverge at another partial interchange; in both carriageways, traffic must <b>move</b> <b>over</b> two lanes {{to remain on}} the same route. Just north of the MD 100 split, MD 10 has a half-diamond interchange with MD 177 (Mountain Road). That interchange has ramps from southbound MD 10 to MD 177 and from MD 177 to northbound MD 10. Traffic from eastbound MD 100 to northbound MD 10 and from southbound MD 10 to westbound MD 100 uses MD 177 and MD 2 as intermediaries.|$|E
5|$|On the September 1 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Kennedy {{defeated}} Finlay and Bobby Lashley in a Triple Threat {{match to win}} the WWE United States Championship, his first and only Championship reign in WWE. On the September 8 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy announced {{that he wanted to}} <b>move</b> <b>over</b> to Raw, as SmackDown! did not interest him anymore because he had already defeated every top performer on the roster. This led to SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long making a match between Kennedy and The Undertaker, who Kennedy had never faced, to be held at No Mercy. Kennedy won the match by disqualification. On the October 13 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy, now with a win over The Undertaker, again stated his desire to move to the Raw brand. However, Long put him against an opponent who he had never faced—this time Chris Benoit—with Kennedy's title on the line. Long said that, if Kennedy were to defeat Benoit, he would be given his release and be allowed to go to Raw. Ultimately, Kennedy lost the match and the United States Championship to Benoit after submitting to the Crippler Crossface following a distraction by The Undertaker, which also marked Kennedy's first loss via submission.|$|E
5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be hired and were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to <b>move</b> <b>over</b> to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E
