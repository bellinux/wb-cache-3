5|$|According to {{a survey}} in 1989–90, Tripura hosts 90 land mammal species from 65 genera and 10 orders, {{including}} such species as elephant (Elephas maximus), bear (Melursus ursinus), binturong (Arctictis binturong), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), porcupine (Artherurus assamensis), barking deer (Muntiacus <b>muntjak),</b> sambar (Cervus unicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), gaur (Bos gaurus), leopard (Panthera pardus), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and many species of small cats and primates. Out of 15 free ranging primates of India, seven are found in Tripura; this is {{the highest number of}} primate species found in any Indian state. The wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is extinct now. There are nearly 300 species of birds in the state.|$|E
25|$|The banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus), {{also known}} as the Andaman wild boar and once thought to be an endemic subspecies, is {{protected}} by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). The spotted deer (Axis axis), the Indian muntjac (Muntiacus <b>muntjak)</b> and the sambar (Rusa unicolor) were all introduced to the Andaman islands, though the sambar did not survive.|$|E
25|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} variability between {{closely related species}} is the muntjac, which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and his colleague Doris Wurster. The diploid number of the Chinese muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi, {{was found to be}} 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, Muntiacus <b>muntjak,</b> they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Several predators {{dwell in}} the {{labyrinth}} of channels, branches and roots that poke up into the air. This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus <b>muntjak),</b> wild boars (Sus scrofa), and even rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated {{that there are now}} 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.|$|E
