40|$|Chunnakam and Vadamaradchi are {{two major}} aquifer systems in Jaffna Peninsula, Sri Lanka. This study was {{performed}} to compare water quality in the domestic wells in these aquifers and to assess the efficacy of household water treatments for treating contaminated water. Replicate well water samples were collected from each aquifer and pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, temperature, total solids (TS), total hardness (TH), chemical oxygen demand (COD), oil and grease (OG), nitrate N (N), and total phosphate (TP) were measured. The sampled water from the domestic wells was filtered through commercial <b>mineral</b> <b>filter</b> and Moringa oleifera leaf powder and boiled at 100 °C for 10 minutes and the TH, OG, N, and TP were measured. Both OG and N in Chunnakam were significantly higher and the DO were significantly {{lower than those of}} Vadamaradchi. TH, N, and OG of some wells exceeded the drinking water quality standards established by Sri Lanka Standards Institution. Moringa oleifera leaf powder filtration reduced N significantly and filtering through commercial <b>mineral</b> <b>filter</b> reduced OG, TH, and N significantly. Boiling at 100 °C could remove TH significantly but may cause significant increase in N which might result in health impacts...|$|E

In {{wastewater}} treatment system, the humus soil activated sludge {{process is to}} culture microorganisms by setting the natural humus soil composite <b>mineral</b> <b>filter</b> to simulate natural soil growing conditions. After enriched and activated in the cultivation tank, the microorganisms with specific functions return to different position of activated sludge process and achieve enhanced operational performance. The project results showed the process could enhance the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus, reduce sludge production, improve sludge dewatering property and achieve odor elimination...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} on the shrinkage {{and cracking}} behaviour of fine particulate filter cake {{have been carried}} out with special regard to the influence of a variation of zeta potential and of particle size distribution. Experiments with two tinania fractions revealed a slight reduction of minimum pressure and shrinkage potential with increasing suspension stability. Shrinkage tests with different limestone fractions demonstrated a more pronounced reduction of minimum pressure and shrinkage potential without changing the general pressure dependency of the shrinkage potential. From the established quantitative relation a critical particle size for fracture formation has been derived. Comparison with literature data confirm that at a particle size > 20 - 50 #mu#m shrinkage fracture formation in <b>mineral</b> <b>filter</b> cakes is nearly excluded. Application of the results for scaling-up and the influence of a regulated predamage of the filter cake are discussed.

40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} rapid {{increases}} in consumer products containing nanomaterials, raising {{concerns over the}} impact of nanoparticles (NPs) to humankind and the environment, but little information has been published about <b>mineral</b> <b>filters</b> in commercial sunscreens. It is urgent to develop methods to characterize the nanomaterials in products. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs in unmodified commercial sunscreens were characterized by laser scanning confocal microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that laser scanning confocal microscopy evaluated primary particle aggregates and dispersions but could not size NPs because of the diffraction limited resolution of optical microscopy (200  nm). Atomic force microscopy measurements required a pretreatment of the sunscreens or further calibration in phase analysis, but could not provide their elemental composition of commercial sunscreens. While XRD gave particle size and crystal information without a pretreatment of sunscreen, TEM analysis required dilution and dispersion of the commercial sunscreens before imaging. When coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, TEM afforded particle size information and compositional analysis. XRD characterization of six commercial sunscreens labeled as nanoparticles revealed that three samples contained TiO 2 NPs, among which two listed ZnO and TiO 2, and displayed average particle sizes of 15  nm, 21  nm, and 78  nm. However, no nanosized ZnO particles were found {{in any of the}} samples by XRD. In general, TEM can resolve nanomaterials that exhibit one or more dimensions between 1  nm and 100  nm, allowing the identification of ZnO and TiO 2 NPs in all six sunscreens and ZnO/TiO 2 mixtures in two of the samples. Overall, the combination of XRD and TEM was suitable for analyzing ZnO and TiO 2 NPs in commercial sunscreens...|$|R

40|$|Geosynthetics {{made from}} {{plastics}} can replace filter layers made of gravel. In this article goal and scope, basic {{data and the}} results of a comparative life cycle assessment of gravel and geosynthetics based filter layers are described. The filter layers of a road made of 30 cm gravel and a filter geosynthetic, respectively, form the basis for the comparison. The filter layers have the same technical performance and the same life time of 30 years. The product system includes the supply of the raw materials, the manufacture of the geotextiles and the extraction of mineral resources, the construction of the road filter, its use and its end of life phase. The life cycle assessment reveals that the geosynthetics based filter layer causes lower environmental impacts per square metre. The cumulative greenhouse gas emissions amount to 7. 8 kg CO 2 -eq (<b>mineral</b> <b>filter)</b> and to 0. 81 kg CO 2 -eq (geosynthetic filter). The variation of the thickness of the gravel based filter layer confirms the lower environmental impacts of a geosynthetics based filter layer. Environmental impacts of the geosynthetic production are dominated by the raw material provision (plastic granulate) and electricity consumption during manufacturing...|$|E
50|$|Among the {{smallest}} of swallowtails in India, the green dragontail is usually found singly along open sunlit patches, almost always near streams and water courses. It may also be seen in small groups, usually twos or threes. It flies in an altitude range of 100 to 1520 m. It flies from April to October. Having much smaller wing size to body length ratio, the butterflies have a whirring flight, rapidly beat their wings and dart {{back and forth in}} a manner reminiscent of dragonflies, their long tails acting as rudders. Male dragontails suck up a lot of water from which the dissolved <b>minerals</b> are <b>filtered</b> and the water squirted from the anus. While feeding they vibrate their wings rapidly but pause from time to time. Occasionally, they rest on leaves of bushes with wings outspread and stationary.|$|R
25|$|Since {{biodiesel}} is {{an effective}} solvent and cleans residues deposited by <b>mineral</b> diesel, engine <b>filters</b> {{may need to be}} replaced more often, as the biofuel dissolves old deposits in the fuel tank and pipes. It also effectively cleans the engine combustion chamber of carbon deposits, helping to maintain efficiency. In many European countries, a 5% biodiesel blend is widely used and is available at thousands of gas stations. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel, meaning it contains a reduced amount of carbon and higher hydrogen and oxygen content than fossil diesel. This improves the combustion of biodiesel and reduces the particulate emissions from unburnt carbon. However, using pure biodiesel may increase NOx-emissions-levels also when using B100.|$|R
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, Malvern's reputation for purity suffered a blow when the rock that filters the water dried out during 2006, allowing the water from heavy storms to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process to take place efficiently. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under European Union law. Consequently, the labels were change from: Malvern The Original English Natural <b>Mineral</b> Water. Naturally <b>filtered</b> through Pre-Cambrian granite and sourced from deep beneath the Malvern Hills. to read The Original English Water Bottled in the Malvern Hills.|$|R
40|$|A {{process has}} been {{investigated}} for solvent extraction of bitumen from Sunnyside, Utah, tar sands. The Sunnyside deposit, in east central Utah, has 1 to 2 billion barrels of geological reserves with a richness of 6 to 10 wtX bitumen. In this process, the ore is crushed and the bitumen is dissolved from the mineral in mix tanks. The bitumen and oil is separated from the coarse mineral by hydrocyclones and from the fines by pentane-deasphaltening. The solvent is recovered from the <b>mineral</b> by centrifuges, <b>filters,</b> and rotary kiln steam strippers, and from the bitumen by multi-effect evaporators. Hydrocyclone tests with one- and four-inch hydrocyclones demonstrated that 97 % of the mineral matter could {{be removed from the}} bitumen. The experimental data were used to develop mathematical models for predicting feed rate and cut size. Since the accuracy of the model was quite good, it was used to design the hydrocyclones for the process...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of spent oil-in-water emulsion (SOWE) from a non-ferrous metal-processing plant by using aluminum sulfate and hydrated lime was studied {{to determine the}} purification efficiency, to optimize the operating conditions and to scale up the treatment process. The purification efficiency was estimated by comparing the compositions of the SOWE and the processed wastewater. The treatment efficiency {{does not depend on}} the type of <b>mineral</b> oil and <b>filter</b> aid. The optimum doses of aluminum sulfate and hydrated lime must be experimentally determined for each batch of SOWEs, but the results obtained at laboratory level are applicable at pilot level. The processed wastewater and the filter cake from the process can be safely disposed into public sewage systems and at municipal waste landfills, respectively. The purification efficiency was higher than 98 % with respect to total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand and oil and grease, and was comparable to the known treatment processes based on coagulation/flocculation followed by sedimentation...|$|R

40|$|Sand {{provenance}} in the Kwanza Basin, Angola, is {{assessed using}} conventional and varietal heavy mineral analysis. There are contrasting heavy mineral signatures {{in the north}} and south of the basin separated by a hybrid zone. These contrasts are attributed to different hinterland geology. Heavy mineralogy, sand body distribution and prominent structures allowed the subdivision of the Kwanza Basin into five depositional domains. Heavy <b>mineral</b> indices <b>filter</b> important provenance signatures in space and time in addition to providlng tectonic and geomorphologic information. Quantitative and qualitative thermal and composition information was obtained from fluid inclusions using UV fluorescence and microthermometry. There were at least two pulses of hydrocarbon generation and migration from source rocks in the basin based on homogenization temperatures of 52 - 129 Ã‚Â°C, geochemical characterization of oil shows from proprietary data, and Genesis basin modelling: 1) during Albian time, rift-related high heat flow triggered the first pulse, and 2) high rates of sedimentation led to a burial-induced pulse during the Neogene-Quaternary. There are three main controls on diagenesis: stratigraphy and facies; thermal history; and provenance. Significant authigenic minerals (illite, smectite, dolomite, quartz and feldspar) were only noted in Cenomanian or older rocks. Apatite fission track analysis (AFTA) yields a record of the temperature regime experienced by the basin and basement through the pre-rift, syn-rift and post-rift stages. There were three main tectono-thermal events in the basin: 1) pre-rift and early syn-rift cooling; 2) a post-rift period of tectonic quiescence (Cretaceous to early Tertiary); interrupted by 3) a rapid cooling (denudation) due to epeirogenic uplift of the Inner Kwanza Basin and hinterland at ca. 23 Ma. Miocene denudation of the Inner Kwanza Basin and the hinterland is mirrored by a burial-related temperature increase in the Outer Kwanza Basin. This source to sink correlation indicates a period of bypassed sedimentation into the Outer Kwanza Basin and possibly onto the abyssal plain of Angola.
