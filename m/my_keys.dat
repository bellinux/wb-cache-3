2500|$|In his statements, Goetz {{described}} his past mugging, {{in which he}} was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City [...] "lawless" [...] and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a [...] "joke," [...] a [...] "sham," [...] and [...] "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being [...] "beaten to a pulp" [...] as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, [...] "My intention was to murder them, to hurt them, to make them suffer as much as possible." [...] Later in the tape, Goetz said, [...] "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets." [...] He added, [...] "I was gonna, I was gonna gouge one of the guys' [...] eyes out with <b>my</b> <b>keys</b> afterwards", but said he stopped when he saw the fear in his eyes. At the criminal trial, Goetz's defense attorneys, Barry Slotnick and Mark M. Baker, argued that this and other extreme statements by Goetz were the product of emotion and an overactive imagination.|$|E
