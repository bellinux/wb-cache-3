In order to prevent quality decay, the combined effects of natural antioxidants and storage temperature on peroxidase activity and sensory attributes (overall visual quality, browning and odor) of individual and <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> <b>soup</b> (butternut squash, leek and celery) were evaluated. Fresh cut vegetables were treated with antioxidant solutions as tea tree essential oil (15 &# 956;l/mL), propolis extract (15 &# 956;l/mL) and gallic acid (2 mg/mL) and stored at optimal (5 &# 176;C) and abusive (15 &# 176;C) temperature for a maximum of 14 days. The application of natural preservatives, plus optimal storage conditions, exerted significant inhibitory effects in peroxidase activity of squash, celery and mixed vegetables throughout the storage. Furthermore, propolis treatment applied on mixed vegetables retarded browning appearance and preserved the visual quality {{for a longer period}} when compared to untreated product...|$|E

50|$|Subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon {{may be able}} {{to improve}} their nutritional, environmental, social, and {{economic}} situations by growing this vine. Nutrition can be improved by using the plant for medicinal purposes as well as through edible consumption.Primarily, Eru leaves are used as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> <b>soups</b> and stews, commonly called Eru soup or afang soup. The leaves of the vine are sold in markets throughout the year and may be used in soups and stews or eaten raw. The leaves may further be used as a remedy for nausea, sore throats, or as a dressing for warts. The stem of the plant may also be eaten for medicinal purposes, including the reduction of pain during childbirth. Furthermore, Eru produces a root tuber that may be used as a source of ‘‘famine food,’‘ and {{is similar to that of}} a yam. Finally, the seeds of the vine may also be eaten cooked.|$|R
40|$|Fresh prepacked <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> <b>soup</b> {{have become}} very popular on the Italian market, since they are already peeled, cut, washed and ready-to-use. The {{packaging}} and the modified atmosphere can prolong their shelf-life and maintain their hygienic, physicochemical and sensory characteristics during storage at + 4 °C. The hygienic and sensory quality was evaluated by analysing microbial growth and atmosphere composition {{at the moment of}} packaging and at the end or the shelf-life of vegetables prepacked in air on under modified atmospheres, and by determining the browning or blackening of parsley and the loss of carrot exudates. A large number of different groups of microorganisms was found in raw vegetables. In spite of this high starting concentration of microbial flora, the prepackaging systems investigated did not seem to significantly influence their growth during vegetable storage at + 4 °C. No pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from the prepackaged vegetables. The hygienic quality was similar in all packaging systems used. However, the vegetables packaged in perforated. film kept their sensory characteristics better than those packaged in air or under a modified atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|On December 6, 1979, three luncheon banquets {{were served}} in a New Jer-sey restaurant. Thirty-eight of 41 members (92. 7 %) of the first group became ill as did 25 of 31 members (80. 6 %) of the second group. None of 12 members of the third group were ill. Illness {{consisted}} primarily of diarrhea (76 %), nausea (73 %), vomiting (67 %), cramps (46 %) and fever (18 %); the median Incubation period was 31 hours and median duration 24 hours.

The soil was mixed with wood chips to improve aeration and then mixed with cattle manure or <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste in {{a ratio of}} 4 : 1. Moisture, temperature, pH, ash content, C:N ratios, and the concentrations of creosote in the compost systems were monitored monthly. The concentrations of selected hydrocarbons in the compost systems were determined {{at the end of}} composting. Temperature rose to about 45 degreesC in the cattle manure compost within two months of incubation while temperature in the control and vegetable waste remained below 30 degreesC until the fourth month. Creosote concentration was reduced by 17 % in the control and by more than 99 % in the cattle manure and vegetable waste compost after composting. The rate of reduction in concentration in the <b>mixed</b> <b>vegetable</b> waste compost was initially lower than in the cattle manure compost. The reduction rate became similar in later months with only small differences {{towards the end of the}} composting. The concentrations of selected creosote components were reduced by between 96 % and 100 % after composting.

5000|$|Economic gains due to Mikania are meager {{compared}} to the loss due to its infestation in various ecosystems. It {{is used as a}} fodder in many countries. Sheep preferentially grazed Mikania in Malaysia and other cattle also relish it. In Kerala, India, the weed is utilized as a fodder {{in some parts of the}} state, especially during summer when availability of grass is scarce. However, Mikania is known to cause hepatotoxicity and liver damage in dairy cattle. The antibacterial effect of Mikania and its efficacy in wound healing has been reported. In Assam (NE India), Kabi tribes use the leaf juice of Mikania as an antidote for insect bite and scorpion sting. The leaves are also used for treating stomachache. Use of juice of Mikania as a curative agent for itches is reported from Malaysia. However, in all such cases therapeutic evidences are scarce or lacking. In Africa, Mikania leaves are used as a <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> making <b>soups.</b> The weed is used as a cover crop in rubber plantations in Malaysia. It is also planted on slopes to prevent soil erosion. Mikania green manure has been reported to increase the yield of rice in Mizoram, India. Recent studies have shown that Mikania is not suitable for mulching and composting due to its high water content. http://www.fao.org/forestry/13376-05d702161c15b1e3defa6bf9c8e6c4f82.pdf ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{historical}} ethnobotanical review of wild plants used by the residents of present day Estonia during the 1770 s– 1960 s. Twenty two sources addressing historical ethnographical accounts {{of the use of}} wild food plants were analysed. The use of 147 taxa of vascular plants (over 6 % of Estonian vascular flora) and two lichens has been recorded. Although the data does not allow for reliable determination of the frequency of use of specific taxa among the population, general conclusions on the preferences for specific dishes made of wild food plants can be made. While the category of snacks covers the largest proportion of species used, a substantial addition to food rations was provided by bread ingredients (used predominantly in famine times), green <b>vegetables</b> used <b>for</b> making <b>soup,</b> and later jams and other dishes of wild berries. Also beverages (tea and coffee substitutes), beer and beer-like drinks were widely made, and the saps of several tree species were consumed in fresh and fermented form. The most important species, according to the criterion of diversity of use, were Carum carvi, Urtica dioica, and the wild berries  V ac cinium vitis-idaea and Vaccinium myrtillus...|$|R

40|$|Two central {{concepts}} in probability theory {{are those of}} "independence" and of "mutually exclusive " events and their alternatives.

Mutually Exclusive versus Non Mutually Exclusive Events Events are mutually exclusive when the occurrence of one of the events rules out the possibility of the occurrence of the other events of concern. The outcomes, for example, on the toss of a single die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The outcomes are all mutually exclusive because when a die is tossed and a number turns up, all the other numbers cannot occur. On the other hand, the events "eating rocky mountain oysters for breakfast " and "eating <b>vegetable</b> <b>soup</b> <b>for</b> breakfast " are & mutually exclusive since it is possible that one has both for breakfast, however improbable that migh...|$|R
