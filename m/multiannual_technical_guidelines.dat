Only use existing theoretical model to the actual situation and formulation. Therefore, the prediction practical results were biggish error. Starting from the model, this paper discusses related by complex pollutant in topographic influence, atmospheric diffusion regularity in. Through the contrast analysis of 1993 <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> and 2008 edition of atmospheric air, in <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> for atmospheric diffusion parameters, stability, principle and model, building under complicated topography and the processing, 2008 edition of atmospheric <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> of 1993 than the <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> for air superiority, advanced. While the future of atmospheric environmental impact assessment work will play a positive role in promoting.

An overview of timber structures, including structural and fire safety considerations for connections, service penetrations and structural elements are provided. The guide also includes a discussion of fire protection strategies and performance based design intended to enable design and approval of timber structures for fire safety.|$|R

30|$|One of {{the reasons}} for these results may be that four {{guidelines}} [11 – 14] are mainly <b>technical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> dealing mostly or only with the practical execution of MSK-US examinations (e.g., how to orient the probe, position the patient, visualise a tendon). Therefore, their purpose is to provide technical education rather than literature evidence on the topic. In this setting, not all domains evaluated by the AGREE II tool may be relevant to this kind of recommendation. Nevertheless, AGREE II developers clearly state that this tool “can be applied to guidelines in any disease area targeting any step in the health care continuum”, therefore opening the possibility to <b>technical</b> <b>guidelines</b> appraisal as well. Of note, the ESSR “Clinical indications for musculoskeletal ultrasound” [1] is a guideline based on a Delphi process which occurred after a thorough review of pertinent literature and was aimed to provide clinical indications about the degree of evidence of the use of MSK-US {{in different parts of the}} body. This may explain why this guideline was the one with the highest overall score. However, excluding <b>technical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> we acknowledge a relative low number of clinical guidelines on MSK-US.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{significant}} impacts on changing precipitation patterns causing the {{variation of the}} reservoir inflow. Nowadays, Indonesian hydrologist performs reservoir inflow prediction according to the <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> of Pd-T- 25 - 2004 -A. This <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> does not consider the climate variables directly, resulting in significant deviation to the observation results. This research intends to predict the reservoir inflow using the statistical downscaling (SD) of General Circulation Model (GCM) outputs. The GCM outputs are obtained from the National Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis (NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis). A new proposed hybrid SD model named Wavelet Support Vector Machine (WSVM) was utilized. It {{is a combination of}} the Multiscale Principal Components Analysis (MSPCA) and nonlinear Support Vector Machine regression. The model was validated at Sutami Reservoir, Indonesia. Training and testing were carried out using data of 1991 – 2008 and 2008 – 2012, respectively. The results showed that MSPCA produced better extracting data than PCA. The WSVM generated better reservoir inflow prediction than the one of <b>technical</b> <b>guideline.</b> Moreover, this research also applied WSVM for future reservoir inflow prediction based on GCM ECHAM 5 and scenario SRES A 1 B...|$|R
40|$|FOREWORD The Trusted Product Evaluation Questionnaire is {{the latest}} in a series of {{technical}} documents that are being published by the National Computer Security Center under the <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidelines</b> Programs. It is the goal of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Guidelines</b> Program to assure that each process in the Trusted Product Evaluation Program and the features of the Department of Defense Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria will be discussed in detail and provide the proper interpretations with specific guidance. These publications are designed to provide insight to the Department of Defense Trusted Computer Systems Evaluation Criteria requirements for the computer security vendor and developer, as well as the technical evaluator. The specific questions in the Trusted Product Evaluation Questionnaire provide a set of good practices related to necessary system security and system security documentation. This questionnaire has been written to help the vendor understand what technical information is required concerning the system for a product evaluation. From the vendor's responses, the evaluator may obtain an understanding of the security of the system applying for evaluation. As the Director, National Computer Security Center, I invite your recommendations for revision to this <b>technical</b> <b>guideline.</b> We plan to review this document when the need arises...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} {{detailed}} analysis of fire safety in the Elementary school of Tomo Brejc, which has recently been renovated. In {{the first part of}} the thesis fire measures for theanalysed building are designed according to the prescriptive approach, i. e. Slovenian <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> TSG- 1 - 001 : 2010 is used. Afterwards designed fire measures are compared with the actual condition. The designed fire measures are presented in the fire safety study. The second part of the thesis includes a comparison between fire – safety measures determined in the first part and fire measures designed according to German <b>technical</b> <b>guideline</b> MBO 2002, which was used in actual design of the discussed school. Differences between both guidelines are given, and advantages and disadvantages of Slovenian <b>technical</b> <b>guideline’s</b> TSG- 1 - 001 : 2010 are pointed out. The last part of the thesis presents a {{detailed analysis of}} evacuation routes in the classroom part of the discussed building. Performance based approach is used, i. e. advanced computer softwares Pyrosim and Pathfinder are used. On the basis of the simulation results the suitability of evacuation routes in the classroom part of the school is estimated...|$|R
