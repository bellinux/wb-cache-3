40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the role of clay minerals in organic matter preservation, the fixation of pure organic compounds on two synthetic low- and high-charge saponites was investigated in laboratory experiments simulating marine water conditions. The clays were exposed to four carboxylic acids: pentadecanoic, docosanoic, 5 β-cholanic acid and ursolic, dissolved in treated natural sea water. Characterization of the resulting organo-clay association indicates that, under <b>marine</b> water <b>column</b> conditions, the organic fixation is only a sorption process, no intercalation being observed. The surface coverage, similar for the two clays (ca. 0. 04 mg organic carbon m- 2), demonstrates that the sorption {{is controlled by the}} surface properties of clays rather than their cation exchange capacity. The weaker sorption of docosanoic acid underlines the major role of the molecular properties, but the lack of selectivity among the three others does not corroborate the influence of molecular size on the sorption process. The general failure of a chemolysis treatment performed on the organo-clay associations demonstrates the high stability of these complexes. Results suggest that the bonding mechanisms are dominated by ligand exchange and not by hydrophobic effects, cation bridges or cation exchange. The minor extractible organic fraction consists of acid molecules connected to clay surfaces by van der Waals interactions. The high stability of the bonds formed in this environment, close to those observed from previous studies of marine sediments, could explain in part the organic matter preservation during transfer across <b>marine</b> water <b>columns,</b> especially metabolisable materials...|$|R

The sequences all span the last termination and the Holocene, but we focus here on the evidence in each record for the time period during which sapropel S 1 formed in the Mediterranean (ca, 9. 0 to 6. 8 cal kyr B. P.). The new records provide evidence of palaeoenvironmental changes on land and sea that can be reconstructed at a high temporal resolution, and which throw {{some light on the}} processes which {{led to the formation of}} S 1. The collective evidence indicates that: (i) organic-rich sediments occurred in both the marine and the crater lake sites during the time of formation of the S 1 sapropel; (ii) there is evidence of increased stratification and anoxia in the sea-water column during the period of S 1 formation; (iii) the S 1 period in the study area is divisible into two subphases (S 1 a and S 1 b), which reflect short-term variations in oceanographic conditions (stratification and anoxia); (iv) changes in stratification in the <b>marine</b> <b>column</b> were contemporaneous with regional climate variations that are inferred from the terrestrial records. We conclude that the key factor that initiated the formation of S 1 was increased discharge of freshwater into the Mediterranean following a change post- 9. 0 cal kyr B.

Furthermore, the period of S 1 formation was interrupted by a short-lived episode (ca. 500 years) of comparatively cooler and drier conditions during the Early-Middle Holocene transition (EMHT).

40|$|Determining which {{microbial}} taxa are out there, {{where they}} live, {{and what they}} are doing is a driving approach in marine microbial ecology. The importance of these questions is underlined by concerted, large-scale, and global ocean sampling initiatives, for example the International Census of Marine Microbes, Ocean Sampling Day, or Tara Oceans. Given decades of effort, we know that the large majority of marine Bacteria and Archaea belong to about a dozen phyla. In addition to the classically culturable Bacteria and Archaea, at least 50 clades, at different taxonomic depths, exist. These account for the majority of marine microbial diversity, but there is still an underexplored and less abundant portion remaining. We refer to these hitherto unrecognized clades as unknown, as their boundaries, names, and classifications are not available. In this work, we were able to characterize up to 92 of these unknown clades found within the bacterial and archaeal phylogenetic diversity currently reported for <b>marine</b> water <b>column</b> environments. We mined the SILVA 16 S rRNA gene datasets for sequences originating from the <b>marine</b> water <b>column.</b> Instead of the usual subjective taxa delineation and nomenclature methods, we applied the candidate taxonomic unit (CTU) circumscription system, along with a standardized nomenclature to the sequences in newly constructed phylogenetic trees. With this new phylogenetic and taxonomic framework, we performed an analysis of ICoMM rRNA gene amplicon datasets to gain insights into the global distribution of the new marine clades, their ecology, biogeography, and interaction with oceanographic variables. Most of the new clades we identified were interspersed by known taxa with cultivated members, whose genome sequences are available. This result encouraged us to perform metabolic predictions for the novel marine clades using the PICRUSt approach. Our work also provides an update on the taxonomy of several phyla and widely known marine clades as our CTU approach breaks down these randomly lumped clades into smaller objectively calculated subgroups. Finally, all taxa were classified and named following standards compatible with the Bacteriological Code rules, enhancing their digitization, and comparability with future microbial ecological and taxonomy studies...|$|R

Depending on the specific study, complementary analytical techniques such as elemental, isotopic and molecular analyses have also been applied. Samples {{from a variety of}} environments were examined including ocean waters, marine sediments and atmospheric aerosols. Studies from all these environments illustrate differences in natural organic matter composition resulting from various factors such as sources, cycling mechanisms and redox conditions. In the <b>marine</b> water <b>column,</b> organic matter of two different size fractions (dissolved and particulate) is found to have distinctly different bulk chemical and isotopic compositions. Overall, this indicates that particulate organic matter does not form from the simple physical aggregation of dissolved organic matter, and dissolved organic matter is not the primary source for particulate organic matter. Comparison of carbon and phosphorus compositional changes with depth in the ocean within the dissolved and particulate fractions reveals differences in cycling mechanisms. In the <b>marine</b> water <b>column,</b> selective mineralization of specific carbon compounds such as carbohydrates and amino acids occurs relative other species such as lipids. Whereas for phosphorus, the relative proportion of the different functional groups are unvarying with depth. In marine sediments, NMR spectroscopy reveals P cycling for specific phases such as polyphosphates is a function of sediment redox conditions. In atmospheric aerosols 13 C NMR spectroscopy shows differences in water-soluble organic carbon composition from urban versus biomass burning sources. Urban aerosols have higher aliphatic and lower aromatic compound contents relative to samples derived from biomass burning. The results of these studies provide new insights into carbon and phosphorus cycling in the environment and demonstrate the capabilities of solid-state NMR as a tool for investigating natural organic matter composition.

Over this time period, the ages of komatiites, and those of global plumes, correlate strongly, at the 99 % confidence level, with the ages of banded iron formations (BIFs).

Using the geochronological records of these events, we can define four periods characterized by mantle superplume activity. Three of these periods are also times of enhanced BIF deposition. The fourth mantle plume period may similarly be coeval with increased BIF accumulation, but the BIF chronostratigraphic resolution is not accurate enough to test this rigorously. Mantle superplume volcanism may promote BIF deposition by increasing the Fe flux to the global oceans through continental weathering and/or through submarine hydrothermal processes.

In the marine environment, a dual-component microbial biofilter consumes up to 80 % of methane produced. Throughout most of the world’s ocean the primary component of this biofilter, anaerobic methane oxidation within sediment, prevents significant amounts of methane from leaving the seafloor. However, in areas of elevated methane production, this sedimentary component is overwhelmed, and methane is released to the water column [1].

Their small size has implications for metabolic rates and the trophic transfer through microbial food webs.

Catalyzed by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, the ability to oxidize ammonia was previously thought to be restricted to a few groups within the β- and γ-Proteobacteria. However, recent metagenomic studies have revealed the existence of unique ammonia monooxygenase α-subunit (amoA) genes derived from uncultivated, nonextremophilic Crenarchaeota.

Diverse and distinct AOA communities are associated with each of these habitats, with little overlap between water columns and sediments. Within marine sediments, most AOA sequences are unique to individual sampling locations, whereas a small number of sequences are evidently cosmopolitan in distribution.

Our results reveal that the increase in the XC pool size and the amplitude of NPQ is determined by the blue fluence rate experienced by cells, while cells require sensing red radiation to allow the development of these processes. Variations in the light spectrum and in the blue versus red radiation modulate either the photoprotective capacity, such as the activation of the diadinoxanthin-diatoxanthin xanthophyll cycle, the diadinoxanthin de-epoxidation rate and the capacity of non-photochemical quenching, or the pigment composition of this diatom. We propose that spectral composition of light has a key role on the ability of diatoms to finely balance light harvesting and photoprotective capacity...|$|R
