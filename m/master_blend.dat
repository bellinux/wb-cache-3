40|$|The {{effect of}} matrix properties, i. e. {{crystallinity}} and molecular weight, {{on the impact}} behaviour of polypropylene–EPDM blends was studied. The blends were made on a twin-screw extruder. The impact strength was determined {{as a function of}} temperature, using a notched Izod impact test. The matrix crystallinity was varied by varying the matrix isotacticity, and ranged from 33 to 50 wt%. With increasing temperature the polymers show a sharp brittle–ductile transition. This brittle–ductile transition temperature (Tbd) shifts to higher temperatures with increasing crystallinity of the polypropylene. However, the balance of properties and the modulus–Tbd relationship were better with blends made with higher crystalline PP. The matrix molecular weight was decreased by treating a high molecular weight PP–EPDM (85 / 15 vol%) <b>master</b> <b>blend</b> with peroxide. In this way blends were obtained with a high MFI and a small rubber particle size. The matrix MFI of the blends thus obtained ranged from 2 to 30 dg min− 1. With decreasing matrix molecular weight the Tbd increased. The peroxide treated blends exhibited a considerably lower Tbd than comparable blends made in the standard way with a similarly small particle size.

50|$|Leblon is {{produced}} {{at its own}} vertically integrated distillery in the fertile cachaça-producing Minas Gerais region of Brazil. The distillery is called Maison Leblon, and Gilles Merlet, along with Carlos Oliveira, serves as master distiller. Merlet approaches the distillation of Leblon Cachaça {{as if it were}} a fine wine. The cane is hand-harvested from Leblon's nearby fields and quickly delivered to the Maison for pressing. The juice is fermented for 20 to 24 hours before being transferred into the Alambique copper pot stills for single-batch distillation. The distillate is then rested up to 6 months in Vintage XO Cognac Casks from France. The various batches are then <b>master</b> <b>blended,</b> and the final batch is gently filtered and bottled in glass. Since Leblon Cachaça is distilled in Alambique copper pot stills in smaller batches and not in faster, cheaper column stills, it is classified as an artisanal cachaça. Leblon is certified by the Instituto Mineiro de Agropecuária as an artisanal Cachaça de Alambique.|$|R
40|$|The rheology, morphology, and {{mechanical}} properties of blends of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with a semiflexible liquid crystalline copolyester (SBH) were studied {{in order to}} assess the compatibilizing ability of added PE-g-SBH copolymers, and its dependence on the molar mass of the PE matrix, and on the technique used for blend preparation. The PE-g-SBH copolymers were synthesized as described in previous articles, either by the polycondensation of the SBH monomers {{in the presence of a}} functionalized PE sample containing free carboxyl groups, or by reactive blending of the latter polymer with preformed SBH. Two samples of HDPE having different molar masses, and two samples of SBH with different melt viscosity and different microstructure, were used for preparing the blends. The two components and the compatibilizer were either blended in a single batch or used to prepare binary <b>master</b> <b>blends</b> to which the third component was added at a later stage. The results indicate that the PE-g-SBH copolymers do, in fact, compatibilize the PE-SBH blends and that the effect is more pronounced with the lower molar mass PE matrix and with the SBH sample having lower viscosity. The experiments carried out on blends prepared with different techniques show that the compatibilizing ability of the graft copolymer is improved if the latter is first blended with either of the two main components.

The homogenization of vanadium, which dictates {{the realization of}} a uniform microstructure of the Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al alloy, was markedly accelerated by SPS. The mechanism is attributed to the intensive Joule heating effect produced by the direct current passing through the electric conducting powder blends, rather than through spark plasma discharge, because homogenization occurred mainly after near full identification had been achieved. The chemical and microstructural homogeneity ensured the achievement of excellent tensile properties of PM Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al in the as-sintered state, with tensile strength > 1250 MPa and elongation > 10 %...|$|R
40|$|Students with {{moderate}} intellectual disabilities (MoID) typically are not taught decoding skills {{because they have}} difficulty <b>mastering</b> critical <b>blending</b> skills. In response to this skill deficit among students with MoID, an Initial Phonics instructional sequence was created that included student development of rapid and automatic retrieval of taught letter-sound correspondences {{to a level of}} mastery before teaching the skill of blending. For each of 16 students with MoID (ages 6 - 15), mastery criterion of letter-sound automaticity phases was determined by their individual naming speed as measured by the Rapid Object Naming (RON) subtest of the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP). Visual analysis of graphically displayed single-case data revealed a functional relation between simultaneous prompting procedures and letter-sound correspondences, automaticity, and blending acquisition for all students. Furthermore, the use of hierarchical linear growth modeling (HLGM) revealed statistical significance for: (a) the impact of daily instruction on the development of letter-sound correspondences, automaticity, and blending in terms of average student growth per instructional session, (b) variability between student growth trajectories within automaticity and blending phases, (c) student pretest scores on RON as an explanatory variable for differences between growth trajectories within automaticity treatment phases, and (d) {{the extent to which the}} number of sessions to mastery within automaticity phases and student age predicted acquisition of blending skills.

40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{compression}} model <b>blends</b> <b>master</b> bone transformations and caches them as virtual bone transformations (left most). It can compress Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) {{model with}} dense weights and generate a fast and compact model without sacrificing {{the quality of}} skinning, compared with dense-weight LBS model. Weighted linear interpolation has been widely used in many skinning techniques including linear blend skinning, dual quaternion blend skinning, and cage based deformation. To speed up performance, these skinning models typically employ a sparseness constraint, in which each 3 D model vertex has a small fixed number of non-zero weights. However, the sparseness constraint also imposes certain limitations to skinning models and their various applications. This paper introduces an efficient two-layer sparse compression technique to substantially reduce the computational cost of a dense-weight skinning model, with insignificant loss of its visual quality. It can directly work on dense skinning weights or use example-based skinning decomposition to further improve its accuracy. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the introduced sparse compression model can significantly outperform {{state of the art}} weight reduction algorithms, as well as skinning decomposition algorithms with a sparseness constraint...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study has been}} made of the sintering and microstructural evolution of Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al compacted from titanium and <b>master</b> alloy powder <b>blends.</b> The densification of Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al at <= 1300 degrees C occurs by solid-state sintering with apparent activation energy of 163 +/- 13 kJ/mol, which falls into the reported activation energy range for the self-diffusion of titanium. The sintered density depends primarily on the titanium powder size while the sintered microstructure and mechanical properties depend mainly on the master alloy type or diffusion of vanadium. The real challenge for the fabrication of Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al by sintering is not densification, which is trivial with relatively fine titanium powder. Rather, it is the realisation of a desired microstructure through master alloy selection or design of the sintering pathway, which determines the distribution of the principal alloying element V. a slow diffuser in beta-Ti. This distinguishes it from the sintering of lean alloys, where the focus has predominantly been on densification. The use of 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al master alloy produced more uniform microstructures and therefore much better ductility than the use of 85 V- 15 Al at similar densities...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: With the {{recognition}} of the need for research capacity strengthening for advancing health and development, this research capacity article explores the use of technology enhanced learning in the delivery of a collaborative postgraduate <b>blended</b> <b>Master</b> 2 ̆ 7 s degree in Malawi. Two research questions are addressed: (i) Can technology enhanced learning be used to develop health research capacity?, and: (ii) How can learning content be designed that is transferrable across different contexts? METHODS: An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was adopted for the evaluation of technology enhanced learning in the Masters programme. A number of online surveys were administered, student participation in online activities monitored and an independent evaluation of the programme conducted. RESULTS: Remote collaboration and engagement are paramount in the design of a blended learning programme and support was needed for selecting the most appropriate technical tools. Internet access proved problematic despite developing the content around low bandwidth availability and training was required for students and teachers/trainers on the tools used. Varying degrees of engagement with the tools used was recorded, and the support of a learning technologist was needed to navigate through challenges faced. CONCLUSION: Capacity can be built in health research through blended learning programmes. In relation to transferability, the support required institutionally for technology enhanced learning needs to be conceptualised differently from support for face-to-face teaching. Additionally, differences in pedagogical approaches and styles between institutions, as well as existing social norms and values around communication, need to be embedded in the content development if the material is to be used beyond the pilot resource-intensive phase of a project...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the effect of non-lubricated warm die (200 C) {{compaction}} on the densification of hydride-dehydride (HDH) Ti powder, pre-alloyed (PA) Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al powders, and HDH Ti and V-Fe-Al <b>master</b> alloy powder <b>blends,</b> compared to cold die compaction. Depending on the compaction pressure, which was varied from 200 to 1000 MPa, non-lubricated warm die (200 C) compaction was very effective for - 100 mesh HDH Ti powder, increasing the green density by 5. 0 - 9. 4 % theoretical density (TD). Die wall lubrication with stearic acid showed no influence on the green density when compacted at 800 MPa. With warm die (200 C) compaction, achieving a green density of greater than 90 %TD was straightforward for HDH Ti powder when compacted at ≥ 750 MPa. Accordingly, near pore-free (≥ 99. 5 %TD) Ti microstructures were obtained after sintering at 1300 C for 120 min in vacuum when compacted at 1000 MPa. The resulting increment in the sintered density was between 2. 0 %TD and 4. 4 %TD. Warm die (200 C) compaction showed no effect on PA Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al powder and only a small effect on PA Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder when compacted at 1000 MPa. However, it was still virtually effective for Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al powder blends made of HDH Ti powder and V-Fe-Al master alloy powder. The observations were compared with literature data and discussed in accordance with the yield strength of Ti, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, Ti- 10 V- 2 Fe- 3 Al and Al 3 V as a function of temperature...|$|R
40|$|Despite our strong intuitions that {{language}} {{is represented in}} memory using some kind of alphabet, phones and phonemes appear to play almost no psychological role in human speech perception, production or memory. Instead, evidence shows that people store linguistic material with a rich, detailed auditory and sensory-motor code that tends, in its details, to be unique for each speaker. The obvious phonological discreteness of languages reflects conventional categories of pronunciation but not discrete symbols. In learning to read, we all <b>master</b> the Speech-Letter <b>Blend,</b> so that letters can be effortlessly interpreted as speech when reading. This Linguistic Intuitions Linguistics, {{for at least the}} last century, has almost invariably subscribed to the following assumption: Speech in any language consists of a sequence of words which are composed from a sequence of phonemic (or phonetic) symbols. This is the standard view of language as the archetypal symbol system and is shared by neighboring disciplines, such as psychology of language and language development. Of course, this assumption is shared by lay people as well since we all have strong intuitions that words and phonemes are just the right units for description of any language. This paper will argue that these intuitions primarily reflect conventions about alphabetical orthographies that have been assumed to be true of spoken language as well, but without sufficient examination (Port, 2007; 2010). In fact, many kinds of familiar data have been incompatible with this assumption for at least 60 years (Pisoni, 1997). But linguists and others have refused to consider seriously the idea that speech may demand much higher dimensionality and thus much richer memory for utterances than has been presumed by the standard view. Interestingly, engineers, despite similar intuitions, began over 40 years ago to turn toward speech recognition systems that seek models of whole words and phrases (rather than phonemes) and to specify them in terms of spectral detail rather than discrete symbols (Jelinek, 1969; Huckvale, 1999). There have been a few attempts to apply these insights to models of human speech perception, such as Klatt’...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{intends to}} study the use of natural elements in architecture {{in order to address}} the issues relating urban built spaces and contemporary architecture in Sri Lanka. Architecture can be defined as an impact on the nature, {{as a result of the}} interaction between man and environment. Due to limitations in human needs and the limitations in their technology, this interaction cause less damage to the natural environment at the earlier evolutionary process of human civilization. As the civilization got sophisticated that equilibrium between nature and man had collapsed resulting damage to the environment. There are various examples that matured architects in earlier civilizations both western and eastern contexts have creations those in harmony with the nature. Even the forefathers of modem architecture like of Frank Lloyd Write or LeCorbusier had some of their <b>master</b> pieces skillfully <b>blend</b> with the natural environment. Human being tended to create new technology and various forms of arts have been developed. Architecture is one of that directly affects the natural setting. In the process of creating the built fabric the nature get amended and loose stability. This phenomenon can be averted if the new creations were done accordance with the environment. Every Human being tends to have some sort of relationship with the nature thou the competitive character of society prevents them enjoying the qualities fully, they interact with the natural environment as they were permitted. Many western urban centers developed with industrialization have incorporated many natural features as parks, water bodies and various types of landscapes to their urban planning and designing and also most of basic concepts for contemporary designs are derivative of the nature. This study focused on exploring the possibilities of incorporating some elements of nature in the forms of water, vegetation, rocks and boulders to improve the quality of the built environment. It is also try to understand the different ways of these elements been used and levels of assimilation. Architecture had been created in different contexts and to facilitate different types of activities. Use of natural elements in these conditions varied in types, quality and quantity giving the built spaces different kinds of expressions. One objective of this study to introduced a typology for these natural elements and records the meanings and expressions they are generating. Being a tropical country, Sri Lanka posse's diversity of natural environment and the different geographical conditions allowed vast array of elements that can be accommodated into the built environment. This is evident in the evolution of traditional Sri Lankan architecture and many ancient remains of urban contexts and buildings provides with valuable information regarding them. The influence of Buddhism on the Sri Lankan community may be a fact that island's architecture created in harmony with the nature also another aspect examine in this study...|$|R
