40|$|Hot weather days cause often large fresh <b>milk</b> <b>defect</b> in {{southern}} developing countries dairy farms {{as well as}} in rural areas where there is a scarcity of energy sources that could run cooling equipments. Consequently, the possibility to use solar cooling starts to be considered an attractive solution. The aim of the work presented is to develop an innovative solar thermally driven cooling concept, to be used for received fresh milk in a dairy factory in the city of Marrakech, Morocco. The work has been carried out in the framework of the EC co-funded project (i. e., MEDISCO). The system is intended for refrigeration at 5 °C in hot climates, and is composed of: medium temperature collector, single effect water ammonia absorption chiller, cold storage. The peculiarity of the configuration is the high temperature difference between the chilled refrigerant temperature, about – 5 °C (in consequence of using an ice storage) and the condenser temperature (ambient temperature, which could exceed 35 °C). In these conditions, the absorption chiller must be driven by a medium temperature heat source (i. e. parabolic trough collector). Moreover, the selected chiller is directly air cooled, and has the main advantage of having no water consumption, low maintenance work and no legionella problems [...] TRNSYS simulations were performed to select the appropriate system configuration, size of the solar collectors ’ field and the storage, heat transfer fluid and control strategy. A summary of the results is given...|$|E

40|$|Fat {{separation}} is a continuous {{problem in the}} production, handling, and storage of evaporated <b>milk.</b> This <b>defect</b> becomes most objectionable during prolonged quiescent storage at high temperatures. The butterfat rises to the upper surface forming a viscous, leathery layer, which may prevent pouring of the milk from a relatively small opening. To retard fat separation, the manufacturer attempts to obtain effective homogenization and sufficient coagulation of the proteins during sterilization to give the product a high viscosity or 2 ̆ 2 heavy body 2 ̆ 2 (1, 12, 14). These practical applications are aimed at three fundamental considerations: {{a reduction in the}} size of the fat globules, an increase in the viscosity of the suspending phase, and perhaps an alteration in the density difference between the fat globule mass and the suspending medium (6) ...|$|R

40|$|Flavor {{control in}} market milk begins {{on the farm}} and {{continues}} through the processing plant and into {{the home of the}} consumer. Flavor control is directly or indirectly related {{to the health of the}} cow, the feeding of the cow, the cleaning and sanitizing of utensils, the cooling of the milk, transportation to the processing plant, and all the steps in processing and distribution of the milk. Consumers judge the quality of milk largely by taste and appearance. Therefore, it is important that each load of milk be checked for off-flavors before it is loaded on the tank truck and again when it is received at the processing plant. Learning to recognize and distinguish certain characteristics of each possible offflavor that may be present in milk is important. This will help the dairyman and the fieldman in tracing the source of any off-flavors in milk and assist in reducing or eliminating the cause. At the end of this article, you will find a chart explaining some of the <b>milk</b> flavor <b>defects,</b> possible causes, and preventions.

40|$|The {{effect of}} milk {{inoculation}} with cultures of Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 {{and of the}} addition of high enzymatic activity (HEA) curds prepared with this strain on casein hydrolysis and formation of peptides during cheese ripening was investigated by capillary electrophoresis and reversed-phase HPLC. Milk inoculation at 2 % with Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 cultures and addition of HEA curds at 10 or 20 % enhanced significantly the degradation of all casein fractions, in particular of β-casein. Also, milk inoculation at 2 % with Micrococcus sp. INIA 528 cultures and addition of HEA curds at 10 or 20 % increased significantly the formation of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether headspace analysis of volatile components {{can be used}} for monitoring the quality of raw cows¿ milk. The detection of different quality defects caused by cows¿ feed, microbiological and chemical contamination, as well as enzymatic deterioration was studied. Fresh raw <b>milk</b> without quality <b>defects</b> was shown to always contain the same seven volatile components. It was also shown that treatments like heating and homogenization of raw milk may drastically change this basic pattern resulting in as much as a 10 -fold {{increase in the number of}} volatile compounds. The growth of Pseudomonas could not be detected in an early stage using headspace analysis. Feed was shown to have an effect on the volatile composition if specific vegetable byproducts were fed to the cow. Chloroform contamination was quantified using the method. Also, the extent of lipolysis could be quantified by measuring the free fatty acids. For quantification of both chloroform and lipolysis, the sensitivity and reproducibility of the method were sufficient for quality control purposes. The method was thus able to detect several quality defects with a single analysis and may therefore be a useful supplementary method for raw milk quality control...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} of key regulators {{of breast cancer}} onset and progression is critical {{for the development of}} targeted therapies. Connexins and pannexins are characterized by their ability to form large-pore channels and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. However, their role in breast cancer progression remains poorly understood {{due to a lack of}} in vivo models capable of assessing the proposed and opposing roles of connexins and pannexins as both tumor suppressors and/or facilitators in multiple stages of the disease. Using 2 previously uncharacterized genetically-modified mice, connexin 43 (Cx 43) and connexin 26 (Cx 26) were evaluated for their role in normal mammary gland development and function prior to using the mice to assess their linkage to breast cancer onset and progression. In addition, pannexin 1 (Panx 1) was evaluated for the first time in the context of mammary gland development and correlated to clinical outcomes in patients with breast cancer using in silico arrays. Using a mouse model expressing a loss-of-function Cx 43 mutant it was revealed that the severity of <b>milk</b> ejection <b>defects</b> associated with Cx 43 are linked to its functional status. Using a similar mouse model induced to develop primary breast cancer lesions, we identified that low functional levels of Cx 43 resulted in mainly hyperplasic mammary glands that greatly increased the frequency of developing metastases to the lungs. Our assessment of mice with conditional knockdown of Cx 26 during pregnancy revealed that basal levels of Cx 26 were sufficient for normal alveolar development and proper lactation, but increased the susceptibility of mammary tumor onset in a chemically induced mouse model of breast cancer. Finally, genetically modified mice with systemic knockout of Panx 1 identified a role for Panx 1 in timely alveolar development during early lactation. In addition, Panx 1 mRNA expression was correlated with worse clinical outcomes in breast cancer. Collectively, our results redefine our view of Cx 43, Cx 26 and Panx 1 in mammary gland development; supporting a tumor suppressive role for Cx 43 and Cx 26, and a tumor facilitating role for Panx 1 in breast cancer progression which may have implications for extending to their use as therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermophilic}} bacilli, such as G. stearothermophilus, are {{an important}} group of contaminants in the dairy industry. Although these bacilli are generally not pathogenic, their presence in dairy products is an indicator of poor hygiene and high numbers are unacceptable to customers. In addition, their growth may result in <b>milk</b> product <b>defects</b> caused by the production of acids or enzymes, potentially leding to off-flavours. These bacteria are able to grow in sections of dairy manufacturing plants where temperatures reach 40 – 65 °C. Furthermore, because they are spore formers, they are difficult to eliminate. In addition, they exhibit a fast growth rate and tend to readily form biofilms. Many strategies have been tested to prevent the formation of thermophilic bacilli biofilms in dairy manufacture, but with limited success. This is, in part, because {{little is known about}} the diversity of strains found in dairy manufacture, the structure of thermophilic bacilli biofilms and how these bacteria have adapted to grow in a dairy environment. In Chapters 2 and 3, phenotypic approaches were taken to understand the diversity of strains within a manufacturing plant. Specifically in Chapter 2, strains of the most dominant thermphilic bacilli, G. stearothermophilus, were isolated from the surface of various locations within the evaporator section and ten strains were evaluated for different phenotypic characteristics. Biochemical profiling, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and fatty profiling demonstrated that the population was diverse. In Chapter 3, it was shown that the same ten strains varied in their ability to form biofilms and produce spores. Three strains of G. stearothermophilus, A 1, P 3 and D 1, were selected for further analysis. SEM demonstrated that there were differences in biofilm morphologies between the three strains, particularly D 1 versus the other two strains, A 1 and P 3. In Chapters 4, 5 and 6 a comparative genomics approach was taken to determine how these bacteria are able to grow and survive within a dairy manufacturing environment, as well as how they differ from other strains of Geobacillus. In Chapter 4 draft genome sequences were generated for three strains of G. stearothermophilus. Identification of a putative lactose operon in the three dairy strains provided evidence of dairy adaptation. In Chapter 5 a phylogenomics approach was taken to resolve relationships within the Geobacillus genus and to identify differences within the G. stearothermophilus group itself. Finally in Chapter 6 comparison with the model organism B. subtilis, gave a genomics insight into the potential mechanisms of sporulation for Geobacillus spp...|$|R

Det finns också sporbildande psykrotrofa bakterier vars sporer kan utvecklas till vegetativa celler vid pastöriseringen och som därefter kan tillväxa i kylskåpstemperaturer. Enzymer som ut- söndrats av psykrotrofer kan orsaka proteolys och lipolys av protein respektive fett som finns i mjölk.

Presence of spoilage {{bacteria in}} <b>milk</b> can cause <b>defects</b> in the <b>milk</b> and shorten it is shelf life. Therefore it is important, {{both for the}} dairy industries {{point of view and}} for the con- sumer, to keep the bacteria count low. The purpose of this literature review is to compile part of the literature about spoilage bacteria, common spoilage flora in milk, what problem they cause and how they can be prevented. In this review the psychrotrophic and thermo resistant bacteria are discussed. The spoilage bacteria can enter the milk in any stage of the milk processing: at the farm or at the dairy industry. Thermo resistant bacteria can cause problem in the pasteurized milk since they survive the heat treatment that is applied at the dairy plant. Bacillus for example, are spore formers and therefore survive pasteurization. The spores are activated by the heat treatment and since some strains of Bacillus also can grow in low temperature they can be present and grow in pasteurized milk. Other psychrotrophic, cold tolerant, bac- teria however does not survive pasteurization. Even though the bacteria are killed in the pasteurization, they can produce heat resistant enzymes that can spoil the pasteurized milk. Pseudomonas for example has these properties. The enzymes that are produced can cause lipolysis or proteolysis of the fat and proteins, respectively. The peptides and fatty acids that are released in the process can cause putrid respectively rancid off-flavour. They can also alter the milk composition which may decrease the yield in cheese making. Different techniques can be used to prevent and decrease the amount of spoilage bacteria in milk. Thermisation (60 - 65 oC, 10 s) can kill psycrothrophs at the farm before they start to produce enzymes. The endospores are activated by the heat treatment and can then be killed in the pasteurization step. By lowering the storage temperature of the milk and change the gas composition in the tank, the keeping time of the milk can increase. Bactofugation and microfiltration is other alternative {{that can be used to}} separate endo- spores and bacteria from milk. By combining these strategies and keep a good hygiene at the farm and at the dairy plant, the bacteria amount in the milk can decrease and the keep- ing time can be prolonged...|$|R
