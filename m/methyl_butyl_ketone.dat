Mutual solubility curves, tie-line data, distribution coefficient, selectivity diagrams and separation factor data were determined for these systems. The thermodynamic consistency of the tie-line data was ascertained by Othmer-Tobias plots as well as by Hand plots. From these data it has been concluded that all these solvents are suitable separating agents for propionic acid from its dilute aqueous solution, but of these solvents methyl isobutyl ketone offers the best hope of achieving separation of propionic acid by distribution between methyl isobutyl ketone and water as it has the highest separation factor value than those of other two solvents...|$|E

The peak inward current in intact axons was reduced {{reversibly}} by each substance. Sodium currents {{were recorded in}} intracellularly perfused axons before and during exposure to the test substances and the records were fitted with equations similar to those proposed by Hodgkin & Huxley (1952). Shifts in the voltage dependence of the steady-state activation and inactivation parameters (m infinity and h infinity), reductions in the peak heights of the activation and inactivation time constants (tau m and tau h) {{and changes in the}} maximum sodium conductance (gNa) caused by these substances have been tabulated and compared with the effects of methyl octanoate (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). Each compound shifted the voltage dependence of the steady-state inactivation parameter in the hyperpolarizing direction and that of the steady-state activation parameter in the depolarizing direction. The shifts produced by the ketones are compared with those produced by methyl pentanoate and by methyl octanoate. The possible role of an interaction between the carbonyl oxygen of the test substance and the sodium channel protein in producing the h infinity shift is discussed. The peak time constants are reduced and the voltage dependences of tau m and tau h are shifted in a direction commensurate with the shifts in steady-state properties. The maximum sodium conductance is not much affected either by the ketones or by methyl pentanoate. Large reductions in peak inward current coupled with little effect on gNa have been reported for the n-alkanols and other surface-active compounds (Haydon & Urban, 1983 b). This lack of a large effect on gNa indicates that whatever direct interaction does take place between the test substance and the channel protein, it does not result in a blockage of the channel...|$|E

40|$|Objectives Phenolic {{antioxidants}} {{are currently}} attracting a growing interest as potential therapeutic agents to counteract diseases associated with oxidative stress. However, their high hydrophilicity {{results in a}} poor bioavailability hindering the development of efficient antioxidant strategies. A promising way to overcome this is to increase their hydrophobicity by lipophilic moiety grafting to form the newly coined 'phenolipids'. Although hydrophobicity is generally considered as advantageous regarding antioxidant properties, it is nevertheless worth investigating whether increasing hydrophobicity necessarily leads to a more efficient antioxidant drug. Methods To answer this question, the antioxidant capacity of a homologous series of phenolics (chlorogenic acid and its <b>methyl,</b> <b>butyl,</b> octyl, dodecyl and hexadecyl esters) toward mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in a ROS-overexpressing fibroblast cell line was investigated using 2, 7 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein. Key findings Overall, the long chain esters (dodecyl and hexadecyl esters) were more active than the short ones (<b>methyl,</b> <b>butyl,</b> and octyl esters), with an optimal activity for dodecyl chlorogenate. Moreover, dodecyl chlorogenate exerted a strong antioxidant capacity, for concentration and incubation time below the cytotoxicity threshold, making it a promising candidate for further in-vivo studies. More importantly, {{we found that the}} elongation of the chain length from 12 to 16 carbons led unexpectedly to a 45 % decrease of antioxidant capacity. Conclusion The understanding of this sudden collapse of the antioxidant capacity through the cut-off theory will be discussed in this article, and may contribute towards development of a rational approach to design novel amphiphilic antioxidant drugs, especially phenolipids with medium fatty chain.

40|$|Termination rate coefficients, kt, for the terpolymerization of {{mixtures}} {{containing the}} three acrylates: <b>methyl,</b> <b>butyl,</b> and dodecyl acrylate or the corresponding {{members of the}} methacrylate family: <b>methyl,</b> <b>butyl,</b> and dodecyl methacrylate, have been measured via the single pulse (SP) -PLP technique. In the homopolymerization {{of each of the}} six monomers an initial plateau region of almost constant kt is seen which extends at least up to 15 % and, for dodecyl acrylate and dodecyl methacrylate, even up to about 50 % monomer conversion. Terpolymerization kt in this region of low and moderate conversion is remarkably well described by a rather simple correlation which exclusively contains homopolymerization kt and the composition of the monomer mixture. This correlation turns out to be very useful for the modeling of kt in mixtures of monomers that exhibit such an initial plateau region of kt. For the systems under investigation, terpolymerization kt, may be estimated within ± 30 %. This finding is very remarkable in view of the enormous differences in homopolymerization kt, within each monomer family, e. g., kt, of methyl acrylate exceeds the corresponding dodecyl acrylate value by a factor of 50 (or 5000 %). The entire set of experiments has been carried out at 40 °C and 1000 bar where the signal to noise ratio of the laser-induced single pulse experiments is very satisfactory. No reason is seen why the conclusions about modeling of terpolymerization kt should not be valid at other reaction conditions including ambient pressure. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D- 69451 Weinheim 1999...|$|R

40|$|Aerobic {{degradation}} of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), previously described for thiobacilli and hyphomicrobia, involves catabolism to sulfide via methanethiol (CH 3 SH). Methyl groups are sequentially eliminated as HCHO by incorporation of O 2 catalyzed by DMS monooxygenase and methanethiol oxidase. H 2 O 2 formed during CH 3 SH oxidation is destroyed by catalase. We recently isolated Thiobacillus strain ASN- 1, which grows either aerobically or anaerobically with denitrification on DMS. Comparative experiments with Thiobacillus thioparus T 5, which grows only aerobically on DMS, indicate a novel mechanism for aerobic DMS catabolism by Thiobacillus strain ASN- 1. Evidence that both organisms initially attacked the methyl group, {{rather than the}} sulfur atom, in DMS was their conversion of ethyl methyl sulfide to ethanethiol. HCHO transiently accumulated during the aerobic use of DMS by T. thioparus but not with Thiobacillus strain ASN- 1. Catalase levels in cells grown aerobically on DMS were about 100 -fold lower in Thiobacillus strain ASN- 1 than in T. thioparus T 5, suggesting the absence of H 2 O 2 formation during DMS catabolism. Also, aerobic growth of T. thioparus T 5 on DMS was blocked by the catalase inhibitor 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole whereas that of Thiobacillus strain ASN- 1 was not. <b>Methyl</b> <b>butyl</b> ether, but not CHCl 3, blocked DMS catabolism by T. thioparus T 5, presumably by inhibiting DMS monooxygenase and perhaps methanethiol oxidase.

The use of chemical methods to decrease mycotoxin producer moulds contamination on food crops in the field, during storage, and/or during processing, has been proved to be efficient. In this work, the antifungal effect of 5 -CQA and a homologous series of 5 -CQA esters (<b>methyl,</b> <b>butyl,</b> octyl, dodecyl), was investigated using the microdilution method and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC 50 and MIC 80). All molecules presented antifungal activity, and two esters showed a MIC for all fungi: octyl (MIC 50 _ 0. 5 e 0. 75 mg/mL, MIC 80 ¼ 1. 0 e 1. 5 mg/mL) and dodecyl (MIC 50 ¼ 0. 75 e 1. 25 mg/mL) chlorogenates. Dodecyl chlorogenate showed a MIC 80 (1. 5 mg/mL) only for A. parasiticus. The maximum percent of growth inhibition on aspergillii was observed with octyl (78. 4 e 92. 7 %) and dodecyl (54. 5 e 83. 7 %) chlorogenates, being octyl chlorogenate the most potent antifungal agent. It was thus concluded that lipophilization improved the antifungal properties of 5 -CQA, which increased with the ester alkyl chain length, exhibiting a cut-off effect at 8 carbons. As far as we know, {{it is the first}} report demonstrating that lipophilization may improve the antifungal activity of 5 -CQA on five toxigenic moulds from the Aspergillus genus.
