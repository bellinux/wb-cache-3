The development of mealiness was analyzed over 3 years to quantify the expression of this chilling injury (CI) symptom in different growth seasons. For such a purpose, 'O'Henry' peaches, considered a CI susceptible cultivar, were harvested and stored at 0 degrees C (non-CI inducing conditions) and 4 degrees C (CI inducing conditions) for 15, 21 and 30 days. Quantitative measurements of <b>juice</b> <b>content</b> in the fruits, an indicator of mealiness, showed that there was a significant variation in the expression of the disorder over the years, being higher in 2 years of evaluations. As expected, there was a reduction in <b>juice</b> <b>content,</b> or a higher incidence of mealiness, with longer cold-storage especially at 4 degrees C.
