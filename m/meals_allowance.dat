40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts of meal voucher sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features of the Czech meal voucher scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison of the Czech meal voucher system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> on various income deciles, quantify the impact of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment of current <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> by flat <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form of <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent households receive <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement of current <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> scheme by one with a flat <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|Justice Brennan, {{writing for}} the majority, first swiftly ruled out the {{possibility}} that the <b>meal</b> <b>allowances</b> payments are not [...] "income" [...] under §61(a): Commissioner v.

50|$|Until 1949, {{the state}} police {{provided}} a meal to patrol officers at the nearest station which was replaced with a <b>meal</b> <b>allowance</b> so they didn't need to leave the area where they were patrolling.

The Commissioner believed that this amount should have been included in income, and determined a tax deficiency. Kowalski argued that the cash <b>meal</b> <b>allowance</b> was not compensatory, but was furnished for the convenience of the employer and therefore wasn’t income under I.R.C. §61(a), and that alternatively, it was excluded under I.R.C. §119.|$|R

The study used descriptive statistics (frequencies, and percentages) to answer three research questions posed for the study the result obtained from the analysis showed that there existed relationship between employee motivation and the organizational performance. The study reveals that extrinsic and instinct motivation given to workers in an organization has a significant influence on the workers performance. This is in line with equity theory which emphasizes that fairness in the remuneration package tends to produce higher performance from workers. It is recommended that all firms should adopt extrinsic and intrinsic incentive in their various firms to increase employee performance. On the bases of these findings, employers are continually challenged to develop good motivation polices on pay policies, etc good working condition, promotion, training, rewards, <b>meals</b> <b>allowances,</b> and procedures that will enable them to attract, motivate, retain and satisfy their employees.

30|$|Our employee-level data provide {{not only}} total yearly wage {{but also its}} {{different}} wage components: basic wage, bonus, supplements, and overtime pay. Bonuses can differ between individuals and {{are based on the}} productivity of workers. Supplements are given to all workers with certain job characteristic, such as those who work night hours or who have more years of tenure in the firm. Information on pay is the yearly total. We divide this yearly total by 12 to construct a monthly pay variable. In comparing wages to the legal minimum wage it is important to use the correct measure of wages. Legally, the wage compared to the minimum wage should include the basic wage plus bonus plus some, but not all, supplements. Overtime pay, the employer contribution to social insurance, and some legally-mandated supplements should be excluded. Other wage supplements that should be excluded when comparing wages to the minimum wage include those for working the night shift and working under dangerous or uncomfortable working conditions. Wage supplements that should be included when comparing wages to the minimum wage are those that are not legally mandated, and include those for medical and health benefits, for tenure, <b>meal</b> <b>allowances,</b> transportation supplements, supplements for books and newspapers, and cost of living adjustments. However, our data only report total supplements paid to workers. That is, we cannot distinguish between supplements that are legally required {{to be included in the}} minimum wage and those legally excluded. Because we cannot distinguish which part of reported supplements should or should not be included when comparing to the minimum wage, when we calculate the proportion of full-time workers earning less than the monthly minimum wage, we present two estimates: the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus (an upper bound) and the proportion earning less than the basic wage plus bonus plus supplements (a lower bound).|$|R

Eight possibilities of tax optimization are mentioned in this thesis, namely superannuation scheme allowence, personal life insurance <b>allowance,</b> food <b>allowance</b> (<b>meal</b> tickets), long-term property renewal provision, utilising the tax allowance in connection with reduced working capacity employees, acquiring immaterial tangible assets, acquiring long-term tangible assets and tax relief when providing donations.

This descriptive case study survey was guided by the theories of campus ecology, cognitive dissonance, and relative deprivation to identify {{the root causes of}} students’ unrest. The research focused on the academic, managerial and allocative, political, religious and welfare issues as areas of the root causes of students’ unrest in the higher learning institution. In most cases,the university administration used authoritarian methods. Alternative approaches which involved problem solving, negotiation and arbitration were emphasised. It was argued that students’ unrestled to destruction of property, stoppage of academic programmes, and loss of peaceful learning environment, and lowers the credibility of the institution. The major technique of data collection were documentary review and interviews of the key informants of the selected unrests. The research has employed Mkumbo’s (2002) steps of analysing students’ crises. These steps were:defining the students’ unrest, events leading to the unrest, characterisation of the unrest, needs that required attention and mechanism used to solve the unrest.
