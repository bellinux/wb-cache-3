40|$|Tamandua tetradactyla, Xenarthra, is {{a native}} species from South America which, due to the few number of studies on its biology, still has many unknown aspects in its morphology. Taking into account the {{importance}} of morphological data for various studies, this paper aimed to elucidate the branching of the abdominal aorta in this species to foster the development of further studies. To do this, 4 specimens were used, 2 male and 2 female, all young, from the Bauxite Mine – Paragominas, Para, Brazil, donated after death due to running over to the Animal Morphology Research Laboratory (LaPMA) of Universidade Federal Rural da Amazonia (UFRA). The arterial system was filled with contrasted latex and the animals were fixed in a formaldehyde solution (10 %), and then dissected, in order to evidence the abdominal aorta and its collateral branches. The parietal branches consisted of 1 pair of caudal phrenic arteries, 2 pairs of intercostal arteries, and 3 pairs of lumbar arteries. Among the visceral branches, stood out: celiac artery; cranial mesenteric artery; adrenal arteries; renal arteries; caudal mesenteric artery; and external, internal, and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> iliac <b>arteries,</b> formed from the final portion of the abdominal aorta. Testicular and ovarian arteries originated from the renal arteries, differing from that described in various species...|$|R
40|$|The lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> usually {{originates}} {{from the}} posterior {{trunk of the}} internal iliac artery. The current study of 342 specimens from 171 cadavers (79 male, 92 female) investigated the origin and course of the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b> It was observed to arise from the posterior trunk in 79. 1 %. Occasionally it originated from the anterior trunk that occurred in 1 %. It arose from the sciatic artery in 8. 8 %, from the superior gluteal artery in 16. 8 %, and from the inferior gluteal artery in 5. 4 %. Conversely, the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> is congenital absence in 0. 3 %. In addition, the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> was single, double, triple, and quadruple in 77. 2 %, 19. 8 %, 2. 3 %, and 0. 3 %, respectively. Consequently, variability of the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> origin is due to vascular demand as the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> plexus does arise from the earlier trunk development. With variability of the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> origin, there is a variability of the sciatic nerve supply. Knowing the variability of origins, surgeons have to avoid prolonged ligation of the internal iliac artery or its posterior trunk during surgical procedures which may lead to sciatic neuropathy. Therefore, the lateral <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> origin, course, and branches are important for clinicians to improve their knowledge and patient management...|$|R

50|$|The {{abdominal}} aorta {{gives rise to}} lumbar and musculophrenic arteries, renal and middle suprarenal arteries, and visceral arteries (the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery). It ends in a bifurcation into {{the left and right}} common iliac arteries. At the point of the bifurcation, there also springs a smaller branch, the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another system {{divides the}} aorta {{with respect to}} its course and the {{direction}} of blood flow. In this system, the aorta starts as the ascending aorta then travels superiorly from the heart and then makes a hairpin turn known as the aortic arch. Following the aortic arch, the aorta then travels inferiorly as the descending aorta. The descending aorta has two parts. The aorta begins to descend in the thoracic cavity, and consequently {{is known as the}} thoracic aorta. After the aorta passes through the diaphragm, it is known as the abdominal aorta. The aorta ends by dividing into two major blood vessels, the common iliac arteries and a smaller midline vessel, the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{reported}} {{prevalence of}} ARA ranges from 12 to 49 % [1, 2]. The problems {{most likely to}} occur during EVAR for AAA with ARA are renal infarction caused by ARA obstruction and type II endoleaks from ARA blood flow. As ARA coverage {{has been reported to}} increase risk of renal infarction, with reported rates ranging from 0 to 84 %, ARA reconstruction procedures have been devised using fenestrated stentgrafts, branched stentgrafts, or debranching [7 – 9]. Yet some believe that the reconstruction of ARA is unnecessary since it offers no significant benefit in terms of eGFR or blood pressure control [3 – 6]. Type II endoleak occurs from the lumbar artery, inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery,</b> and accessory renal artery (ARA). These branches act as inflow or outflow depending on the pressure gradient between the aorta and each branch. When a renal artery is covered with a stentgraft, the pressure on the kidney parenchyma is decreased. Yet covering the ARA while leaving the renal artery uncovered would result in high pressure, and the ARA would act as inflow. Therefore, ARA larger than 3  mm has been reported as a potential cause of type II endoleak [5]. Because of this, prophylactic ARA coil embolization for ARAs larger than 3  mm is effective for reduction of type II endoleak. In general, routine embolization for lumbar artery, IMA, and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> is not recommended. In our case, we did not embolize any of these branches.|$|E
40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the arteries on the anterolateral {{surfaces}} of the lower two lumbar vertebral bodies has been described in 100 living subjects, using radiographs obtained at aortography. The classic description of this anatomy is commonly correct in the young subject. In addition, a precostal anastomosis was seen in 5 out of 7 subjects aged 10 years or younger. Distortion of this pattern was seen in older subjects; most of this distortion was due to degenerative disease. The average number of observed arteries around the fifth lumbar vertebral body declined steadily in decennial age groups over 30 years, but {{a statistically significant difference}} could not be found between the categories of indications for aortography, nor between those judged grossly atherosclerotic and those not so judged as a result of aortography. The precostal anastomosis is an important collateral supply in some older subjects with arterial disease. In addition, a common artery of origin for the fourth lumbar arteries was observed in 15 subjects, and an origin from the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> for the fourth lumbar arteries was observed in two subjects. These features have not previously been described in healthy subjects...|$|E
40|$|The radiologic {{anatomy of}} the aortic {{bifurcation}} in the rabbit has received little study {{but it is important}} as this anatomical area is widely used in atherosclerosis research. Thirty rabbits were used to study the aortic bifurcation and subsequent branching patterns on arteriography. Fifteen different arteries were identified. Mean arterial diameters of 2. 88 ± 0. 7 and 2. 27 ± 0. 55 mm were obtained for the aorta and external iliac arteries, respectively. The cranial and middle aspects at the seventh lumbar vertebra (L 7) were the most frequent anatomical landmarks (53. 3 % of the cases) for aortic and common iliac bifurcations, respectively. The caudal aspect of L 6 was the most frequent origin (50 % of the cases) for the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b> Deep circumflex iliac arteries originated from common iliac arteries and not the abdominal aorta in the rabbit, showing anatomical asymmetry in 73. 3 % of the cases. No gender disparity was found in the anatomical location of any of the arteries of the study. Knowledge of normal vascular landmarks for the aortic bifurcation as well as anatomical variations should be helpful to future experimental studies...|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{variations}} {{were found}} in a 54 -year-old male cadaver during routine dissections of abdominal retroperitoneal region. Right inferior phrenic artery was arising from right renal artery, while the right middle and superior suprarenal artery branched from the right inferior phrenic artery. Left inferior phrenic artery was originating from the abdominal aorta below celiac trunk. The left middle suprarenal artery appeared as the branch of celiac trunk. Double left renal artery was arising separately {{from the left side}} of the aorta. The upper left renal artery showed approximately 80 º of kinking which then crossed the lower one and entered to the inferior pole of hilum of kidney. Left testicular artery was originating from the upper left renal artery after this kinking. The left and right fourth lumbar arteries and <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> have branched from a common trunk posterior to the abdominal aorta. In spite of these abundant variations in the branches, abdominal aorta itself did not show any variation, spanning normally between the levels of T 12 –L 4 vertebrae.

40|$|URL] The genus Aotus {{is found}} in South America and {{is known for its}} nocturnal habit. The {{morphology}} of the genus is poorly understood even though it is used in biomedical research. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the collateral branches of the abdominal aorta of two females and one male Aotus azarae infulatus (commonly known as the night monkey). The vessels were observed and stained with Neoprene latex and radiopaque contrast. The animals were fixed in an aqueous solution of 10 % formaldehyde via intramuscular and intracavitary routes, dissected and radiographed. It was observed that the celiac artery was divided into three subjacent branches, the gastric, hepatic and splenic arteries. The left and right renal arteries originated from a common trunk in two animals (animals 1 and 2), while the adrenal artery in one of the animals was derived from the celiac trunk and renal artery (animal 2). In one animal the mesenteric artery flow gave rise to individual cranial rectal, sigmoid and left colic arteries (animal 3). In the three animals the abdominal aorta bifurcated in the final portion of the abdomen, with the external and internal iliac artery on each side, and then the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery.</b> These anatomical variations need to be identified and reported because these animals are frequently used in clinical and surgical, veterinary practices...|$|E
40|$|Neste estudo, utilizaram-se 30 nutrias, 15 fêmeas e 15 machos, com o sistema {{arterial}} aórtico-abdominal preenchido com látex 603, pigmentado em vermelho, e fixado em uma solução aquosa de formaldeído a 20 %. A aorta abdominal emitiu de sua superfície dorsal de 6 a 8 artérias lombares únicas. Das artérias renais, direita e esquerda, originaram-se as artérias frênico-abdominal para irrigar parte do diafragma e da parede abdominal lateral cranial. A aorta abdominal lançou dorsalmente, a artéria sacral mediana, cranialmente a sua bifurcação em artérias ilíacas comuns. As artérias ilíacas comuns, ramos terminais da aorta abdominal, originaram as artérias ilíacas interna e externa. A artéria ilíaca interna distribuiu-se nas vísceras da cavidade pélvica. A artéria ilíaca externa emitiu uma artéria umbilical e, antes de alcançar o anel femoral, lançou a artéria circunflexa ilíaca profunda para a parede abdominal lateral, em seus dois terços caudais. A artéria ilíaca externa lançou o tronco pudendo-epigástrico, que originou a artéria epigástrica caudal, para a parede abdominal ventral e a artéria pudenda externa, que saiu pelo canal inguinal, para irrigar a genitália externa. Os ramos parietais diretos da aorta abdominal foram as artérias lombares e a artéria sacral mediana, enquanto as artérias frênico-abdominal, circunflexa ilíaca profunda e epigástrica caudal, foram ramos colaterais parietais indiretos. Os ramos terminais da artéria aorta abdominal foram as artérias ilíacas comuns com seus ramos, as artérias ilíacas interna e externa.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of arterial diseases in the arteries supplying the lumbar spine and their relation to other vascular diseases, {{as well as to}} chronic low back pain.  METHODS—Five pairs of the lumbar arteries and the middle <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> were evaluated from 140  postmortem aortograms, performed in connection with routine medicolegal necropsies on subjects ranging from 16  to 89  years of age. For information about low back pain history, a close relative of each of the deceased was interviewed two to four weeks after the necropsy.  RESULTS—Twenty one (22 %) men and nine (20 %) women had occluded arteries, and an additional 33  (35 %) men and 17  (38 %) women had narrowed arteries. The mean age for men with occluded or narrowed arteries, or both, was 50  years and for women 59  years. Most of the stenotic changes were seen at the orifices or {{in the first part of}} the <b>arteries.</b> The middle <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> was most often affected, followed by the fourth lumbar arteries. The number of collateral arteries increased with occluded (p < 0. 001) and narrowed arteries (p =  0. 001). Stenotic lumbar/middle <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries</b> were found, on average, five years earlier than atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Subjects with one or more occluded/narrowed arteries were 8. 5  times more likely to have suffered from chronic (that is, three months or longer) low back pain at some time during their life than were those without such findings (odds ratio adjusted for age and sex 8. 5; 95 % confidence intervals 2. 9,  24; p < 0. 001).  CONCLUSIONS—The study shows that the lumbar and middle <b>sacral</b> <b>arteries</b> frequently become obliterated by atheromatous lesions during adult life, and that obliteration of these arteries is more common in subjects with a history of chronic back pain than in those without. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In humans the glomus coccygeus was {{described}} in 1860 by Luschka. It is present at the coccyx tip and corresponds to a complex anastomosis between the <b>median</b> <b>sacral</b> <b>artery</b> and vein, and it is innervated by sympathetic fibers. In rats and mice it has been located in the tail ventral face. Its function is not known. According to our previous work, which demonstrated that hematopoiesis is under a noradrenergic control {{and based on the}} presence of epithelioid cells and sympathetic innervation, we assumed that the coccygeal gland might influence hematopoiesis via neuroendocrine or neural mechanisms. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to analyze the effect of glomus coccygeus on hematopoiesis. MATERIAL & METHODS: Peripheral blood leukocyte and platelet concentrations as well as body temperature (BT) and body weight (BW), and norepinephrine (NE), adrenaline (A) and dopamine (DA) content in bone marrow of Luschkaectomized (LCGx), Sham LCGx operated (ShLCGx) and normal mice (Co) were investigated. RESULTS: We found that in LCGx vs. ShLCGx and Co, platelets and neutrophils increased while lymphocytes decreased. The effect of LCGx was significant from day 0 until day 65. Total leukocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, eosinophils and BT did not show any variation. Moreover, 22 days after the operation the amount of NE, A and DA seemed to be decreased in LCGx vs. ShLCGx while the difference was less evident between ShLCGx vs. Co. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests {{for the first time a}} possible hematopoietic function and an immunomodulatory activity of the "Luschka's body" or Coccygeal body by a modulation of the sympathetic nervous system...|$|E

Most were related to patent lumbar arteries. An active policy of intraprocedural aneurysm pressure sac measurement and angiography was used to demonstrate type-I and type-II endoleaks, focusing on the applied anatomy of aortic side branches and variations. Selective intraprocedural coli embolisation and thrombin injection into the sac was utilised to thrombose persisting and large lumbar arteries that predisposed to retroleaks. We recorded a low incidence of persisting type-II endoleaks using this proactive treatment strategy by addressing variant aortic morphology and patent lumbar arteries during EVAR. One aneurysm-related death (0. 6 %) was observed due to late rupture after EVAR, and a single intraprocedural death was related to unpredictable aneurysm rupture. In conclusion, comprehensive anatomical knowledge of the abdominal aorta and its main collateral side branches, including variations, is a fundamental prerequisite if satisfactory and predictable results are to be achieved after EVAR, especially regarding prevention, diagnosis and treatment of type-II endoleaks.
