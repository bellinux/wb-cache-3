25|$|Snyder saw school {{buildings}} as civic monuments {{for a better}} society. He was concerned with health and safety issues in public schools and focused on fire protection, ventilation, lighting, and classroom size. Snyder used terra cotta blocks in floor construction to improve fireproofing, and large and numerous windows to allow more light and air into the classrooms. He also developed new methods for <b>mechanical</b> <b>air</b> circulation in {{school buildings}}. The problem of school design in New York was compounded by the relatively constricted sites which were necessitated by {{the high cost of}} land acquisition.|$|E
25|$|Air {{conditioning}} is {{the cooling}} and de-humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Using {{a system of}} coils {{as a solution to}} cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first <b>mechanical</b> <b>air</b> conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier's invention – encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.|$|E
25|$|Not all fly ashes meet ASTM C618 requirements, {{although}} {{depending on}} the application, {{this may not be}} necessary. Ash used as a cement replacement must meet strict construction standards, but no standard environmental regulations have been established in the United States. 75% of the ash must have a fineness of 45µm or less, and have a carbon content, measured by the loss on ignition (LOI), of less than 4%. In the U.S., LOI must be under 6%. The particle size distribution of raw fly ash tends to fluctuate constantly, due to changing performance of the coal mills and the boiler performance. This makes it necessary that, if fly ash is used in an optimal way to replace cement in concrete production, it must be processed using beneficiation methods like <b>mechanical</b> <b>air</b> classification. But if fly ash is used also as a filler to replace sand in concrete production, unbeneficiated fly ash with higher LOI can be also used. Especially important is the ongoing quality verification. This is mainly expressed by quality control seals like the Bureau of Indian Standards mark or the DCL mark of the Dubai Municipality.|$|E

2500|$|The city grew explosively in the 1950s; the {{population}} expanded {{by a factor}} of three, and industry {{by a factor of}} fifteen. [...] The growth brought serious problems of minority housing, traffic congestion, smog, and a fading of the traditional laid-back Phoenix lifestyle. By 1950, over 105,000 people lived within the city and thousands more in surrounding communities. There were 148miles (238km) of paved streets and 163miles (262km) of unpaved streets. [...] The 1950s growth was spurred on by advances in <b>mechanical</b> <b>air</b> conditioning, which allowed both homes and businesses to offset the extreme heat known to Phoenix during its long summers. Affordable cooling in the decade contributed to a wild building boom. In 1959 alone, Phoenix saw more new construction than it had in the more than three decades from 1914 to 1946.|$|E

60|$|The unfortunate to {{be punished}} held out his arm at a level with his shoulder, back uppermost. Raising his arm so that the rod fell almost {{straight}} behind his back, Dr. Litter would bring it down, stroke after stroke, with a passionless and <b>mechanical</b> <b>air,</b> but with a sweeping force which did its work thoroughly. Four cuts was the normal number, {{but if it was}} the third time a boy had been sent up during the term he would get six. But four sufficed to swell the back of the hand, and cover it with narrow weals and bruises. It was of course a point of honour that no sound should be uttered during punishment. When it was over the Doctor would throw the broken rod scornfully upon the ground and return to his seat. The Junior then carried it away and placed a fresh one upon the desk.|$|E
60|$|The cowboys jeered at first, {{but after}} a time they began to marvel at the dogged walk of the youth. They {{gathered}} about {{the walls of the}} corral and laid bets on the outcome. At {{the end of the third}} hour Kintuck walked with a <b>mechanical</b> <b>air,</b> all the fire and fury gone out of him. He began to allow his pursuer to approach him closely, almost near enough to be touched. At the end of the four hours he allowed Mose to lay his hand on his nose, and Mose petted him and went to dinner. Odds stood in Mose's favor as he returned to the corral. He was covered with dust and sweat, but he was confident. He began to speak to the horse in a gentle, firm voice. At times the stallion faced him with head lifted, a singular look in his eyes, as though he meditated leaping upon his captor. At first Mose took no notice of these actions, did not slacken his pace, but continued to press the bay on and on. At last he began to approach the horse with his hand lifted, looking him in the eyes and speaking to him. Snorting as if with terror, the splendid animal faced him again and again, only to wheel at the last moment.|$|E
40|$|This report summarises {{the work}} of WP 4, {{a part of the}} METRO project. It investigates theperformance of various smoke control systems for use in {{underground}} stations having only one exit to ground level. Two different smoke control systems with two different configurations were investigated: A pressurizing (positive pressure) supply air system; a pressurizing supply air system with platform screen doors; a <b>mechanical</b> exhaust <b>air</b> system with extraction fittings above the track area; and a <b>mechanical</b> exhaust <b>air</b> system with platform screen doors. Simulations were performed using Fire Dynamics Simulator, investigating two different heat release rates – 20 MW and 60 MW. The results show that both the pressurizing supply air system and the <b>mechanical</b> exhaust <b>air</b> system provide effective smoke control. The advantages of a positive pressure supply air system are a relatively simple installation and a lower requisite flow capacity of the fans. The disadvantage is that the smoke is not dispelled, but can be spread to other platforms of the station and even to the next station. The advantages of a mecha- nical exhaust system are that the hot smoke is removed, and that the spread of smoke is restricted to the platform directly exposed to the fire. Disadvantages include the needfor a duct system, which requires space, and considerably higher fan capacities. METRO-projekte...|$|R
