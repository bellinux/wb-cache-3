40|$|The {{formation}} of electrospun poly(var epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) fibres between two collection rings is described, and {{the conversion of}} these fibres into a <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> of is demonstrated. During electrospinning, when two grounded rings are placed equidistantly from the spinneret, an array of fibres is formed between the collection rings. These rapidly produced fibres are three-dimensionally suspended in air, and demonstrate low incidence of fibre splitting when lower voltages are applied. Such electrospun fibres, with a diameter of 1. 26 ± 0. 19 ?m and a length between 40 and 100 mm, were oriented and continuous. Furthermore, manufacture of the fibre array was easily achievable, reproducible and not subject to relatively small changes in spinneret-ground distance or applied voltage. Rotation {{of one of the}} collection rings results in a wound <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> with a diameter below 5 ?m, and a length of 50 mm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{comparative}} {{experimental study of}} single jersey knitted fabrics made from a novel bio-based and degradable polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn,</b> together with polylactide acid, Cupro, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyamide 6 (PA 6) multi-filament yarns. Their structures, mechanical, thermal and surface properties and performances as well as anti-bacterial behavior are measured and compared. It {{has been found that}} the polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) filament yarn has adequate thermal and mechanical properties for normal textile and coloration/finishing processes. The Young's modulus of polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> is the lowest among all the candidates investigated except for polyamide 6 (PA 6). The dyed polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) fabric has the highest softness rating among all the fabrics. Single jersey knitted fabrics from the polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) filament yarn have a bursting strength, extension and recovery that satisfy the industrial requirement. In addition, after fully relaxation, the dyed polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) knitted fabrics exhibit an outstanding pilling resistance, favorable snagging property, as well as good air permeability, Qmax and smoother surface. Finally, this study has led to a discovery of excellent anti-bacterial performance of 100 % polylactide acid/poly (hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) (PLA/PHBV) fabrics against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, candida albicans according to AATCC 100 - 2012.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{performance}} of a bond layer between the <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> and the cementitious matrix. The performance of the bond layer is a central issue in the development of textile-reinforced concrete. The changes in the microstructure during the loading result in distinguished failure mechanisms on the micro, meso and macro scales. The paper provides a brief review of these effects and describes a modeling strategy capable of reflecting the failure process. Using the model of the bond layer we illuminate the correspondence between the disorder in the microstructure of the yarn and the bonding behavior at the meso- and macro level. Particular interest is paid to the influence of irregularities in the micro-structure (relative differences in filament lengths, varying bond quality, bond-free length) for different levels of local bond quality between the filament surface and the matrix. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{presented}} paper copes with {{an experimental}} valida-tion {{of a model}} based on modified Weibull size effect theory. Classical statistical Weibull theory was modified by introducing a new param-eter (correlation length lρ) representing the spatial autocorrelation of a random mechanical properties of material. This modification is here compared with experimental data obtained for two different materials used in civil engineering: unreinforced (plain) concrete and <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarns</b> made of alkali-resistant (AR) glass which are used for textile-reinforced concrete. The behavior under flexural and tensile loading is investigated by laboratory experiments. A high number of specimens of different sizes was tested to obtain statistically significant data which were subsequently corrected and statistically processed. Results of the experiments showed a decreasing average strength with an increasing sample length. Size effect curves were obtained and the correlation length was fitted according to measured data. Results do not disclaim {{the existence of the}} proposed new parameter lρ. Keywords—Statistical size effect, concrete, <b>multi-filaments</b> <b>yarns,</b> experiment, autocorrelation length.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{conventional}} intermingling process uses {{a high-speed}} air jet, positioned {{in the path}} of the yarn being textured; to create knot-like intermittent entangled nodes (‘nips ’ or ‘tacks’) in the textured thermoplastic continuous <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn.</b> This paper reports a proof-of-concept research into the use of a pulse laser to fuse such yarns at discrete points at regular intervals along its length to impart cohesion at required frequencies. Pulse frequency and duration, hence the heat intensity, are varied to determine a suitable range of operating conditions. Results from a range of polyester and nylon yarns show that fusing textured filament yarn to create nips is feasible using a pulse laser as an alternative to intermingling by air jets. The multifilament yarn is also modeled to compute the heat flow in the yarn when heated by a pulse laser. This model can be used, as a tool to estimate the heat energy required to fuse a given textured yarn...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the influence of}} variations in material properties along the <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> on the overall response in the tensile test. In Part I (Chudoba, Vořechovský and Konrad, 2006), we have described the applied model and studied the influence of scatter of material characteristics varying in the cross-section with no variations along the filaments. In particular, we analyzed the influence of varying cross-sectional area, filament length and delayed activation. Inclusion of these effects has lead to a better interpretation of the experimental data, especially {{with respect to the}} gradual stiffness activation, post-peak behavior and some form of size effect. In the present paper, the length-related distributions of local stiffness and strength are included in terms of theoretical considerations and by applying the Monte Carlo type simulation of random fields. Such an approach allows us (1) to demonstrate the strong need for including length scale to random fluctuation of strength along the filaments and (2) to combine several sources of randomness in a single analysis so that their significance can be evaluated from the tensile test response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a thorough study of sources of randomness/disorder in multi-filament yarns {{that are relevant}} for their performance in textile reinforced concrete. For the analysis of bundles with infinite number of fibers we use a continuous analytical model with refined kinematic hypothesis. In parallel, we apply a more general discrete numerical bundle model covering the cases of finite number of fibers and spatial variations of material properties. The considered distributions of material properties include variations of parameters (local stiffness and strength) both from filament to filament and over the length of each filament. In the present paper, we study the influence of variations in filament properties across the bundle. In the companion paper (Vořechovský, M., Chudoba, R., 2006. Stochastic modeling of multi-filament yarns. II. Random properties over the length and size effect. International Journal of Solids and Structures), the variations of material properties over the length are considered. Both papers {{provide the basis for}} correct interpretation of the data obtained from the tensile test on <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> with varied specimen length. As the actual goal of the present work is to derive yarn characteristics relevant for crack bridges in cementitious composites we systematically assess the significance of the studied sources of disorder in the context of extremely short bundle lengths...|$|E

The pull-out behavior is characterized by direct pull-out tests performed on different glass rovings.

40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{presented}} bachelor’s thesis was {{the establishment of a}} probabilistic model for material strength of textile reinforcement used for textile reinforced concrete. This reinforcement is composed of AR-glass <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarns.</b> The goal of this thesis was to determine the potential weak spot of the textile yarn and evaluate its strength in overall. The weak spot could have been a lateral cross-connection, which narrowed the textile yarn at several locations. Another thing of interest was the observation of statistical size effect with the increasing length of textile yarn. In order to properly fit the numerical model to real behavior of <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarns,</b> five series of experimental tensile testing has been executed in laboratory. Each series consisted of 8 - 10 specimens and had a different yarn length. Maximum tensile force and maximum deformation have been measured to obtain L-D diagrams for each specimen. Measured data were statistically analyzed and gave the information necessary for the identification of probabilistic model parameters. This parameter estimation has been carried out with the help of numerical and optimization methods included in Python programming algorithms. The problem statement resulted in a combination of model parameters describing the textile yarn behavior. The statistical size effect was observed corresponding to the Weibull theory. The performed study showed that the failure of the textile yarn depends on material strength of its filaments. There are no load concentrators at the location of lateral cross-connections affecting the yarn failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{scope of}} the {{presented}} master thesis was the experimental study of <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarns</b> made of AR-glass and used for textile-reinforced concrete. The behavior under the tensile loading was investigated by laboratory tests. A high number of yarn specimens (over 300) of six different lengths (from 1 cm to 74 cm) was tested to obtain statistically significant data which were subsequently corrected and statistically processed. The numerical model of the multi-filament bundle was studied and applied for prediction of the yarn performance and for later results interpretation. The model of n parallel filaments describes {{the behavior of a}} bundle with varying parameters representing different sources of disorder of the response and provides the qualitative information about the influence of their randomization on the overall bundle response. The aim of the carried experiment was to validate the model presumptions and to identify the model parameters to fit the real load-displacement curves. Unfortunately, due to unsuccessful correction of measured displacements devalued by additional non-linear contribution of the unstiff experiment device the load-displacement diagrams were not applicable to model parameters identification. The statistical evaluation was carried only for the maximal load values and the effect of the specimen size (length) on its strength was demonstrated. The size effect curve did not exclude the existence of spatial correlation of material mechanical properties modifying the classical statistical Weibull theory...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} the {{interaction}} between <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarn</b> and cementitious matrix can give a good comprehension of bond and failure mechanism of this type of composite. This study may be carried out by means of pull-out test which is an applicable tool to investigate the shear bond properties. In order to better understand the bond behavior of a continues glass fiber /matrix system, in this work a series of pull-out tests is performed with different types of fiber. Applied a uniform tensile load uniaxial from one side on the composite, hence matrix cracking strength are required as soon as crack begin formed along continuous fiber. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} the load bearing capacity do not only depend on the properties of materials constitutive (micro concrete / fibers) but in reality the principal feature depends on the interaction of the fiber and the matrix. This interaction between fiber and matrix is characterized by different parameters such as bond strengths Gc, τc, bond modulus k, ascending stiffness kbond, descending stiffness kdebond and pull-out toughness A. These parameters are determined from pull-out experiment curves for different types of fiber. The comparison of these parameters for different types of fiber allows us to analyse the bond behaviour of the fiber/matrix system...|$|E
40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{focuses on the}} links that exist between the mechanical pull-out behaviour of <b>multi-filament</b> <b>yarns</b> embedded in concrete and the impregnation of the yarn by the concrete. To this aim, 5 glass yarns have been embedded in concrete (AR and E glass yarns from assembled or direct roving). A pre-treatment {{was applied to the}} yarn before the casting, and was chosen in the following three: wetting, drying or pre-impregnation with a cement slurry. By this way, 15 yarn / pre-treatment combinations were obtained that generate 15 conditions of impregnation of the yarn by the cementitious matrix. In each case, the mechanical properties were determined from a classical pull-out test and the yarns impregnation properties were characterized by two dedicated tests: yarns porosity measurements and along yarn water flow measurements. By studying the relationship between the mechanical behaviour and the physical properties of the impregnated yarns, it is shown that the pre- and post-peak behaviour are mainly connected to the flow rate measured during the water flow measurements, which suggest a specific influence of the connected pores parallel to the filaments and of the penetration depth of the matrix into the yarn. The postpeak and the residual behaviour are moreover linked to the yarn pore volume associated to the disorder induced in the filaments assembly by the penetration of the matrix. The overall result of this work is a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between the impregnation of the yarns and the pull-out behaviour...|$|R
