40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mercury is an {{environmental}} hazard. Therefore, we studied recent {{trends in the}} blood level of organic and inorganic mercury in the United States. METHODS: We analysed newly available data on blood inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005 - 2010. Organic <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was calculated by subtracting inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> from the total <b>mercury</b> <b>level.</b> As complex sampling was used in NHANES, appropriate weights were used to adjust for oversampling of minorities and sampling from the same location. RESULTS: There were 8364, 8161, and 8727 participants in NHANES 2005 - 6, 2007 - 8, and 2009 - 10, respectively. Inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> (geometric mean [95 % confidence interval]) were 0. 31 [0. 30 - 0. 32], 0. 30 [0. 30 - 0. 31], 0. 28 [0. 27 - 0. 28] µg/L and organic <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were 0. 24 [0. 19 - 0. 30], 0. 19 [0. 14 - 0. 25], 0. 27 [0. 22 - 0. 33] µg/L in 2005 - 6, in 2007 - 8, and in 2009 - 10, respectively. Inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> showed a significant decreasing trend (P < 0. 05). The adjusted proportion (mean ± standard error) of participants with a total <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> of ≥ 5. 8 µg/L was 3. 0 ± 0. 2 %, 3. 5 ± 0. 6 %, and 4. 0 ± 0. 4 % (P < 0. 05) in NHANES 2005 - 6, 2007 - 8, and 2009 - 10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Inorganic <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> has been decreasing during the study period. Organic <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was lower in 2007 - 2008 but increased in 2009 - 10. The significant increase in organic <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> in the US general population in 2009 - 10 is of concern, suggesting that continual monitoring of <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> is needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Environmental <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> {{significantly}} {{increased in the}} past decades following its increase in industrial applications. In spite of an increasing concern on the potential harmful effects of mercury on children, there is no reported data for the Chinese population. The relationship between dietary habit and environmental mercury exposure in Chinese children was studied. Methods: The hair and blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of Chinese children aged above 3 years in 2000 March to September, were studied. Sociodemographic data, dietary habits of the past 6 months, and other risk factors for environmental mercury exposure were collected. Those children with blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> above the toxic range (i. e. > 45 nmol/L) and their family members were further evaluated and their blood and hair <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were monitored before and after Fishing-Moratorium period (June to August 2000) in South China Sea. Results: Altogether, 137 Chinese children (mean age, 7. 2 years) were recruited. The mean hair <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was 2. 2 p. p. m and the mean blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was 17. 6 nmol/L. There was a strong correlation (r = 0. 88) between hair and blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in our cohort. Frequency of fish consumption correlated with hair (r = 0. 51) and blood (r = 0. 54) <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> For those children who consumed fish more than 3 times/week, hair and blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were {{twice as high as}} those who consumed fish 1 - 3 times/week and threefold of those who never consumed fish. Five children and 12 family members had toxic blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> Their blood (P < 0. 0001) and hair (P = 0. 02) <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> dropped significantly after reducing fish consumption during Fishing-Moratorium period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: High <b>levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> in the Cree {{population}} of James Bay, Que., {{have been a}} cause of concern for several years. This study examines changes in <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> within the Cree population between 1988 and 1993 / 94 and identifies potential determinants of high <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> METHODS: Data on <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> among the Cree were obtained through a surveillance program undertaken by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay. In 1988 and again in 1993 / 94 surveys were carried out in all 9 Cree communities of northern Quebec. Hair samples were obtained and analysed for mercury content. Analyses were carried out to determine the proportion {{of people who had}} <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in excess of established norms. Changes in <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> between 1988 and 1993 / 94 and determinants of high levels were estimated by means of regression methods. RESULTS: The proportion of the Cree population with <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in excess of 15. 0 mg/kg declined from 14. 2 % in 1988 to 2. 7 % in 1993 / 94. Wide variations in <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were observed between communities: 0. 6 % and 8. 3 % of the Eastmain and Whapmagoostui communities respectively had <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of 15. 0 mg/kg or greater in 1993 / 94. Logistic regression analyses showed that significantly higher <b>levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> were independently associated with male sex, increasing age and trapper status.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the relationship between average fish consumption, as well as the type of fish consumed and <b>levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> in the blood of pregnant women. We also performed follow-up studies to determine if blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were decreased after counseling and prenatal education. To examine these potential relationships, pregnant women were divided into two groups: a study group was educated to restrict fish intake, whereas a control group did not receive any prenatal education regarding fish consumption. We measured blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> and performed follow-up studies during the third trimester to examine any differences between the two groups. Out of the 63 pregnant women who participated in our study, we performed follow-up studies with 19 pregnant women from the study group and 12 pregnant women from control group. The average initial blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> of both groups was 2. 94 µg/L, with a range of 0. 14 to 10. 75 µg/L. Blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> in the group who ate fish more than four times per month was significantly higher than that of the group who did not consume fish (p = 0. 02). In follow-up studies, blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were decreased in the study group but slightly increased in the control group (p = 0. 014). The maternal blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> in late pregnancy was positively correlated with <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of cord blood (r = 0. 58, p = 0. 047), which was almost twice the level found in maternal blood. Pregnant women who consume a large amount of fish may have high blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> Further, cord blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were much higher than that of maternal blood.

Methods: A case-control study was conducted by interviewing 60 workers in 5 hazardous-waste-management factories, and 60 matched non-exposed persons {{living in the same}} area of Southern Thailand. Urine samples were collected to determine <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> by cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometer mercury analyzer. Results: The hazardous-waste workers’ urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> (10. 07 μg/g creatinine) were significantly higher than the control group (1. 33 μg/g creatinine) (p < 0. 001). Work position, duration of work, personal protective equipment (PPE), and personal hygiene, were significantly associated with urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> (p < 0. 001). The workers developed acute symptoms - of headaches, nausea, chest tightness, fatigue, and loss of consciousness {{at least once a week}} - and those who developed symptoms had significantly higher urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> than those who did not, at p < 0. 05.

Ten studies reporting paired air and urine mercury data (149 samples total) met criteria for data quality and sufficiency. The log-transformed data set showed {{a strong correlation between}} mercury in air and in urine (r = 0. 774), although the relationship was best fit by a series of parallel lines with different intercepts for each study (R 2 = 0. 807). Predicted ratios of air to urine <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> at 50 µg/m 3 air concentration ranged from 1 : 1 to 1 : 3, based on the regression line for the studies. Toward {{the lower end of the}} data set (i. e., 10 µg/m 3), predicted urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> encompassed two distinct ranges: values on the order of 20 µg/L and 30 – 60 µg/L. Extrapolation to 1 µg/m 3 resulted in predicted urinary levels of 4 – 5 and 6 – 13 µg/L. Higher predicted levels were associated with use of static area air samplers by some studies rather than more accurate personal air samplers. Urinary mercury predictions based primarily on personal air samplers at 1 and 10 µg/m 3 are consistent with reported mean (4 µg/L) and upper-bound (20 µg/L) background levels, respectively. Thus, although <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in air and urine are correlated below 50 µg/m 3, the impact of airborne <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> below 10 µg/m 3 is likely to be indistinguishable from background urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> Key words: air exposure, background urinary <b>mercury</b> <b>levels,</b> <b>mercury</b> vapor, pooled analysis, urinary mercury.

Location : Seven saltpans and a large area of ricefields in Portugal. Methods : Total mercury concentration and stable isotope ratios were measured in chick feathers of black-winged stilt Himantopus himantopus and little tern Sterna albifrons, from Portuguese coastal wetlands during breeding seasons. Results and Conclusions : Variation in trophic status explained the inter-specific variation of <b>mercury</b> <b>levels,</b> the intra-specific variation of <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in H. himantopus, but not the intra-specific variation of <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in S. albifrons. A different diet specialization and a mixture of prey groups, teleosts and invertebrates from different saltpan ponds and trophic status are suggested as being the basis for intra-specific variation of <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> not being related with the trophic status in S. albirons. H. himantopus only uses invertebrates, but a wide range of stable isotope signatures and <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were observed. Because chicks are precocial, the feeding area may be associated with a confined area in the ricefield, in the saltpan or in the saltpan pond. Differences of delta C- 13 in chick feathers of H. himantopus between ricefields and saltpans, and also between saltpan ponds suggested that different contributions from marine versus freshwater sources exist among preys. Prey exhibited differences ill delta N- 15 and <b>mercury</b> <b>levels,</b> and significant correlation between mercury concentration and delta N- 15 revealing that prey occupy different trophic status.

The Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment was used to estimate neurobehavioral development in the neonates at 3  days of age. ResultsTotal <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was significantly higher in cord blood than that in maternal blood. A strong correlation was found between total <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in maternal blood and those in cord blood (r =  0. 7431; P <  0. 0001). Trend analysis revealed that mothers who consumed more fish had higher blood and cord blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> (all P <  0. 0001). Significant differences were also found between male and female cord blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> among groups with different fish consumption frequencies (all P <  0. 0001). Cord blood <b>mercury</b> <b>level</b> was significantly associated with total Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment scores (β =  0. 03; standard error =  0. 01; P =  0. 0409), passive muscle tone (odds ratio =  1. 07; 95 % confidence interval =  1. 12 - 1. 13; P =  0. 0071), and active muscle tone (odds ratio =  1. 06; 95 % confidence interval =  1. 01 - 1. 11; P =  0. 0170) scores after adjustment, respectively. ConclusionsNeonatal neurodevelopment was associated with prenatal exposure to mercury. Women with high <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> should avoid intake seafood excessively during pregnancy. Long-term effects of exposure to mercury on childhood development need to be further explored...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{expression}} in blood {{was correlated with}} <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in blood of 2 - to 5 -year-old boys with autism (AU) compared to age-matched typically developing (TD) control boys. This was done to address {{the possibility that the}} two groups might metabolize toxicants, such as mercury, differently. RNA was isolated from blood and gene expression assessed on whole genome Affymetrix Human U 133 expression microarrays. <b>Mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed and partial correlations between gene expression and <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were calculated, after correcting for age and batch effects. To reduce false positives, only genes shared by the ANCOVA models were analyzed. Of the 26 genes that correlated with <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in both AU and TD boys, 11 were significantly different between the groups (P(Diagnosis*Mercury)  ≤  0. 05). The expression {{of a large number of}} genes (n =  316) correlated with <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in TD but not in AU boys (P ≤  0. 05), the most represented biological functions being cell death and cell morphology. Expression of 189 genes correlated with <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in AU but not in TD boys (P ≤  0. 05), the most represented biological functions being cell morphology, amino acid metabolism, and antigen presentation. These data and those in our companion study on correlation of gene expression and lead levels show that AU and TD children display different correlations between transcript levels and low <b>levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> and lead. These findings might suggest different genetic transcriptional programs associated with mercury in AU compared to TD children...|$|R
40|$|Most {{attention}} to the risks from fish consumption has focused on recreational anglers and on fish caught by individuals, {{but the majority of}} fish that people eat are purchased from commercial sources. We examined <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in three types of fish (tuna, flounder, bluefish) commonly available in New Jersey stores, sampling different regions of the state, in communities with high and low per capita incomes, and in both supermarkets and specialty fish markets. We were interested in species-specific <b>levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> in New Jersey fish and whether these levels were similar to data generated nationally by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA; mainly from 1990 to 1992) on the same types of fish. Such information is critical for providing public health advice. We were also interested in whether <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in three common species of fish differed by region of the state, economic neighborhood, or type of store. We found significant species differences, with tuna having the highest levels and flounder the lowest levels. There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> as a function of type of store or economic neighborhood. There was only one regional difference: flounder from fish markets along the Jersey shore had higher <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> than flounder bought in other markets.

40|$|Although mercury {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} neurotoxicant, {{there is a lack of}} data to {{evaluate}} the causal relationship between mercury and autism. We aim to see if there is increased mercury exposure in children with autistic spectrum disorder. We performed a cross-sectional cohort study over a 5 -month period in 2000 to compare the hair and blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of children with autistic spectrum disorder (n = 82; mean age 7. 2 years) and a control group of normal children (n = 55; mean age 7. 8 years). There was no difference in the mean <b>mercury</b> <b>levels.</b> The mean blood <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of the autistic and control groups were 19. 53 and 17. 68 nmol/L, respectively (P =. 15), and the mean hair <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> of the autistic and control groups were 2. 26 and 2. 07 ppm, respectively (P =. 79). Thus, the results from our cohort study with similar envi-ronmental mercury exposure indicate that there is no causal relationship between mercury as an environmental neurotoxin and autism. (J Child Neurol 2004; 19 : 431 - 434).

Zooplankton methyl <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> ranged from 19 to 448 ng$ rm cdot g sp{- 1 }$ dry weight in the study lakes and were highest in zooplankton from acidic brownwater lakes. Water color and lake water pH were the best predictors of methyl <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> in zooplankton explaining 73 % of the variation. Methyl mercury concentrations were positively correlated with water color and inversely correlated with lake water pH. Water color explained a greater portion of the overall variance in methyl <b>mercury</b> <b>levels,</b> indicating that the supply of mercury from the drainage basin {{plays a key role}} in determining methyl mercury concentrations in the lacustrine biota. Zooplankton methyl <b>mercury</b> <b>levels</b> were well correlated with mercury concentrations in smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieui) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) from 11 of the study lakes showing zooplankton to be good indicators of the relative bioavailability of mercury at the base of the food chain...|$|R

Methods: Sixty disk-shaped amalgam specimens (GS- 80, SDI- Australia) were prepared and randomly divided into the following treatment groups: 1. Distilled water (control); 2. 15 % home-bleach carbamide peroxide (Opalescence PF, Ultra dent, USA) applied for 6 h/day for 3 weeks; and 3. 35 % in-office bleach carbamide peroxide (Opalescence Quick, Ultradent) applied for 30 min/week for 3 weeks. <b>Levels</b> of <b>mercury</b> were measured as weight percentages using an energy dispersive x-ray micro-analyzer detector connected to an electron microscope.
