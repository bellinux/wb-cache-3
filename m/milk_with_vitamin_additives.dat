40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} cases of hypervitaminosis D caused by the inadvertent overfortification of milk from a home-delivery dairy and to identify risk factors for this illness. METHODS. Hospital discharge, laboratory, and state health department data were used to define, identify, and describe cases of hypervitaminosis D diagnosed in the exposed communities between January 1, 1985, and June 30, 1991. To identify disease risk factors, community-based sex- and age-matched controls were used in a case-control study. RESULTS. Of the 56 case patients identified, at least 41 were hospitalized; 2 died. The study included 33 case patients and 93 control subjects. Nineteen of the 33 case patients had been customers of the implicated dairy. Risk of illness rose with increasing consumption of the dairy's milk and was also associated <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D supplement use, sunburn susceptibility, and cancer history. Accounting for these factors did not alter the association between drinking the dairy's milk and developing hypervitaminosis D. CONCLUSIONS. Overfortification of <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D can lead to hypervitaminosis D, manifested by severe illness and death.

The encouragement of sensible sun exposure and the fortification of <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D resulted in almost complete eradication of the disease. Vitamin D (where D represents D 2 or D 3) is biologically inert and metabolized in the liver to 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D], the major circulating form of vitamin D {{that is used to}} determine vitamin D status. 25 (OH) D is activated in the kidneys to 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D [1, 25 (OH) 2 D], which regulates calcium, phosphorus, and bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency has again become an epidemic in children, and rickets has become a global health issue. In addition to vitamin D deficiency, calcium deficiency and acquired and inherited disorders of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus metabolism cause rickets.

40|$|Background: Fortification of <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D {{may not be}} {{adequate}} for satisfying the vitamin D requirement because of vari-ability in its vitamin D content after fortification and because many persons have milk allergy or lactose intolerance. Additional foods need to be fortified <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D. Objective: We determined whether vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin, is bioavailable in orange juice and skim milk, 2 nonfat beverages. Design: On 3 separate occasions, 18 adults ingested 25 000 IU vitamin D 2 in 240 mL whole milk or skim milk or in 0. 1 mL corn oil applied to toast. A separate, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial investigated whether the consumption of orange juice fortified <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D 3 would increase serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations: 14 subjects ingested 240 mL orange juice fortified <b>with</b> 1000 IU <b>vitamin</b> D, and 12 subjects ingested a control orange juice daily for 12 wk. Results: Peak serum vitamin D 2 concentrations {{did not differ significantly}} after the ingestion of vitamin D 2 in whole milk, skim milk, or corn oil on toast. After subjects consumed orange juice fortified <b>with</b> 1000 IU <b>vitamin</b> D 3 daily for 12 wk, serum 25 (OH) D 3 concentrations increased by 150 %, and serum parathy-roid hormone concentrations decreased by 25 % compared with baseline; control subjects had a seasonal increase of 45 % in 25 (OH) D and no change in serum parathyroid hormone.

40|$|Early in {{the twentieth}} century more than 80 percent of {{children}} in industrialized Europe and North America were ravaged by the devastating skeletal consequences of rickets. Finding that exposure to ultraviolet radiation or sunlight treated and prevented rickets led to the ultraviolet irradiation of foods including milk. These practices along with the fortification of a variety of foods including dairy products <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D and widespread use of cod liver oil eradicated rickets as a significant health problem by the late 1930 s. Many countries mandated the fortification of <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D to prevent rickets during wartime shortages. In the 1950 s, in Europe, many countries forbid fortification of dairy and food products except breakfast cereals and margarine because of an outbreak of vitamin D intoxication in neonates. Vitamin D deficiency has again become a major public health interest with its association with osteoporosis, osteomalacia, fractures, and more recently with prevention of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. Regular sun exposure has decreased due to changing lifestyles. Vitamin D deficiency is especially prevalent in dark skinned children and adults living in Northern latitudes, and obese children and adults. Improving the vitamin D status worldwide would have dramatic effects on public health, and reduce healthcare costs for many chronic diseases. The most cost-effective way to remedy this deficiency is to increase food fortification with higher levels of <b>vitamin</b> D along <b>with</b> sensible sun exposure, and adequate vitamin D supplementation.

Methodology: 72 enamel specimens were prepared from freshly extracted deciduous and permanent teeth and divided into four groups and subgroup. Each subgroup comprised of 3 pairs of enamel specimens (3 deciduous and 3 permanent enamel slabs). In the first group (control group) specimens were immersed in distilled water, whereas the remaining three groups were immersed for 45 minutes under standardized conditions at room temperature in different milk products. The three groups included the milk group comprising plain milk, strawberry milk, cocktail juice <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> and apple exotic fruits juice milk; the laban group consisting of plain laban, strawberry laban, cocktail laban and orange laban; the yogurt group including plain yogurt, yogurt with natural strawberry fruit, yogurt with artificial strawberry flavor. Microhardness was measured using micrometer II microhardness, 300 g load was applied and the significance of difference was statistically analyzed at (p 7 0. 05). To enhance statistical analysis, the number of reading where evaluated to get better number of specimens. Enamel slabs were evaluated after exposure to milk products and distilled water by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Analysis of the calcium and phosphate ions on the enamel surface structure was determined using EDX-Analysis. Results: The microhardness measurements showed that there were statistically significant differences before and after immersion of the enamel slabs in the different milk products for 45 minutes when compared to control group. Plain milk and strawberry milk revealed the highest microhardness values indicating increased enamel hardness while the other products expressed significant softening effects {{as indicated by the}} decreased microhardness values. These effects were visualized by SEM and confirmed by EDX-Analysis. Conclusion: This study revealed that all tested milk products cause dental erosion to some extent except plain milk and strawberry milk that showed enamel hardening.

50|$|Healthcare was {{reformed}} in 1948 {{after the}} Second World War, broadly {{along the lines}} of the 1942 Beveridge Report, with the creation of the National Health Service or NHS. It was originally established as part of a wider reform of social services and funded by a system of National Insurance, though receipt of healthcare was never contingent upon making contributions towards the National Insurance Fund. Private health care was not abolished but had to compete with the NHS. About 15% of all spending on health in the UK is still privately funded but this includes the patient contributions towards NHS provided prescription drugs, so private sector healthcare in the UK is quite small. As part of a wider reform of social provision it was originally thought that the focus would be as much about the prevention of ill-health as it was about curing disease. The NHS for example would distribute baby formula <b>milk</b> fortified <b>with</b> <b>vitamins</b> and minerals in an effort to improve the health of children born in the post war years as well as other supplements such as cod liver oil and malt.

The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} light (2300 Lux) and/or cupric sulfate (0, 0. 5, 1 mg/kg) as pro-oxidative factors in milk during an 11 -day refrigerated storage period. The effects of added vitamin A (2113 IU/L) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg milk fat) as potential inhibitors of oxidation in the presence of light (2300 Lux) and light with cupric sulfate (0. 05 mg/kg) during a 7 -day refrigerated storage were also investigated. The presence of pro-oxidants significantly decreased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and increased the oxidation products in milk during storage. Light had a greater effect in the decrease of TAC, while cupric sulfate in the presence of light significantly increased oxidation products. Added vitamin A and E showed a significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) increase in TAC when samples were exposed to light on day 0. On day 1, only vitamin A significantly increased TAC when samples were exposed to light and cupric sulfate. Oxidation products were not affected by the presence of either vitamin A or E.

40|$|<b>Milk</b> enriched <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D by supplementing {{dairy cow}} diets {{could provide a}} {{valuable}} dietary source of vitamin D, but information on the feasibility {{of this approach is}} limited. In the current study, the effects of supplementing dairy cows <b>with</b> either <b>vitamin</b> D 3 or 25 (OH) D 3 over the transition/early lactation period on plasma and milk vitamin D concentrations were compared. Sixty dairy cows were randomly allocated to one of four dietary treatments from 14 days pre-calving to 56 days post-calving. Treatments were a control diet (Control) for both pre-calving and post-calving periods containing 0. 625 mg/day vitamin D 3; a pre-calving diet supplemented with 6 mg 25 (OH) D 3 /day, but with a post-calving diet matching that of the control diet (25 (OH) D 3 pre-calving); the control diet pre-calving but with the post-calving diet supplemented <b>with</b> 2 mg <b>vitamin</b> D 3 /day (D 3 max), and the control diet pre-calving but with the post-calving diet supplemented with 1. 5 mg 25 (OH) D 3 /day (25 (OH) D 3 post-calving). No treatment effect on milk yield, composition or 25 (OH) D 3 concentration was observed. However there was an interaction of treatment and time for plasma 25 (OH) D 3 concentration; this increased within two weeks of supplementation for the 25 (OH) D 3 pre-calving treatment (peaking just after calving, 202 ng/ml), whereas that of the 25 (OH) D 3 post-calving group had a slower response following supplementation, continuing to increase at 56 days. There were correlations between plasma and milk 25 (OH) D 3 concentrations at days 4 and 14 of lactation, but not at later sampling times. The D 3 max treatment did not increase 25 (OH) D 3 concentration in plasma or milk. Overall, results from this study indicate that supplemental 25 (OH) D 3 is an effective means of enhancing dairy cow plasma 25 (OH) D 3 concentrations compared <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D 3 supplementation, but not necessarily milk concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dairy {{products}} fortified <b>with</b> <b>vitamins</b> {{and minerals}} represent a growing market {{that is of}} interest to those sectors of the population with unbalanced diets and increased needs. However, there is little information on the bioavailability of micronutrients in milk products at dietary intake levels. Aim of the study: To evaluate the bioavailability of vitamins A and E in whole milk and fortified whole and skimmed milk in control subjects. Methods: A single-dose bioavailability study was performed using three commercially available milks (unfortified whole milk and whole and skimmed <b>milk</b> fortified <b>with</b> <b>vitamins</b> A and E). Nineteen volunteers (10 women and 9 men) ingested 430 ml of each milk on different days. The contents of retinol and α-tocopherol provided in the milks and the retinyl esters and α-tocopherol in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein fractions (TRL) from plasma collected for 6. 5 h postprandially were assayed using a quality-controlled HPLC method. The relative absorption of vitamins A and E from milks was calculated {{on the basis of}} area under the curve (AUC) versus time curve estimations, adjusted for plasma volume and expressed as percentage of the amount of nutrient provided. Results: The total amounts of retinol and α-tocopherol provided ranged between 0. 48 and 4. 15 μmol and 0. 41 and 32. 49 μmol, respectively. The AUC value of retinyl palmitate in TRL was higher for fortified whole milk than for the other two milks (unfortified whole and fortified skimmed milk). The percent relative absorption of vitamin A did not differ among the three types of milk. The AUC for α-tocopherol was no different after the ingestion of any of these milks. Conclusion: The mean percentage of retinol absorption was apparently similar for the three types of milk, regardless of the amount of fat ingested with each type of milk and the vitamin A provided. © 2006 Steinkopff Verlag.

40|$|This {{research}} book {{presents a}} {{critical analysis of}} mandatory food fortification as a technology for protecting and promoting public health. Increasing numbers of foods fortified with novel amounts and combinations of nutrients are being introduced into the food supplies of {{countries around the world}} to raise populations’ nutrient intakes. Three topical food fortification case studies representing the different public health rationales for adding nutrients to food were assessed for their public health benefits, risks and ethical considerations: Universal salt iodisation (USI) to help prevent iodine deficiency disorders; mandatory flour fortification with folic acid (MFFFA) to help prevent neural tube defects; and mandatory <b>milk</b> fortification <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D (MMFVD) to help prevent vitamin D deficiency. These assessments found that whereas USI performs strongly as a public health intervention, MFFFA and MMFVD are associated with more risks and less ethical justification than an alternative policy option. Food fortification can be a blunt policy response to complex policy problems. The findings highlight that the primary predictor of a mandatory food fortification policy’s benefits, risks and ethics is its ability to address the underlying cause of the policy problem. The analysis of the policy-making processes for each case study found that certain powerful actors use their influence to determine what counts as evidence in policy processes to privilege food fortification activities over alternative policy options. Policy-making frequently was notable for the low prominence it afforded ethical considerations and its lack of public engagement. Priority activities to help strengthen policy processes and outcomes are suggested. <br /...|$|R
40|$|During a 12 -month {{longitudinal}} study, bulk-tank milk {{was collected}} from organic (n= 17) and conventional (n= 19) dairy {{farms in the}} UK. Milk samples were analysed for vitamin A (retinol), vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta-carotene content.

40|$|Vitamin D is the {{collective}} {{name for a}} group of closely related lipids, whose main biological function is to maintain serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations within the normal range by enhancing the efficiency of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet. We used a commercially available ELISA method for the determination of vitamin D in bovine milk. Individual milk samples from two different Italian Friesian herds were analysed. The enzyme immunoassay method used was confirmed as a useful tool to measure the vitamin D in the milk as it greatly reduces the time required to perform the conventional HPLC analysis. An interesting variation was found among individual animals that may be associated with management factors and specific genetic effects. A relationship was highlighted between vitamin D and the genetic polymorphism of β-lactoglobulin, the main bovine whey protein which is involved in the transport of small hydrophobic molecules such as retinol and vitamin D. The relatively high content of vitamin D in most milk samples suggests an opportunity to improve the natural content of vitamin D in milk either by acting on the herd management or selecting individuals genetically predisposed to produce <b>milk</b> <b>with</b> a higher <b>vitamin</b> D content...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{modifiable}} predictors for osteoporosis and fractures have been identified, including nutritional factors, such as vitamin D deficiency and low calcium intake.

Objectives: 1) To show the associations of vitamin B 12 and homocysteine with measures of bone health in three different populations. 2) To assess the effect of supplementation with 1000 mg crystalline cobalamin, carried either by a milk product or a capsule, on cobalamin status in mildly cobalamin deficient Dutch elderly people. Results: Data analyses in three different populations supplied the following information. Macrobiotic-fed adolescents: adolescents (9 - 15 y) with a low BMD had a significantly less favorable vitamin B 12 status (adjusted mean, SD: 344 :t 24 pmol/L) and MMA status (adjusted mean, P 5, P 95 : 0. 31 [0. 26, 0. 35] f-lIDol/L) than adolescents with a normal BMD, with levels of respectively 442 (18) and 0. 20 (0. 16, 0. 23) f-lmol/L. Free-living elderly: An increased Hcy level appeared to be a strong and independent risk factor for osteoporotic fractures in elderly men and women of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (n= 1267, mean age: 76 yrs). Relative risks (95 % CI) for the highest Hcy quartile versus lowest three homocysteine quartiles were 4. 6 (1. 4 - 14. 5) in men, and 1. 8 (0. 8 - 3. 7) in women. Frail elderly people: Osteoporosis (defined by BMD T-score< - 2. 5) occurred almost five times more of ten in frail elderly women <b>with</b> a marginal <b>vitamin</b> B 12 status and seven times more of ten in women <b>with</b> a deficient <b>vitamin</b> B 12 status than in women with a normal status in the VFit-study.

Our study hypothesised that this age-dependent effect is caused by exhausted body reserves of fat-soluble vitamins and, therefore, extra supply reduces growth retardation. PEI was induced by PL at the age of seven (PL- 7) or 16 weeks (PL- 16). Controls (C) underwent a sham surgery. Some PL- 7 pigs (PL- 7 + Vit) were fed a special <b>vitamin</b> <b>additive.</b> PEI reduced the mean final body weight (kg) at 26 weeks of age significantly with lower effect in PL- 16 -pigs (C: 117; PL- 7 : 49. 5; PL- 7 + Vit: 77. 1; PL- 16 : 96. 4). Extra vitamin supply resulted in an increased growth and normalised serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol, underlining the importance of special supplementation in PEI-patients...|$|R

40|$|To test {{a system}} <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled pulsation, milk flow was {{recorded}} in 29 Holstein cows during machine milking. The three different treatments were routine milking (including a pre-stimulation of 50 - 70 s), <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of teat preparation and <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase, i. e. with a gradually elongated b-phase of the pulsation cycle <b>with</b> increasing <b>milk</b> flow rate and shortening again during decreasing milk flow. For data evaluation the herd was divided into three groups based on the peak flow rate at routine milking (group 1 : 4 · 5 kg/min). Compared <b>with</b> routine <b>milking,</b> <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> <b>milk</b> flow-controlled b-phase caused a significant elevation of the peak flow rate and the duration of incline lasted longer especially in cows with a peak flow rate of > 3 · 2 kg/min in routine <b>milking.</b> In <b>milking</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of teat preparation the duration of incline lasted longer compared with the two other treatments.
