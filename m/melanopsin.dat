25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the circadian clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} circadian clock, a different photopigment, <b>melanopsin,</b> is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|Pineal cytostructure {{seems to}} have {{evolutionary}} similarities to the retinal cells of the lateral eyes. Modern birds and reptiles express the phototransducing pigment <b>melanopsin</b> in the pineal gland. Avian pineal glands are thought to act like the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mammals. The structure of the pineal eye in modern lizards and tuatara {{is analogous to the}} cornea, lens, and retina of the lateral eyes of vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The photopigment of the retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, <b>melanopsin,</b> is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Provencio {{discovered}} <b>melanopsin</b> as a novel opsin in the photosensitive skin melanophores of the African clawed frog. In 2000, {{he showed}} that <b>melanopsin</b> is {{also present in}} mouse, rhesus macaques, and humans, where it is only present in the eye. The unique inner retinal localization of <b>melanopsin</b> indicated that <b>melanopsin</b> {{was not involved in}} image formation. Later, he demonstrated that the <b>melanopsin</b> pigment might be involved in entrainment of a circadian oscillator to light cycles in mammals.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, the Provencio lab {{was able}} to {{specifically}} destroy <b>melanopsin</b> cells in the fully developed mouse retina using an immunotoxin made of an anti-melanopsin antibody conjugated to the protein saporin. This resulted in lowered responsiveness to light/dark cycles; a similar characteristic was observed in gene-knockout mutants lacking rods, cones or <b>melanopsin.</b> Furthermore, light-induced negative masking, mediated by rods, cones and/or <b>melanopsin</b> cells, was missing in the mice lacking <b>melanopsin</b> cells. Therefore, Provencio suggested that cells containing <b>melanopsin</b> might be required to transmit rod and/or cone information for certain non-image forming visual responses.|$|E
50|$|Provencio's {{research}} team {{has found that}} in albino mice, the amount of <b>melanopsin</b> protein in various retinal cells varies based on the environmental light conditions. In constant light conditions, <b>melanopsin</b> cell number did not increase. However, when these constant-light mice were exposed to light-dark schedules, there was regain of <b>melanopsin</b> cell number. This study shows that bouts of darkness or the order {{of light and dark}} periods may control the normal development of the <b>melanopsin</b> system.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Hattar and {{his colleagues}} showed that <b>melanopsin</b> {{plays a key role}} in a variety of photic responses, {{including}} pupillary light reflex, and synchronization of the biological clock to daily light-dark cycles. He also described the role of <b>melanopsin</b> in ipRGCs. Using a rat <b>melanopsin</b> gene, a melanopsin-specific antibody, and fluorescent immunocytochemistry, the team concluded that <b>melanopsin</b> is expressed in some RGCs. Using a Beta-galactosidase assay, they found that these RGC axons exit the eyes together with the optic nerve and project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the primary circadian pacemaker in mammals. They also demonstrated that the RGCs containing <b>melanopsin</b> were intrinsically photosensitive. Hattar concluded that <b>melanopsin</b> is the photopigment in a small subset of RGCs that contributes to the intrinsic photosensitivity of these cells and is involved in their non-image forming functions, such as photic entrainment and pupillary light reflex.|$|E
50|$|Provencio's {{discovery}} of <b>melanopsin</b> and its function in photoentrainment supports earlier {{studies showing that}} some blind patients can entrain to a daily light cycle. Since retinal ganglion cells that express <b>melanopsin</b> have also been found in humans, these studies suggest that blind humans who still retain functional <b>melanopsin</b> cells {{are those who are}} able to entrain to daily light cycles. These studies also show that blind patients who cannot entrain and lack <b>melanopsin</b> cells have a significantly greater risk of suffering from circadian rhythm sleep disorders. While enucleation of blind patients and babies was a common practice for cosmetic or analgesic reasons, doctors now must make a more cautious decision on whether to enucleate blind patients, especially infants, because they may still have functioning photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express <b>melanopsin.</b> In addition, there are now studies attempting to optimize light therapy for those with circadian rhythm sleep disorders that specifically try to stimulate <b>melanopsin</b> cells in blind patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> in {{the iris}} of some, {{primarily}} nocturnal, mammals closes the iris {{when it is}} exposed to light. This local pupil light reflex (PLR) is absent from primates, even though their irises express <b>melanopsin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> photoreceptors are {{sensitive}} {{to a range of}} wavelengths and reach peak light absorption at blue light wavelengths around 480 nanometers. [...] Other wavelengths of light activate the <b>melanopsin</b> signaling system with decreasing efficiency as they move away from the optimum 480 nm. For example, shorter wavelengths around 445 nm (closer to violet in the visible spectrum) are half as effective for <b>melanopsin</b> photoreceptor stimulation as light at 480 nm.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> {{undergoes}} phosphorylation on its intracellular carboxy tail {{as a way}} {{to deactivate}} its function. Compared to other opsins, <b>melanopsin</b> has an unusually long carboxy tail that contains 37 serine and threonine amino acid sites that could undergo phosphorylation. However, a cluster of seven amino acids are sufficient to deactivate zebrafish <b>melanopsin.</b> These sites are dephosphorylated when <b>melanopsin</b> is exposed to light and are unique from those that regulate rhodopsin. They are important for proper response to calcium ions in ipRGCs; lack of functional phosphorylation sites, particularly at serine-381 and serine-398, reduce the cell’s response to light-induced calcium ion influx when voltage-gated calcium ion channels open.|$|E
5000|$|In humans, <b>melanopsin</b> {{is found}} in {{intrinsically}} photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). It {{is also found in}} the iris of mice and primates. <b>Melanopsin</b> is also found in rats, amphioxus, and other chordates. ipRGCs are photoreceptor cells which are particularly sensitive to the absorption of short-wavelength (blue) visible light and communicate information directly to the area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), also known as the central [...] "body clock", in mammals. <b>Melanopsin</b> plays an important non-image-forming role in the setting of circadian rhythms as well as other functions. Mutations in the Opn4 gene can lead to clinical disorders, such as Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). According to one study, <b>melanopsin</b> has been found in eighteen sites in the human brain (outside of the retinohypothalamic tract), intracellularly, in a granular pattern, in the cerebral cortex, the cerebellar cortex and several phylogenetically old regions, primarily in neuronal soma, not in nuclei. <b>Melanopsin</b> is also expressed in human cones. However, only 0.11% to 0.55% of human cones express <b>melanopsin</b> and are exclusively found in the peripheral regions of the retina. The human peripheral retina senses light at high intensities that is best explained by four different photopigment classes.|$|E
50|$|He {{found that}} blind mice lacking classic outer-retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) still had eye-mediated {{responses}} to light. Mice with the <b>melanopsin</b> gene knocked out but with functional rods and cones were {{also able to}} entrain. However, when <b>melanopsin</b> was knocked out in blind mice without rods and cones, they exhibited “complete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light.” Provencio concluded that either melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells or outer-retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones) are sufficient to induce a response to light. However, {{in the absence of}} either rods and cones or <b>melanopsin,</b> <b>melanopsin</b> becomes necessary for photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator and for other photic responses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> serves an {{important}} role in the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms in mammals. An organism that is photoentrained has aligned its activity to an approximately 24-hour cycle, the solar cycle on Earth. In mammals, <b>melanopsin</b> expressing axons target the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> may aid in {{controlling}} sleep cycles and wakefulness. Tsunematsu and colleagues created transgenic mice that expressed <b>melanopsin</b> in hypothalamic orexin neurons. With a short 4-second pulse of blue light (guided by optical fibers), the transgenic mice could successfully transition from slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is {{commonly known as}} [...] "deep sleep," [...] to long-lasting wakefulness. After switching off the blue light, the hypothalamic orexin neurons showed activity for several tens of seconds. It has been shown that rods and cones play no role in the onset of sleep by light, distinguishing them from ipRGCs and <b>melanopsin.</b> This provides strong evidence that there is a link between ipRGCs in humans and alertness, particularly with high frequency light (e.g. blue light). Therefore, <b>melanopsin</b> {{can be used as a}} therapeutic target for controlling the sleep-wake cycle.|$|E
50|$|The opsin {{found in}} the {{photosensitive}} ganglion cells of the retina is called <b>melanopsin.</b> These cells are involved in various reflexive responses {{of the brain and}} body to the presence of (day)light, such as the regulation of circadian rhythms, pupillary reflex and other non-visual responses to light. <b>Melanopsin</b> functionally resembles invertebrate opsins.|$|E

50|$|Joseph {{cells are}} bare photoreceptors {{surrounded}} by a band of microvilli. These cells bear the opsin <b>melanopsin.</b> The Hesse organs (also known as dorsal ocelli) consist of a photoreceptor cell {{surrounded by a}} band of microvill and bearing <b>melanopsin,</b> but half enveloped by a cup-shaped pigment cell. The peak sensitivy of both cells is ~470 nm (blue).|$|E
50|$|Unlike other {{photoreceptor}} pigments, <b>melanopsin</b> has {{the ability}} to act as both the excitable photopigment and as a photoisomerase. Instead of requiring additional cells to revert between the two isoforms, from all-trans-retinal back into 11-cis-retinal before it can undergo another phototransduction, like the photoreceptor cones which rely on müller cells and retinal pigment epithelium cells for this conversion, <b>melanopsin</b> is able to isomerize all-trans-retinal into 11-cis-retinal when stimulated with light without help from additional cells. The two isoforms of <b>melanopsin</b> differ in their spectral sensitivity, for the 11-cis-retinal isoform is more responsive to shorter wavelengths of light, while the all-trans isoform is more responsive to longer wavelengths of light.|$|E

50|$|<b>Melanopsin</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} by Ignacio Provencio as a novel opsin in the melanophores, or light-sensitive skin cells, of the African clawed frog in 1998. A year later, {{researchers found that}} mice without any rods or cones, the cells involved in image-forming vision, still entrained to a light-dark cycle. This observation led {{to the conclusion that}} neither rods nor cones, located in the outer retina, are necessary for circadian entrainment and that a third class of photoreceptor exists in the mammalian eye. Provencio and colleagues then found in 2000 that <b>melanopsin</b> is also present in mouse retina, specifically in ganglion cells, and that it mediates non-visual photoreceptive tasks. <b>Melanopsin</b> was found to be encoded by Opn4 with orthologs in a variety of organisms.|$|E
50|$|To further {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>melanopsin</b> in light-induced phase shifting in mammals, the Provencio lab studied the locomotor activities of melanopsin-null mice (Opn4 -/-) in response to light. The Opn4 -/- mice showed similar circadian behaviors as the normal mice: they entrained to light/dark cycles and free-ran under constant darkness in a way expected from the normal mice. Researchers in Provencio's lab thus concluded that <b>melanopsin</b> {{was not involved in}} the functioning of the master clock oscillation. On the other hand, Opn4-/- mice had difficulties adjusting to new phases in response to pulses of monochromatic light. The implication was that <b>melanopsin</b> was necessary for phase resetting but other mechanisms of light inputs might be involved in circadian entrainment as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the gene Opn4, Dopamine (DA) {{is a factor in}} the {{regulation}} of <b>melanopsin</b> mRNA in ipRGCs.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, Kay and {{his team}} were able to show the role of <b>melanopsin,</b> a {{photosensitive}} photopigment in retinal ganglion cells, in detecting light for the master circadian oscillator located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus of the brain. Both <b>melanopsin</b> and visual photoreceptors, such as rods and cones, were required for entrainment. However, removing each individually {{did not result in}} total blindness in mice, as they retained non-visual photoreception.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Panda, Melyan, Qiu, {{and colleagues}} {{demonstrated}} that the <b>melanopsin</b> photopigment was the phototransduction pigment in ganglion cells. Dennis Dacey and colleagues showed in a species of Old World monkey that giant ganglion cells expressing <b>melanopsin</b> projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Previously only projections to the midbrain (pre-tectal nucleus) and hypothalamus (supra-chiasmatic nuclei, SCN) had been shown. However a visual role for the receptor was still unsuspected and unproven.|$|E
50|$|Other opsins {{found in}} humans include encephalopsin (or panopsin, opsin-3), <b>melanopsin</b> (opsin-4), neuropsin (opsin-5) and peropsin. <b>Melanopsin</b> is {{involved}} in the light entrainment of the circadian clock in vertebrates. Encephalopsins and neuropsins are highly expressed in nerve cells and brain tissue, but so far their function is unknown. Peropsin binds all-trans retinal (microbial-type chromophore) and might function as a photoisomerase to return retinal to the 11-cis isomer form needed in visual perception.|$|E
50|$|Provencio {{also took}} Rpe65(-/-) mice and crossed them with <b>melanopsin</b> {{knockout}} mice (Opn4(-/-)). This created double RPE and <b>melanopsin</b> knockout mice, {{which resulted in}} abnormal photoentrainment and diurnal behavior.From these results, Provencio concluded that RPE65 is not necessary for the function of ipRGCs. However, because of the interesting restoration of circadian photosensitivity in rodless, RPE-less mice, {{there seems to be}} a mechanism by which rods can influences ipRGCs and rods may interact.|$|E
50|$|In a paper {{published}} by Ye and colleagues in 2011, <b>melanopsin</b> was utilized {{to create an}} optogenetic synthetic transcription device that was tested in a therapeutic setting to produce glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), a protein that helps control blood glucose levels in mammals with Type II Diabetes. The researchers subcutaneously implanted mice with microencapsulated transgenic HEK 293 cells that were cotransfected with two vectors including the <b>melanopsin</b> gene and the gene of interest under an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) promoter, respectively. It is through this engineered pathway that they successfully controlled the expression of GLP-1 in doubly recessive diabetic mice and reduced hyperglycemia, or high blood glucose levels, in these mice. This shows promise {{for the use of}} <b>melanopsin</b> as an optogenetic tool for the treatment of Type II diabetes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Melanopsin,</b> {{like all}} other animal opsins (e.g. rhodopsin), {{is a member of}} the G-protein coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) family. The <b>melanopsin</b> protein has seven alpha helices integrated in the plasma membrane, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. It resembles invertebrate opsins far more than vertebrate photopigments, especially in its amino acid sequence and downstream signaling cascade. [...] Like invertebrate opsins, it appears to be a photopigment with intrinsic photoisomerase activity and signals through a G-protein of the Gq family.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} recent {{research}} {{on the role of}} <b>melanopsin</b> in optogenetic therapy for patients with the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Reintroducing functional <b>melanopsin</b> into the eyes of mice with retinal degeneration restores the pupillary light reflex (PLR). These same mice could also distinguish light stimuli from dark stimuli and showed increased sensitivity to room light. The higher sensitivity demonstrated by these mice shows promise for vision restoration that may be applicable to humans and human eye diseases.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{of the role of}} <b>melanopsin</b> in non-image forming vision has led to a growth in optogenetics. This field has shown promise in clinical applications, including the treatment of human eye diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa and diabetes. A missense mutation in Opn4, P10L, has been implicated in 5% of patients with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This is a condition in which people experience depressive thoughts in the winter due to decreased available light. Additionally, a <b>melanopsin</b> based receptor has been linked to migraine pain.|$|E
50|$|Melanopsin-knockout mice display reduced photoentrainment. In {{comparison}} to wild-type mice that expressed <b>melanopsin</b> normally, deficits in light-induced phase shifts in locomotion activity were noted in melanopsin-null mice (Opn4 -/-). These melanopsin-deficient mice did not completely lose their circadian rhythms, {{as they were}} still able to entrain to changing environmental stimuli, albeit more slowly than normal. This indicated that, although <b>melanopsin</b> is sufficient for entrainment, it must work {{in conjunction with other}} photopigments for normal photoentrainment activity. Triple-mutant mice that were rod-less, cone-less, and melanopsin-less display a complete loss in the circadian rhythms, so all three photopigments in these photoreceptors, rhodopsin, photopsin and <b>melanopsin,</b> are necessary for photoentrainment. Therefore, there is a functional redundancy between the three photopigments in the photoentrainment pathway of mammals. Deletion of only one photopigment does not eliminate the organism’s ability to entrain to environmental light-dark cycles, but it does reduce the intensity of the response.|$|E
50|$|Mammals have {{orthologous}} <b>melanopsin</b> genes named Opn4m, {{which are}} derived from one branch of the Opn4 family, and are approximately 50-55% conserved. However, non-mammalian vertebrates, including chickens and zebrafish, have another version of the <b>melanopsin</b> gene, Opn4x, which {{appears to have a}} distinct lineage that diverged from Opn4m about 360 million years ago. Mammals lost the gene Opn4x relatively early in their evolution, leading to a general reduction in photosensory capability. It is thought that this event {{can be explained by the}} fact that this occurred during the time in which nocturnal mammals were evolving.|$|E
5000|$|Hattar {{is known}} for his work in the area of chronobiology. He is {{credited}} with discovering that the photopigment <b>melanopsin</b> and associated ipRGCs {{play an important role in}} the entrainment of circadian rhythms [...] Before Hattar's work, it was assumed that organisms entrained to daily light-dark cycles through the same mechanisms that are responsible for vision. However, case studies reported that some who were completely blind could still entrain to these cycles. This observation, coupled with the discovery of <b>melanopsin</b> by Ignacio Provencio, led Hattar to hypothesize that this photopigment might be responsible for photoentrainment.|$|E
