5|$|Given {{the planet}}'s high mass, it is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be a gas giant with no solid surface. Since the planet {{has only been}} {{detected}} indirectly through observations of the star, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown.|$|E

5|$|Acne scars {{are caused}} by {{inflammation}} within the dermal layer of skin and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. The scar is created by abnormal healing following this dermal inflammation. Scarring is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> take place with severe acne, but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss {{at the site of}} the acne lesion.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E

5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths. The best-understood are the genera Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis, as these planktonic coastal forms are among the <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be {{collected}} near shore. No ctenophores {{have been found in}} fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Foraging turtles {{frequently}} cross lakes {{or travel}} linearly down creeks. Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed. Tag and release {{studies show that}} sex also drives turtle movement. Males travel the most, up to , between captures; females the second most, up to , between captures; and juveniles the least, less than , between captures. Males move the most and are <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> change wetlands because they seek mates.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a credible set <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> include the causal variant.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} {{is caused}} by a number of human activities. Marine mammals that live in coastal environments are <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be affected by habitat degradation and loss. Developments such as sewage marine outfalls, moorings, dredging, blasting, dumping, port construction, hydroelectric projects, and aquaculture both degrade the environment and take up valuable habitat. For example, extensive shellfish aquaculture takes up valuable space used by coastal marine mammals for important activities such as breeding, foraging and resting.|$|E

UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.

The next day, the Detroit Tigers invited him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together. Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them.

5|$|The {{division}} {{into two}} kingdoms is <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{date back to}} the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom.

An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.|$|E
