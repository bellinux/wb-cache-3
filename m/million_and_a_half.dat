5|$|Thomas Paine was a noted {{writer and}} {{political}} theorist whose work had influenced and helped drive the American Revolution. Having returned to England, {{he decided to}} write a book addressing the arguments of Edmund Burke, a prominent conservative strongly fearful of the French Revolution. This was simply titled Rights of Man. The first part was published in 1791, and attracted no attention from Pitt's administration. The second, published on 16 February 1792, advocated, amongst other things, {{the right of the people}} to replace their government if they thought it appropriate. The work was an immediate success, selling a <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> copies, and generated public support for various reform movements. It also brought Paine to the attention of the government and made him a subject to its crackdown. While Paine was visiting an aunt in Kent, Pitt had a writ issued against J.S. Jordan, Paine's publisher, prosecuting him for seditious libel—a crime based on the concept that the executive was beyond reproach, that made it illegal to criticise the government. Paine returned to London and began to campaign for Jordan, finding him a lawyer and agreeing to pay his legal fees. Jordan, however, most likely frightened for his life, pleaded guilty and turned his files over to the court. With this additional evidence, a writ was issued for Paine on 21 May, charging him with the same crime. His trial date was set for 8 June, and later rescheduled for 18 December.|$|E

Crowell obtained Kirkpatrick's interests and established it as the Crowell Publishing Company. In 1906, Crowell turned around and sold {{his interest in the}} company to Joseph Knapp and George Hazen of New York, who incorporated in New Jersey and kept the name Crowell Publishing Company. Crowell Publishing acquired The American Magazine in 1911. The magazine had muckraking roots but with the decline of muckraking journalism it had turned into a general interest magazine.|$|E

The land is {{exceedingly}} fertile and bears in abundance all tropical products, particularly rice, sugar, <b>and</b> the abaca, <b>a</b> variety of the banana-tree. The fibres of the abaca are employed in making the finest and most delicate fabrics, of which from three to four million dollars’ worth are exported annually. The exports of sugar amount to about four <b>millions</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> of gold to two <b>millions</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> <b>and</b> of coffee and tobacco close on to <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quarter each.

The husbandman cannot complain that his toil is inadequately rewarded. A rice plantation will yield a return of at least fifteen per cent.; if he plant his farm with sugar-cane he will realise thirty per cent., if not more. On the other hand, the price of labour is very low. An adult who gains a real fuerte (about thirteen cents) a day, thinks he is doing well.|$|R

25|$|The {{events of}} 1915-23 are {{regarded}} by Armenians {{and the vast}} majority of Western historians to have been state-sponsored mass killings. Turkish authorities, however, maintain that the deaths were the result of a civil war coupled with disease and famine, with casualties incurred by both sides. The exact number of deaths is hard to establish. It is estimated by many sources that close to a <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> Armenians perished in camps, which excludes Armenians who may have died in other ways. Most estimates place the total number of deaths between 600,000 (by Turkish authorities) and 1,500,000 (by Western academics). These events are traditionally commemorated yearly on 24 April, the Armenian Christian martyr day.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} decade {{important}} women writers also published novels. Susanna Rowson {{is best known for}} her novel, Charlotte: A Tale of Truth, published in London in 1791. In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, Charlotte Temple. Charlotte Temple is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs. Reaching more than a <b>million</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> readers over a century and a half, Charlotte Temple was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, Charlotte Temple is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.|$|E

Kohn called its mood happy yet miserable the same, evoking more emotions as a whole than even the preceding episode. The A.V. Club writer Oliver Sava gave it an A grade, finding it, like Kohn, emotionally intense. Kohn praised the episode for supplying Lumpy, a usually arrogant character, with a tragic circumstance. Sava saw the character as more explored that way. Nussbaum, who considered the episode proof of her intricacy as a character, wrote that Lumpy appropriately shows pathos.|$|E
