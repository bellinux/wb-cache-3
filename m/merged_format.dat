40|$|Abstract. XML {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} one of the most adopted standard for information representation and interchange over the Internet. With the proliferation of mobile devices of communication such as palmtop computers in recent years, there has been growing numbers of web ap-plications that generate tremendous amount of XML data transmitted via the Internet. We therefore need to investigate an effective means to handle such ever-growing XML data in various merging activities such as aggregation, accumulation or updating, in addition to storing and querying XML data. Previously, we recognized that FDs are an impor-tant and effective means to achieve consistent XML data merging, which we restricted data consistency for leaf nodes in an XML data tree. In this paper we further extend FDs to be satisfied in an XML document by comparing subtrees in a specified context of an XML tree. Given an XML tree T and a set of FDs F defined over a set of given path expressions, called targeted functional path expressions, we tackle the problem of repairing the inconsistency with respect to F in the most concise <b>merged</b> <b>format</b> of T. ...|$|E

This was also the period of experimental works, which showed a progression away from the canonical motifs and themes of Kathak, like Radha Krishna, Chhed Chhad, Gat Bhav and Tode Tukde. In 1980, when Keshav Kothari was the Director at the Kendra and also Secretary of Sangeet Natak Akademi, a work title, Parikrama was choreographed by Birju Maharaj, in which Kathak was used to depict the natural rhythm that runs through all animate objects. In 1982, Kathak Kendra started organising two national-level Kathak festivals annually, 'Kalka Bindadin Festival' and 'Sharad Chandrika Festival', focussing of group and solo performances respectively. This also provided a common platform of dancers from both Lucknow and Jaipur gharana to allow mingling of ideas and facilitate innovations.

40|$|Hashing {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} table lookup techniques, not just in SAS®, but in any {{programming}} language. Figure 1 illustrates the concept of a table lookup and the speed advantage of SAS V 9 Hashing over a format table lookup. If a programmer needs to select, from a large file, all subjects that are in a small file, hashing will likely save disk space and time. Hashing {{should be part of the}} tool kit of every programmer who deals with large files. Hashing is designed to allow a programmer to subset a large file, based on information in a small file (as is shown in figure 1). While that is the designed reason for SAS adding this new feature, hashing can also replace by <b>merges,</b> <b>format</b> lookups and IORC merges. A major benefit of hashing, is that it can perform a table lookup using two unsorted datasets. Sorting is a disk and CPU intensive process. The techniques described in the series of papers named the Animated Guide©: Speed Merges: have, as a common theme, the desire to not sort the data. This paper, on SAS V 9. 1 Hashing, is the fourth in the “speed merging ” series and recommends that V 9. 1 hashing be considered for general use because of its speed and ease of use...|$|R

40|$|In SAS data processing, searching {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} operations. Base SAS offers a rich collection of built-in searching techniques. <b>MERGE,</b> SQL joins, <b>formats,</b> SAS indexes- all serve the purpose of the table lookup. For do-it-yourselfers, SAS offers arrays directly addressable data structures suited for implementing just about any searching algorithm. An array-based lookup is not a ready-to-go food: It has to be cooked at home. However, it results in dishes digested by the computer more easily, programmatically more nutritious, and with less CPU time going into the wastebasket. In this paper, SAS arrays are used to organize the fastest class of in-memory data lookups- direct addressing. Three such techniques- key-indexing, bitmapping, and hashing- are considered in their logical sequence using a real-life example of matching data files by a common key. The results of benchmarking presented in the paper show that home-grown direct addressing methods beat even the quickest ready-to-go tools like "large formats " by a wide margin.
