5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. Furthermore, in the B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E
5|$|According to Hobsbawm, the Fasci were a {{prime example}} of {{primitive}} agrarian movement that became modern by aligning itself with socialism and communism. Many of its leaders continued in the Socialist Party and continued the struggle for land rights and land reform once they were released. Despite the 1894 defeat, permanent <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> set up in some areas of Sicily using modern socialist models of organisation.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{feminism}} {{is a movement}} that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of women within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or minyan, the exemption from positive time-bound mitzvot, and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate divorce. Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.|$|E

5|$|The cantata {{is written}} in seven movements, with a {{symmetrical}} form: {{the first and last}} <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> for chorus and orchestra; the second and sixth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> recitatives; the third and fifth <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> arias in two parts with da capo repeats only for the instrumental ritornello; and the central fourth <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an accompanied solo. The metrical English translations below of the texts of the first six <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> by Henry Sandwith Drinker; and that of the seventh <b>movement</b> (chorale) <b>is</b> from the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of John Christian Jacobi and Isaac Watts.|$|R
50|$|The piece follows {{standard}} concerto form. The first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> brisk and in sonata form, {{the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow, {{and the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> fast. The length of the concerto is approximately 29 minutes.|$|R
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> young {{children}} {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and political life at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|Much of Clock Towers {{plot and}} artistic style are {{inspired}} by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, most notably Phenomena (1985). Director Hifumi Kono loved horror films like this and wanted the game to feel like one. Many of the game's character graphics were digitized from photos of real people. Jennifer's <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> constructed from a woman in Human's planning division acting out the scenes. Her design was inspired by Jennifer Connelly's character in Phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes of artwork for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
40|$|The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> {{not against}} globalization, it opposes to the {{negative}} effects caused by globalization. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> an expanding social movement of protest. With democratic master framework, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> highly decentralized, and its organizations and groups ally loosely. The anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a disparate and divided movement, and its members have varies motivation and different goals although anti-corporate globalization is the main target of anti-globalization movements. Furthermore, the anti-globalization <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> facing some serious challenges...|$|R
50|$|The {{intent of}} the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> to obtain public support (money and votes) to elect officeholders who would repeal these liberal statutes. Ultimately, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful. In retrospect, the <b>movement</b> <b>was</b> part of the ongoing culture war.|$|R
5000|$|In most of Beethoven's four-movement sonatas, {{the third}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in [...] and in ternary form, {{while the second}} <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> slow and in a {{different}} key from the other movements. In this sonata, {{the second and third}} movements have switched roles, where the second <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the ternary scherzo and trio, while the third <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> the slow <b>movement</b> in the tonic minor.|$|R
5|$|The German {{occupation}} administration repressed {{political dissent}} and launched numerous unpopular measures, including the deportation of Belgian workers to Germany and forced labour on military projects. It also supported the radical Flemish Movement by making numerous concessions {{as part of}} the Flamenpolitik in an attempt to gain support among the country's Flemish population. As a result, numerous resistance <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> founded which attempted to sabotage military infrastructure, collect intelligence for the Allies or print underground newspapers. Low-level expressions of dissent were common although frequently repressed.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually adjusted the faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, {{after some}} negotiation, Nevinson {{agreed to work}} for the British War Memorials Committee to produce a single large artwork for a proposed, but never built, Hall of Remembrance. He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit the casualty stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E

50|$|Each {{of the six}} <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> in {{different}} rhythms: the first <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> 4-beat, the second 5-beat, the third 6-beat, the fourth 7-beat, and the fifth, 9-beat (2+3+2+2). The sixth and final <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> in multiple cycles of the preceding beat patterns.|$|R
50|$|This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> a choral song {{of praise}} to Nicolas, briefly recounting several {{different}} {{stories of his}} mercy, charity, and kindness. Most of this <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> written homophonically, with a brief canonic section towards the end. This <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> strongly tonal, in G-Major.|$|R
5|$|It was {{revealed}} in December 2005 that Bayh had raised $1.2 {{million in the}} first two quarters of 2005, more than any other potential candidate with the exception of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. But the cash did not translate into high marks among possible voters as a CNN poll conducted December 9–11 found that Bayh had the support of only 1% of self-identified Democrats, placing him seventh among possible candidates. Later in the month, Bayh was criticized by the video game industry for political posturing in his quest along with Senator Hillary Clinton to crack down on explicit content in video games. The manufacturers claimed that the <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> simply attempts to increase his appeal to values voters for his presidential run.|$|E
5|$|Most Spanish Americans saw {{no reason}} to {{recognize}} a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and Río de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|On {{going through}} his papers, Loriod {{discovered}} that, in {{the last months of}} his life, he had been composing a concerto for four musicians he felt particularly grateful to, namely herself, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, the oboist Heinz Holliger and the flautist Catherine Cantin (hence the title Concert à quatre). Four of the five intended <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> substantially complete; Yvonne Loriod undertook the orchestration of {{the second half of the}} first movement and of the whole of the fourth with advice from George Benjamin. It was premiered by the dedicatees in September 1994.|$|E

50|$|Overt {{orienting}} is {{the act of}} selectively {{attending to}} an item or location over others by moving the eyes to point in that direction. Overt orienting can be directly observed {{in the form of}} eye movements. Although overt eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> quite common, there is a distinction that can be made between two types of eye movements; reflexive and controlled. Reflexive <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by the superior colliculus of the midbrain. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> fast and are activated by the sudden appearance of stimuli. In contrast, controlled eye <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> commanded by areas in the frontal lobe. These <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> slow and voluntary.|$|R
5|$|One of the Smith government's first actions was {{to crack}} {{down hard on the}} black {{nationalist}} political violence that had erupted following the establishment of a second black nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.|$|E
5|$|Path {{integration}} in mammals {{makes use of}} the vestibular organs, which detect accelerations in the three dimensions, together with motor efference, where the motor system tells {{the rest of the}} brain which <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> commanded, and optic flow, where the visual system signals how fast the visual world moves past the eyes. Information from other senses such as echolocation and magnetoreception may also be integrated in certain animals. The hippocampus is {{the part of the brain}} that integrates linear and angular motion to encode a mammal's relative position in space.|$|E
5|$|The Sri Lankan {{military}} began attacking Kilinochchi {{from three}} directions on 23 November 2008. Throughout {{the month of}} December, the SLA conducted three offensives {{in an attempt to}} take Kilinochchi. Heavy monsoon rains affected both sides during the months of November and December, with floods covering a large area in and around Kilinochchi. Troop <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> limited by this, and mines had been scattered around the area by the flood waters. Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} that once the <b>movement</b> <b>is</b> selected, it should <b>be</b> completed: uncompleted <b>movements</b> <b>are</b> likely to be unbalanced. Thus a <b>movement</b> should <b>be</b> selected which has a high probability of being completed.|$|R

5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing its lights. Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|The defence of the Australia Station was the Royal Australian Navy's {{main concern}} {{throughout}} the war. While RAN ships frequently served outside Australian waters, escort vessels and minesweepers {{were available to}} protect shipping in the Australia Station at all times. These escorts were supported by {{a small number of}} larger warships, such as cruisers and armed merchant cruisers, for protection against surface raiders. While important military shipping <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> escorted {{from the start of the}} war, convoys were not instituted in Australian waters until June 1942. The Australian naval authorities did, however, close ports to shipping at various times following real or suspected sightings of enemy warships or mines prior to June 1942.|$|E
5|$|The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry <b>movements</b> <b>were</b> some of Millett's {{principal}} causes. Her {{books were}} motivated by her activism, such as woman's rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, Bryn Mawr College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are The Politics of Cruelty (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and Mother Millett (2001), a book about {{her relationship with her}} mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono's Courage Award for the Arts, and was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
