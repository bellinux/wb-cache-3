5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E
5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{meets his}} girlfriend Elisa's {{grandmother}} (Teresa Yenque). The grandmother {{does not like}} Jack because he reminds her of the Generalissimo, the antagonist from her favorite Mexican telenovela Los Amantes Clandestinos. Jack buys Los Amantes Clandestinos and tries to kill the Generalissimo off, but the actors on the show refuse to cooperate. Jack then meets Hector Moreda (also played by Baldwin), the actor who plays the Generalissimo, and asks why he will not follow the script. According to Hector, {{his role as the}} Generalissimo allows him to cut in line at Disney World, among other perks. Jack shows him a picture of Elisa, explaining that he wants to kill off the character for her. Understanding Jack's feelings, Hector agrees to help Jack by making the character fall in love with an elderly Hispanic woman, thereby winning the affection of Elisa's grandmother. The grandmother subsequently accepts Jack as Elisa's boyfriend, but makes one more request of him: to make NBC News less depressing. Jack responds by airing a montage of pictures of Puerto Rican babies to the music of Tito Puente on The Today Show, much to the displeasure of <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of Communication StudiesCharles GriffinThe year 2015 {{provided}} {{a hotbed of}} discussion about trans* identities. Caitlyn Jenner’s public announcement of her identity as transgender shortly followed by Rachel Dolezal unveiling as a woman with Caucasian heritage. Using publically accessible interviews such as the Diane Sawyer interview with Bruce Jenner, both of <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer’s</b> conversations with Dolezal and Jenner, Melissa Harris-Perry’s interview with Dolezal, {{as well as two}} Vanity Fair stories provide a space for a closer examination of how trans* identities are negotiated in a conversational setting. Using Hecht’s (1993) communication theory of identity to investigate how the four proposed frames (personal, enactment, relationship, and communal) operate under the lens of trans* identities in flux. This thesis aims to explore the kinds of linguist framing motifs used by both an exemplar of the transgender community and an individual treading the barrier between Caucasian and black identities, ultimately leading to a discussion about how language confines personal and socially structure identity and identification. The implications of this identity work tangles with the reliance on personal experience as an expression of identity and its persuasive power to impact discourse. The linguistic tropes that confine identity expression inherently impact a community of individuals struggling to navigate trans* identity acceptance in a larger sphere...|$|R

25|$|On October 2, 2000, NBC {{expanded}} Today {{to three}} hours, {{with the addition}} of an hour from 9:00 to 10:00a.m. For its first twelve years, the format of the third hour was originally structured similarly to Todays first two hours, using the same anchors as that portion of the broadcast; separate anchors began to be used for the third hour over time, with only the news anchor (Ann Curry until 2011, then Natalie Morales) and the weather anchor (Al Roker) being shared with the main 7:00 to 9:00a.m. block – this was particularly the case during instances where <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> and/or his co-host (Katie Couric, then Meredith Vieira from 2006 to 2011, Ann Curry from 2011 to 2012 and finally Savannah Guthrie during the final months of the original format) could not be present for the entire hour due to reporting assignments or personal commitments. Vieira, outside of breaking news situations, was specifically disallowed by contract from any duties in the third hour due to her hosting commitments to the syndicated version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? by Buena Vista/Disney–ABC Domestic Television.|$|E
25|$|Ann Curry's final show as co-anchor was subdued {{compared}} to the earlier departures of Katie Couric and Meredith Vieira, as it did not include retrospectives of Curry's 15-year run on the program or goodbye messages from colleagues and celebrities, although Curry – seated alongside Lauer, Natalie Morales and Al Roker in the couch area of the Studio 1A set – gave a tear-filled farewell message to viewers. Rumors of Curry's departure from Today began weeks before NBC formally announced that she {{would no longer be}} co-host, spurring negative press similar to that resulting from the departure of Jane Pauley and her replacement by Deborah Norville 23 years earlier, as since disproven reports suggested that <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> had a hand in the program's decision to let Curry go. Viewership declines for the program that began in the months following Curry becoming co-host precipitated in part due to public criticism over Lauer's alleged involvement in Curry's departure; loyal viewers once again began turning to the competing Good Morning America, which toppled Todays 16-year consecutive run as the top-rated morning news program during the week of April 9, 2012. The public relations problems for Lauer that resulted from the accusations, led then-executive producer Jim Bell to admit responsibility for the negative press, in defense of Lauer, in a series of interviews with The New York Times, The Hollywood Reporter and the Associated Press.|$|E

He criticized President George W. Bush for not [...] "car about black people". Bush stated {{in an interview that}} the comment was [...] "one of the most disgusting moments" [...] of his presidency. In November 2010, in a taped interview with <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> for the Today show, West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize.

500|$|Nearly 41 million US viewers watched NBC's {{coverage}} of the event. Criticism was levelled at its decision to tape-delay this broadcast, and not make a live version available even to cable and web users. [...] There were frequent interruptions by commercial breaks. Many US viewers looked for other ways to watch (such as the live BBC feed), despite both NBC and the IOC vowing {{to crack down on}} unauthorised streams. More significant criticism was levelled at NBC for cutting to a Ryan Seacrest interview with Michael Phelps during the 'memorial wall' tribute including commemoration of the victims of the 7/7 London bombings, which was seen as disrespectful and insensitive. An NBC spokesman said the network had left out that segment because its programming was [...] "tailored for the US audience". There was also criticism of commentators <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> and Meredith Vieira for suggesting that the Queen had actually jumped out of a helicopter. Vieira and Lauer admitted to not knowing that Tim Berners-Lee was the inventor of the World Wide Web, as she commented [...] "If you haven't heard of him, we haven't either", before Lauer told the audience to Google him. These failings were picked up on Twitter during the broadcast with the hashtag #nbcfail. Commentary by Bob Costas and Lauer during the Parade of Nations was also criticised for their negative opinions about some countries' political environments and for leaving out information about the athletes, which was seen as [...] "smug American elitism".

500|$|McKellen has {{appeared}} in limited release films, such as Emile (which was shot in three weeks following the X2 shoot), Neverwas and Asylum. He appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in The Da Vinci Code. During a 17 May 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, <b>Matt</b> <b>Lauer</b> posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer {{that it is a}} work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie– not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it". McKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais' comedy series Extras, where he played himself directing Gervais' character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in The Prisoner, a remake of the 1967 cult series The Prisoner. In 2013, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom Vicious as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi.

In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell me the same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "Truth", the album's title track, is an electropop {{composition}} with {{a guitar}} hook.

Club summarized its meaning as [...] "captur the delicious anticipation of a crush potentially texting a snap". [...] "Red Flag" [...] is an [...] "upbeat in-your face track" [...] beginning with [...] "an intro that sounds like a melting violin", followed by Stefani scorning her ex: [...] "This is what happens when you don't listen to what your mother say."
