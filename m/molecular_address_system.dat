30|$|The idea of {{synaptic}} {{democracy has}} previously arisen {{within the context}} of equalizing synaptic efficacies, that is, ensuring that synapses have the same potential for affecting the postsynaptic response regardless of their locations along the dendritic tree [71, 126]. An analogous issue arises within the context intracellular transport, since vesicles are injected from the soma (anterograde transport) so that one might expect synapses proximal to the soma to be preferentially supplied with resources. In principle, this could be resolved by routing cargo to specific synaptic targets, but there is no known form of <b>molecular</b> <b>address</b> <b>system</b> that could support such a mechanism, particularly in light of the dynamically changing distribution of synapses. From a mathematical perspective, the issue of synaptic democracy reflects a fundamental property shared by the one-dimensional advection–diffusion equation used to model active transport and the cable equation used to model ionic current flow, namely, they generate an exponentially decaying steady-state solution in response to a localized source of active particles or current.|$|E
40|$|Phosphoinositide {{phospholipase}} C (PI-PLC) {{plays an}} essential role in cell signaling. A unique Trypanosoma cruzi PI-PLC (TcPI-PLC) is lipid-modified in its N terminus and localizes to the plasma membrane of amastigotes. Here, we show that TcPI-PLC is located onto the extracellular phase of the plasma membrane of amastigotes and that its N-terminal 20 amino acids are necessary and sufficient to target the fused GFP to the outer surface of the parasite. Mutagenesis of the predicted acylated residues confirmed that myristoylation of a glycine residue in the 2 nd position and acyl modification of a cysteine in the 4 th but not in the 8 th or 15 th position of the coding sequence are required for correct plasma membrane localization in T. cruzi epimastigotes or amastigotes. Interestingly, mutagenesis of the cysteine at the 8 th position increased its flagellar localization. When expressed as fusion constructs with GFP, the N-terminal 6 and 10 amino acids fused to GFP are predominantly located in the cytosol and concentrated in a compartment that co-localizes with a Golgi complex marker. The N-terminal 20 amino acids of TcPI-PLC associate with lipid rafts when dually acylated. Taken together, these results indicate that N-terminal acyl modifications serve as a <b>molecular</b> <b>addressing</b> <b>system</b> for sending TcPI-PLC to the outer surface of the cell...|$|R

Here, we analysed {{the effects of}} cage confinement on the weightbearing musculoskeletal system, behaviour and stress of wild-type mice (C 57 BL/ 6 JRj, 30 g b. wt., total n = 24) housed for 25 days in a prototypical ground-based and fully automated life support habitat device called "Mice in Space" (MIS). Compared with control housing (individually ventilated cages) the MIS mice revealed no significant changes in soleus muscle size and myofiber distribution (type I vs. II) and quality of bone (3 -D microarchitecture and mineralisation of calvaria, spine and femur) determined by confocal and micro-computed tomography. Corticosterone metabolism measured non-invasively (faeces) monitored elevated adrenocortical activity at only start of the MIS cage confinement (day 1). Behavioural tests (i. e., grip strength, rotarod, L/D box, elevated plus-maze, open field, aggressiveness) performed subsequently revealed only minor changes in motor performance (MIS vs. controls). The MIS habitat will not, on its own, produce major effects that could confound interpretation of data induced by microgravity exposure during spaceflight.

40|$|The {{urokinase}} receptor (uPAR) exerts essential {{functions in}} the pathophysiology of cancers and therefore constitutes an important drug target. In order to generate efficient drugs against uPAR, a new approach includes chimeric proteins associating one <b>molecular</b> <b>address</b> to specifically target uPAR and one bacterial or plant toxin that will eventually kill the tumoural cell. Using this frame, several recombinant toxins have been designed namely DTAT, DTAT 13, EGFATFKDEL 7 mut, and ATF-SAP. As <b>molecular</b> <b>address,</b> all of these fusion proteins use the amino-terminal fragment of urokinase that binds with high affinity to uPAR through its growth factor domain (GFD). The various toxin moieties were derived from either diphtheria toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE 38), or saporin. In this review, we describe the rational, design, production and therapeutic anti-cancer potential of these chimeric toxins...|$|R
