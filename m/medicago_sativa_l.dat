50|$|Most {{members of}} the Fabaceae family contain {{significant}} quantities of isoflavones. Analysis of levels in various species {{has found that the}} highest levels of genistein and daidzein in psoralea (Psoralea corylifolia). Various legumes including soybean (Glycine max L.), green bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), alfalfa sprout (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.),</b> mung bean sprout (Vigna radiata L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), kudzu root (Pueraria lobata L.), and red clover blossom and red clover sprout (Trifolium pratense L.) have been studied for their estrogenic activity. Highly processed foods made from legumes, such as tofu, retain most of their isoflavone content, and fermented miso, which has increased levels.|$|E
50|$|According to Columella (De Re Rustica 8.4.1), {{chickens}} {{should be}} fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, {{if they are}} cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (Lolium sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> {{can be used as}} well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the winter solstice, in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.|$|E
40|$|Information on genetic {{diversity}} and population {{structure of a}} tetraploid alfalfa collection might be valuable in effective use of the genetic resources. A set of 336 worldwide genotypes of tetraploid alfalfa (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> subsp. <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> was genotyped using 85 genome-wide distributed SSR markers to reveal the {{genetic diversity}} and population structure in the alfalfa. Genetic diversity analysis identified a total of 1056 alleles across 85 marker loci. The average expected heterozygosity and polymorphism information content values were 0. 677 and 0. 638, respectively, showing high levels of genetic diversity in the cultivated tetraploid alfalfa germplasm. Comparison of genetic characteristics across chromosomes indicated regions of chromosomes 2 and 3 had the highest genetic diversity. A higher genetic diversity was detected in alfalfa landraces than that of wild materials and cultivars. Two populations were identified by the model-based population structure, principal coordinate and neighbor-joining analyses, corresponding to China {{and other parts of}} the world. However, lack of strictly correlation between clustering and geographic origins suggested extensive germplasm exchanges of alfalfa germplasm across diverse geographic regions. The quantitative analysis of the genetic diversity and population structure in this study could be useful for genetic and genomic analysis and utilization of the genetic variation in alfalfa breeding...|$|R

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} in southern Australia investigated a farming system of over-cropping wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into established lucerne (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> subsp. <b>L.)</b> varieties of different winter activity ratings. The study was completed at Roseworthy, South Australia, and Katanning, Western Australia, between August 2000 and May 2003 in seasons receiving below average and average rainfall. Comparative lucerne persistence and biomass, wheat biomass, grain yield and protein contents, and soil water contents were measured. Wheat grain yield was reduced by 13 – 63 % by over-cropping lucerne compared with wheat monoculture. Winter-dormant lucerne (winter activity Classes 0. 5 and 2) reduced the yield penalty compared with winter-active varieties (Classes 6 and 10) in 2 of the 4 evaluations. The positive response to applying N at sowing {{in the second}} year of over-cropping wheat at Katanning was greatest in the most winter-dormant lucerne treatment (winter activity 0. 5). Soil water contents were similar under the lucerne/wheat over-cropping and lucerne monoculture treatments irrespective of lucerne winter activity. Deficits of up to 43 mm at Roseworthy and 88 mm at Katanning were measured in the 0 – 200 -cm soil profile {{at the start of the}} third summer of the study. The study shows that it can be more efficient in terms of land area to over-crop wheat into lucerne than to grow monocultures on separate parcels of land akin to phase farming. The improved productivity of over-cropping is associated with the separation of growth patterns of winter wheat and summer-active lucerne. This farming system offers great potential for improving sustainability and productivity in southern Australian cropping rotations...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{nutrient}} solution pH on growth parameters of alfalfa (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> genotypes The effects of {{nutrient solution}} pH (4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 and 7. 0) were examined on growth features of 12 alfalfa genotypes {{in relation to}} characters: leaf blade, epicotyl, hypocotyl, first leaf petiole, trifoliate leaf petiole and root fresh weight and epicotyl, hypocotyl, first leaf petiole, trifoliate leaf petiole and root length. Significant quadratic effects of pH solution were detected for all studied parameters. The pH value which resulted in maximum growth varied, according to the studied parameter, between 5. 0 and 6. 0. The genotypes Victoria, Esmeralda, Crioula and F- 708 exhibited superior performance when data were pooled for all studied pH values. The {{results indicate that the}} initial growth is affected by pH variation in the nutrient solution, and that contrasting genotypes tend to perform alike.

40|$|Aluminum (Al) {{toxicity}} in acid soils {{is a major}} limitation to {{the production}} of alfalfa (<b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> subsp. <b>sativa</b> <b>L.)</b> in the USA. Developing Al-tolerant alfalfa cultivars is one approach to overcome this constraint. Accessions of wild diploid alfalfa (M. sativa subsp. coerulea) {{have been found to be}} a source of useful genes for Al tolerance. Previously, two genomic regions associated with Al tolerance were identified in this diploid species using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and single marker analysis. This study was conducted to identify additional Al-tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTLs); to identify simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers that flank the previously identified QTLs; to map candidate genes associated with Al tolerance from other plant species; and to test for co-localization with mapped QTLs. A genetic linkage map was constructed using EST-SSR markers in a population of 130 BC 1 F 1 plants derived from the cross between Al-sensitive and Al-tolerant genotypes. Three putative QTLs on linkage groups LG I, LG II and LG III, explaining 38, 16 and 27 % of the phenotypic variation, respectively, were identified. Six candidate gene markers designed from Medicago truncatula ESTs that showed homology to known Al-tolerance genes identified in other plant species were placed on the QTL map. A marker designed from a candidate gene involved in malic acid release mapped near a marginally significant QTL (LOD 2. 83) on LG I. The SSR markers flanking these QTLs will be useful for transferring them to cultivated alfalfa via marker-assisted selection and for pyramiding Al tolerance QTLs...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{heavy metals}} {{concentrations}} increased in some agricultural areas {{due to the}} consequences of anthropogenic impacts. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the level of heavy metals (As, Cr, Ni and Pb) in <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> and Trifolium pratense L. grown on fluvisol, in order to obtain information on safety of these nutrients. The total content of Pb, As, Cr and Ni in the samples of fluvisol was above the maximum allowable amount. The content of heavy metals in <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> and Trifolium pratense L. was below the critical and toxic concentrations in all samples originating from contaminated soil. It was concluded that the accumulation of heavy metals in plants did not depend only on the total content in soil, but also the affinity of the plant, and individual and interactive effects of various soil properties. No statistically significant differences in the accumulation of heavy metals between <b>Medicago</b> <b>sativa</b> <b>L.</b> and Trifolium pratense L were observed.

Evidence for transformation {{was based on}} GUS activity {{and the presence of}} a fragment of the uidA gene in transformed embryos and regenerated plants, as demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction. Efficiency was 1 % (LBA 4404 /pBI 121) to 14 % (LBA 4404 /pTOK 233) higher than that of some other vectors used in previous work with the same cultivar. The higher efficiency {{may be due to the}} presence of an extra set of vir genes in pTOK 233.
