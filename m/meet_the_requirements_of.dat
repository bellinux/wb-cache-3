5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been a major {{contributor}} to the pollution of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E
5|$|As long as {{maple syrup}} {{does not have}} an {{off-flavour}} and is of a uniform colour and clean and free from turbidity and sediment, it can be labelled as one of the A grades. If it exhibits any of these problems, it does not meet Grade A requirements and must be labelled as Processing Grade maple syrup and may not be sold in containers smaller than 5 gallons. If maple syrup does not <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> Processing Grade maple syrup (including a fairly characteristic maple taste), it is classified as Substandard.|$|E

5|$|The Model 8-A, {{the export}} {{model of the}} Northrop Attack Bomber series was never {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} basis of a floatplane and had to be redesigned to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian order. The new N-3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft, which had reformed in 1939, and was a low-winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats. First intended for a lower powered engine, the N-3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine, of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A-5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk 75A-8s ordered by Norway at the same time, simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets.|$|E
5|$|The main prison {{building}} {{was built in}} 1910–1912 during its time as a United States Army military prison; Alcatraz had been {{the site of a}} citadel since the 1860s. The United States Disciplinary Barracks, Pacific Branch on Alcatraz was acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island became a prison of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in August 1934 after the buildings were modernized to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> a top-notch security prison. Given this high security and the location of Alcatraz in the cold waters and strong currents of San Francisco Bay, the prison operators believed Alcatraz to be escape-proof and America's strongest prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft would be completely common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E

5|$|The {{economy of}} the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on agriculture. The main {{agricultural}} product was rice, the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. Rice cultivation began around the Malvatu oya, Deduru oya and Mahaweli river and spread throughout the country. Shifting cultivation was also done during the rainy seasons. Rice was produced in two main seasons named Yala and Maha. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly self-sufficient. Cotton was grown extensively to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> cloth. Sugarcane and Sesame were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. Finger millet was grown {{as a substitute for}} rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country. Surpluses of these products, mainly rice, were exported.|$|E
5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was originally}} planned as a three-act opéra comique for the Opéra-Comique theatre. Meyerbeer stopped {{work on the}} opera in 1827 when the theatre underwent financial difficulties. In August 1829, the composer and librettists agreed to refashion the work in a five-act form to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the Paris Opéra. This entailed some significant rewriting of the storyline, reducing the essentially comic role of Raimbaut (who vanishes after Act 3 in the final version, but whose antics – including the spending of Bertram's money – continued throughout in the earlier libretto). It also meant that the traditional 'pairing' of lovers in opéra comique (Robert/Isabelle paralleled throughout by the 'lower-class' Raimbaut/Alice) was swept aside in favour of concentration on the more sensational story-line of Robert's diabolic ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphee, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed to <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphee, Tolman, Cohen and Tolman estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee {{that it would be}} operational by 1 January 1945.|$|E

5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> <b>requirements</b> <b>of</b> the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the {{proposed}} site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E
