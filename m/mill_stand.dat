50|$|The {{heart of}} the temper mill is the cold rolling <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> which {{produces}} the temper pass. It will include electric powered drive motors and speed reduction gearing suited to the process desired. The design of the rolling mill can be a 2-high or 4-high (even 6-high in some cases). The <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> can be work roll driven or back up roll driven. The mill can be designed with hydraulic work roll bending or back up roll bending. Installations typically have a single rolling <b>mill</b> <b>stand,</b> but may have two. Pinch rolls provide back tension for the pay off reel in the entry section and entry and exit tension for the temper pass.|$|E

50|$|As of 2000, IPSCO {{had used}} mini mills to produce {{flat-rolled}} steel for 40 years. Late in 2001, the company officially opened an Axis, Alabama mill (in the Mobile area), with {{a capacity of}} 1,250,000 tonnes,. The $US425 million rolling mill, with <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> housings {{believed to be the}} largest one-piece cast mill housings in the world at 350 tons each, uses scrap steel to produce discrete plate and coiled hot rolled plate. Montpelier, Iowa had a similar facility which began operations in 1997, but this one would serve the Gulf coast. On October 21, 2008, SSAB announced a $US460 million expansion of the Axis mill to be completed in 2011. The mill already had 400 employees and 350 contractors.|$|E
50|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} of Huish {{took place in}} the summer of 1963 when the new stand was built, as the original Pen <b>Mill</b> <b>stand</b> was demolished. Plans were drawn up by James E. Fox and in March 1963 work commenced when first a tea hut and then the stand was demolished. By the first week in May building work was under way, and {{at the start of the}} 1963-64 season the dressing rooms ha been completed and the stand was open but the rest of the facilities were still under construction. The new 2,000 seater Main Stand was finally completed just in time for an FA Cup tie with Crystal Palace, on 7 December 1963, when the Social Club was opened. The new stand, which had cost £60,000 to build, gave the club new dressing rooms, plus an upstairs boardroom, and a long bar for supporters to drink in, and where the club held dances and bingo nights. The bar soon became one of the hubs of the town, with the ground on the west end of the town centre, and the additional income began to give the club payback for that investment.|$|E

50|$|As Florida {{officials}} {{realized the}} Seminole would resist relocation, preparations for war began. Settlers fled to safety as Seminole attacked plantations and a militia wagon train. Two companies totaling 110 men {{under the command}} of Major Francis L. Dade were sent from Fort Brooke to reinforce Fort King in mid-December 1835. On the morning of December 28, the train of troops was ambushed by a group of Seminole warriors {{under the command of}} Alligator near modern day Bushnell, Florida. The entire command and their small canon was destroyed, with only two badly wounded soldiers surviving to return to Fort Brooke. Over the next few months Generals Clinch, Gaines and Winfield Scott, as well as territorial governor Richard Keith Call, led large numbers of troops in futile pursuits of the Seminoles. In the meantime the Seminoles struck throughout the state, attacking isolated farms, settlements, plantations and Army forts, even burning the Cape Florida lighthouse. Supply problems and a high rate of illness during the summer caused the Army to abandon several forts. On Dec. 28, 1835 Major Benjamine A. Putnam with a force of soldiers occupied the Bulow Plantation and fortified it with cotton bales and a stockade. Local planters took refuge with their slaves. The Major abandoned the site on January 23, 1836, and the Bulow Plantation was later burned by the Seminoles. Now a State Park, the site remains a window into the destruction of the conflict; the massive stone ruins of the huge Bulow sugar <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> little changed from the 1830s. By February 1836 the Seminole and black allies had attacked 21 plantations along the river.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It {{is still}} common {{practice}} in industry to handle the thickness control problem of a rolling mill around a working point. The assumption of linearity is no longer valid if the mill is operated in a wider working range. In a reversing mill this is especially the case when the plate enters and leaves the <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> from pass to pass. A non-linear control strategy is proposed to improve the regularity of the thickness {{at the ends of}} the plate in order to decrease the amount of the plate to be cut off by the crop shear. The performance of the controller is examined using an advanced simulation model of a finishing mill. Copyright c ° 2005 IFA...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{model of}} rolling process is used at cold mill rolling on tandemmills in metallurgy. The model {{goal is to}} analyse rolling process {{according}} to process datameasured on the mill and get immeasurable variables necessary for rolling control andoptimal mill pre-set for next rolled coil. The values obtained by model are used asreferences for superimposed technology controllers (thickness, speed, tension, etc.) as well. Considering wide steel strip assortment (different initial and final thickness, differenthardness), and fluctuation of tandem mill parameters (change of friction coefficient, workrolls abrasion, temperature fluctuation, etc.) the exact analysis of tandem is complicated. The paper deals with an identification of friction coefficient on a single rolling mill standby a genetic algorithm. Mathematical description of tandem <b>mill</b> <b>stand</b> is based on themodified Bland-Ford model. Results are presented in graphical form...|$|E
