5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of <b>material</b> <b>items</b> that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E

If my inferences are correct, we have a settlement that is spatially arranged according to its functional needs and socio-economic organization.|$|E
25|$|The study Cognitive Dissonance: Private Ratiocination or Public Spectacle? (1971) {{reported}} that maintaining cognitive consistency, rather than protecting a private self-concept, {{is how a}} person protects his or her public self-image. Moreover, the results reported in the study I’m No Longer Torn After Choice: How Explicit Choices Implicitly Shape Preferences of Odors (2010) contradict such an explanation, by showing the occurrence of revaluation of <b>material</b> <b>items,</b> after the person chose and decided, even after having forgotten the choice.|$|E

He identified <b>material</b> <b>items</b> and showed the techniques by which they were made. Ishi provided valuable information on his native Yana language, which was recorded and studied by the linguist Edward Sapir, who had previously done work on the northern dialects.|$|E
25|$|On {{the fifteenth}} day {{the realms of}} Heaven and Hell and {{the realm of the}} living are open and Chinese would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is {{ancestor}} worship, where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning incense, and burning joss paper, a papier-mache form of <b>material</b> <b>items</b> such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former includes only older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and lanterns on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.|$|E

Other varieties in style may have distinguished between arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps defining status, gender, clan or guild affiliation, religious belief or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in a given time or area.|$|E

2500|$|Working less {{is another}} {{component}} of freeganism. Freegans oppose {{the notion of}} working {{for the sole purpose}} of accumulating <b>material</b> <b>items.</b> They claim that their need to work is reduced by only purchasing the basic necessities and acquiring the remainder for free from the garbage. According to freegans, not working frees up additional time for political action while avoiding tasks they see as sacrificing valuable time to [...] "take orders from someone else, stress, boredom, monotony, and in many cases risks to physical and psychological well-being". As with squatting, however, the degree of concordance between freegan ideology and practices is variable.

[...] The Court, in law and equity is required to answer such a prayer. [...] If the accused's prayer is not answered in a manner that favorably restores the balance between the accused and the Government in criminal cases, or between the defendant and the plaintiff in civil cases, it is grounds for an appeal if a mistrial is not granted. The United States Supreme Court dealt with this issue in federal civil cases in United States v. Reynolds.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the motive}} of the rioters was {{attributed}} to racial tensions {{but now they are}} considered one factor in a larger status quo conflict. Urban sociologist Joel Kotkin agrees, [...] "This wasn't a race riot, it was a class riot." [...] Supporting this is the large misconception that rioters were only African-American; many groups in fact participated. Newsweek reported that [...] "Hispanics and even some whites—men, women and children—mingled with African-Americans." [...] "When residents who lived near Florence and Normandie were asked why they believed riots had occurred in their neighborhoods, they responded of the perceived racist attitudes they had felt throughout their lifetime and empathized with the bitterness the rioters felt. Residents who had respectable jobs, homes, and <b>material</b> <b>items</b> still felt like second-class citizens.

2500|$|In the 1980s, {{there was}} a {{movement}} in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology. [...] During this same period, then-Cambridge archaeologist Ian Hodder developed [...] "post-processual archaeology" [...] as an alternative. [...] Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but as culture itself. [...] Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation. [...] Instead, he [...] "is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which <b>material</b> <b>items,</b> artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes." [...] His 1982 book, Symbols in Action, evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, {{as an alternative to}} White and Steward's materialist view of culture. [...] In his 1991 textbook, Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.|$|E
