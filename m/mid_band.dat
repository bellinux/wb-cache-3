40|$|Abstract- Aliquot {{watermarking}} is {{the unique}} idea in aliquot media for copyright protection. Various watermarking algorithm {{has been developed}} in recent years, but cognitive content of the intent, as they serve, they demarcated from each other. This context presents a new proposal for hiding a logo-based watermark in color still image. This dodge is based on averaging of central frequency coefficients of block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of an image. It is unique from earlier dodge based on middle frequency coefficient by mean of high redundancy, to nurture malicious attacks. Here we propose algorithm of aliquot watermarking technique based on DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation) using <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> for robustness. Through adjusting the block DCT coefficient of the image the watermarks are adumbered.

40|$|The {{robustness}} {{and security}} of the biometric watermarking approach can be improved by using a multiple watermarking. This multiple watermarking proposed for improving security of biometric features and data. When the imposter tries to create the spoofed biometric feature, the invisible biometric watermark features can provide appropriate protection to multimedia data. In this paper, a biometric watermarking technique with multiple biometric watermarks are proposed in which biometric features of fingerprint, face, iris and signature {{is embedded in the}} image. Before embedding, fingerprint, iris, face and signature features are extracted using Shen-Castan edge detection and Principal Component Analysis. These all biometric watermark features are embedded into various <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> frequency curvelet coefficients of host image. All four fingerprint features, iris features, facial features and signature features are the biometric characteristics of the individual and they are used for cross verification and copyright protection if any manipulation occurs.

It can use for multiple copyright authentication and verification...|$|E
40|$|A simple yet {{promising}} {{strategy to}} modify TiO 2 band gap was achieved via dopants incorporation which influences the photo-responsiveness of the photocatalyst. The mesoporous TiO 2 was successfully mono-doped and co-doped with nitrogen and fluorine dopants. The {{results indicate that}} band gap engineering does not necessarily requires oxygen substitution with nitrogen or/and fluorine, but from the formation of additional <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> and Ti 3 + impurities states. The formation of oxygen vacancies {{as a result of}} modified color centres and Ti 3 + ions facilitates solar light absorption and influences the transfer, migration and trapping of the photo-excited charge carriers. The synergy of dopants in co-doped TiO 2 shows better optical properties relative to single N and F doped TiO 2 with c. a 0. 95 eV band gap reduction. Evidenced from XPS, the synergy between N and F in the co-doped TiO 2 uplifts the valence band towards the conduction band. However, the photoluminescence data reveals poorer electrons and holes separation as compared to F-doped TiO 2. This observation suggests that efficient solar light harvesting was achievable via N and F co-doping, but excessive defects could act as charge carriers trapping sites...|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 photocatalysts were {{prepared}} by doping {{transition metal ions}} like V 5 +, Mo 6 +and an inner transition metal Th 4 + in the concentration range of 0. 02 - 0. 1 and were characterized by various analytical techniques. The photocatalytic activities of these catalysts were studied for the mineralization of chlorpyrifos (CP) as a probe molecule. X-ray diffraction results showed only anatase phase irrespective of nature, oxidation state and concentration of these dopants. The photocatalytic activity of undoped TiO 2 showed a better activity under UV light compared to doped catalysts. Under solar light illumination, the Th 4 + (0. 06) -TiO 2 showed highest activity for the mineralization of CP. This was attributed to the prolonged separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, high specific surface area of the catalyst and high concentration of surface adsorbed water/hydroxyl groups. Further large shift in the absorption band (460 and 482 nm) due {{to the creation of}} <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> gap states by Th 4 + dopant and also by its small crystallite size additionally contributes to the enhancement of the degradation process. The degradation pathway was followed by UV-vis spectroscopic and GC-MS analysis. Â© 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a blind medical image {{watermarking}} scheme {{based on}} Fast Discrete Curvelet Transform (FDCuT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is proposed. FDCuT is applied on the medical image to get different frequency coefficients of its curvelet decomposition. On the high frequency curvelet coefficients of the medical image, block wise DCT is applied to get different frequency coefficients. Then <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> frequency coefficients of the medical image are modified by White Gaussian Noise (WGN) sequences according to watermark bit to get watermarked medical image. At extraction end, blind recovery of watermark data is performed by correlation of WGN sequences. The proposed scheme is tested for its effectiveness on various types of medical images such as X-ray, Ultrasound (US), Magnetic Resonant Imaging (MRI) and Computerized Tomography (CT). Result analysis shows that imperceptibility of watermarked medical image is better as PSNR is above 45  dB {{for all types of}} the medical images. In addition, the robustness of the scheme is better than an existing scheme for a similar set of medical images in terms of Normalized Correlation (NC). Experimental results show that scheme is robust to geometric attacks, signal processing attacks and JPEG compression attacks. An analysis is also carried out to verify the performance of the proposed scheme to support binary watermarks with different details in it: text and logos. Moreover, the proposed scheme resulted in zero false positive rate when tested on 100 non-watermarked images...|$|E
40|$|The {{degradation}} {{efficiency of}} Th-doped TiO 2 /TiO 2 photocatalysts were investigated under UV and solar light illumination. The model compound {{chosen for the}} study was Oryzalin (OZ). Doping of inner transition metal ion Th was intended to modify the electronic properties of TiO 2. The Th-doped TiO 2 were synthesized by incorporating 0. 02, 0. 04, 0. 06, and 0. 1 atom percentage of Th into the TiO 2 lattice by solid-state reaction. The stochiometry of the prepared samples is Ti 1 -xThx O 2, where 'x' is the percentage of Th. The samples were characterized by UV-Visible absorption, UV-Visible -Diffused reflectance spectra, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDX) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The pore size and surface area of these samples were studied by Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) adsorption method. It was found that metal ion doping at various percentage compositions enables a large shift in the absorption band of the TiO 2 towards visible light region. This {{is due to the}} formation of various <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> gaps at 2. 84 eV, 2. 804 eV, 2. 66 eV, and 2. 55 eV. The extent of degradation of the pesticide was followed by UV-Visible spectroscopy and GC-MS methods. Based on the spectral analysis, the probable degradation reaction mechanism for OZ is proposed. These results indicate that Th-doped TiO 2 with the modified electronic properties is a good catalyst under solar light irradiation. But these particles show marginal variation in rates under UV-illumination. All the photodegradation reactions follow the first order kinetics.

40|$|We report new {{observations}} of the nova RS Ophiuchi (RS Oph) using the Keck Interferometer Nulling Instrument, approximately 3. 8 days following the most recent outburst that occurred on 2006 February 12. The Keck Interferometer Nuller (KIN) operates in K-band from 8 to 12. 5 pm in a nulling mode, {{which means that the}} central broad-band interference fringe is a dark fringe - with an angular width of 25 mas at <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> - rather than the bright fringe used ill a conventional optical interferometer. In this mode the stellar light itself is suppressed by the destructive fringe, effectively enhancing the contrast of the circumstellar material located near the star. By subsequently shifting the neighboring bright fringe onto the center of the source brightness distribution and integrating, a second spatial regime dominated by light from the central portion of the source is almost simultaneously sampled. The nulling technique is the sparse aperture equivalent of the conventional corongraphic technique used in filled aperture telescopes. By fitting the unique KIK inner and outer spatial regime data, we have obtained an angular size of the mid-infrared continuum of 6. 2, 4. 0. or 5. 4 mas for a disk profile, gaussian profile (fwhm), and shell profile respectively. The data show evidence of enhanced neutral atomic hydrogen emission located in the inner spatial regime relative to the outer regime. There is also evidence of a 9. 7 micron silicate feature seen outside of this region. Importantly, we see spectral lines excited by the nova flash in the outer region before the blast wave reaches these regions. These lines are from neutral, weakly excited atoms which support the following interpretation. We discuss the present results in terms of a unifying model of the system that includes an increase in density in the plane of the orbit of the two stars created by a spiral shock wave caused by the motion of the stars through the cool wind of the red giant star. These data show the power and potential of the nulling technique which has been developed for the detection of Earth-like planets around nearby stars for the Terrestrial Planet Finder Mission and Darwin missions...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge of {{wideband}} {{dielectric properties}} of liquid materials {{is necessary in}} many applications such as biomedical, remote sensing, powder technology and radar absorbing materials. Nondestructive, noncontact, in situ and real time measurement of dielectric properties of liquids is important for evaluation of complex material systems such as service-aged transformer oil. Free-space microwave measurement (FSMM) system (which is nondestructive and noncontact) was developed for accurate measurement of dielectric properties of low-loss and high-loss liquids at microwave frequencies. Three free-space methods were used, namely, reflection and transmission method, transmission only method and metalback method. These methods were especially developed and tested for dielectric measurement of liquids in free-space. This is the first reported implementation of transmissions only and metal-back methods in free-space for low-loss liquids at microwave frequencies. FSMM system consists of spot focusing of hom lens antennas, mode transitions, coaxial cables and vector network analyzer (VNA). All measurements were made using FSMM system in the frequency range of 8 GHz to 12 GHz and temperature fixed at 20 ° C. Inaccuracies due to diffraction from the sample are minimized by using spot focusing hom lens antennas. Errors due to multiple reflections between antennas were minimized by using free-space LRL (line, reflect, line) calibration technique and time domain gating (a feature ofVNA). The liquid is contained in a container consisting of two Plexiglas plates with known dielectric properties. These Plexiglas plates {{are designed to be}} quarter wavelength at <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> to reduce reflectivity of the liquid sample. The effect of Plexiglas plates is removed from the knowledge of dielectric properties of Plexiglas and thickness of plates. Dielectric properties of low-loss liquids such as Dioxane, Benzene and transformer oil are measured using reflection and transmission, transmission only and metal-back methods. High-loss liquids such as Methanol, Ethanol, Ethylene Glycol and N-Propyl Alcohol, dielectric constants and loss factors were measured using reflection and transmission, transmission only and metal-back methods. It was found that reflection and transmission method gives accurate results for high-loss liquids. Transmission only and metal-back methods give accurate results for lowloss liquids. Values of dielectric constant for low-loss liquids are almost constant in ' the frequency variation. Whereas, dielectric constant of high-loss liquids are reduce in magnitude if frequency increased. Results for all liquids are compared with published data. For high-loss liquids, our experimental results are also compared with data calculated from previo. usly published Debye parameters. All results for dielectric constants and loss factors for all samples have close match with published data. The percentage error for dieleetric constant is ± 3. 9...|$|E
40|$|A {{very high}} {{frequency}} (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) network is used in Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for communication purposes within the company. This network is specially used in the field activities such as in breakdowns & projects. This network is fully owned by the CEB and it is maintained by the company itself. This network is used four bands of frequency called VHF low band (LB), VHF <b>mid</b> <b>band</b> (MB), VHF high band (HB) and UHF band. Also there are four different types of radio equipment in the network called repeaters, fixed sets, mobile sets and hand held sets. Repeater station is used as an amplifier station for long distance communication. Radio sets which are installed in the office places like project offices and customer service centers are called fix sets. Radio sets are installed in vehicles which works {{in the field are}} called mobile sets. There were 34 numbers of repeaters, 1000 fixed and mobile sets, 814 hand held sets and 13 other radio equipment at the end of 2010. Presently, this network is not used by most of the uses because of its drawbacks and alternatives. Lots of breakdowns are being reported. It can be a because of an equipment fault, a DC supply fault, a battery fault or an antenna fault. There are several reasons for these breakdowns such as carelessness of uses, oldness of equipment, less knowledge of the network, coverage issues, lightning and corrosion issues. Mobile telephones are widely used as a communication medium in field activities without using existing VHF/UHF network. For the year 2010, around 18. 5 million Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) have been expended by the CEB as the operational and maintenance (O&M) cost of VHF and UHF network. When considering the economic benefits of using a mobile operator as an alternative solution to maintain this VHF and UHF network, it is profitable. But non economical benefits of VHF and UHF networks such as broadcast facility, security and fast response are very critical in the power system. So maintaining this network for optimum use is essential. As a first step, all existing drawbacks have to be avoided. There should be a proper maintenance plan and all users have to be educated about the system and its usefulness. Also the network planning system has to be optimized. A network expansion model was derived for future expansions of the network. When this network expansion is used, most of parameters which have to be considered when planning the network can be optimized. They are frequency band, antenna type, transmission power, antenna location and antenna height. Parameters which calculated from this model can be verified using software tools. In addition to that in all installation works, good practices have to be followed to reduce losses and improve the availability of the network. When there is a properly maintain and widely covered network, the communication media within the company will so powerful than before. Then power system reliability will be improved. Finally this will improve the quality of the Sri Lankan power system. However, it is to be studied about the VHF and UHF communication systems before starting this challenging business...|$|E
