5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted {{about the man}} due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese <b>man</b> <b>was</b> in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to blow up a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E

50|$|The law {{holds for}} the A and E {{proposition}}s of the Aristotelian square of opposition. For example, the A proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' and the E proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' cannot both be true {{at the same}} time, since {{no one can be}} honest and not honest at the same time. But both can be false, if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, and some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not. For if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest, the proposition 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false. And if some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest, the proposition 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest' is false also.|$|R
50|$|A {{universal}} affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' and {{a universal}} negative proposition {{having the same}} subject and predicate, such as, 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition ("Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way ("Some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not white") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true (for example, both, 'Every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' and 'No <b>man</b> <b>is</b> honest,' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not honest,' and, 'Some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> honest,' are both true.|$|R

5|$|About 80% of Manila's 7 million {{residents}} lost power {{due to the}} storm. Low-lying areas of Manila were underwater as strong winds blew away roofs of shacks and uprooted trees. Throughout the city, four deaths happened. One <b>man</b> <b>was</b> electrocuted while another <b>man</b> <b>was</b> crushed by debris. Fifty people were confirmed to have died and 2,089 dwellings were damaged in nearby Bataan after storm surge crashed into the area. Most of the casualties in Bataan were due to drownings; the city was also the hardest hit by the storm. Throughout the area near Bataan, 10 villages were destroyed. In Pantalan Luma, all but four of the town's 400 huts were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|After the match, one <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{arrested for}} {{wearing a black}} armband. During Zimbabwe's next group stage match against India, nearly 200 spectators wore black armbands, to support the protest.|$|E
5000|$|Universal {{statements}} <b>are</b> contraries: 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' and 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just' {{cannot be}} true together, although {{one may be}} true and the other false, and also both may be false (if at least one <b>man</b> <b>is</b> just, {{and at least one}} <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not just).|$|R
50|$|In track events, SP2 {{women in}} H2 have faster laptimes than SP1 men in H1. Factoring {{is used in}} cycling to allow {{multiple}} classes and genders to compete against each other. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H2 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 77.22% and H2 women are 67.73%. When H3 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> set at 100%, H2 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 70.40% and H2 women are 69.64%. When H4 and H5 women are set at 100%, H2 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 88.04% and H2 women are 77.22%. UCI factoring for 2014 with H4 and H5 men as 100% on the factoring. Against this factoring, H1 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 56.64% and H1 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 49.68%. When H3 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> set at 100%, H1 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 58.24% and H1 women are 51.08%. When H4 and H5 women are set at 100%, H1 <b>men</b> <b>are</b> 64.58% and H1 women are 56.64%.|$|R
50|$|Another logical {{opposition}} {{implied by}} this, though not mentioned explicitly by Aristotle, is 'alternation' (alternatio), consisting of 'subalternation' and 'superalternation'. Alternation is a relation between a particular statement and a universal {{statement of the}} same quality such that the particular is implied by the other. The particular is the subaltern of the universal, which is the particular's superaltern. For example, if 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true, its contrary 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is false. Therefore the contradictory 'some <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' is true. Similarly the universal 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white' implies the particular 'not every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'.|$|R

5|$|Although Richard tracked {{north of}} Honduras, strong winds along the {{coastline}} downed trees and power lines. Mudslides stranded up to 15,000 people across 40 different towns. The island of Roatán received {{a gust of}} 58mph (93km/h). Farther north and west in Belize, the Belize Zoo and Tropical Education Center—popular attractions for tourists—were heavily damaged. About 80% of the grapefruit and nearly 25% of the orange crop were lost there. Two deaths were observed: one <b>man</b> <b>was</b> killed when his boat capsized in rough seas, while a second <b>man</b> <b>was</b> mauled to death by a jaguar that escaped after a tree mangled its cage. The damage cost topped $80 million.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow <b>Man</b> <b>was</b> deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E

60|$|But, I say, what is {{the reason}} some so prize what others so despise, since they both stand in need of the same grace and mercy of God in Christ? Why, the one sees, and the other sees nothing, of this woeful miserable state. And thus have I showed you the {{necessity}} of a broken heart. 1. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> dead, and must <b>be</b> quickened. 2. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a fool, and must be made wise. 3. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> proud, and must <b>be</b> humbled. 4. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> self-willed, and must <b>be</b> broken. 5. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> fearless, and must be made to consider. 6. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a false believer, and must <b>be</b> rectified. 7. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> a lover of sin, and must be weaned from it. 8. <b>Man</b> <b>is</b> wild, and must <b>be</b> tamed. 9. <b>Man</b> disrelishes the things of God, and can take no savour in them, until his heart is broken.|$|R

50|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 21 September 1995, five local <b>men</b> <b>were</b> arrested on {{suspicion}} of murder in co-ordinated early morning raids.

5000|$|... 'Contrary' (medieval: contrariae) statements, {{are such}} that both cannot {{at the same time}} be true. Examples of these are the {{universal}} affirmative 'every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white', and the universal negative 'no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white'. These cannot be true at the same time. However, these are not contradictories because both of them may be false. For example, it is false that every <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since some <b>men</b> <b>are</b> not white. Yet it is also false that no <b>man</b> <b>is</b> white, since there <b>are</b> some white <b>men.</b>|$|R

5|$|Field {{punishment}} (FP) {{had replaced}} flogging (abolished {{at home in}} 1868 and on active service in 1881, although still used in military prisons until 1907). FP No.1 (in which the <b>man</b> <b>was</b> shackled to fixed object, e.g. a large wheel) was awarded to 60,210 cases, equivalent to one man in 50 (although in practice there were many repeat offenders). FP No.1 could be very unpleasant depending on the weather, was abhorred by some as barbaric, and in some units was ritualised (e.g. by locking {{a man in a}} shed and throwing the handcuffs in with him); there were also cases of Australian troops releasing British troops whom they found tied up, although in other units it was regarded as a necessary sanction for serious offences. FP No.2 meant that a <b>man</b> <b>was</b> shackled but not fixed in place.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} of 3 May, the niece {{of the woman who}} lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired <b>man</b> <b>was</b> seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired <b>man</b> <b>was</b> seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.|$|E
