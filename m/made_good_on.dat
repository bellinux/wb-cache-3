5|$|The Great Depression and the {{election}} of Democratic party candidates in 1932 ended widespread national support for Prohibition. Franklin D. Roosevelt, who included repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment as a major issue of his presidential campaign in 1932, <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> his promise to American voters. On December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and ended nationwide Prohibition. However, Indiana's legislature continued to regulate alcohol within the state through allocation of state liquor licenses and prohibition of sales on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Villani {{was sent}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission in 1329, {{this time to}} Bologna to meet Cardinal Bertrand de Pouget. From 1330 to 1331 he superintended the making of Andrea Pisano's bronze doors for the Baptistry. At the same time, he served as the consul for his guild of the Arte di Calimala and watched over the raising of the campanile of the Badìa. He was also sent with others as a hostage to Ferrara, to ensure that Florence <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> a debt; he resided there for some months in 1341.|$|E
5|$|Jameson did {{not regard}} this {{ambiguity}} as a proper answer, and impatiently waited for further {{word from the}} king. After standing by for the specified two days and receiving nothing, he correctly concluded that Lobengula was stalling him, and using the extra time {{to distance himself from}} his former capital. Jameson therefore <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> his pledge, and called for volunteers; he assembled a host of about 470 men, mixed together from the Mashonaland Mounted Police, the Bechuanaland Border Police, and Raaff's Rangers, an independent unit led by the eponymous Commandant Piet Raaff. This force was placed under Forbes's command, with three Maxim guns attached. Jameson told the major to scout the area between Shiloh and Inyati for spoor, with the ultimate objective of capturing Lobengula, and sent him out just before sunset on 14 November 1893.|$|E

5|$|While having name recognition, McGovern {{had little}} funding or staff, {{although}} he did garner critical funding from some celebrities and statesmen. He won a surprise third-place showing in the Iowa caucuses amidst a crowded field of candidates, but finished fifth in the New Hampshire primary. He announced he would drop out unless he finished first or second in the Massachusetts primary, {{and when he came}} in third behind his former campaign manager Gary Hart and former Vice President Walter Mondale, he <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> his promise. He later endorsed Mondale, the eventual Democratic nominee. McGovern hosted Saturday Night Live on April 14, 1984.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} Rudd Concession on mining rights from King Lobengula of Matabeleland on 30 October 1888, Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company were granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria in October 1889. Under this charter, the Company was {{empowered}} {{to trade with}} indigenous rulers, form banks, own and manage land, and raise and run a police force. In return for these rights, the British South Africa Company would administer and develop any territory it acquired, while respecting laws enacted by extant African rulers, and upholding free trade within its borders. Though the Company <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> most of these pledges, the assent of Lobengula and other native leaders, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Lobengula reacted by making war on the new arrivals, their Tswana allies and the local Mashona people in 1893. The resulting conflict ended with Lobengula's torching of his own capital at Bulawayo, his death from smallpox in early 1894, and the subsequent submission of his izinDuna (advisors) to the Company. Violent rebellion to the north-east, in neighbouring Mashonaland, was forcibly put down by the Company during 1897.|$|E
5|$|In December 1979, Roberts <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> his threats when he, {{along with}} the other top world {{championship}} riders, released a letter to the press announcing their intention to break away from the FIM and create a rival race series called the World Series. When Roberts first arrived on the Grand Prix scene, motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as $200, at venues such as Imatra in Finland that featured railroad crossings and hay bales wrapped around telephone poles. In 1956, the reigning 500cc world champion, Geoff Duke and thirteen other riders were given six-month suspensions for merely threatening to strike. Roberts adopted a confrontational, sometimes belligerent stance with race promoters, challenging the previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of the day were accustomed to receiving. Although the competing series failed to take off due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders' demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.|$|E

5|$|This was {{a blow to}} the {{short-range}} committee, who had <b>made</b> <b>good</b> progress <b>on</b> the specification. Despite being technically superior, FACT had {{not been}} created with portability in mind or through manufacturer and user consensus. It also lacked a demonstrable implementation, allowing supporters of a FLOW-MATIC-based COBOL to overturn the resolution. RCA representative Howard Bromberg also blocked FACT, so that RCA's work on a COBOL implementation would not go to waste.|$|R

25|$|Coal miners in {{southern}} Indiana <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> their threats and {{joined in a}} national strike.

As the militia arrived to resolve the situation, and second large strike broke out in Hammond, as railroad workers seized control of an important railroad hub in northern Indiana, effectively shutting down {{a large part of the}} state's exporting via Lake Michigan. Matthews called up additional militia and dispatched them to break up the second strike.|$|E
25|$|Though the Company <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> {{most of the}} pledges it {{had made}} to local leaders in Matabeleland, the assent of Lobengula and other less {{prominent}} figures, particularly regarding mining rights, was often evaded, misrepresented or simply ignored. Company officials also demanded that Lobengula cease the habitual raids on Mashona villages by Matabele impis (regiments). Enraged by what he perceived as slights against his authority, Lobengula made war on Mashonaland in 1893. Matabele warriors began the wholesale slaughter of Mashonas near Fort Victoria in July that year. The Company organised an indaba (tribal conference) to try to end the conflict, but this failed. The First Matabele War had begun.|$|E
25|$|Namath and the Jets <b>made</b> <b>good</b> <b>on</b> his {{guarantee}} as {{they held}} the Colts scoreless {{until late in the}} fourth quarter. The Jets won, 16–7, in what {{is considered one of the}} greatest upsets in American sports history. With the win, the AFL finally achieved parity with the NFL and legitimized the merger of the two leagues. That notion was reinforced one year later in Super Bowl IV, when the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs upset the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings, 23–7, in the last championship game to be played between the two leagues. The Vikings, favored by 12½ points, were held to just 67 rushing yards.|$|E
