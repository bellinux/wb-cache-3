5|$|Beryllium mirrors are of {{particular}} interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a honeycomb support structure, are used, for example, in meteorological satellites where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in optical guidance systems and in fire-control systems, e.g. in the German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 main battle tanks. In these systems, very rapid movement of the <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> coated with hard electroless nickel plating which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to cryogenic operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.|$|E
5|$|Girl in Mirror (sometimes Girl in the <b>Mirror)</b> <b>is</b> a 1964 porcelain-enamel-on-steel pop art {{painting}} by Roy Lichtenstein {{that is considered}} to exist in between eight and ten editions. One edition {{was part of a}} $14 million 2012 lawsuit regarding a 2009 sale, while another sold in 2010 for $4.9 million. Although it uses Ben-Day dots like many other Lichtenstein works, it was inspired by the New York City Subway rather than directly from a panel of a romance comics work.|$|E
5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the <b>mirror,</b> <b>is</b> dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface reflected beam is inverted.|$|E
50|$|At Teotihuacan {{the largest}} <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> worn on the back, <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> also {{frequently}} worn on belts. Mirrors worn {{as a part}} of costume frequently had cloth or feather tassels attached. These costume <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> forerunners of the Aztec tezcacuitlapilli, which <b>was</b> a <b>mirror</b> worn on {{the lower part of the}} back. A number of <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> excavated from the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at Teotihuacan. Fifteen individuals were interred with back mirrors placed at the small of the back in Burial 190 alone. <b>Mirrors</b> <b>were</b> additionally worn upon the chest and the representation of chest mirrors upon ceramic figurines is very common. Additionally, circular <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> frequently worn as part of a headdress, usually occupying a central position.|$|R

5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> made of gold-plated beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking <b>Mirror</b> <b>is</b> a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{video game}} originally released on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 1997. It was re-released on Microsoft Windows, OS X and iOS as a remastered edition in 2010 and on Android in 2012.

The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, a young American who is an eyewitness to the kidnapping of his girlfriend Nicole Collard.|$|E
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE sub-contract to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E

50|$|Far {{from being}} a {{personal}} cosmetic accessory, <b>mirrors</b> in Mesoamerica <b>were</b> divinatory aids and also formed a part of elite status costume. <b>Mirrors</b> <b>were</b> viewed as metaphors for sacred caves and as conduits for supernatural forces; they were associated with fiery hearths and pools of water because of their bright surfaces. <b>Mirrors</b> <b>were</b> also {{closely associated with the}} sun. <b>Mirrors</b> <b>were</b> often used in pre-Columbian Mexico to reveal a person's destiny through divination. Among the Maya of the Classic period <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> a means of communication with otherworld entities, as depicted in scenes painted on ceramic vessels. Otherworld <b>mirrors</b> <b>were</b> believed to be the far side of earthly <b>mirrors,</b> and <b>were</b> owned and used by deities and other supernatural beings.

5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking <b>Mirror</b> <b>is</b> a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
5|$|The Twyman–Green {{interferometer}}, {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson interferometer widely used to test optical components. The basic characteristics distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green interferometer using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path Interferometer, or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green interferometer set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
5|$|To Heart 2 {{was first}} {{released}} as an all-ages {{title for the}} PlayStation 2 on December 28, 2004 in three versions: a limited edition, a deluxe edition, and a regular edition. The limited edition release contains the game itself, an original soundtrack disc, a visual concept collection, a calendar, and a special casing; the deluxe edition contains the extras included in the limited edition and a version of To Heart playable on the PS2; the regular edition does not contain the aforementioned extras. The original PS2 version was followed by an adult version entitled To Heart 2 X Rated (stylized as ToHeart2 XRATED). It was first released on December 9, 2005 for Microsoft Windows PCs as a limited edition, and was subsequently followed by a regular edition release on December 23, 2005. X Rated is the fifth title in the Leaf Visual Novel Series; it contains additional scenarios and introduces a new heroine named Sasara Kusugawa. Its source code was released by Aquaplus under the GNU General Public License on December 22, 2005 along with the source code for Arurū to Asobo!!, Tears to Tiara, and Kusari. This decision was made due to the inclusion of Xvid derived code; Xvid being distributed under the same license. The source code for all four games is distributed upon request in CD-R format.

25|$|Optical {{cavities}} {{can also}} be used as multipass optical delay lines, folding a light beam so that a long path-length may be achieved in a small space. A plane-parallel cavity with flat mirrors produces a flat zigzag light path, but as discussed above, these designs are very sensitive to mechanical disturbances and walk-off. When curved mirrors are used in a nearly confocal configuration, the beam travels on a circular zigzag path. The latter is called a Herriott-type delay line. A fixed insertion <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> placed off-axis near one of the curved mirrors, and a mobile pickup <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> similarly placed near the other curved mirror. A flat linear stage with one pickup <b>mirror</b> <b>is</b> used in case of flat mirrors and a rotational stage with two mirrors is used for the Herriott-type delay line.|$|E
