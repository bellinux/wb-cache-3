Sarace and {{collaborators}} at Bell Labs {{replaced the}} aluminum gate with an electrode made of vacuum-evaporated amorphous silicon and succeeded in building working self-aligned gate MOS transistors. However, the process, as described, {{was only a}} proof of principle, suitable only for the fabrication of discrete transistors and not for integrated circuits; and was not pursued any further by its investigators. [...] In 1968 the MOS industry was prevalently using aluminum gate transistors with high-threshold voltage and desired to have a low threshold voltage MOS process {{in order to increase}} the speed and reduce the power dissipation of MOS integrated circuits. Low threshold voltage transistors with aluminum gate demanded the use of 100 silicon orientation, which however produced too low a threshold voltage for the <b>parasitic</b> <b>MOS</b> <b>transistors</b> (the MOS transistors created when aluminum over the field oxide would bridge two junctions). To increase the parasitic threshold voltage beyond the supply voltage, it was necessary to increase the N-type doping level in selected regions under the field oxide, and this was initially accomplished {{with the use of a}} so-called channel-stopper mask, and later with ion implantation.|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend for}} space {{application}} systems is towards fully integrated systems-on-a-chip. To facilitate this drive, high-voltage transistors must reside {{on the same}} substrate as low-voltage transistors. These systems must also be radiation tolerant, particularly for space missions such as the Europa Lander and Titan Explorer. SOI CMOS technology offers high levels of radiation hardness. As a result, a high-voltage lateral MOSFET has been developed in a partially-depleted (PD) SOI technology. Utilizing high voltages causes a <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistor</b> to have non-negligible effects on a circuit. Several circuit architectures {{have been used to}} compensate for the radiation induced threshold voltage shift of the <b>parasitic</b> back-channel <b>transistor.</b> However, a new architecture for high-voltage systems must be employed to bias the substrate to voltage levels insuring all <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistors</b> remain off.

40|$|Total Ionizing Dose and Random Dopant Fluctuation {{simulations}} in 45 nm Partially Depleted Silicon-on-Insulator nMOSFETs are presented.

The importance of the bottom corner <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistor</b> to the Total Ionizing Dose response is shown {{with the use of}} ultra shallow junctions. Simulation of irradiation in two-dimensional slices of the device reveal {{that the majority of the}} charge is trapped around the silicon film and at the bottom of the Buried OXide in the case of a positive gate bias. Random Dopant Fluctuations are examined using the Sano and the Impedance Field Method. The simulation results of the two methods are in good agreement. Dopant fluctuations do not produce significant response variation pre-irradiation, but they affect post-irradiation results introducing statistical deviations and aggravating Total Ionizing Dose effects.

5000|$|It {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1 that the source {{metallization}} connects both the N+ and P+ implantations, although the operating principle of the MOSFET only requires the source to be connected to the N+ zone. However, if it were, this would result in a floating P zone between the N-doped source and drain, which is equivalent to a NPN transistor with a non-connected base. Under certain conditions (under high drain current, when the on-state drain to source voltage is in the order of some volts), this <b>parasitic</b> NPN <b>transistor</b> would be triggered, making the MOSFET uncontrollable. The connection of the P implantation to the source metallization shorts the base of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistor</b> to its emitter (the source of the MOSFET) and thus prevents spurious latching.|$|R

40|$|A new silicon {{controlled}} rectifier {{low voltage}} triggered (SCR-LVT), to be adopted as protection structure against electrostatic discharge (ESD) events, has been developed and characterized. A high holding voltage has been obtained thanks to the insertion of two <b>parasitic</b> bipolar <b>transistors,</b> achieved adding a n-buried region to a conventional SCR structure. These two <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistors</b> partially destroy the loop feedback gain of the two main npn and pnp BJTs, resulting in an increase of the sustaining (holding) voltage during the ESD event. A strong dependence of the holding voltage with the ESD pulse width has also been observed, caused by self-heating effects. 2 D device simulations (DESSIS Synopsys) have been performed obtaining results that perfectly fit the measurements over a wide temperature range (25 degC- 125 degC). Using device simulation results, {{the factors that influence}} the holding voltage, in terms of temperature dependence, but also in the behavior of the parasitic BJTs, are explained.

40|$|Abstract — We {{characterize}} the TID resilience and annealing response of high-density SRAMs, fabricated in 90 nm commercial processes. Results demonstrate intrinsic SRAM hardness at 300 krad(Si), but also reveal several {{orders of magnitude}} increase in leakage current at 1 Mrad(Si) of exposure, with recorded critical functionality failures. However, the technology is shown to be very responsive to temperature treatments as all chips recover to pre-rad leakage levels after 5 hours at 150 o C with fully regained functionality. Finally, consecutive exposure/anneal cycles reveal a drastic improvement in TID resilience as SRAMs that did undergo at least one postrad anneal stayed fully functional up to the strategic TID level of 2 Mrad(Si) once re-exposed. The gained resilience is attributed to negative interface trapped charge build-up along the STI walls: it progressively turns OFF the channel of <b>parasitic</b> <b>transistors</b> responsible for TID-induced leakage paths creation.

40|$|N-channel MOSFETs {{can suffer}} from <b>parasitic</b> edge <b>transistor</b> effects, unless several extra {{processing}} and masking steps are used. These edge devices increase the off-state current and degrade subthreshold {{slope of the}} N-MOSFETs. <b>Parasitic</b> edge <b>transistors</b> of oxide trench isolated N-MOSFETs and Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) N-MOSFETs, fabricated using Selective Epitaxial Growth/Epitaxial Lateral Overgrowth (SEG/ELO) technology, are caused by the boron out-diffusion during high temperature process steps. Employing a simple ammonia nitridation of the field oxide before the epitaxial growth step, boron out-diffusion into the surrounding oxide was suppressed. The <b>parasitic</b> edge <b>transistors</b> in both oxide trench isolated SEG N-MOSFETs and ELO-SOI N-MOSFETs were eliminated. ^ A unique and simple method is demonstrated for characterizing the electrical impact of a single stacking fault on Fully Depleted Thin-Film SOI MOSFETs. SOI islands are created using the SEG/ELO technology. The stacking faults are observed using a optical Nomarski microscope. Both P and N-MOSFETs, {{with the presence of}} a single stacking fault entirely in the channel region, are measured. The influence of a stacking fault on device I-V characteristics is determined and compared to that of nearby identical devices without stacking faults. It is found that the threshold voltage increased and saturation current decreased. MOSFETs with a stacking fault only in the drain edge under the gate are found to have high subthreshold leakages under high drain voltage bias. P-MOSFETs, with a stacking fault crossing the gate and penetrating into the source and drain, have high subthreshold leakage currents. Various physical models are proposed to bring physical insights to the observed phenomena. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel silicon RF {{vertical}} double-diffusion metal-oxide-semiconductor {{field effect}} transistor (VD-MOSFET) structure with a dummy-gate incorporated between the active gates is proposed. The dummy-gate functions as a field plate to minimize the drain-to-gate feedback capacitance C-rss and also to raise the device breakdown voltage. Therefore, for the same blocking voltage rating, the dummy-gate structure allows the MOSFET to have a shorter channel and a larger gate to drain overlap area to minimize the on-state resistance. Hence, the transconductance gain G(m) can be improved, leading to a higher RF performance for the power device. Experimental results show that with the dummy-gate a 51 % lower on the feedback capacitance, a 21 % lower on the on-state resistance, a 100 % increase in output resistance and a higher and linear transconductance are achieved.
