Our results, using long-horizon data of Group of Seven (G- 7) economies, supports causality in <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> as running from bank lending to bank deposits, a result that is predicted by the post-Keynesian <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> endogeneity (bank-credit-driven) theory.

A new evidence of positive relationship between endogenous <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> and aggregate bank stock return is statistically significant on this hitherto unexplored topic.

Competing theories exist on how change in the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> affects stock prices.

The Granger causality model is also employed, and results show that in Malaysia <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> does not Granger cause economic growth. Economic growth does Granger cause inflation in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Causality runs from economic growth to <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> only in Malaysia.

50|$|The <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> {{function}} for {{this situation is}} plotted on the same graph as the liquidity preference function. The <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> {{is determined by the}} central bank decisions and willingness of commercial banks to loan money.

Thus the <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> function is represented as a vertical line - <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> is a constant, independent of the interest rate, GDP, and other factors. Mathematically, the LM curve is defined by the equation , where the <b>supply</b> of <b>money</b> is represented as the real amount M/P (as opposed to the nominal amount M), with P representing the price level, and L being the real demand for money, which is some function of the interest rate i and the level Y of real income.

40|$|Money is {{the blood}} of modern free-enterprise economies. Correspondently, the {{quantity}} and velocity of money circulated in such an economy would determine its health. Expressed differently, the levels of economic activities, production and <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in an economy are interrelated. The central issue then is, does the quantity of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> determine the levels of economic activities and production? Or, on the contraly, are economic activities and production the variables that actually determine the level of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in an economy? Indeed the endogeneity/exogeneity of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> is still an unsettled issue. While nobody can still say for sure whether the <b>supply</b> of <b>money</b> is endogenously or exogenously determined, this issue is crucial for a proper formulation of macroeconomic theory and policy. Since, as previously noted, the economic health of a countv would depend heavily on its <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> Having said this, {{if we were to}} obtain some valuable insights into efective and efficient management of an economy, this issue needs to be examined and analyzed rigorously. In much of the mainstream macroeconomic literature <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> is assumed to be exogenously determined by the central bank. This view is put forward by a group of economists known as the Monetarists based on the argument that <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> equals the <b>money</b> multiplier times the monetaly base. Since the central bank can change this base, it can control the <b>supply</b> of <b>money</b> in the economy. On {{the other side of the}} debate, another group of economists known as Post Keynesian Economists maintain that <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> is endogeneity, in nature. Whereas, there are a number of different views of the concept of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> endogeneity, the core argument of this school of monetary economic thought is that bank lending creates deposits and hence <b>money</b> <b>supply.</b> Given such opposing views on exogeneity/endogeneity of <b>money</b> <b>supply,</b> the central issue at this juncture is: does loan cause <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> or does <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> cause loan? Accordingly, our study will examine this issue by using cointegration test and vector error correction model developed by Johansen. The results of this study have enabled us to claim convincingly that lending is an essential (endogenous) determinant of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> in Malaysia. Findings of the study clearly corroborates Horizontalist view of <b>money</b> <b>supply</b> endogeneity that in Malaysia, loan causes monetary aggregates (i. e.,M 0, M 1, M 2, and M 3) ...|$|R
