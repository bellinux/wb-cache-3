40|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence that overland flow from land contributes to pollution of surface water. No convenient method exists to identify fields that generate overland flow. Therefore the WT {{model has been}} developed to predict overland flow from any small parcel of land. Water table tubes and flow meters were installed in three sites in Wexford and Carlow. The water table data, along with rainfall and evaporation data, were entered into the WT model to calculate overland flow and other parameters over a 7 -month period. Additional measurements of water table level were taken using <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> {{with a view to}} reducing field costs. All three sites had layers of sand in the sub-soil. It is likely that the sand allowed water to flow under the soil and contributed to overland flow. Values from the WT model matched the field measurements of water table closely and predicted overland flow with reasonable accuracy. One pipe in each field was identified which could indicate when the field was sufficiently dry for spreading slurry. The <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> recorded water table accurately. However, the lack of synchronisation of this data, with weather data, reduced slightly the precision of the model. The WT model can identify fields prone to overland flow and show when a field is sufficiently dry to accept slurry. Proposed economies promise to reduce the cost of investigation.

40|$|PCBs – {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} – rank amongst the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. Consumers mainly ingest these substances from milk, meat, eggs and fish. For {{the first time the}} European Commission has suggested <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> in food for non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs) that are intended to reduce consumer exposure to PCBs. BfR was asked to assess the EU proposal for a <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> for PCBs from the angle of consumer health protection. BfR welcomes the fact that for the majority of PCBs, the ndl-PCBs, <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> are to be laid down across Europe. This would also lead to a replacement of the <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> for PCBs in the national contaminants ordinance which are deemed to be too high. According to the Institute, the <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> proposed still do not afford the population sufficient protection. Furthermore, some foods of animal origin with above-average levels of contamination, like wild game and fish liver are not taken into account in the EU provisions. The EU proposal envisages using the sum of 6 ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs), which account for around half of the PCB contamination in food, {{for the establishment of a}} <b>maximum</b> <b>level.</b> BfR has no objections to this procedure but is of the opinion that, with the <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> proposed by the EU, it is still the case that scarcely any foods with elevated PCB levels will be objected to. The reason: because of the correlation between dl-PCBs and ndl-PCBs in Germany, the proposed EU <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> would only then take effect after the already existing EU <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> for dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs (WHO-TEQs) had been exceeded. In the opinion of BfR, the WHO-TEQs already protect the population in Germany from elevated PCB exposure more effectively than the EU <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> proposed for Σ 6 PCBs could...|$|R

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) {{are some}} of the most {{dangerous}} environmental toxins. They were used in plasticizers, varnishes, transformers, or as hydraulic liquid. Their production and use has since been banned. Because of their longevity they still occur in the environment and are to be found in particular in fat-containing food of animal origin like milk, meat, eggs and fish. The European Commission is currently in the process of drawing up <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> provisions for most PCBs, i. e. the so-called non-dioxin-like PCBs (ndl-PCBs). It envisages using as their representative the sum of six selected ndl-PCBs (Σ 6 PCBs) that frequently occur in food. BfR welcomes the fact that in the new proposal the <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> have been reduced for most foods and that fish liver and food for babies and infants has been included in the new proposal. One exception to this positive assessment is, however, the new <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> for chicken eggs of 75 nanogram (ng) Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat which, in contrast to the first proposal of 50 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat, has been set at an incomprehensibly high <b>level.</b> The <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> for eggs should be oriented towards the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> for poultry meat where 30 ng Σ 6 PCBs per gram fat was established as the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> and this is more than 50 % lower, as the PCB contaminations in the fat portion of eggs and poultry meat are roughly the same. * In the opinion of BfR the proposed <b>maximum</b> <b>levels</b> for Σ 6 PCBs in food should, however, be lowered further. *After the preparation of this Opinion, this concern of BfR was presented to the European Commission (DG SANCO) with the consequence that the proposal for the <b>maximum</b> <b>level</b> for chicken eggs was reduced to 50 ng/g fat for Σ 6 PCB...|$|R
