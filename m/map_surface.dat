50|$|John Call Cook, PhD (April 7, 1918 - October 12, 2012) was an American {{geophysicist}} {{who played}} a crucial role in establishing the field of ground-penetrating radar and is generally regarded as contributing the fundamental research to develop the field.

50|$|Rectangular {{coordinates}} in {{the plane}} can be used intuitively with respect to one's current location, {{in which case the}} x-axis will point to the local north. More formally, such coordinates can be obtained from three-dimensional coordinates using the artifice of a map projection. It is not possible to map the curved surface of the Earth onto a flat <b>map</b> <b>surface</b> without deformation. The compromise most often chosen—called a conformal projection—preserves angles and length ratios, so that small circles are mapped as small circles and small squares as squares.|$|E

But neither game did well, with increased realism in the form of detailed penetration tables in Tobruk and rigid rules for modern Soviet doctrine forced on the players of Firefight making games once again less playable. Tobruk also suffered from an unattractive <b>map</b> <b>surface</b> which depicted basically flat terrain.|$|E

This, side by side with the superior typography of the hand-drawn type in the Atlante Internazionale, the lettering, gave the maps a very attractive appearance. The seventh edition was issued 1955/56, the last and eighth edition in 1968: an atlas of 50 x 32 centimetres with 94 tables, in total 173 pages of cartographic material, and an index, covering 250,000 geographical names; the <b>map</b> <b>surface</b> consisted of about 18 square metres!

5000|$|VERITAS {{would produce}} global, high {{resolution}} topography and imaging of Venus' surface and produce the first maps of deformation and global surface composition, thermal emissivity, and gravity field. [...] It would also {{attempt to determine}} if Venus hosted ancient aqueous environments. Also, current data are highly suggestive of recent and active volcanism and this mission could determine if current volcanism is limited to mantle plume heads or is more widespread. High resolution imagery would be obtained by using an X band radar configured as a single pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coupled with a multispectral near-infrared (NIR) emissivity mapping capability. VERITAS would <b>map</b> <b>surface</b> topography with a spatial resolution of 250 m and 5 m vertical accuracy, and generate radar imagery with 30 m spatial resolution.|$|E
50|$|Subaqueous volcanoes can be {{compared}} to subaerial volcanoes which are formed and erupt on land surface, or under the air. The major differences of volcanic eruptions are due to the effects of pressure, heat capacity or conductivity of water, the presence of steam and water rheology. The thermal conductivity of water is about 20 times that of air and steam has a thermal conductivity nearly 50 times that of water.Subaqueous volcanoes are most commonly formed in oceans, but can also form in lakes, rivers and subglacial lakes. In improving our understanding of subaqueous volcanoes, {{it is important to consider}} the differences between the characteristics of modern and ancient approaches to the study. Modern studies offer fresh and unaltered observances, can see and <b>map</b> <b>surface</b> features and the water depth is known in areas that allow observation. Ancient studies have had stratigraphic exposure to sections, are easier to work on, have more and better exposures and have an existing relationship to resources.|$|E
