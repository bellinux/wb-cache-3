5|$|The {{funds from}} the robbery were {{originally}} kept {{at the house of}} Stalin's friends in Tiflis, Mikha and Maro Bochoridze. The money was sewn into a <b>mattress</b> so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion. The <b>mattress</b> was moved to another safe house, then later put on the director's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory, possibly because Stalin had worked there. Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory. The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof.|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} natural fibre (biomaterial) pocket spring <b>mattresses</b> are shown to emit marginally less greenhouse gasses (GHG) than foam (petrochemical) pocket spring <b>mattresses.</b> However, when {{end of life}} scenarios are considered, the results suggest much larger GHG emission reductions for natural fibre than foam <b>mattresses.</b> Refurbishing natural fibre <b>mattresses</b> and reusing the springs, coupled with recycling the waste components, can reduce GHG emissions by 90 % compared to sending the <b>mattresses</b> to landfill. Incinerating <b>mattresses</b> via {{combined heat and power}} plants for electricity production and converting the waste textiles to ethanol are also shown to reduce GHG emissions, though to a lesser extent than refurbishment and recycling. <b>Mattresses</b> are normally disposed of via landfill however designing for reuse and recycling, coupled with supportive policy and legislation, may encourage more natural fibre <b>mattresses</b> and recycling. Such changes could save between 210 and 2092 thousand tCO 2 -eq in the European Union annually...|$|R

The pole vault has been an Olympic event since 1896 for men, but it was over 100 years later that the first women's world championship competition was held at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships.

50|$|Air <b>mattresses</b> use one or {{more air}} {{chambers}} instead of springs to provide support. Quality and price can range from inexpensive ones used occasionally for camping, to high-end luxury beds. Air <b>mattresses</b> designed for typical bedroom use cost {{about the same as}} inner-spring <b>mattresses</b> with comparable features. Air bladder construction varies from a simple polyethylene bag to internally baffled, multiple chambers of latex (vulcanized rubber) or vinyl with bonded cotton exteriors. <b>Mattresses</b> may have a layer of foam above the air chambers for added cushioning, and may be enclosed in a cover. Some such beds are termed soft-sided air beds.|$|R

25|$|A 2015 Cochrane review {{found that}} people who lay on high {{specification}} or high density foam <b>mattresses</b> were 60% less likely to develop new pressure ulcers compared to regular foam <b>mattresses.</b> Sheepskin overlays on top of <b>mattresses</b> were also found to prevent new pressure ulcer formation. There is unclear research on the effectiveness of alternating pressure <b>mattresses.</b> Pressure-redistributive <b>mattresses</b> are used to reduce high values of pressure on prominent or bony areas of the body. There are several important terms used to describe how these support surfaces work. These terms were standardized through the Support Surface Standards Initiative of the NPUAP. Many support surfaces redistribute pressure by immersing and/or enveloping the body into the surface. Some support surfaces, including antidecubitus <b>mattresses</b> and cushions, contain multiple air chambers that are alternately pumped. Methods to standardize the products and evaluate the efficacy of these products have only been developed in recent years through the work of the S3I within NPUAP. For individuals with paralysis, pressure shifting on a regular basis and using a wheelchair cushion featuring pressure relief components can help prevent pressure wounds.|$|R
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable <b>mattress,</b> removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E

She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her <b>mattress,</b> and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E
