5|$|From the outset, the cyclone's {{motion was}} altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico. Initially, deep {{convection}} fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico. At 1200UTC on August10, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle, {{as the storm}} curved southward. Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment, although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat. The storm shifted once again onto a west-northwest course on August11, <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> slowly towards the coast.|$|E

The date of Zuikakus {{installation}} is unknown, but both ships received a second Type 21 radar in a retractable installation adjacent to the flight deck after October. Before June 1944, a Type 13 air-search radar was installed on the light tripod mast abaft the island. The Shōkaku-class carriers were also fitted with a Type 91 hydrophone in the bow that was only useful when anchored or <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> slowly.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm George {{originated}} on September27 from {{a strong}} tropical wave {{northeast of the}} Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda. A large system, it moved to the northwest and later west-northwest. George began strengthening on September30 as it decreased its forward speed. The next day, while remaining nearly stationary south of Bermuda, a nearby ship reported that George had reached hurricane status. It continued <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> slowly, passing only 100mi (160km) south of Bermuda. The island experienced winds of 30 to 40mph (40 to 65km/h). Aside from rainbands, little impact was reported on Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>very</b> little, the {{depression}} was disorganized due to continued shear, leaving {{the center of}} circulation west of the convective activity. By later in the morning hours of May27, the system began to show overall signs of organization, primarily related to a burst of convection in the eastern semicircle. At the same time, the center of circulation either reformed or began to move farther north, possibly north-northeast. Embedded within the steering currents of a ridge, most forecasts anticipated the storm would drift northward for several days, though some computer models predicted the storm would eventually move inland near Acapulco. At 1800UTC on May27, {{the depression}} organized into a tropical storm, and as such was named Aletta by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|<b>Moving</b> <b>very</b> {{steadily}} southwest, {{the storm}} gradually intensified. Early on February 15, the JTWC announced that that system had intensified into a tropical storm. After intensifying slightly (based on JTWC data) that evening, the storm briefly weakened overnight, only to re-intensify the next morning. On February16, Favio turned southwest {{in response to}} a large subtropical ridge. Despite low wind shear, Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days; however, on February18, MFR announced that Favio had intensified into a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa. Two days later, the agency then upgraded the system into cyclone status. At 0000UTC that day, on February19, the JTWC upgraded the system into a Category1 hurricane-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) though not much additional intensification was predicted.|$|E

25|$|Officials placed police {{officers}} in the Bicol Region ahead of the storm. In the provinces of Samar and Leyte, classes were canceled, and residents in flood- and landslide-prone areas were required to evacuate. Some of the storm-threatened areas were affected by an earlier earthquake in Bohol. Then-Philippine President Noynoy Aquino requested the military to deploy planes and helicopters to the region expected to be affected. As Haiyan was <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> fast, PAGASA issued warnings at different levels to about 60 of the 80 provinces, including the capital Metro Manila.

25|$|Fissile U-235 and non-fissile but {{fissionable}} and fertile U-238 {{are both}} {{used in the}} fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 {{is more likely to}} capture a neutron when the neutron is <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.|$|E
500|$|This supergiant {{elliptical}} galaxy is {{located near the}} center of the Virgo Cluster. This rich cluster has about 2,000 members and it forms the core of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group, and hence the Milky Way galaxy, is an outlying member. The cluster is organized into at least three distinct subsystems that are associated with the three galaxies M87, M49 and M86, with the one centered around M87 known as Virgo A and the one around M49 as Virgo B. There is a preponderance of elliptical and S0 galaxies around M87, with a chain of elliptical galaxies aligned with the jet. In terms of mass, M87 is a dominant member of the cluster, and hence appears to be <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> little relative to the cluster as a whole. Indeed, M87 is defined as the cluster center. The cluster has a sparse gaseous atmosphere that emits X-rays that decrease in temperature toward the middle, where M87 is located. The combined mass of the cluster is estimated to be (0.15–1.5) [...] 1015 solar masses.|$|E

500|$|At 1800UTC on August5, {{the storm}} {{strengthened}} to hurricane strength, the first tropical cyclone {{of the season}} to do so. At the time, the hurricane was <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> slowly westward, allowing it to strengthen despite its close proximity to land. The hurricane reached Category2 intensity by 0600UTC on August7. The storm made landfall at peak intensity at around 2100UTC later that day near Sabine Pass, Texas. At the time, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (160km/h), with the storm's maximum winds extending out 10mi (15km) from its center. A weather station in Sabine Pass recorded a barometric pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), which was analyzed {{to have been the}} lowest pressure measured in association with the storm. After moving inland, the storm immediately curved northward and began to gradually weaken. At 0600UTC on August8, the cyclone weakened to tropical storm strength while situated over East Texas, and later degenerated to a tropical depression by 1200UTC the following day. The depression persisted into Arkansas, where it transitioned into a trough of low pressure at 1800 UTC on August 10 after its center of circulation lacked the well-defined closed circulation characteristic of tropical cyclones.|$|E
500|$|The {{mating season}} in {{temperate}} climates typically {{takes place in}} autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur {{at any time of}} the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the egg mass is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually. [...] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{consequence}} of the mixing of nationalities {{and the spread of}} bilingualism and linguistic Russification was the growth of ethnic intermarriage and a process of ethnic Russification—coming to call oneself Russian by nationality or ethnicity, not just speaking Russian as a second language or using it as a primary language. In the last decades of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russification (or ethnic assimilation) was <b>moving</b> <b>very</b> rapidly for a few nationalities such as the Karelians and Mordvinians. [...] However, whether children born in mixed families where one of the parents was Russian were likely to be raised as Russians depended on the context. [...] For example, the majority of children in families where one parent was Russian and the other Ukrainian living in North Kazakhstan chose Russian as their nationality on their internal passport at age 16. [...] However, children of mixed Russian and Estonian parents living in Tallinn (the capital city of Estonia), or mixed Russian and Latvian parents living in Riga (the capital of Latvia), or mixed Russian and Lithuanian parents living in Vilnius (the capital of Lithuania) most often chose as their own nationality that of the titular nationality of their republic – not Russian.|$|E
