5|$|If {{the four}} contested lines {{were part of}} the Tithonus poem, the poem's tone would have changed significantly. The sixteen-line version of the poem has a much <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> ending than the twelve-line version, expressing hope for an afterlife.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his book would sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to meet the demand for The Kindly Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Morrison's third solo album, Moondance, {{which was}} {{released}} in 1970, became his first million selling album and reached number twenty-nine on the Billboard charts. The style of Moondance stood in contrast to that of Astral Weeks. Whereas Astral Weeks had a sorrowful and vulnerable tone, Moondance restored a <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> and cheerful message to his music, which abandoned the previous record's abstract folk compositions {{in favor of more}} formally composed songs and a lively rhythm and blues style he expanded on throughout his career.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} to protocol analysis using asynchronous product automata (APA) {{and the simple}} homomorphism verification tool (SHVT) is demonstrated on several variants of the well known Zhou-Gollmann fair non-repudiation protocol and on two <b>more</b> recent <b>optimistic</b> fair non-repudiation protocols.

50|$|In each {{self-contained}} {{story the}} boy Copper and his talking dog Fred journey through a detailed but economically drawn landscape - sometimes beautiful, sometimes bleak, sometimes surreal. Fred usually has some concise and forcefully expressive comment {{to make on}} their circumstances, while Copper is generally <b>more</b> cheerfully <b>optimistic.</b> The first three strips suggest that their adventures are dreams. After that the question is usually left open.|$|R
5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and {{his sense of humor}} and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover that the dog, a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be <b>more</b> <b>optimistic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Backspacer is {{the ninth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on September 20, 2009. The bandmembers started writing instrumental and demo tracks in 2007, and got together in 2008 {{to work on}} an album. It was recorded from February through April 2009 with producer Brendan O'Brien, who had worked on every Pearl Jam album except their 1991 debut Ten and 2006's self-titled record—although this was his first production credit since 1998's Yield. Material was recorded in Henson Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California and O'Brien's own Southern Tracks Recording in Atlanta, Georgia. The music on the album—the shortest of the band's career—features a sound influenced by pop and new wave. The lyrics have a <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> look than {{the ones in the}} politic-infused predecessors Riot Act and Pearl Jam, something frontman Eddie Vedder attributed to the election of Barack Obama.|$|E

When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau's trial and {{sentencing}} while Guiteau merrily cakewalks up to the noose, getting more and <b>more</b> desperately <b>optimistic</b> with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau's optimism before he is finally hanged ("The Ballad of Guiteau").|$|R
50|$|In August 2012, he {{released}} an 10-track album called Forward. Once again, Michael Manring makes a guest appearance on fretless bass. The album has songs with a <b>more</b> melodic and <b>optimistic</b> mood compared with his previous album Equilibrium.|$|R
5|$|General Paul D. Harkins, {{commander}} of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), made a much <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> assessment of the battle. He considered the operation {{to be a major}} success; after the Viet Cong abandoned their positions, the South Vietnamese units captured the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi. Harkins' evaluation of the battle's success was based on US military doctrine from World War II, in which opposing forces fought a conventional combined arms battle with the objective, on each side, of gaining control of the opponent's territory. The Viet Cong, however, were more interested in exposing the weaknesses of Diem's regime and its military. Moyar (2008) argues that Harkins' resolutely optimistic assessments based on conventional doctrine avoided recognizing shortcomings in tactics and battle readiness and in the arrangement under which ARVN commanders and their American counterparts and advisers were operating. Largely because of his attitude, neither the South Vietnamese nor the American commands learned useful lessons from the battle.|$|E
5|$|A left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack {{made his}} {{first-class}} cricket {{debut in the}} 1945–46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early-1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular {{member of the national}} team and played in every Test over the next two summers, fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947–48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only made the trip after a 3–2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> outlook; this allowed him to tour. As a member of Bradman's Invincibles, the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted a friend with the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed Toshak. The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.|$|E

25|$|The last {{factor of}} optimistic bias {{is that of}} {{underlying}} affect and affect experience. Research has found that people show less optimistic bias when experiencing a negative mood, and <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias when in a positive mood. Sad moods reflect greater memories of negative events, which lead to more negative judgments, while positive moods promote happy memories and more positive feelings. This suggests that overall negative moods, including depression, result in increased personal risk estimates but less optimistic bias overall. Anxiety also leads to less optimistic bias, continuing to suggest that overall positive experiences and positive attitudes lead to <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias in events.|$|E
25|$|Symphony No. 8 in G major, Op. 88, is {{characterized}} by a warmer and <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> tone. Karl Schumann (in booklet notes for a recording of all the symphonies by Rafael Kubelík) compares it to the works of Gustav Mahler.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have also}} noticed that people {{demonstrate}} <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias when making comparisons {{when the other}} is a vague individual, but biases are reduced when {{the other is a}} familiar person, such as a friend or family member. This also is determined due to the information they have about the individuals closest to them, but not having the same information about other people.|$|E
25|$|Smith's stories {{describe}} a long future history of Earth. The settings {{range from a}} postapocalyptic landscape with walled cities, defended by agents of the Instrumentality, {{to a state of}} sterile utopia, in which freedom can be found only deep below the surface, in long-forgotten and buried anthropogenic strata. These features may place Smith's works within the Dying Earth subgenre of science fiction. They are ultimately <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> and distinctive.|$|E

40|$|Transactional memory, an {{approach}} aiming to replace cumbersome locking mechanisms in concurrent systems, {{has become a}} popular research topic. But due to problems posed by irrevocable operations (e. g., system calls), the viability of pessimistic concurrency control for transactional memory systems is being explored, {{in lieu of the}} <b>more</b> typical <b>optimistic</b> approach. However, in a distributed setting, where partial transaction failures may happen, the inability of pessimistic transactional memories to roll back is a major shortcoming. Therefore, this paper presents a novel transactional memory concurrency control algorithm that is both fully pessimistic and rollback-capable...|$|R
5000|$|Many regard Old Ramon as a <b>more</b> lighthearted, <b>optimistic</b> {{recording}} {{than previous}} Red House Painters releases. The first track, [...] "Wop-a-Din-Din" [...] is Marks {{tribute to his}} cat, while [...] "Byrd Joel," [...] "Michigan" [...] and [...] "Kavita" [...] are love songs. Elsewhere, however, the languid, lengthy [...] "River" [...] and [...] "Void", and the melancholic [...] "Smokey", confirmed that Kozelek hadnt lost his touch for articulating regret and sadness. The album also retained Songs for a Blue Guitars mix of introspective acoustic folk-rock and heavier electric rock.|$|R
50|$|It is {{probable}} that Hitler believed Zeitzler would be a <b>more</b> pliable and <b>optimistic</b> OKH chief than Halder. He {{was known to be}} a master of logistics, with solid organizational skills. His performance {{at the head of the}} General Staff was very respectable, but his drive and initiative was eventually paralyzed by Hitler's increasingly unreasonable demands and irrational orders.|$|R
25|$|Alexander Campbell's millennialism was <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> than Stone's. He {{had more}} {{confidence}} in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age. Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that {{the progress of the}} church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ. This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.|$|E
25|$|A new {{meeting between}} Nimetz {{and the two}} parties was {{arranged}} on 17 March 2008 in Vienna, {{in the office of}} the former UN special envoy to Kosovo and ex-president of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari. Nimetz noted that he did not present any new proposals, thanked the United States with whom he said he was in contact, and urged more countries to help in solving the dispute. He also announced that he was <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> after this meeting, and that he focused only on the solutions that could be applied by NATO's summit in April.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{these figures}} became more joyful, whimsical, colorful, and larger in scale. Inspired by a {{collaborative}} drawing with American artist Larry Rivers of his wife, her pregnant friend Clarice Price, Saint Phalle began to portray archetypal female figures with a <b>more</b> <b>optimistic</b> {{view of the}} position of women in society. The newer figures took on ecstatic dance poses and even acrobatic positions, such as handstands and cartwheels. Saint Phalle's light-hearted figures have been compared to the joyful dancers of Matisse and the sturdy female figures by Gaston Lachaise, Aristide Maillol, and Rodin.|$|E

While there, April is worried to note that Michelangelo is not himself. He spends his days in the barn taking out his {{aggression}} on a punching bag. A scene shows him lashing out at his surroundings and repeatedly punching the wall of the barn until it breaks, then collapsing on it despondently, anger spent.

Males are found to over-appreciate their physical fitness. To the extent this behaviour carries over to other contexts, such as the labor market, the tendency of men to overestimate their capacity could lead to distorted self-appraisals and give them advantages in terms of higher salaries and better positions.
