40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the methods of}} inverse {{problems}} solution are applied for the identification of substitute heat transfer coefficient in the primary cooling zone of continuous casting plant. The heat exchange between the cast strand and the continuous casting mould proceeds in the very complex conditions (air gap, layer of <b>mould</b> <b>dressing,</b> fouling etc.). For the needs of casting solidification modelling the real boundary condition on the contact surface should be simplified and one can introduce the mean boundary heat flux (the Neumann condition) or the substitute heat transfer coefficient (the Robin condition). These values can be found using the inverse approach. In order {{to solve the problem}} of identification, the gradient methods are here applied (the least square criterion with regularization parameter). The algorithm presented bases on the sensitivity analysis methods, in other words the values of temperature derivatives with respect to the unknown nodal heat transfer coefficients must be known. The basic and additional boundary problems connected with the sensitivity coefficients computations are solved using the generalized variant of finite differences method. In the final part of the paper the example of computations is shown...|$|E

I have spoken of her once before; {{but it is}} difficult to describe her, there is something so perfectly simple, yet elegant, in her appearance; but it has cut itself like a cameo in my memory--a figure under the middle size, perfectly <b>moulded,</b> <b>dressed</b> simply in black, a beautiful head, hair Ã  la Madonna, ornamented by a band of gold coins on black velvet: a band of the same kind encircling her throat is the only relief to the severe simplicity of her dress.|$|R

This was allowed by {{the invention of the}} cuirass bodice which functions like a corset, but extends downwards to the hips and upper thighs. Although dress styles took on a more natural form, the narrowness of the skirt limited the wearer in regards to walking.|$|R

For each person, these include the right to: live by one's own law; live in the way that one wills to do; work, play, and rest as one will; die when and how one will; eat and drink what one will; live where one will; move about the earth as one will; think, speak, write, draw, paint, carve, etch, <b>mould,</b> build, and <b>dress</b> as one will; love when, where and with whom one will; and kill those who would thwart these rights.|$|R
