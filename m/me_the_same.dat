In that work I tried to get across the atmosphere of [...] "peasant devotion" [...] that had struck me so forcibly in that lofty chapel.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{began reading}} Nightmare of Ecstasy {{and some of}} Wood's letters. He was taken by how he [...] "wrote about his films {{as if he was}} making Citizen Kane, you know, whereas other people {{perceived}} them as, like, the worst movies ever". Burton admits to having always been a fan of Ed Wood, which is why the biopic is filmed with an aggrandizing bias borne of his admiration rather than derision of Wood's work. The relationship between Wood and Lugosi in the script echoes closely Burton's relationship with his own idol and two-time colleague, Vincent Price. He said in an interview, [...] "Meeting Vincent had an incredible impact on <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> impact Ed must have felt meeting and working with his idol." [...] Meanwhile, Burton had been asked to direct Mary Reilly for Columbia Pictures with Winona Ryder in the title role.|$|E

500|$|Growing up in New Zealand without {{television}} {{until the}} 1960s, Dale developed {{a love of}} theatre and amateur dramatics. His first performance was for a school concert, {{at the age of}} 13, doing an impression of comedian Shelley Berman. His parents became founding members of an amateur theatre in Auckland called [...] "The Little Dolphin Theatre". Dale often operated the stage equipment used to produce weather effects, and whenever he was on stage he loved the applause. Although a skilled rugby player, Dale opted to move into drama instead because [...] "the acting fraternity didn't like footballers and the footballers didn't like actors. [...] Acting gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> buzz and there was the chance of a longer career." [...] He gave up rugby at the age of 21 because it was not considered a workable career at the time, and he had to support his family. Acting roles were limited in New Zealand so Dale worked in multiple jobs, including as a male model, a car salesman and a realtor. While working as a milkman he heard the disc jockey at his local radio station resign during a broadcast. Dale went over to the station and told the managers he could do a better job. They gave him a trial and then signed him up for the afternoon show, which led to him landing his first TV role, and at the age of 27 he decided to become a professional actor.|$|E
500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and tell <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E

And I made a joke , and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?"

2500|$|During {{this time}} Ramblin' Jack Elliott studied {{extensively}} under Guthrie, visiting {{his home and}} observing how he wrote and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's Huntington's disease, Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, [...] "I was flattered. Dylan learned from <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If {{you want to learn}} something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly." ...|$|E

Or if an estate agent comes to my house and tells me that because a Jamaican family has moved next door the value of my property has fallen through the floor. Ask me then!" ...|$|E

2500|$|After this event, he lost {{interest}} in school studies, friends, and relations. He was absent-minded at school, [...] "imagining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me". Avoiding company, he preferred to sit alone, absorbed in concentration on this current or force, and went daily to the Meenakshi Temple, ecstatically devoted to {{the images of the}} 63 Nayanars and of Nataraja, wanting [...] "the same grace as was shown to those saints," [...] praying that he [...] "should have the same bhakti that they had" [...] and [...] " [...] that God should give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> grace He gave to those saints".|$|E

I was particular in ascertaining the exact number and they (the natives) gave <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> number over and over again. The slaughtered consisted of men, women and children. The abovenamed native was one of the party attacked and succeeded in hiding himself among the long grass and thus escaped. The whites immediately threw the bodies into a waterhole, and left the spot leaving the bodies there.|$|E
2500|$|Levy {{and many}} others have {{supported}} Dylan {{in the context of}} a larger, older blues and folk tradition of songwriters evolving old songs into new ones, which Dylan was no stranger to in the 1960s. Pete Seeger himself has previously expressed the view that Dylan is a link in this chain of folk and blues songwriters. Seeger has spoken many times about the folk process, often recounting that his friend Woody Guthrie once said to him [...] "That guy stole that from me, but I steal from everybody". Ramblin' Jack at one time expressed similar sentiments: [...] "Dylan learned from <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, 'If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly'".|$|E

2500|$|Cohen was {{described}} as a Sabbath-observant Jew in an article in The New York Times:Mr. Cohen keeps the Sabbath even while on tour and performed for Israeli troops during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. So how does he square that faith with his continued practice of Zen? [...] "Allen Ginsberg asked <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> question many years ago", he said. [...] "Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity. So theologically there is no challenge to any Jewish belief." [...] In his concert in Ramat Gan, Israel, on September 24, 2009, Cohen spoke Jewish prayers and blessings to the audience in Hebrew. He opened the show with the first sentence of Ma Tovu. At the middle he used Baruch Hashem, and he ended the concert reciting the blessing of Birkat Cohanim.|$|E
2500|$|Obama's win in Iowa {{was seen}} as a boost to his already-improving chances in New Hampshire. On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If you give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> chance that Iowa gave me last night I truly believe that I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E

[...] However, and despite Sanders' complaints, label head Larry Sherman insisted in releasing half of the material under the pseudonym Virgo Four as an effort to associate the duo with Virgo, a sort of supergroup consisting of Marshall Jefferson, Vince Lawrence, and Adonis. In 1989, the material was released as two 12" [...] EPs in the United States - Do You Know Who You Are? by Virgo Four, and later Ride by <b>M.E.</b> <b>The</b> <b>same</b> year, the tracks were compiled and released as a CD album titled Virgo in the United Kingdom. It was licensed to Radical Records (also known as Radikal), the house offshoot of 80s urban label StreetSounds. Since its release, several bootleg editions of the album appeared.|$|E

2500|$|Linney first {{appeared}} in minor roles in a few early 1990s films, including Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and Dave (1993), before coming to prominence in the public television miniseries Tales of the City in 1993. She was then cast {{in a series of}} high-profile thrillers, including Congo (1995), Primal Fear (1996) and Absolute Power (1997). She made her Hollywood breakthrough in 1998, playing Jim Carrey's on-screen wife in The Truman Show, for which she received critical acclaim.
