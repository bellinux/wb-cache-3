25|$|Queens {{typically}} {{mate with}} multiple drones {{on more than}} one <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> Once mated, they lay eggs and fertilize them as needed from sperm stored in the spermatheca. Since the number of sex alleles is limited at a regional level, a queen will most likely mate with one or more drones having sex alleles identical with one of the sex alleles in the queen. The queen, then, typically produces a percentage of diploid drone eggs.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies have}} shown that Africanized bees can {{infiltrate}} European bee colonies and then kill and replace their queen (thus usurping the hive), this is less common than other methods. Wild and managed colonies will sometimes be seen to fight over honey stores during the dearth (periods when plants are not flowering), but this behavior {{should not be confused with}} the aforementioned activity. The most common way that a European hive will become Africanized is through cross-breeding during a new queen's <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> Studies have consistently shown that Africanized drones are more numerous, stronger and faster than their European cousins and are therefore able to out-compete them during these mating flights. The results of mating between Africanized drones and European queens is almost always Africanized offspring.|$|E
2500|$|Congregation {{areas are}} {{typically}} located above open ground, away from trees or hills, where flight is somewhat {{protected from the}} wind (calm winds may be helpful during <b>mating</b> <b>flight).</b> [...] At the same time, many congregation areas do not show such characteristics, such as those located above water or the forest canopy. [...] Some {{studies have suggested that}} magnetic orientation could play a role, since drones older than 6 days contain cells in the abdomen that are rich in magnetite.|$|E
40|$|Several unique {{issues related}} to <b>mated</b> <b>flight</b> control have been broadly identified. These issues include {{redundancies}} in subsystems, controllability, command and control authority distribution, information flow across elements, and changes and variability in system characteristics due to variable mated configurations during operations.

50|$|A. versicolor mate {{from late}} July through October. All major <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> are {{preceded by a}} day of rain. <b>Mating</b> <b>flights</b> begin {{in the early morning}} when {{individuals}} of both sexes emerge from the colony. Males will leave for the mating sites first, followed by the females who likely follow male pheromones. Males will grapple the female in mid-air then fall to the ground to copulate.|$|R
40|$|<b>Mating</b> <b>flights</b> of {{queen and}} drone honey bees are {{performed}} at a particular, species-specific time of day. <b>Mating</b> <b>flights</b> of Apis dor-sata drones {{take place in}} mass flights at dusk (Koeniger & Wijaya-gunasekara, 1976; Koeniger et al., 1988; Rinderer et al., 1993; Koeniger et al., 1994; Woyke et al., 2001). Queens of A. dorsata fly {{at the same time}} (Tan et al., 1999). Although only drones and queens have been reported as taking part in these mass flights at dusk, we have observed workers flying together with drone...|$|R
2500|$|A single drone visits {{multiple}} congregation areas {{during his}} lifetime, often taking multiple trips per afternoon. [...] A drone’s <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> averages 25–32 minutes, but can {{last up to}} 60 minutes, before he must return to the colony to refuel with honey. [...] While at the site, the drones fly around passively, waiting {{for the arrival of}} a virgin. [...] When the virgin queen arrives to the congregation area, the drones locate her by visual and olfactory cues. [...] At this point, it is a race to mate with the virgin queen, to be genetically represented in the newly founded colony. [...] The swarming drones, as they actively follow the queen, reportedly resemble a “drone comet”, dissolving and reforming as the drones chase the virgin queen. [...] Drones greatly outnumber the quantity of virgin queens produced per season, so even with multiple mating by the queen, very few drones mate successfully (estimated at less than one in 1000). [...] If needed, a virgin queen can embark on multiple ‘nuptial flights’, to be sure to receive enough semen from enough drones.|$|E
5000|$|The method {{through which}} A. insinuator [...] "infects" [...] the A. echinatior colony is still undetermined. The time of A. insinuator's <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> {{is near the}} same time of the <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> of A. echinatior and {{therefore}} is reasonable to hypothesize that the recently inseminated A. insinuator queen joins the A. echinatior queen as she finds her new colony. However, this does {{not rule out the}} possibility that A. insinuator queen joins an A. echinatior colony that has already been found (pleometrotic).|$|E
50|$|Swarming {{creates a}} {{vulnerable}} {{time in the}} life of honey bees. Cast swarms are provisioned only with the nectar or honey they carry in their stomachs. A swarm will starve if it does not quickly find a home and more nectar stores. This happens most often with early swarms that are cast on a warm day that is followed by cold or rainy weather in spring. The remnant colony after having cast one or more swarms is usually well provisioned with food, but the new queen can be lost or eaten by predators during her <b>mating</b> <b>flight,</b> or poor weather can prevent her <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> In this case the hive has no further young brood to raise additional queens, and it will not survive. An afterswarm will usually contain a young virgin queen.|$|E

50|$|Leadership is {{determined}} through chance. The first gold dragon to rise for the <b>mate</b> <b>flight</b> after the previous Weyrwoman's gold dragon has died or ceased to mate becomes Weyrwoman; the rider of the bronze dragon that catches that dragon becomes Weyrleader. This system {{was established by}} the first Weyrleader, Sean Connell, in the short story The Second Weyr. This system can (and in the books has) produce inept or otherwise unsatisfactory leadership. There {{is no way to}} remove a bad Weyrwoman {{and the only way to}} replace a Weyrleader is for a different bronze to fly the Weyrwoman's gold dragon. During an Interval, it may be as long as a decade between <b>mating</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
25|$|Virgin queens go on <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> {{away from}} their home colony to a drone {{congregation}} area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die {{in the act of}} mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.|$|R
5000|$|Also in fandom, if a rider {{has strong}} {{objections}} to sex with someone {{involved in a}} <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> or the writer has objections to writing a homosexual encounter or object to their character being involved in a sexual encounter with a person other than their [...] "significant other," [...] they may sequester themselves with a more acceptable partner during the flight. This idea is called [...] "Stand-Ins" [...] and based on a concept McCaffrey introduced in Dragonseye/Red Star Rising, in which a female green rider objects {{to the idea of}} a specific bronze rider winning her green's <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> However, this concept is not seen in other books and clearly does not exist in the Ninth Pass, as several problems arise regarding green and gold riders who object to the random nature of mating flights and end up raped by the male winner of the flight (most notably in Skies of Pern).|$|E
5000|$|The queen {{emerges from}} her cell after 15 days of {{development}} and she remains in the hive for 3-7 days before venturing out on a <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> <b>Mating</b> <b>flight</b> is otherwise known as [...] "nuptial flight". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark {{the position of the}} hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough sperm from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate—possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive—she remains infertile and becomes a drone layer, incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.|$|E
50|$|Like {{males in}} other stingless bee species, there is {{tremendous}} competition between T. iridipennis males to copulate with virgin queens. Males {{have been observed}} to form large aggregations and to engage in mass flights near nests waiting {{for the emergence of}} virgin females. Once a virgin queen emerges, it pairs with one of the males and a <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> ensues, resulting in the fertilization of the queen.|$|E
50|$|Once the queens have mated {{they will}} land and discard their wings {{and begin to}} find a {{suitable}} place to dig a tunnel. Meanwhile, the males generally only live {{for a day or}} two after the <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> and will then die.|$|R
50|$|Virgin queens go on <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> {{away from}} their home colony to a drone {{congregation}} area, and mate with multiple drones before returning. The drones die {{in the act of}} mating. Queen honey bees do not mate with drones from their home colony.|$|R

50|$|The {{levels of}} two of the {{aliphatic}} compounds increase rapidly in virgin queens within the first week after eclosion (emergence from the pupal case), which is consistent with their roles as sex attractants during the <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> It is only after a queen is mated and begins laying eggs, however, that the full blend of compounds is made. The physiological factors regulating reproductive development and pheromone production are unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Polygyny {{is often}} {{associated}} with many social insect species, and is usually characterized by limited <b>mating</b> <b>flights,</b> small queen size, and other characteristics. However, carpenter ants have [...] "extensive" [...] <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> and relatively large queens, distinguishing them from polygynous species. Carpenter ants are described as oligogynous because they have a number of fertile queens which are intolerant of each other and must therefore spread to different areas of the nest. Some aggressive interactions have been known to take place between queens, but not necessarily through workers. Queens become aggressive mainly to other queens if they trespass on a marked territory. Queens in a given colony can work together in brood care and the workers tend to experience higher rates of survival in colonies with multiple queens. Some researchers still subscribe to the notion that carpenter ant colonies are only monogynous.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the intense}} psychic bond between rider and dragon, dragonriders are {{overcome}} by the powerful emotions and sensations associated with <b>mating</b> <b>flights.</b> The riders of the mating pair engage in sex themselves, to varying degrees unaware {{of what they are}} doing. This contributes to a much looser attitude toward sexuality in general among dragonriders than in the rest of Pernese society.|$|R

50|$|The {{military}} {{side of the}} Weyr {{is headed}} by the Weyrleader. Weyrleadership {{is determined by the}} <b>mating</b> <b>flights</b> of the senior queen.

50|$|The Lower Caverns are an {{extensive}} series of caverns with easy entrance by foot. They contain common use {{areas such as}} lounging and recreation areas for riders, kitchens and dining areas, bathing pools, storage areas for supplies, living quarters for support staff, children (Weyrbrats), crafters and more. They also contain special quarters for riders {{who are involved in}} <b>mating</b> <b>flights,</b> as their private weyrs are often inaccessible from the ground.|$|R
50|$|Both {{green and}} gold dragons {{broadcast}} their sexual feelings on a wide band during mating flights. Weyrfolk tend to become somewhat inured to this and therefore can hold their sexual reactions until an appropriate place and time. However, flights are usually not over the Weyr itself and sometimes the flight path of the <b>mating</b> <b>flight</b> brings the mating dragons over Holds or Farmholds where the average people occasionally find themselves engaged in unexpected activities. This is especially common among young teens working out in the fields who react to the sudden, unexpected and overwhelming urges with potentially embarrassing results.|$|E
5000|$|Often, but not always, the Candidates {{who failed}} to Impress a dragon, or those who have {{run away from home}} to live in the more liberal, {{accepting}} atmosphere of the Weyr. Lower Cavern staff are often the grown children of dragonriders. This includes cooks, servers, cleaning staff for common areas, those who care for the beasts that will feed the dragons, and many others. Lower Caverns workers often satisfy the sexual needs of riders who have lost a <b>mating</b> <b>flight.</b> They are led and organized by a headwoman, who is usually ranked just under the weyrleaders in authority.|$|E
5000|$|This {{specific}} {{behavior has}} also been documented in Dominican amber fossils dating back , with queens of the fossil species Acropyga glaesaria being found preserved with species of the extinct mealybug genus Electromyrmococcus.

50|$|Once male reproductives {{emerge and}} {{both males and}} females {{disperse}} from the natal nest for <b>mating</b> <b>flights,</b> the so-called intermediate phase begins.
