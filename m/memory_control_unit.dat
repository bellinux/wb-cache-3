It is a tool for modeling the design and behavior of a microprocessor and its components, such as the ALU, cache <b>memory,</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> and data path, among others. The simulation allows researchers to explore the design space {{as well as to}} evaluate the performance and efficiency of novel microarchitecture features. For example, several microarchitecture components, such as branch predictors, re-order buffer, and trace cache, went through numerous simulation cycles before they become common components in contemporary microprocessors of today. In addition, the simulation also enables educators to teach computer organization and architecture courses with hand-on experiences.|$|E

Furthermore, it is shown how the timing diagrams for the unit network verification are easily derived from the timing diagrams specified for the units. The multiprocessor hardware test showed the effectiveness of the proposed verification approach. 1.

5000|$|The ASC {{was based}} around a single {{high-speed}} shared memory, which was accessed by the CPU and eight I/O channel controllers, {{in an organization}} similar to Seymour Cray's groundbreaking CDC 6600. Memory was accessed solely {{under the control of}} the <b>memory</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (MCU). The MCU was a two-way, 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors, with a ninth channel for accessing [...] "main memory" [...] (or [...] "extended memory" [...] as it was referred to as). The MCU also acted as a cache controller, offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports, and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory. The MCU was designed to operate asynchronously, allowing it to work at a variety of speeds and scale across a number of performance points. For instance, main memory could be constructed out of slower but less expensive core memory, although this was not used in practice. At the fastest, it could sustain transfer rates of 80 million 32-bit words per second per port, for a total transfer rate of 640 million words per second. This was well beyond the capabilities of even the fastest memories of the era.|$|E

Due to their high performance, Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) based microprocessors have been widely used in computing systems as well as embedded control and communication systems. The first and the most important step in designing a RISC microprocessor is to define the instruction set and its corresponding architecture. It will be inconvenient in terms of time and cost to verify an instruction set and its architecture through complete hardware realization. Therefore, a logic simulator for RISC microprocessor is highly desirable. This thesis studies the logic simulation of RISC microprocessors based on behavioral modeling approach. Many behavioral models for the components of RISC microprocessors, like ALU, multiplexer, <b>memory,</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> are proposed. A prototype, called LSRM (a Logic Simulator for RISC-based Microprocessor), is also designed and implemented in SUN/UNIX environment. LSRM consists of a graphical user interface and a simulator. The user interface is built on the X-window/Motif system while the simulator is implemented in C, Verilog and PLI. The system model adopted in this research is based on the DLX machine. However, substantial extension is made in order to satisfy as many applications as possible...|$|E

However, if memory chip contents survives power-off, e. g., via freezing DRAM chips, sensitive data such as passwords and keys can be extracted. Main memory persistence {{will soon be}} the norm as recent advancements in MRAM and FeRAM position non-volatile memory technologies for widespread deployment in laptop, desktop, and embedded system main memory. Unfortunately, the same properties that provide energy efficiency, tolerance against power failure, and “instant-on ” powerup also subject systems to offline memory scanning. In this paper, we propose a <b>Memory</b> Encryption <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (MECU) that provides memory confidentiality during system suspend and across reboots. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the processor-local level 2 cache and main memory to ensure plaintext data is never written to the persistent medium.

We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. This analysis shows the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with higher access latencies (caused by resume state reconstruction) subsiding within 0. 25 seconds of a system resume.

40|$|Non-volatile {{memories}} provide energy efficiency, tolerance against power failure, and “instant-on” power-up. These {{memories are}} likely to replace traditional volatile memory in next-generation laptops and desktops. However, the move to non-volatile memory introduces new vulnerabilities; sensitive data such as passwords and keys residing in main memory persists across reboots and can be probed during hardware suspension. In this paper, we propose a <b>Memory</b> Encryption <b>Control</b> <b>Unit</b> (MECU) to address the vulnerabilities introduced by non-volatile memories. The MECU encrypts all memory transfers between the level 2 cache and main memory. The keys used to encrypt memory blocks are derived from secret information present on removable authentication tokens, e. g., smart card, or other similar secure storage devices. This provides protection against physical attacks in absence of the token. A MECU design is outlined and performance, memory, and security trade-offs considered. We evaluate a MECU-enhanced architecture using the SimpleScalar hardware simulation framework on several hardware benchmarks. The performance analysis shows that we can secure non-volatile memories with minimal overhead—the majority of memory accesses are delayed by less than 1 ns, with limited degradation subsiding within 67 µs of a system resume. In effect, we provide zero-cost steady state confidentiality for main memory. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} cache memory, {{used for a}} 32 -bit {{processor}} system, which consists of four components: the Directory, Line Replacement Unit (LRU), Cache <b>Memory,</b> and <b>Control</b> <b>Unit.</b> An 8 -way set-associative mapping method is employed in the directory. The Line Replacement Unit {{is based on the}} least recently used line replacement algorithm. The cache memory unit has a capacity of 8 k bytes, 32 bytes in each line, and it is directly accessible to 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes (one word) once by the associated processor. This cache memory is designed for a multiple processor system as well as in single processor system; a write-through algorithm and an updating algorithm are combined together to keep the information in main memory consistent with that of the cache and to make the multicaches coherent. The hit ratios are predicted to be over 95 percent. A two-phase clock of 40 ns is employed to pipeline this cache, and it can turn out a result in 20 ns during read operations without line misses. This cache is implemented into a single chip, and is designed so {{that it is possible to}} build cache systems of various sizes using these chips, without decreasing the system speed.

40|$|Introduction Heart Failure is {{the most}} {{frequent}} reason for hospital admissions in Germany since 2006 and is, moreover, {{one of the most}} cost-intensive chronic diseases. The largest part of costs is attributable to hospital treatment. Therefore, an im-plantable monitor is developed to detect increasing pulmonary artery (PA) pressure as an early sign of cardiac decom-pensation, thus allowing the physician to timely adjust heart failure therapy to prevent hospitalisation. Methods A sensor capsule containing a capacitive pressure transducer is implanted in the PA and securely hold in place by a fixation. The capsule is connected via a lead to a subcutaneously implanted housing containing the battery, <b>memory,</b> <b>control</b> and telemetry <b>units.</b> Outside the body, a Biotronik CardioMessenger enhanced with a barometric pressure sensor receives pressure data from the implant and transmits them to a Service Center. Results Mechanical design, material and surface properties of the sensor capsule and cable including the fixation as well as im-plantation procedure have been investigated and optimized in 6 acute and 5 chronic animal experiments. As a result, a delivery system was designed that allows a reproducible implantation procedure in animals. Moreover, first acute PA pressure measurements with sensor prototypes were successfully performed. Conclusion First acute results demonstrate the general feasibility of physiological PA pressure measurements, the fixation has shown to be stable in chronic experiments with dummy implants.

The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are fitted into the matrix by an initial loose mounting on a surface of a transfer carrier (4). The transfer carrier is applied to the matrix, with the surface fitted with <b>control</b> <b>units</b> towards the transducers, and the transfer carrier is peeled off. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - To produce an adaptronic micro system, the transfer carrier is a film, sheet or plate, with an adhesive bond to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> at a surface, with a weaker bonding than the bond between the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> and the matrix. The bonds are modified to hold the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> more strongly at the matrix. When the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are in place at the matrix, the matrix and/or the <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are given an intermediate hardening. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied to the transfer carrier by a printing process, ink jet printing or by dispensing. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are electrodes, in an inter-digital array, or of an electrically conductive adhesive applied to the transfer carrier and treated with radiation or heat to give a total or partial hardening action. The transfer carrier, with the control electrodes, is pressed mechanically against the matrix, which is then wholly or partially hardened by radiation or heat. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can be of conductive film or foil materials, conductive lines or network or grid, or of an intrinsic or extrinsic electrically conductive material. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> can also be light waveguides. The transducers are piezo electric, magnetostrictive, shape memory alloys or nano tubes. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are applied with a direct contact on the transducers. The control connectors, or connectors which can be fitted, are applied by one or more transfer carriers like the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> application. The transfer carrier is a polymer film, a sheet of felt paper or coated paper. The <b>control</b> <b>units</b> are wholly embedded in the matrix. A number of micro systems (5) are assembled into a stack, and then fully hardened by mechanical pressure and heat. USE - The process is for the production of adaptronic micro systems.
