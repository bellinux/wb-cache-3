40|$|This study {{introduces}} the erosion control method <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>drainage,</b> staking and wattling {{commonly used in}} Taiwan. This method installs <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> system and fills cracks {{on the top of}} landslide areas, and re-vegetates. It can reduce a great amount <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> erosion and reduce rainfalls entering slopes; therefore, there is only little infiltration into the slope thereby increasing stability. The <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> system can reduce sheet/gully erosion. Staking and wattling with vegetation is applied on the slope face to increase re-vegetation rate. If needed, drainage pipe can be installed at the slope toe, to reduce the chance of water build up. The effectiveness of this erosion control method has been proven by inspecting the performance of sites treated with this method after Typhoon Mindulle in July 2004. Only 9. 4 % of the sites were damaged, mostly showing local scours or collapses caused by the typhoon rainfall. More than 90 % of the areas were effectively stabilized, and there was no major debris flow and large scale landslide. Therefore, treating a landslide prone area with this erosion control method is relatively effective...|$|R
30|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} {{is an important}} aspect of characterization of watersheds.

Over the past several decades, morphometric analysis to evaluate watersheds and to describe the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>drainage</b> networks with reference to land and water management has been a major emphasis in geomorphology. Pioneer studies by Horton (1932, 1945) demonstrated the significance of quantitative morphometric analysis to better understand the hydrologic and geomorphic properties of watersheds. Since then, several methods of watershed morphometry were further developed (e.g., Miller 1953; Strahler 1954, 1957, 1964; Schumm 1956; Melton 1957; Faniran 1968) that enabled morphometric characterization at watershed scale to extract pertinent information on the formation and development <b>of</b> land <b>surface</b> processes.|$|R
