5|$|Among Presbyterians, communion was {{the central}} {{occasion}} of the church, conducted infrequently, at <b>most</b> <b>once</b> a year, often taking a week of festivals {{as part of a}} communion season. Communicants were examined by a minister and elders, proving their knowledge of the Shorter Catechism. They were then given communion tokens that entitled them {{to take part in the}} ceremony. Long tables were set up in the middle of the church at which communicants sat to receive communion. Where ministers refused or neglected parish communion, largely assemblies were carried out in the open air, often combining several parishes. These large gatherings were discouraged by the General Assembly, but continued. They could become mixed with secular activities and were commemorated as such by Robert Burns in the poem Holy Fair. They could also be occasions for evangelical meetings, as at the Cambuslang Wark.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to be drawn on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also be drawn in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at <b>most</b> <b>once.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Kirk had {{considerable}} {{control over the}} lives of the people, with {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation the singing of the psalms. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at <b>most</b> <b>once</b> a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second half of the century there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, with musical accompaniment prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, a {{comparability}} graph is a graph such that, {{for every}} generalized cycle of odd length, {{one can find}} an edge (x,y) connecting two vertices that are at distance two in the cycle.

25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings. However, {{this is not the}} best drawing for minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at <b>most</b> <b>once,</b> so the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E

25|$|In 1566, {{unlike the}} {{situation}} after the Eighty Years War and today, Protestantism in the Low Countries was mainly {{concentrated in the}} south (roughly modern Belgium), and much weaker in the north (roughly now the Netherlands), and iconoclasm in the north began later, after news of the events in Antwerp was received, and was more successfully resisted by local authorities in some towns, although still succeeding in <b>most.</b> <b>Once</b> again individually socially prominent laymen often took the lead. In many places there were, or were later said to have been, false claims of official commissions from some local authority to perform the actions, {{and by the end}} of the outbreak some northern towns removed images by order of the local authority, presumably to prevent the disorder that would accompany a mob action.|$|E
25|$|The Reformation, {{carried out}} in Scotland in the mid-sixteenth century and heavily {{influenced}} by Calvinism, amounted to a revolution in religious practice. Sermons were now the focus of worship. The Witchcraft Act 1563 made witchcraft, or consulting with witches, capital crimes. There were major series of trials in 1590–91, 1597, 1628–31, 1649–50 and 1661–62. Prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. Seventy-five per cent of the accused were women and modern estimates indicate that over 1,500 persons were executed across the whole period. Scottish Protestantism {{in the seventeenth century}} was highly focused on the Bible, which was seen as infallible and the major source of moral authority. In the mid-seventeenth century Scottish Presbyterian worship took the form it was to maintain until the liturgical revival of the nineteenth century with the adoption of the Westminster Directory in 1643. The seventeenth century saw the high-water mark of kirk discipline, with kirk sessions able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. Kirk sessions also had an administrative burden in the system of poor relief and a major role in education. In the eighteenth century there were a series of reforms in church music. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted at <b>most</b> <b>once</b> a year, sometimes in outdoor holy fairs.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike baseball, {{the batting}} order in cricket is not fixed, {{and can be}} changed at any time, {{provided}} each player bats at <b>most</b> <b>once.</b> This {{gives rise to the}} [...] "pinch hitter" [...] in cricket – a non-specialist batsman promoted up the order to get quick runs – and the Nightwatchman.

If a batsman is not ready to bat at the fall of a wicket, another batsman, typically the player who occupies the next spot in the batting order, will go out to bat in his place, to avoid the risk of the original batsman being timed out.|$|E
2500|$|An {{attribute}} is a markup construct {{consisting of}} a name–value pair that exists within a start-tag or empty-element tag.

An XML attribute can only have a single value and each attribute can appear at <b>most</b> <b>once</b> on each element. In the common situation where a list of multiple values is desired, this must be done by encoding the list into a well-formed XML attribute with some format beyond what XML defines itself. Usually this is either a comma or semi-colon delimited list or, if the individual values are known not to contain spaces, a space-delimited list can be used. <div class="inner greeting-box">Welcome!</div>, where the attribute [...] "class" [...] has both the value [...] "inner greeting-box" [...] and also indicates the two CSS class names [...] "inner" [...] and [...] "greeting-box".|$|E
