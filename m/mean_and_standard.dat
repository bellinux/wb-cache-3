25|$|An {{alternative}} method {{of establishing a}} reference range with the assumption of log-normal distribution {{is to use the}} arithmetic mean and arithmetic value of standard deviation. This is somewhat more tedious to perform, but may be useful for example in cases where a study that establishes a reference range presents only the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation, leaving out the source data. If the original assumption of arithmetically normal distribution is shown to be less appropriate than the log-normal one, then, using the arithmetic <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation may be the only available parameters to correct the reference range.|$|E

25|$|Where {{there are}} {{a large number of}} samples a quick {{reasonable}} estimate of the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation can be got by grouping the samples into classes using equal size ranges.

25|$|This is {{an analog}} {{of the mean}} {{difference}} - {{the average of the}} differences of all the possible pairs of variate values, taken regardless of sign. The mean difference differs from the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation because it is dependent on the spread of the variate values among themselves and not on the deviations from some central value.|$|E

25|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary base (for example e), derive the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above that mean, and subsequently exponentiate using those two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.|$|E

2500|$|However, a rainy monsoon is not {{necessarily}} a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to statistical averages calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the average quantity of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (mean spatial distribution) and over the entire expected time period (mean temporal distribution). Additionally, the arrival date and the departure date of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the Indian Meteorological Department with calculations for the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation of each of these variables.|$|E
2500|$|The {{correlation}} of the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation in counting independent discrete occurrences is useful scientifically.

For example, the charge e on an electron can be estimated by correlating the magnitude of an electric current with its shot noise.

2500|$|The {{accompanying}} plot shows {{these two}} solutions as surfaces {{in a space}} with horizontal axes of (sample excess kurtosis) and (sample squared skewness) and the shape parameters as the vertical axis. The surfaces are constrained by the condition that the sample excess kurtosis must be bounded by the sample squared skewness as stipulated in the above equation. [...] The two surfaces meet at the right edge defined by zero skewness. Along this right edge, both parameters are equal and the distribution is symmetric U-shaped for α = β < 1, uniform for α = β = 1, upside-down-U-shaped for 1 < α = β < 2 and bell-shaped for α = β > 2. [...] The surfaces also meet at the front (lower) edge defined by [...] "the impossible boundary" [...] line (excess kurtosis + 2 - skewness2 = 0). Along this front (lower) boundary both shape parameters approach zero, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities [...] at the left end x = 0 and [...] at the right end x = 1. [...] The two surfaces become further apart towards the rear edge. [...] At this rear edge the surface parameters are quite different from each other. [...] As remarked, for example, by Bowman and Shenton, sampling {{in the neighborhood of}} the line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0) (the just-J-shaped portion of the rear edge where blue meets beige), [...] "is dangerously near to chaos", because at that line the denominator of the expression above for the estimate ν = α + β becomes zero and hence ν approaches infinity as that line is approached. [...] Bowman and Shenton [...] write that [...] "the higher moment parameters (kurtosis and skewness) are extremely fragile (near that line). However the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> deviation are fairly reliable." [...] Therefore, the problem is for the case of four parameter estimation for very skewed distributions such that the excess kurtosis approaches (3/2) times the square of the skewness. [...] This boundary line is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the other parameter. [...] See section titled [...] "Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness" [...] for a numerical example and further comments about this rear edge boundary line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0). [...] As remarked by Karl Pearson himself [...] this issue may not be of much practical importance as this trouble arises only for very skewed J-shaped (or mirror-image J-shaped) distributions with very different values of shape parameters that are unlikely to occur much in practice). [...] The usual skewed skewed-bell-shape distributions that occur in practice do not have this parameter estimation problem.|$|E
