5|$|Though {{electric}} guitars {{had been}} used by industrial artists {{since the early days}} of the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as Throbbing Gristle displayed a strong anti-rock stance.

Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> {{city into}} the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social {{tensions}} of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> enterprise.|$|E

5|$|On 30 December 1947, {{members of}} the Irgun, a Jewish {{underground}} militia, threw bombs into a crowd of Arabs outside {{the gates of the}} Consolidated Refineries in Haifa, killing six and injuring 42.

The Jewish Haganah militia retaliated with a raid on the Arab village of Balad al-Shaykh, where many of the Arab refinery workers lived, in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre. Control of Haifa was critical in the ensuing civil war, since it was the <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> and oil refinery port in British Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a <b>major</b> <b>industrial</b> city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E
