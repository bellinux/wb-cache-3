25|$|During {{the time}} Burial was released, Extol was {{described}} as Norway's second best band by the Norwegian magazine Scream.

25|$|A {{man with}} a <b>metal</b> <b>press</b> did a fair sort of {{business}}. He set up for business {{on the porch of}} the hotel. He had constructed a die depicting the Hunterdon County courthouse, surrounded by the legend, Hauptmann Trial, Flemington, N.J. On the stand beside the press lay several hundred bright new pennies and several fine strips of copper. By running the copper strips through the press, together with the pennies, he turned out Lincoln heads backed by the courthouse and the legend. The pieces sold for five cents each, three for a dime.|$|E
25|$|Following the breakup, Anselmo devoted much of {{his time}} to a {{longtime}} side project, Superjoint Ritual. Having heard this, the Abbott brothers of Pantera (guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul) formed Damageplan with former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals and Bob Zilla on bass. Some fans blame Anselmo for Pantera's breakup, because of statements in the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>press.</b> Anselmo has accused journalists of twisting the facts, publishing what they think sells best. Pantera bassist Rex Brown, widely known as being the one neutral voice in the matter, has blamed both sides for the band's breakup.|$|E

500|$|Released on April 4, 1995, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing was {{not widely}} {{recognized}} in the metal community. The album sold 143copies in its first six months, but received favorable reviews from the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>press.</b> Its unusual musical ideas—a synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences—prompted Andy Stout from Metal Hammer to call it [...] "one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear {{for a very long}} time". Nevertheless, Townsend has repeatedly expressed his distaste for the recording. He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record's 2006 reissue, contending it contained only two great songs. He also deemed its production poor in interviews, referring to the album as [...] "basically a collection ...|$|E
500|$|For the Lexus LS, the Tahara plant {{developed}} new molds {{and enhanced}} assembly techniques and instituted measures aimed at increasing {{the precision of}} the sedan's fit and finish. The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding, allowing for seamless steel welds. A large sheet <b>metal</b> <b>press</b> was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly. Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring-loaded for a tighter fit. On the LS 400, engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from , with measurements made within on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold, to [...] When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.|$|E
500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>press</b> {{and the release}} of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were working on that were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} year, Pantera {{released its}} second studio album, Projects in the Jungle. Though {{still very much}} a glam metal album, the band members crafted songs that had less overbearing melodic influences than songs from Metal Magic. Another change was Terry Glaze's name, as he was henceforth credited as [...] "Terrence Lee". In addition, a music video for the album's lead track, [...] "All Over Tonight", was eventually created. Projects in the Jungle was also released on the band's independent Metal Magic Records label and produced by Jerry Abbott. In 1985, Pantera again released a full-length album on Metal Magic Records, titled I Am the Night. As with Projects in the Jungle, this album saw Pantera's sound becoming heavier (though still rooted in glam metal), and the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>press</b> took more notice of the band. Because of poor distribution, I Am the Night was a costly album to many fans. Around 25,000 copies of I Am the Night were sold. Pantera's second music video was produced for the track [...] "Hot and Heavy".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} to mid-1990s, a number of southern-California bands {{developed}} the style that would be called stoner rock. In 1992, Kyuss emerged from the Palm Desert Scene with Blues for the Red Sun. Critics have hailed it as [...] "a major milestone in heavy music," [...] while NME described their music {{as an attempt to}} figuratively melt [...] "a hundredweight of hot desert sand into metal". In 1992, San Jose doom metal band Sleep released their album Sleep's Holy Mountain, and along with Kyuss were heralded by the heavy <b>metal</b> <b>press</b> as leaders of the emerging stoner scene. These two bands {{were among the first to}} introduce a psychedelic groove to their doom-influenced sound. During the same year, New Jersey's Monster Magnet released their debut album Spine of God, which displayed fewer metal influences but was psychedelic and sludgy, in the vein of their California peers. Together with these three bands, southern-Californians Fu Manchu, who released their eponymous album in 1994, are credited with being [...] "one of the most enduring and influential bands" [...] of the genre. In 1994, San Francisco's Acid King and Britain's Acrimony released their debut albums, both of which adopted this psychedelic approach to doom metal. Other influential bands from this era include Clutch, Sons of Otis and Corrosion of Conformity.|$|E
