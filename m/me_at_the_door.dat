2500|$|Although Newman's deepest {{relationships}} were with men, {{he had many}} affectionate friendships with women. One {{of the most important}} was with Maria Giberne, who knew him in his youth and followed him into the Catholic Church. She was a noted beauty, who even at fifty was described by one admirer as [...] "the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life". A gifted amateur artist, she painted many portraits of Newman at various periods, as well as several of the pictures hanging in the Birmingham Oratory. Newman had a photographic portrait of her in his room and was still corresponding with her into their eighties. Emily Bowles, who first met Newman at Littlemore, was the recipient of some of his most outspoken letters on what he felt to be the mistaken course of the extreme infallibilists and his reasons for not [...] "speaking out" [...] as many begged him to do. When she visited Newman at the Birmingham Oratory in 1861, she was welcomed by him [...] "as only he can welcome"; she would never forget [...] "the brightness that lit up his worn face as he received <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> carrying in several packages himself".|$|E
60|$|He left <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> with {{a gentle}} {{encouraging}} pressure of my hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{was waiting}} for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> when I {{followed}} her to the house.|$|E
60|$|I {{answered}} him incongruously. We went below, and he wished <b>me</b> good-night <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of my cabin.|$|R
60|$|The hysterical passion swelled in her bosom--her quickened convulsive {{breathing}} almost beat on my face, as {{she held}} <b>me</b> back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what way}} should I come back? You didn't hear <b>me</b> knock <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> that's all. So Miss Spruce {{is really going}} to leave you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Euphemia met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> She had Pomona's {{baby in her}} arms. We walked {{together}} into the parlor.|$|E
60|$|By the way, when I {{went back}} to my lodging on that eventful day, the miller's wife met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Towards evening, the Duke of Losas passed my hotel, and, seeing <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{asked if}} I {{had read the}} manuscript.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am only {{alone for}} the moment," [...] she replied quietly. [...] "Maria and Jakob and Piet are waiting for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> north <b>door.</b> I {{did not know it}} would be closed." ...|$|R
60|$|As he took <b>me</b> out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> {{my mother}} ran towards us. Miss Murdstone said, 'Clara! {{are you a}} perfect fool?' and interfered. I saw my mother stop her ears then, and I heard her crying.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked back}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> from <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with {{a twinkle in}} her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|This {{time there}} was no audible reply. The boy showed himself to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "Please to come in, sir. I can't make {{anything}} of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The landlady met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> ‘Here, madam,’ said she, with a curtsey insolently low, ‘here is my bill. Would it {{inconvenience}} you {{to settle}} it at once?’ ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{went the}} next day Miss Sylvia herself met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> She caught my hand and drew me into the hall. Her eyes were softly radiant.|$|E
60|$|He went on {{and tried}} it, and sure enough he fetched <b>me</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on <b>the</b> very side that he had said I would be. I {{was not able to}} believe it then, and I don't believe it yet.|$|R
6000|$|Biddy {{was waiting}} for <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>door,</b> with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread. [...] "Biddy," [...] said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, [...] "I am not angry, but I am hurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Nag Nag Nag" [...] / [...] "Is That <b>Me</b> Finding Someone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Door</b> Again" [...] (live 75) (April 1979) ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{they could}} answer, Miss Verinder called to me softly. She met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of her room, {{with a light}} shawl, and with the counterpane from her own bed.|$|E
6000|$|The landlady met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> [...] "Here, madam," [...] said she, with a curtsey insolently low, [...] "here is my bill. Would it {{inconvenience}} you {{to settle}} it at once?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dr. Etherington met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of his appartement, {{and led me}} to {{an inner}} room without speaking. Here he stood gazing, for some time, in my face, with {{paternal}} concern.|$|E
6000|$|... “The first clean bite since I come aboard,” Harrison said to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> galley <b>door,</b> as he {{returned}} the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle. “Somehow Tommy’s grub always tastes of grease, stale grease, and I reckon he ain’t changed his shirt since he left ’Frisco.” ...|$|R
60|$|June the 1st, 1748, {{was the day}} {{of their}} marriage. It was December {{of the same year}} that first saw <b>me</b> {{alighting}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> great house; and from there I take up the history of events as they befell under my own observation, like a witness in a court.|$|R
60|$|He {{left the}} room, {{only to return}} once more. His head appeared, staring <b>at</b> <b>me</b> round <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> in a disembodied way, like the Cheshire Cat.|$|R
60|$|We separated. Ralph {{was unusually}} silent and serious {{on our way}} back. He took leave of <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of my lodging, very abruptly; without {{referring}} again to our visit to the hospital.|$|E
6000|$|Unlooked for I {{arrived on}} a rainy night, And you hailed <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> by the swaying light, [...] And I full forgot [...] That life might not Again be {{touching}} that ecstatic height.|$|E
60|$|I {{slipped away}} again this {{afternoon}} and went for that boat sail. We had a lovely time but were rather late getting in, and I hurried home with many misgivings. Aunt Martha met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now down again, Mr. Noel," [...] she said. [...] "Gently down again, in {{this fine}} sunlight. I {{have much to}} say to you, sir, which you never {{expected}} to hear from me. Let me ask a little domestic question first. They told <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house <b>door</b> Mrs. Noel Vanstone was gone away on a journey. Has she gone for long?" ...|$|R
60|$|I set off {{to morning}} mass with my son and little Armantine as usual, {{thinking}} all would be quiet so early in {{our part of the}} city, but before the service was over there was the dull roar of the populace in a fury to be heard in the distance, and Nicole met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> church <b>door</b> entreating <b>me</b> to get home as quickly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you have}} <b>me</b> meet him <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with a meek courtesy, and say, 'Oh, if you please, I'm {{ready to say}} Yes, thank you, if you'll {{be good enough to}} say, Will you'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From your manner {{when you}} talked to <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Well, my dear, you've been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped it on--ha-ha! But I don't want to get him away from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I desired {{first of}} all that the Empress’s Court should receive me at [...] {{the foot of the}} stairs, secondly, that she should meet <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> [...] of her bedroom, and, thirdly, that she should offer me an {{armchair}} to [...] sit on.|$|E
60|$|When I entered it, the follies of {{the world}} {{abandoned}} <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.|$|E
60|$|On the Friday I was not favoured by Mr. Fairlie with an interview. He had been, or had fancied {{himself to}} be, an invalid for years past, {{and he was}} not well enough to receive me. Miss Halcombe was the first member of the family whom I saw. She met <b>me</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house <b>door,</b> and {{introduced}} me to Mr. Hartright, who had been staying at Limmeridge for some time past.|$|R
6000|$|I slid on the West Shore line, I slid till midnight, {{and they}} dumped <b>me</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of a frowzy hotel in Elmira. Yes, they {{knew all about}} [...] "that man Clemens," [...] but {{reckoned}} {{he was not in}} town; had gone East somewhere. I had better possess my soul in patience till the morrow, and then dig up the [...] "man Clemens'" [...] brother-in-law, who was interested in coal.|$|R
60|$|Once face to {{face with}} him, I soon set things right. I really believe he had been half mad with his own self-imposed troubles, when he had {{declared}} he would give <b>me</b> <b>the</b> lie <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of Lucilla's room.|$|R
