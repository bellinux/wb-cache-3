In my case, the debt is not financial, but rather to the many people who helped me reach this point and supported me during the process. I owe a debt to my committee: My chair, Dr. Edith Barrett, whose patience and perserverence were a main source of encouragement to me;, Dr. Richard Cole served as a steady hand of advice during the process; and I owe Dr. Alejandro Rodriguez <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> time and interest go get me through comprehensive exams and to introduce me {{to the work of}} H.

I am very grateful for the opportunity I was given by you and Aker Solutions in Tromsø to work with such a relevant and exciting theme for my master’s thesis. Thank you for all of the advise, motivation and fruitful discussions. Also thank you to my co-supervisors, Gunnar Noer and Odd Erik Garcia, for much appreciated advise and help when needed. A huge thank you should also be extended to Chantal Claud for providing me with the data set that formed the entire basis for my thesis. Allowing me to use this data set is highly appreciated. During my work I received help with various tasks, and for that I wish to express ap-preciation to the following persons: Robert Jenssen, Jonas Nordhaug Myhre and Georg Elvebakk. Thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> time to help me.

25|$|Murray {{went into}} the US Open as the eighth seed, his lowest seeding at a major since Wimbledon 2008. In the first round he faced Robin Haase where he looked to be heading for a routine {{straight}} sets victory. However, early in the third set, Murray suffered a bout of cramp and Haase was able to claw his {{way back into the}} match. It looked to be going all the way to a deciding set but Murray was able to come back from a break down to take the match in four. In the second round Murray defeated qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets to set up a first meeting with Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round. He came through that encounter in four sets to set up a third meeting of the season with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Murray won in straight sets to record his first win over a top 10 player since his 2013 Wimbledon final victory over Novak Djokovic. It was Djokovic who he faced at the quarter-final stage of the tournament. In their 21st meeting the Serb proved to be too <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Murray, <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> win in four sets in a late match that lasted over three and a half hours.|$|R
25|$|His ankle {{problems}} {{became so}} severe {{years later that}} he had both his ankles surgically fused. His saga of injury and failed rehabs {{was connected to the}} use of painkillers by the doctor who was assigned to his case. Walton has said repeatedly in his broadcasts that he is just as <b>much</b> to blame <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> medication as the doctor was for giving it to him. In a June 8, 2010 interview on The Dan Patrick Show, Walton admitted to contemplating suicide for a time due to the constant pain resulting from injuries sustained during his NBA career. Walton's injuries, along with his 1978–1979 year-long protest, gave him an unpleasant, if not odd, record of missing the most games during an NBA playing career, when <b>taking</b> into account <b>the</b> number of years he was officially listed as a player on a team roster.|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation summarizes {{the best part}} of my life {{in the past three years}} and four months with the signal processing group at the Technische Universität Darm-stadt (TUD). This dissertation would not have been possible without the guidance, en-couragement, and help from my advisor, colleagues, collaborators, family, and friends over the past years. First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Prof. Ab-delhak M. Zoubir for offering me a precious opportunity to work in a vibrant group full of brilliant fellows. To me, you are not only a great researcher and leader, but also like a merciful father. From you, I have gained not only the knowledge but also self-confidence. Thank you so <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> me to <b>the</b> world of statistical signal processing. The first DSP lecture and the first excursion to ATLAS Electronik in 2008 were so fascinating and unforgettable. It has been a great pleasure to be a doctoral student under your supervison. I am also greatly indebted to Prof. Fredrik Gustafs-son from the Linköping University, Sweden for the collaborations in the past three years. I strongly agree with all your students that you are a never-ending source o...|$|R
40|$|The {{eruption}} of Merapi Mountain Yogyakarta in 2010 caused the damage of water-installation tool in Belang hamlet, Tlogolele village, Selo district, Boyolali county, Central Java. It caused {{the people in}} Belang hamlet difficult to gain clean water. The people had to walk far away to gain clean water for their sanitation and drinks, so a tool was needed very <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> clean water. Hydrant pump is simple to make and maintain. It can last for a long time. Fuel, lubricant, and electricity are not needed. We conducted this community service program for eight months, from April 2013 to November 2013 in Belang, Tlogolele, Selo, Boyolali. The purposes of making this hydrant pump are to overcome water shortages and to improve the welfare of society. The hydrant pump needed a water-resource reservoir to help the pressure which is needed by hydrant pump. This pressure {{will be used as}} dynamic pressure to lift water up from low place to higher place. In this program, we conducted some stages that is observation, socialization, pump manufacturing, pump installation, pump testing, pump utilization, pump developing, and pump maintenance. This hydrant pump program uses a hydrant pump with dimension of 4 inch which able to raise 80 -meter-high water in 500 -meter distance. The cost which was used for this program is Rp 11. 330. 000, 00. Rp. 10. 500. 000, 00 from DIKTI and Rp. 830. 000, 00 from the people of Belang. The innovation of using hydrant pump without foil becomes solution to handle water shortages in Belang. This program is put to good use by the people for gaining clean water. This program also successfully encourages people to solve water shortages in Belang. Furthermore, the result of this program is that the people start learning about hydrant pump so that the community can utilize this technology for agriculture and animal husbandry.

2500|$|It {{is unknown}} {{exactly how much}} wealth was confiscated from {{converted}} Jews and others tried by the Inquisition. Wealth confiscated in one year of persecution {{in the small town}} of Guadaloupe paid the costs of building a royal residence. There are numerous records of the opinion of ordinary Spaniards of the time that [...] "the Inquisition was devised simply to rob people". [...] "They were burnt only for the money they had", a resident of Cuenca averred. [...] "They burn only the well-off", said another. In 1504 an accused stated, [...] "only the rich were burnt". In 1484 Catalina de Zamora was accused of asserting that [...] "this Inquisition that the fathers are carrying out is as <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> property from <b>the</b> conversos as for defending the faith. It is the goods that are the heretics." [...] This saying passed into common usage in Spain. In 1524 a treasurer informed Charles V that his predecessor had received ten million ducats from the conversos, but the figure is unverified. In 1592 an inquisitor admitted that most of the fifty women he arrested were rich. In 1676, the Suprema claimed it had confiscated over 700,000 ducats for the royal treasury (which was paid money only after the Inquisition's own budget, amounting in one known case to only 5%). The property on Mallorca alone in 1678 was worth [...] "well over 2,500,000 ducats".|$|R
