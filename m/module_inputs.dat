50|$|It is {{important}} to note that not all drum <b>module</b> <b>inputs</b> have the same capabilities. Besides the obvious differences between mono, stereo and three-way inputs, which support mono (single-zone), stereo (dual-zone) or three-zone pads accordingly, there are additional differences in the capabilities of stereo inputs. While some stereo inputs only support pads with a piezo and a switch (piezo/switch inputs), others also support pads with two piezos (piezo/piezo inputs). Also, some stereo inputs are only intended to be split into two mono inputs by using an insert cable (mono/mono inputs). Certain pairs of stereo inputs can be configured to form one three-way input.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} efficiently answering reachability queries over views of provenance graphs, derived from executions of workflows that may include recursion. Such views include composite modules and model fine-grained dependencies between <b>module</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. A novel view-adaptive dynamic labeling scheme is developed for efficient query evaluation, in which view specifications are labeled statically (i. e. as they are created) and data items are labeled dynamically as they are produced during a workflow execution. Although the combination of fine-grained dependencies and recursive workflows entail, in general, long (linear-size) data labels, we show that for a large natural class of workflows and views, labels are compact (logarithmic-size) and reachability queries can be evaluated in constant time. Experimental results demonstrate the benefit of this approach over the state-of-the-art technique when applied for labelin...|$|E

40|$|Executing {{instructions}} from the cache {{has been shown to}} improve the defect coverage of real chips. However, although the faults detected by such tests can be deteremined, there has been no technique to target test generation for an undetected fault. This paper presents a novel technique to map pre-computed test sequences at the module level of a processor, to sequences of instructions. The module level pre-computed test sequence is translated into a temporal logic property and the negation of the property is passed to a bounded model checker. The model checker produces a counter-example for the temporal logic property. This counter-example trace contains the instruction sequence that can be applied at the primary inputs to produce the pre-computed test sequence at the <b>module</b> <b>inputs.</b> This technique has no restrictions on the type of test sequences, so {{it can be used to}} map test sequences for any kind of fault to processor instructions. It can also be used in the design phase to produce validation tests. ...|$|E

40|$|The rise in {{complexity}} of SOC (System-on-Chip) architectures has brought into focus {{the need for}} better communication models for SOCs. The traditional bus based approach is reaching its limit {{with the emergence of}} high core count SOCs. The theory and practices of wired communication networks is being applied to tackle communication issues in complex SOCs. This {{is referred to as the}} Network on Chip (NOC) model. Routers are one of the most important elements of an on chip network. The underlying architecture of a router is based on a crossbar switch as it offers higher throughput and lower latency due to point-to-point architecture. Homogenous sizes of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> in the router may not be efficient as some cores may be underutilized while some of them may be overloaded. A heterogeneous size of the <b>input</b> <b>module</b> is preferred for the predicted traffic but bursty in nature.
