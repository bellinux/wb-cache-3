5|$|Fare {{control is}} in a glass-enclosed headhouse {{building}} off of Main Street. The headhouse has {{a feature that}} is unusual to the subway system: it uses recordings of birds to try to scare away city pigeons, and these bird recordings play every few <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The system was installed because of issues with pigeons entering the headhouse and leaving feathers and droppings both inside and around the building. Previous efforts, like spiked ledges, had been ineffective in curbing the pigeon population of the area immediately next to the station.|$|E
5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> and stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E

There remained a few sceptics about this interpretation until, a decade or so later, American physicists using satellite data regularly detected bursts of electrons 25 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after solar flares. This was just one component, but to Wild and his colleagues a very exciting one, of a much wider world-leading research program.|$|E
25|$|As {{in other}} ostariophysan fishes, the swim bladder has two chambers. The {{anterior}} chamber {{is connected to}} the inner ear by a series of small bones derived from neck vertebrae called the Weberian apparatus, which greatly enhances its hearing capability. The posterior chamber extends along the whole length of the body and maintains the fish's buoyancy. E. electricus has a well-developed sense of hearing. This fish has a vascularized respiratory system with gas exchange occurring through epithelial tissue in its buccal cavity. As obligate air-breathers, electric eels must rise to the surface every ten <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to inhale before returning to the bottom. Nearly eighty percent of the oxygen used by the fish is obtained in this way.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{to other}} players {{resulted}} in another recall to the England side for the Third Test against New Zealand at Headingley in July 1965, where he scored 310 not out. This innings spanned over eight hours, and included 52 fours and five sixes – 238 runs or 77% of his innings. Commentators {{at the time}} said {{that he might have}} broken the existing Test record of 365 within another 90 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> if his captain, Mike Smith, had not felt it necessary to declare the innings closed. However, a week later during the First Test against South Africa, he suffered a blow to the head from a short-pitched delivery by Peter Pollock. This was before helmets came into use, and he was forced to retire hurt on 7 not out.|$|E
25|$|The {{episode is}} usually {{considered}} to {{have been written by}} Ray Rigby, based on a story by Patrick Brawn; however, in an interview with Wheeler W. Dixon in May 1999, Brian Clemens, the creator of the series, claims to have written it. The episode sets were designed by Alpho O'Reilly. Production by ABC Weekend Television was wrapped up on 30 December 1960. The episode premiered on ABC in the Midlands and North of England on Saturday 7 January 1961 at 10pm. Only the first 20 <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the first act of the episode survive; the remaining two acts are thought to be lost. The extant footage ends with the sequence in which Keel's fiance Peggy is shot, before the introduction of John Steed. It has been released on DVD as a bonus feature by A Home Video in its Emma Peel Megabox collection, alongside the two complete surviving episodes from Season 1.|$|E
25|$|The 33rd and {{its sister}} regiments {{advanced}} cautiously toward the Federals, who by now {{had opened up}} on them from {{the far side of}} the field, with the Confederates returning fire. At one point about halfway across, the commander of the 16th Alabama ordered his regiment to halt; Adams ordered the 33rd to stop, as well. The two regiments resumed their advance after about ten <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> though in the darkness they now had to deal with stragglers firing on them from behind, as well as the enemy shooting at them to their front. One incident of friendly fire claimed the life of Lieutenant Alfred Moore: he was accidentally shot in the neck from behind by a straggler, who was roundly cursed by his comrades and ordered to cease fire. A few companies of the 33rd began to fall back, but Adams quickly corralled them and got them back into the fight. With the attack beginning to stall, artillery batteries were brought up in the darkness together with supporting troops under Brigadier General John Jackson; these finally drove the Federals back, with the 33rd Alabama crossing their breastworks on {{the far side of the}} field, and heading straight for the nearby 6th Indiana.|$|E

500|$|Morrowinds soundtrack was {{composed}} by Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose previous soundtracks for Total Annihilation and Icewind Dale had earned some acclaim from the gaming press. In a Bethesda press release, Soule stated that the [...] "epic quality" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series was [...] "particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music" [...] that Soule enjoys composing [...] "the most". Outside Bethesda press releases, some have criticized Morrowinds soundtrack. In their reviews of the game, both GameSpot and GameSpy criticized {{the length of the}} game's soundtrack and praised its general production quality. In the words of GameSpot's Greg Kasavin: [...] "The very first time you boot up Morrowind, you'll be treated to a memorable, stirring theme filled with soaring strings and booming percussion. You'll proceed to hear it literally every five <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> during play." [...] Soule was aware of the problem and chose to create a soft and minimalist score so as not to wear out players' ears.|$|E
500|$|From 1975 until 2016, on the {{day before}} the Organic Chemistry exam—which is often {{on the first day of}} finals—at {{precisely}} the stroke of midnight, the Columbia University Marching Band occupied Butler Library to distract diligent students from studying. After a forty-five <b>minutes</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of jokes and music, the procession then moved out to the lawn in front of Hartley, Wallach and John Jay residence halls to entertain the residents there. The band then plays at other locations around Morningside Heights, including the residential quadrangle of Barnard College, where students of the all-women's school, in mock-consternation, rain trash – including notes and course packets – and water balloons upon them from their dormitories above. The band tends to close their Orgo Night performances before Furnald Hall, known among students as the more studious and reportedly [...] "anti-social" [...] residence hall, where the underclassmen in the band serenade the graduating seniors with an entertaining, though vulgar, mock-hymn to Columbia, composed of quips that poke fun at the stereotypes about the Columbia student body.|$|E
