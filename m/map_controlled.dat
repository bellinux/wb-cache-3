40|$|Interoperability between {{distributed}} {{information systems}} requires an agreement of metadata standards, protocols, interfaces and controlled vocabularies. Such an agreement is often pursued by adopting standards published by {{organizations such as}} the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). These standards are general and do not fully dictate the control vocabularies used for annotating metadata. Therefore, when communities share metadata they encounter semantic conflicts because of the â€œstageâ€�, â€œgage heightâ€� and â€œwater elevationâ€� are different concepts that are semantically equivalent. To be able to solve these semantic heterogeneities, VINE, the Vocabulary Integration Environment tool, was created.

The harvest of citrus fruit in a large scale has brought the consequences in the postharvest deterioration.

40|$|Ovine {{ricotta cheese}} is a {{traditional}} Sicilian dairy product characterised by high humidity and a short shelf life (2 - 4 days when refrigerated). The increasing demand for fresh food has prompted manufacturers to develop special packaging techniques, such as modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), that can extend the shelf life and maintain the organoleptic characteristics of ovine ricotta cheese. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the shelf life of fresh MAP-packed ovine ricotta cheese by monitoring the microbiological, chemical, physical and organoleptic characteristics of the product. Samples of a single batch were packed in MAP or vacuum packed and stored at 4 °C for 24 and 7 days, respectively. Water activity, pH, physicochemical parameters and microbiological characteristics were examined. A sensory panel rated the product’s main organoleptic characteristics (colour, odour, flavour and texture). Results showed that <b>MAP</b> <b>controlled</b> the development of any unwanted microflora, but did not affect the development of intrinsic lactic floras or chemical parameters. Sensory analysis revealed that overall the MAP-packed ricotta remained acceptable for up to 15 days of storage. The vacuum-packed ricotta cheese, however, showed a progressive deterioration in organoleptic characteristics from day 5 onward and therefore had a shorter shelf life. In conclusion, the ability of MAP to extend the shelf life of a traditional regional product (such as fresh ovine ricotta cheese) guarantees consumers a quality product and provides opportunities for manufacturers to expand their markets beyond national boundaries...|$|E
40|$|The {{internet}} {{is composed of}} thousands of networks, linking millions of users at academic, industrial and governmental institutions all over the world, offering opportunities to collaborate and to share resources, such as documents, software and data. The ever-increasing number of users confronts the network with an expansion in traffic density, leading to congestion situations during transfer of the data. In addition, future network services which offer an increasing amount of voice and video applications, demand more bandwidth and a high throughput. A cost-effective way to deliver bandwidth is to send multiple wavelengths through a single fibre through an optical network at very high data rates, using a (dense) wavelength-division multiplexing technology that operates in the 1550 nm wavelength window. Considering this context, packet switched all-optical networks not only offer much higher bandwidths than electronic networks due to their ultrafast serial processing, but they also provide for protocol heterogeneity (i. e. transparency of transport layer). In realizing such a network, the following requirements must be met. Optical buffering and contention within the network must be avoided, trading in bandwidth must minimize processing and electronic bottlenecks must be overcome by pushing all electronics to {{the periphery of the}} network. An integral part of an optical communication node is a wavelength routing mechanism, sorting optical packets along three dimensions: space, time and wavelength. This paper outlines the basis ideas of a Kohonen self-organizing feature <b>map</b> <b>controlled</b> all-optical router system, providing optimal paths between users without suffering contention problems...|$|E

The model includes age-dependent susceptibility for infection; age-dependent sensitivity for detection; environmental MAP build-up in five separate areas of the farm; in utero infection; infection via colostrum and waste milk, and it allows for realistic culling (i. e. due to other diseases) by including a ranking system. We calibrated the model using a unique dataset from Denmark, including 102 random farms with no control actions against spread of <b>MAP.</b> Likewise, four <b>control</b> actions recommended in the Danish <b>MAP</b> <b>control</b> program were implemented in the model based on reported management strategies in Danish dairy herds in a <b>MAP</b> <b>control</b> scheme. We tested the model parameterization in a sensitivity analysis.

Although {{it is possible to}} eradicate MAP from the farm by implementing all four control actions from the Danish <b>MAP</b> <b>control</b> program, it was not economically attractive since the expenses for the control actions outweigh the benefits. Furthermore, the three most popular control actions against the spread of MAP on the farm were found to be costly and inefficient in lowering the prevalence when used independently...|$|R

40|$|Objective  To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant of sevoflurane for controlled hypotension in endoscopic sinus surgery. Methods  Forty-eight patients (ASA Ⅰor Ⅱ) scheduled for endoscopic sinus surgery were randomly assigned into two groups (n = 24) : control group (group I) and dexmedetomidine group (group Ⅱ). In both groups, intravenous injection of midazolam, propofol, fentanyl, and atracurium besilate was given to induce anesthesia, and propofol, fentanyl, atracurium besilate, together with sevoflurane inhalation were used to maintain anesthesia. The radial artery was cannulated to monitor the invasive mean arterial pressure (<b>MAP).</b> <b>Controlled</b> hypotension was induced by adjusting the sevoflurane concentration in group Ⅰ. In group Ⅱ, within 15 min to 30 min before the induction of anesthesia, dexmedetomidine was administered in a dose of 0. 8 μg/kg via intravenous infusion pump, then maintained at 0. 4 μg/(kg·h). Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain the target blood pressure {{at the beginning of}} surgery. The MAP was maintained at 65 - 75 mmHg up to the end of operation. Meanwhile, the heart rate (HR), MAP, epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were recorded at the time of induction of anesthesia (T 0), beginning of controlled hypotension (T 1), 30 min after controlled hypotension (T 2), and at the time when extubation was performed (T 3). Blood gas analysis and determination of lactic acid concentration were conducted using the blood drawn from the radial artery during the operation. The surgical field quality was assessed based on Fromme scores of surgical field quality (SSFQ). Meanwhile, the dose of sevoflurane, propofol, and fentanyl, MAP, the recovery time of anesthesia, and the incidence rate of untoward eﬀects were recorded. Results  The doses of propofol, fentanyl and sevoflurane, and MAC value in group Ⅱwas significantly diminished compared with group Ⅰ(P ＜ 0. 01). In addition, the surgical field quality was better, whereas SSFQ was obviously lower in group Ⅱ(P ＜ 0. 05). The HR at the time of T 0 to T 3, and the MAP, E, and NE at the time of T 0 and T 3 in group Ⅱwere obviously lower compared with group Ⅰ(P ＜ 0. 05). The results of blood gas analysis and lactic acid, and the time of regaining consciousness and extubation showed no statistical diﬀerence between the two groups (P ＞ 0. 05). Moreover, the incidence rates of nose distending pain, headache, delirium, and shivering were obviously lower in group Ⅱ(P ＜ 0. 05). However, the incidence rate of bradycardia needing intervention was higher in group Ⅱthan in group Ⅰ. No severe cardiovascular emergency was noted in the two groups. Conclusion  Dexmedetomidine can reduce the dose of anesthetic drugs, improve the cardiovascular stability during the perioperative period, accelerate the time to recovery of consciousness, and is safe and eﬀective in assisting controlled hypotension during endoscopic sinus surgery. </p...|$|E
