40|$|Cichlid fishes of Lake Tanganyika {{display a}} variety of <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> parental care behaviors, {{including}} polygamous and monogamous mouthbrooding and substrate breeding, cooperative breeding, as well as various alternative reproductive tactics such as sneaking and piracy. Moreover, reproductive behaviors sometimes vary within species both in space and in time. Here, I survey reports on <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> parenting behaviors of Lake Tanganyika cichlid species and address the evolution of <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> parental care patterns and sexual dimorphism.

5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have descended to the bottom to <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5000|$|However, to many {{biologists}} {{it seemed}} unlikely until recently, that <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> sex {{could be a}} primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> sex appeared to be lacking in certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree. However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for meiosis <b>and</b> hence <b>mating.</b> To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis was once {{considered to be a}} descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, G. intestinalis was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. [...] These results suggested that G. intestinalis is capable of meiosis <b>and</b> thus <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> sexual reproduction. Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> sexual reproduction, was also found in G. intestinalis. [...] Other protists for which evidence of <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> sexual reproduction has recently been described are parasitic protozoa of the genus Leishmania, Trichomonas vaginalis, and acanthamoeba.|$|R

5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother. Males emerge before females and both genders are sexually receptive from emergence in July to early August, when they <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> brood. English naturalist Charles Darwin postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by natural selection to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing {{of the emergence of}} females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, Tibicen duryi and T.parallela, which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests. Many have yellow markings located on their tergites (dorsal portion), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and {{the next two or}} three hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some way of dealing with winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter due to the lack of food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E

Two years later, he had obtained his First Mate's ticket, and in 1898, he was certified as a Master Mariner, qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world.|$|E
40|$|Female {{control of}} nonrandom mating {{has never been}} genetically established, despite being linked to {{inbreeding}} depression and sexual selection. In order to map the loci that control female-mediated nonrandom mating, we constructed a new advanced intercross recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) accessions Vancouver (Van- 0) and Columbia (Col- 0) and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> seed yield traits. We genotyped a population of 490 RILs. A subset of these lines was used to construct an expanded map of 1, 061. 4 centimorgans with an average interval of 6. 7 +/- 5. 3 centimorgans between markers. QTLs were then mapped for female-and male-mediated nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> seed yield traits. To map the genetic loci responsible for female-mediated nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> seed yield, we performed mixed pollinations with genetically marked Col- 0 pollen and Van- 0 pollen on RIL pistils. To map the loci responsible for male-mediated nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> seed yield, we performed mixed pollinations with genetically marked Col- 0 and RIL pollen on Van- 0 pistils. Composite interval mapping of these data identified four QTLs that control female-mediated nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> five QTLs that control female-mediated seed yield. We also identified four QTLs that control male-mediated nonrandom <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> three QTLs that control male-mediated seed yield. Epistasis analysis indicates that several of these loci interact. To our knowledge, {{the results of these}} experiments represent the first time female-mediated nonrandom mating has been genetically defined...|$|R

5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|For a while, Red and {{her pack}} are happy, feeding off the {{plentiful}} carrion left by receding flood waters, but the pack's {{way of life}} is upset by an invasion of large Acrocanthosaurus, huge meat-eating dinosaurs. The added competition for food puts strain on the pack, as does the unexpected death of one of the chicks. A fight erupts between the male raptor and Red's sister. Red, torn between a prospective <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> her kin, tries to defuse the situation. Two Acrocanthosaurus watch the commotion and take the opportunity to attack the Utahraptor. Meanwhile, a Kronosaurus ambushes one of the chicks on the beach. Seeing the danger, Red lures the female Acrocanthosaurus into deep water where the larger predator is dragged under by the Kronosaurus. Red saves her family, but at a price—her consort is forced away by Red's sister.|$|E

Establishing himself as a fisherman, Thomas Sr. achieved his <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> then skipper qualifications, entitling him to captain a fishing vessel sailing from the port. In 1902 he was taken on by Chambers, one of the largest boat owning families in Lowestoft, to crew and then captain their ketch George Borrow, in which he remained for thirteen years.

Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafes. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the Lord of the Manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone. Many crew members of Vampyr had worked with Dreyer on his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Returning crew members included cinematographer Rudolph <b>Maté</b> <b>and</b> art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

A schooner was torn from its moorings at Chicago, and crashed into nearly a dozen smaller vessels while being blown about. The schooner Belle from Racine, Wisconsin, went missing amid the storm, while the barge Sumatra broke up and capsized near Milwaukee, taking the lives of four crew members; the captain, first <b>mate,</b> <b>and</b> cook were safely rescued.

5|$|Some frogs {{have become}} adapted for {{burrowing}} {{and a life}} underground. They tend to have rounded bodies, short limbs, small heads with bulging eyes, and hind feet adapted for excavation. An extreme {{example of this is}} the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) from southern India which feeds on termites and spends almost its whole life underground. It emerges briefly during the monsoon to <b>mate</b> <b>and</b> breed in temporary pools. It has a tiny head with a pointed snout and a plump, rounded body. Because of this fossorial existence, it was first described in 2003, being new to the scientific community at that time, although previously known to local people.|$|E

In both vertebrates and invertebrates, recent investigations into mate choice for immunity, tradeoffs between reproduction and immunity, and {{the relationships between}} post-mating processes and immune function have revealed that <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> immunity are also intimately linked to each other. Here, we focus on invertebrates and critically examine the evidence that immunity is under sexual selection, both pre- and post-mating, and explore other hypotheses linking <b>mating</b> <b>and</b> immunity. We find little evidence for a consensus regarding which theories best account for the accumulating empirical data. However, we suggest that progress can quickly be made by exploiting the intrinsic strengths of invertebrate model systems...|$|R
