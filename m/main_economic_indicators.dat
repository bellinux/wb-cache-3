In fact, the analysis of the evolution of the relative levels of farm income (the <b>main</b> <b>economic</b> <b>indicator</b> used in the analysis) has not shown a clear discontinuity between 2007 and 2008. In particular, of the 7 considered types of farms, 4 have shown an increase, while the remaining types have experienced a reduction of income level (Table 9 in the Appendix). Furthermore, other Authors have used the full series (i.e. before and after the change) for analysis of farm income without reporting relevant discontinuities in the data series (Henke and Salvioni 2013).|$|R

40|$|For new EU member {{countries}} economical disparities among particular regions are characteristic.

At present it is possible to notice the risk of further increase in differences between fast developing areas and low developed regions. The metropolitan most economic developed regions are characterised by advanced infrastructure, high level of urbanization, small distances between a producer and a market and by decisive inflows of foreign investments to a country. When evaluating basic economic and social disparities one can on the territory of the new EU member states determine the developed and unadvanced areas and split its space into the core and peripheral areas. For the classification of particular areas, the administrative units called NUTS were used, which are also used in the uniform classification of the Eurostat.
