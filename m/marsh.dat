5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the <b>marsh</b> shrew is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although the <b>marsh</b> shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the <b>marsh</b> shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without the <b>marsh</b> shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The <b>marsh</b> shrew typically has a longer snout than that of the American water shrew, which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E

5|$|Cope and <b>Marsh</b> {{came from}} very {{different}} backgrounds. Cope {{was born into}} a wealthy and influential Quaker family based in Philadelphia. Although his father wanted his son to work as a farmer, Cope distinguished himself as a naturalist. In 1864, already a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cope became a professor of zoology at Haverford College and joined Ferdinand Hayden on his expeditions west. In contrast, <b>Marsh</b> would have grown up poor, the son of a struggling family in Lockport, New York, {{had it not been for}} the benefaction of his uncle, philanthropist George Peabody. <b>Marsh</b> persuaded his uncle to build the Peabody Museum of Natural History, placing <b>Marsh</b> as head of the museum. Combined with the inheritance he received from Peabody upon his death in 1869, <b>Marsh</b> was financially comfortable (although, partly because of Peabody's stern views on marriage, <b>Marsh</b> would remain a lifelong bachelor).|$|E

5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked <b>Marsh</b> for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. <b>Marsh</b> and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from a piece in The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against <b>Marsh</b> and Powell. <b>Marsh</b> himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
50|$|The {{draining}} of the Qurna <b>Marshes</b> {{also called}} The Draining of the Mesopotamian <b>Marshes</b> occurred in Iraq {{and to a}} smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear {{large areas of the}} <b>marshes</b> in the Tigris-Euphrates river system.

Many parasites have been recorded on the <b>marsh</b> rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites of the <b>marsh</b> rice rat).|$|E

5|$|<b>Marsh</b> {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales.

5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the <b>marsh</b> rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that of the <b>marsh</b> rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the <b>marsh</b> rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the <b>marsh</b> rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the <b>marsh</b> rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt <b>marsh</b> contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the <b>marsh</b> becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common <b>marsh</b> plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt <b>marsh</b> here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E

5|$|Parasitologist John Kinsella {{compared}} the endoparasites of <b>marsh</b> rice rats in a saltwater <b>marsh</b> at Cedar Key and a freshwater <b>marsh</b> at Paynes Prairie, both in Florida, in a 1988 study. He found {{a total of}} 45species, a number unequaled in rodents. This {{may be related to}} the diverse habitats the rice rat uses and to its omnivorous diet; it eats a variety of animals which may serve as intermediate hosts of various parasites. The endoparasites in the saltwater <b>marsh</b> were dominated by trematodes (flukes), and those of the freshwater <b>marsh</b> by nematodes (roundworms). Endoparasites were found in the gastric mucosa (which lines the stomach), the cavity of the stomach, the small intestine, the cecum, the large intestine, the pancreatic duct, the bile ducts, the mucus of the liver, the pulmonary arteries, the abdominal cavity, and the pleural cavity. While the <b>marsh</b> rice rat harbors a number of host-specific species, such as the nematode Aonchotheca forresteri, other parasite species, such as the lone star tick (pictured), are shared with other mammals. Compared to the hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), Florida <b>marsh</b> rice rats usually harbor fewer individual ectoparasites of each species. Borrelia, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, has been identified in some ticks that infect the <b>marsh</b> rice rat and it has been identified as a possible natural reservoir for Borrelia.|$|E
