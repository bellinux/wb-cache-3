The anclabris is depicted as if it were made out of marble, and two sphinxes—beings that serve as allegories for the secrets and mysteries of the Dionysian cult—are supporting the table. On the anclabris stands a small statue of Hermes, next to which hangs a mask with pipes. Above this mask <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the raven of Apollo. On {{the left side of the}} table, a goat is seen resting on the ground, surrounded by the symbols of the cult. Finally, a wicker basket can be found to the right of the table, out of which a snake emerges; this basket motif is often found in Dionysian artwork, and seemingly was an object of great importance to the religion.|$|E

25|$|The origin {{behind the}} hydronym 'Wear' is {{uncertain}} but is generally {{understood to be}} Celtic. The River Vedra on the Roman Map of Britain <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the River Wear. The name may be derived from Brythonic *wẹ:drā, which meant 'a bend' (c.f Welsh gwair).

The name 'Wear' has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning 'river of blood'.|$|E
25|$|While Turing's proof {{shows that}} there can be no general method or {{algorithm}} to determine whether algorithms halt, individual instances of that problem <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to attack. Given a specific algorithm, one can often show that it must halt for any input, and in fact computer scientists often do just that as part of a correctness proof. But each proof has to be developed specifically for the algorithm at hand; there is no mechanical, general way to determine whether algorithms on a Turing machine halt. However, there are some heuristics that can be used in an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Lewis (played by John L. Adams) — A {{physiotherapist}} {{who helps}} Johnny regain his strength after his coma. Bruce is an open-minded spiritual junkie {{as a result}} of a religious upbringing by his pastor father. He is Johnny's best friend and frequently his voice of reason, and <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the reason for the divergence in this series when compared to the novel or 1983 movie (Johnny never tried to kill Greg Stillson before the election). An episode in season 2 even featured a vision of an alternate reality where instead of being a physical therapist, Bruce was a reverend who never met Johnny after waking up from his coma. And thus, with the absence of his guidance, this version of Johnny became unstable, deranged, and driven mad by his abilities.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} certain rare mineral {{resources}} that, because of limitations due to distance and prevalence, were also moved along these rudimentary trade networks that {{towards the end}} of the culture would begin to become more and more important to the survival of the members of this society. The most important of these minerals was salt, which is critical for human existence. Indeed, the Cucuteni-Trypillia saltworks located at the brackish spring at Lunca, Neamţ County, Romania, <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> the oldest in the world. There is evidence to indicate that the production of this valuable commodity directly contributed to the rapid growth of the society. This saltworks was so productive that it supplied the needs of the entire region. For this to happen, the salt had to be transported, which may have marked the beginning of a trade network that developed into a more complex system over time.|$|E
25|$|A slew of {{centrality}} measures {{exist to}} determine the ‘importance’ of a single node in a complex network. However, these measures quantify {{the importance of a}} node in purely topological terms, and the value of the node does not depend on the ‘state’ of the node in any way. It remains constant regardless of network dynamics. This is true even for the weighted betweenness measures. However, a node <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> centrally located in terms of betweenness centrality or another centrality measure, but may not be ‘centrally’ located {{in the context of a}} network in which there is percolation. Percolation of a ‘contagion’ occurs in complex networks in a number of scenarios. For example, viral or bacterial infection can spread over social networks of people, known as contact networks. The spread of disease can also be considered at a higher level of abstraction, by contemplating a network of towns or population centres, connected by road, rail or air links. Computer viruses can spread over computer networks. Rumours or news about business offers and deals can also spread via social networks of people. In all of these scenarios, a ‘contagion’ spreads over the links of a complex network, altering the ‘states’ of the nodes as it spreads, either recoverably or otherwise. For example, in an epidemiological scenario, individuals go from ‘susceptible’ to ‘infected’ state as the infection spreads. The states the individual nodes can take in the above examples could be binary (such as received/not received a piece of news), discrete (susceptible/infected/recovered), or even continuous (such as the proportion of infected people in a town), as the contagion spreads. The common feature in all these scenarios is that the spread of contagion results in the change of node states in networks. Percolation centrality (PC) was proposed with this in mind, which specifically measures the importance of nodes in terms of aiding the percolation through the network. This measure was proposed by Piraveenan et al.|$|E

500|$|In {{a similar}} case, Organic Seed Growers & Trade Ass'n v. Monsanto Co., a {{coalition}} of farmers filed suit to challenge twenty-three of Monsanto's patents for glyphosate-resistant crops. The plaintiffs argued that if their crops became [...] "contaminated by transgenic seed, which <b>may</b> <b>very</b> <b>well</b> <b>be</b> inevitable given the proliferation of transgenic seed today, they could quite perversely also be accused of patent infringement". The plaintiffs sued to declare Monsanto's patents invalid and asked Monsanto to [...] "expressly waive any claim for patent infringement [...] may ever have" [...] against the farmers and to [...] "memorialize that waiver by providing a written covenant not to sue". However, the case was dismissed {{for lack of a}} controversy. The suit did not demonstrate instances of current harm or future risk. Monsanto also gave assurances that it did not plan to sue in cases of inadvertent infringement when a grower was not also using glyphosate on their crop. Monsanto's patent for the soybeans at issue in this case expired in 2014, prior to which Monsanto announced that it will no longer enforce the licenses associated with the soybeans.|$|E
500|$|Berry was {{religious}} {{as well as}} worldly, {{and collected}} relics as keenly as other types of objects.
