Satellite functionality was integrated into the Base Software in subversions from customer sites via the Redfern Projects Office, and managed by the Base Manager into release candidates and separate administration integrated enhancements into documentation and user guides.Two Major branches were developed off the elements from version 2 through to version 4 of the core based initially on AT&T NCR 9800 series Mainframe architecture - creating a UNIX branch and an NT/Windows Server Branch. COBOL Sources were inter-changeable but software interfacing with the OS, such as transaction queues, differed to handle the various implementations written in C and linked into the Microfocus COBOL run time system linked object. scripting also varied across branches to handle operations and non-functional requirements.Major versions featured <b>multicurrency</b> (with spot positions) and multi lingual. To cater for this various front ends were created such as BTM (Branch Terminal Manager), Branch 2000, BEAM handled transactions from Tellers.Major version 6 included three database back ends: Oracle, Informix and DB2.UNIX Was implemented in practice on HP-UX, IBM AIX and AT&T NCR System V UNIX variants. ksh or Korn Shell was the primary script language.Version 7.5 onwards of The BaNCS system was developed by Tata Consultancy Services business unit TCS Financial Solutions.It was developed in COBOL.|$|E

40|$|Zimbabwe faces {{growth and}} {{external}} competitiveness challenges, {{as indicated by}} its low trend growth and investment, declining share in the world exports, high current account deficits, and external debt. The stock-flow approach to the equilibrium exchange rate reveals that the real exchange rate experienced periods of sizeable overvaluation, both prior to the 2008 economic collapse and under the current <b>multicurrency</b> regime. While overvaluation hampers GDP growth, as well as growth and employment in export sectors, we have not found that undervaluation would raise it. Replacing the <b>multicurrency</b> regime anchored in the US$ by the South African rand as the sole transaction currency would help reduce overvaluation and stimulate exports and growth. Under any currency regime, Zimbabwe needs to adhere to sound macroeconomic policies, avoid overspending on public wages, and create environment conducive for investment...|$|E

There was great change in nature and patterns of sources of income, particularly for informal traders, a sector which had become the backbone of almost all householdsâ€™ income in pre-MCS era. MCS brought with it the inherent problem of inadequacy and, in some cases, unavailability of smaller denominations.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a case study which explores the use of {{qualitative}} accounting information to measure business confidence in the external environment in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe experienced a very difficult external environment between the years of 2000 and 2008, characterized by social tension, political strife, and economic instability heightened by record hyperinflation and commodity shortages. However Zimbabwe’s external environment dramatically changed in 2009 when a <b>multicurrency</b> system was introduced and the local currency was abandoned together with all manner of price and foreign currency controls which had created commodity shortages. From qualitative accounting information contained in the financial reports of Delta Corporation Limited Zimbabwe, this paper compiled a record of business confidence in the external environment in Zimbabwe {{from the time of}} introduction of the <b>multicurrency</b> system one year post the general elections held on 31 March 2013. It was found that in the absence of hyperinflation and commodity shortages such as experienced {{at the peak of the}} economic meltdown in Zimbabwe in 2008, business confidence in the external environment in Zimbabwe may depend on how well a company was performing as opposed to the broader social-political-economic mix of factors in the external environment.

40|$|The study empirically {{evaluated}} the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) foreign exchange interventions {{in for the}} period pre and post dollarization. There have been different forms and motives of intervention used by the RBZ {{in line with the}} exchange rate system and fundamental macroeconomic problems at each given point in time. There has been sterilised and unsterilized intervention together with direct and indirect interventions. Success ranges from the fixed exchange rate system when the main reason for intervention was to defend the fixed parity hence success was mainly imminent for the period 1985 to 1995 when the foreign exchange reserves were more than enough but the reserves started to be depleted towards 2000 and hence led to the move towards the flexible exchange rate system from the Auction system of 2003 to the actual flexible exchange rate system leading to the abandonment of the local currency as it continued to lose value relative to foreign currencies. Intervention became indirect and fairly successful from 2008 after the adoption of the <b>multicurrency</b> system. Reasons behind unsuccessful intervention being depletion of foreign currency reserves due to persistent Balance of Payments deficits, declining levels of productivity, vulnerability to natural disasters such as droughts, rampant corruption, policy inconsistency and incredibility. However if the above fundamental issues are not addressed, {{there is no need for}} the country to return its own currency since it will never stand against other foreign currencies hence recommend the need to continue with the <b>multicurrency</b> exchange rate regime...|$|E

40|$|Is the {{exchange}} rate expectation formation process rational? This age old question is looked at with survey data on exchange rate expectations at multiple forecast horizons. This helps to circumvent the risk premium issue and isolate {{the exchange}} rate expectational rationality factor. The econometric procedure used is the Phillips-Hansen fully modified ordinary least squares test. This allows one to conduct an unrestricted cointegration analysis and also differentiate between strong and weak forms of rationality. To do this separate tests are made of the bivariate (two currencies) and the multivariate (<b>multicurrency)</b> systems approach. Rationality in {{the exchange rate}} expectation formation process is not upheld in either the weak or strong form test, at any forecast horizon. ...|$|E

For <b>multicurrency</b> interest rate derivatives portfolios examined in this paper, the relative performance of scenario simulation is erratic when compared with standard Monte Carlo results. Although by design the discrete distributions used in scenario simulation converge to their continuous distributions, convergence appears to be slow, with irregular oscillations that depend on portfolio characteristics and the correlation structure of the risk factors. Periodic validation of scenario-simulated VaR results by cross-checking with other methods is advisable.

40|$|Zimbabwe has {{undergone}} a decade of economic decline during the hyperinflationary period. This was its worst in its history. An attempt to jumpstart the economy saw February 2009 ushering in the <b>multicurrency</b> era. The foreign currency shortage which was prevalent in the hyperinflationary period did not ease off. Neither substantial foreign direct investment nor meaningful domestic investment flowed into the economy. A low level of cash resources existed within the economy due to low levels of investment. Business operating costs erode these cash resources. This paper suggests to Zimbabwe businesses possible measures to complement the conventional approaches to managing costs in this multi currency era given the scanty levels of investment injections into the economy. No research {{has been carried out}} in Zimbabwe on how operating costs may be contained given the low levels of domestic and foreign direct investment. Given the importance of investment for growth, as the economy slowly experiences growth, it draws on measures which were applied in some developed and emerging economies in the management of costs. The descriptive survey method and desk research were carried out to enable the gathering of data. Questionnaires and an interview guide were used to gather data. A sample of 30 business units was selected in the Gweru [...] Major findings were that most entities maintain financial records not for cost control purposes but just to comply with regulations; most business units lack personnel with the cost management skills to practice lean management. The paper recommends cost variance reporting,lean management practices and a culture of continuous improvement. The paper presents an overview of the economy over the hyperinflationary era up to the <b>multicurrency</b> era, a review of related literature, the methodology applied, measures to contain operational costs in the multi currency era and the conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this essay are threefold: first, to provide a microtheoretic framework that incorporates the transaction motive for holding money in a <b>multicurrency</b> world; second, {{to show how the}} recent "currency substitution theory" can be embedded in the micro choice model we develop; third, to derive some comparative static results from a macro model that allows agents to hold different currencies. Recently, Cuddington noted in a paper discussing the issue of currency substitution that we still lack an explicit microtheoretic framework clarifying the transaction roles of different currencies in a <b>multicurrency</b> world. Tobin also seems to call for an analysis of the service yields of different currencies. The next section discusses what properties a transaction technology describing the transaction roles of currencies should satisfy. Section 3. 1 then formalizes the individual choice problem that determines the demand for the various currencies. The second part of section 3 describes how the currency substitution literature is related to our model. Several results on currency substitution are shown to be nested hypotheses of our general model. A short-run general equilibrium model for two open economies is developed in the fourth section in order to derive some implications in the presence of currency substitution. The way in which expectations are introduced into the model can be described as a form of bounded rationality. The exchange rate in the model has the feature that it is an element of the price to holders of one currency of every asset and commodity denominated in the other currency. In the last section we investigate the issue of currency substitution on a macro level. By comparing comparative static results for economies with and without currency substitution present, we are able to analyze the qualitative and quantitative aspects of currency substitution. Mathematics is relegated to the appendices, together with a list of symbols...|$|E

If lognormal dynamics are assumed for forward LIBOR or forward swap rates in two currencies, the forward exchange rate linking the two currencies can only be chosen to be lognormal for one maturity, with the dynamics for all other maturities given by no-arbitrage relationships. Alternatively, one could choose forward interest rates in only one currency, say the domestic, to be lognormal and postulate lognormal dynamics for all forward exchange rates, with the dynamics of foreign interest rates determined by no-arbitrage relationships.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{forecasting}} accuracy of correlation derived from implied volatilities in dollar-mark, dollar-yen, and mark-yen options from January 1989 to May 1995. As a forecast of realized {{correlation between the}} dollar-mark and dollar-yen, implied correlation is compared against three alternative forecasts based on time series data: historical correlation, RiskMetrics' exponentially weighted moving average correlation, and correlation estimated using a bivariate GARCH (1, 1) model. At the one-month and three-month forecast horizons, we find that implied correlation outperforms, often significantly, these alternative forecasts. In combinations, implied correlation always incrementally improves the performance of other forecasts, but not the converse; in certain cases historically based forecasts contribute no incremental information to implied forecasts. The superiority of the implied correlation forecast holds even when forecast errors are weighted by realized variances, reflecting correlation's contribution to the dollar variance of a <b>multicurrency</b> portfolio. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper derives the arbitrage-free pricing {{formulae}} and hedging {{ratios of}} path-dependent <b>multicurrency</b> {{interest rate derivatives}} in continuous time. The exchange rates and the zero-coupon bond prices are modelled by multivariate log-normal processes with an arbitrary number of random factors. The exact pricing formulae are obtained by solving the time-evolution equation of the contingent claims described by a multi-dimensional Kolmogorov field equation. Applications to the Asian options and Bermudan options are given as examples. Several European options on currency swaps, forward and futures contracts are also illustrated as special cases. These exact solutions are factor-independent and explicitly depend on the instantaneous covariances of the returns of the exchange rates and the zero-coupon bonds.

40|$|Abstract,The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to {{investigate}} the effects of the size of a pension fund on its investment performance (efficiency) in Zimbabwe from 2010 to 2013 post <b>multicurrency</b> era. This is an empirical study based on quantitative data that includes the returns of the portfolio of pension funds and their asset sizes. This is a deductive approach that lets the researcher tests hypotheses and theory. The research sample was 20 stand-alone pension funds and 9 fund administered pension funds using a cluster sample. Data analysis revealed to a greater extent that no relationship exists between the pension fund size and its investment performance based on the data that was presented on Zimbabwean pension fund. The implications of the above results mean that data on pension funds coming from third world economies like that of Zimbabwe cannot be used to predict the performance of pension funds because a lot of factors come into play and that the markets are not efficien...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} the bid-ask spreads in euro rates increased relative to the corresponding bid-ask spreads in the German mark (DM) prior to the currency union. This comes with a decrease in transaction volume in the euro rates relative to the previous DM rates. The starkest example is the DM(euro) /yen rate in which the spread has risen by almost two-thirds while the volume has almost halved. We propose a microstructure theory for a system of multiple exchange rates in which spreads are endogenously determined. It is argued that the elimination of cross rates due {{to the introduction of}} the euro reduced the intra-temporal risk sharing capacity of the <b>multicurrency</b> dealership market. A second explanation for the increase in the euro bid-ask spreads and the relative euro volume loss is based on an increase in the information content of order flow in euro rates relative to previous DM rates.
