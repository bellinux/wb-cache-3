500|$|In {{the theory}} of electroweak interaction, the left-handed {{component}} of electron's wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the electron neutrino. This means that during weak interactions, electron neutrinos behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a [...] and be converted into the other <b>member.</b> <b>Charge</b> is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions {{are responsible for the}} phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom. Both the electron and electron neutrino can undergo a neutral current interaction via a [...] exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron elastic scattering.|$|E

5000|$|There may be tax {{advantages}} {{obtained for the}} group if one <b>member</b> <b>charges</b> another <b>member</b> for services, even where the <b>member</b> bearing the <b>charge</b> derives no benefit. To combat this, the rules of most systems allow the tax authorities to challenge whether the services allegedly performed actually benefit the <b>member</b> <b>charged.</b> The inquiry may focus on whether services were indeed performed as well as who benefited from the services. [...] For this purpose, some rules differentiate stewardship services from other services. Stewardship services are generally those that an investor would incur for its own benefit in managing its investments. Charges to the investee for such services are generally inappropriate. Where services were not performed or where the related party bearing the charge derived no direct benefit, tax authorities may disallow the charge altogether.|$|R
