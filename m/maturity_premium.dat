40|$|Using a rich {{data set}} for the UK for over a century, {{we find that the}} {{relation}} between the equity risk premium and the government bond <b>maturity</b> <b>premium</b> is nonlinear and subject to stochastic regime switching. We identify a regime in which both premia are jointly characterized by low volatility and another regime in which both premia are characterized by high volatility. The occurrence of the high volatility regime chronologically coincides with major changes in the pound exchange rate. The low volatility regime has a higher probability of turning up over two consecutive years than the high volatility regime, but it is not perceived by investors to be an absorbing regime. The lagged <b>maturity</b> <b>premium</b> is a strong predictor of the equity risk premium only in the regime of low volatility. In addition, the lagged equity premium is a predictor of the <b>maturity</b> <b>premium</b> also in the low volatility regime. This result on regime-dependent bidirectional predictability is robust to alternative definitions of the equity premium, and to the inclusion of real interest rate and real growth effects.

40|$|We {{model and}} {{calibrate}} the arguments in favor and against short-term and long-term debt. These arguments broadly include: <b>maturity</b> <b>premium,</b> sustainability, and service smoothing. We use a dynamic equilibrium model with tax distortions and government outlays uncertainty, and model maturity as {{the fraction of}} debt {{that needs to be}} rolled over every period. In the model, the benefits of defaulting are tempered by higher future interest rates. We then calibrate our artificial economy and solve for the optimal debt maturity for Brazil {{as an example of a}} developing country and the U. S. as an example of a mature economy. We obtain that the calibrated costs from defaulting on long-term debt more than offset costs associated with short-term debt. Therefore, short-term debt implies higher welfare levels. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to measure Reisz's (1999) empirical implication about bond yields against data: yields demanded on corporate debt should be higher the later the uncertainty facing the firm is resolved. We conduct our study looking at new bond issues made by industrial corporations between 1987 and 1996. Based on this sample, we find strong evidence that firms with more delayed resolution of uncertainty offer higher yields once default and overall risks have been controlled for. We also find that the <b>maturity</b> <b>premium</b> on corporate bonds is monotonic {{in the pattern of}} Temporal Resolution of Uncertainty (TRU) facing the firm. Both results are mitigated for firms whose managers enjoy fewer information asymmetries. We also find that firms with more delayed TRU rely less heavily on debt and tend to issue shorter-term bonds. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a set {{of tests}} of models of {{relative}} capital asset pricesis developed. The tests are used to examine how well the models explain <b>maturity</b> <b>premiums</b> on Government bonds, though they are perfectly general and hence {{could be applied to}} stocks or other assets. Allowance is made in the tests for the nonobservability of investors' optimal per capita consumption (or expected marginal utility). It is found that the returns on Government bonds bear a systematic risk which is better measured by their covariability with aggregate per capita consumption than with the returns on the NYSE stock market index, the latter being the surrogate-wealth portfolio typically used to measure risk in the traditional Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin CAPM. ...|$|R

40|$|Post Keynesian {{economists have}} now embraced {{endogenous}} money and exogenous interest rates for 30 years. Nevertheless the IS-LM diagram, with its explicit assumption of monetary exogeneity and interest rate endogeneity remains widely accepted by most mainstream economists, and still appears in most money & banking and macroeconomic textbooks. Post Keynesians recognize that interest rates do not adjust as the textbooks maintain to equilibrate saving and investment or the {{supply and demand}} for “loanable funds. ” Bank Rate (BR) is now widely recognized as the main instrument of monetary policy, set exogenously by the CB to achieve its stabilization targets and maintained at that level between interest rate meetings. By an arbitrage process other short-term market rates are held equal to BR plus a specific asset differential, reflecting expected differences in liquidity, maturity, collateral and tax status, and borrowers ’ risk among securities. Long term rates are also determined by an arbitrage process, and held equal to the capital markets’ expectations of future values of BR plus a positive <b>maturity</b> <b>premium,</b> which reflects creditors ’ preferences to hold assets of shorter maturity than debtors’ preferences to issue securities. 1 This lecture is a summary of selected material from my forthcoming book, SHAKING THE INVISIBL...|$|E

The analytical method used is descriptive method that describe or provide a picture of the object under study through previous data as it is without doing the analysis and make conclusions apply to the public, then compare how the revenue recognition made by the company with SEAS No. 36. Results of research conducted indicates that revenue recognition made by the company using Basic Cash and long-term contracts and the application is not in accordance with SFAS No. 36. This is evident from the company recognizes revenue too fast and did not adjust to the income received that does not reflect the amount actual income for that period in accordance with SFAS No. 36, while premium income that can be recognized is the premium that has been matured in that period, while premiums have been received but not yet recognized as a deposit <b>maturity</b> <b>premium.</b> So the hypothesis is: It was alleged that Revenue Recognition Premiums Life Insurance Services is not in accordance with SFAS No. 36 in RO D'Citizen PT Asuransi Takaful Family in Makassar "Accepted"...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{and estimates}} a monetary model that offers {{an explanation of}} some puzzling features of observed returns on equities and default-free bonds. The key feature of the model is that some assets other than money play a special role in facilitating transactions. The model is capable of producing a low risk-free rate, a high equity premium, and an average positive relationship between <b>maturity</b> and term <b>premium</b> for default-free bonds. The model's implications for the joint distribution of asset returns, velocity, inflation, money growth, and consumption growth are also compared to the behavior of these variables in the U. S. economy. Copyright 1996 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{explanation}} for the empirical finding that yields on risk-free bonds are increasing with their <b>maturity</b> (the term <b>premium).</b> The key ingredient in the explanation is that investors not only dislike risk, but also dislike uncertainty about the current trend growth rate of the economy. The model setup is one where investors observe consumption growth rates and use these observations to estimate {{the current level of}} a mean reverting trend growth rate. At a given point in time, uncertainty about the state is given by the variance of the estimate. Disliking uncertainty, investors bias their estimate of the current trend downwards. On average this lowers short term interest rates relative to long run interest rates. The model can account quantitatively for the observed term premium in the US data and correctly predicts the flattening of the real yield curve since the early nineties...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} the stockholder reactions to convertible debt announcements made by Western European companies. We simultaneously test the impact of issuer characteristics, security design features, the stated uses of proceeds and the aggregate convertible debt issue volume. Our {{evidence suggests that the}} announcement returns are positively influenced by the <b>maturity</b> and conversion <b>premium,</b> and negatively influenced by the Eurobond feature, the level of post-conversion equity dilution and the aggregate convertible debt volume. We also document significant interaction effects between the issuer characteristics, the convertible debt design and the convertible debt market condition. First, we find that hot market convertibles are structured to be more 'debt-like' than non-hot market convertibles. Second, we show that the influence of the issuer characteristics depends on the convertible debt design: equity-like convertibles are perceived as instruments able to reduce adverse selection and financial distress costs, whereas debt-like convertibles are perceived as predominantly straight debt. Lastly, we demonstrate that issuer and security characteristics have much more power for explaining the investor reactions during non-hot markets than during hot markets.

40|$|Paper {{examines}} how open access {{policy of the}} SNB affects interbank money market rates in normal and stress periods • More specifically, paper focuses on potential segmentation resulting from: – Direct access to SNB liquidity; – Foreign vs. domestic financial institutions. • Access and cross-border premia extracted from CHF Libor – interbank rates spreadPaper Objectives/Findings (cont’d) • Reported evidence shows (positive) access and (negative) cross-border premia • Access premium weakens over the different stages {{of the financial crisis}} as the CB provides more liquidity to the banking sector • Cross-border premium is more stable over time My Comments CHF LIBOR-OIS spread controls for tensions in money market – Spread however includes credit and liquidity components; – Relative weights are changing over time-> in some periods, it (essentially) captures market liquidity risk, in some it captures credit risk concerns (McAndrews et al. (2008), Sarkar (2009), Schwarz (2010)) – Proxy is good for tensions in general, bad for individual credit/liquidity components. Might be interesting to separate the two components as – Market liquidity is influenced by (a) access policy, and (b) liquidity directly provided by the CB; – Liquidity argument is used to explain the size of the access premium. My Comments (cont’d) Further microstructure effects: – To what extent does market liquidity/activity vary across maturities? – How do risk premia behave across <b>maturities?</b> – Access <b>premium</b> might be subject to seasonality induced by payments flows or operational framework (see McAndrews, 2009) – In the LSDV framework used in the paper, more active banks have more weight (more trades) -> is this an issue?

40|$|This master's thesis {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} electricity spot and futures prices and the futures premium in the Nordic electricity market. The objective {{of the study is}} to identify, whether a nonzero futures premium exists in the Nordic electricity market, and to gauge its economic significance and the factors affecting its behavior. Furthermore, the forecasting ability of electricity futures over the future spot price is examined, and finally the existence of arbitrage opportunities is tested by constructing synthetic futures and comparing their prices with actual futures prices. The data in this study consists of daily electricity spot prices in the Nord Pool power exchange for years 2000 - 2011, and electricity futures price data for weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly contracts during the same period. The price data is complemented by coal price data and Nordic level data on water reservoir levels and electricity demand, which are the variables used to examine the behavior of electricity prices and the futures premium. The results show that the futures premium in the Nordic electricity market is nonzero and positive for the time period 2000 - 2011, generally increasing with contract <b>maturity.</b> The futures <b>premium</b> exhibits very high variation, but on average the relative futures premium ranges from being close to zero with weekly futures to levels above 20 percent for yearly futures. The OLS regression analyses show that deviations from historical water reservoir levels have an inverse relationship with electricity spot and futures prices so that above average water reservoir levels {{have a negative impact on}} electricity prices, and vice versa. Coal price and the overall electricity demand exhibit a positive relationship with electricity prices, and the influence of all these physical factors diminishes with the futures' time to maturity, being the strongest for shorter maturity futures and weak or inexistent for futures with longer maturities. On the contrary, deviations from historical water reservoir levels indicate a positive relationship with the futures premium, this relationship being negative for coal price and electricity demand. Furthermore, consistent with the expectations theory, electricity futures seem to possess strong explanatory power over the future spot price in the Nordic electricity market, whereas no evidence of time-varying risk premiums is found. Finally, the comparison of synthetic futures prices to actual futures prices reveals that with yearly futures the mean relative price difference is close to zero, indicating that no opportunities for arbitrage exist, but for quarterly and monthly futures the price difference is different from zero on average, reaching a maximum mean value of 2. 0 % for 1 -month contracts. This indicates that opportunities for risk-free profits may exist for arbitrageurs using synthetic futures to mimic the actual futures contracts. These arbitrage opportunities continue to prevail when transaction costs are at levels below two percent of the futures price, although their economic significance is low...|$|R
