5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). <b>Methenamine</b> is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E

25|$|Formaldehyde {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} bacterial products for toxoid vaccines (vaccines that use an inactive bacterial toxin to produce immunity).

Urinary tract infections are also often treated using a derivative of formaldehyde (<b>methenamine),</b> a method often chosen because it prevents overuse of antibiotics and the resultant development of bacterial resistance to them. In an acid environment, <b>methenamine</b> is converted in the kidneys to formaldehyde, which then has an antibacterial effect in the urinary tract.

50|$|As the {{mandelic acid}} salt (generic <b>methenamine</b> mandelate, USP) {{it is used}} for the {{treatment}} of urinary tract infection. It decomposes at an acidic pH to form formaldehyde and ammonia, and the formaldehyde is bactericidal; the mandelic acid adds to this effect. Urinary acidity is typically ensured by co-administering vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or ammonium chloride. Its use had temporarily been reduced in the late 1990s, due to adverse effects, particularly chemically-induced hemorrhagic cystitis in overdose, but its use has now been re-approved because of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance to more commonly used drugs. This drug is particularly suitable for long-term prophylactic treatment of urinary tract infection, because bacteria do not develop resistance to formaldehyde. It should not be used in the presence of renal insufficiency. <b>Methenamine</b> in the form of cream and spray is successfully used for treatment of excessive sweating and concomitant odour.|$|E
