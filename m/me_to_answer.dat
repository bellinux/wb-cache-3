500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The film cuts to {{the closing}} credits from {{a shot of the}} top {{apparently}} starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate, saying, [...] "I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> it." [...] The film's script concludes with [...] "Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we – FADE OUT". [...] Nolan said, [...] "I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me — it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene — and this is what I tell people — is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing." [...] Also, Michael Caine explained his interpretation of the ending, saying, [...] "If I'm there it's real, because I'm never in the dream. I'm the guy who invented the dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but he {{was down}} in Northamptonshire on business. Besides he hadn't any letter from <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer.</b> I shouldn't like him to think--" ...|$|E
60|$|Robert advises <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> {{and it may}} be as well, perhaps.|$|R
60|$|He signed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> him--rose--removed his coat--and {{rolled up}} the shirt-sleeve on his left arm.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. She did. I shouldn't {{like you}} <b>to</b> have led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the <b>answer.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The colour showed plainly in Jacinta's face. [...] "I {{think that}} is another question. One, too, which you could {{scarcely}} expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you truly, or to answer you {{according}} to the good-natured idea of never saying any ill of one's neighbour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray {{do not ask}} me such {{questions}} Lady Scudamore, said I turning away my head, for it is not fit for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> them." ...|$|E
50|$|Quayle: Let <b>me</b> try <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the {{question}} one more time. I {{think this is}} the fourth time that I've had this question.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do not press <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reply,' <b>answered</b> Rose. 'The {{question}} {{does not}} arise, and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because it is {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give <b>answers</b> which must refer, whether they are affirmative or negative, to what I have heard in confession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are {{an elder}} {{and a better}} man than I. [...] . It would be insolent in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that question, except in one way, [...] . and--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say it!--I {{know what}} you mean; but I can't admit so much as that. There! Guess what you like, but don't press <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions!" ...|$|E
60|$|Har. Jun. Leave <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that: Assure {{yourself}} I {{love you}} violently, and, {{if you are}} wise, you will make some difference betwixt Towerson and me.|$|E
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. It confuses <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>answered.</b> It discourages me. I cannot bear men and women. I {{have to run}} away. I {{must run}} away now [he tries to].|$|R
60|$|It {{is not my}} custom to be {{discouraged}} by a first failure. I looked over the letters which had been sent <b>to</b> <b>me</b> in <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> my advertisement, and wrote to another of the applicants, who very promptly came <b>to</b> see <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not intimately, thank goodness! As {{a general}} rule, {{when a man}} begins to abuse his wife <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I find that the Lord gives <b>me</b> {{wherewith}} <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> him according <b>to</b> his folly; and we part with a coolness between us. I laugh.' ...|$|R
6000|$|PROSERPINE (stubbornly). Yes, I do. I'm only a beer teetotaller, not a {{champagne}} teetotaller. I don't like beer. Are there any letters for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> Mr. Morell? ...|$|E
60|$|Yours of to-day {{just this}} moment received, and the Secretary having left it is {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to-day. I have not received your letter from Erie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} {{resident}} patient, in a nervous fashion, [...] "of {{course it is}} hard to say that. You can hardly expect <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that, Mr. Holmes." ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Mr. Wagner {{had taught}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> smoke. I <b>answered</b> by {{offering}} my new acquaintance a cigar.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make any <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> this woman, but I took off my hat and bowed. The sail filled, and we glided away.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{plain and}} uninteresting {{statement}} of fact, and appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> require no <b>answer.</b> I read on.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{was very}} wrong of <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you as I did yesterday,' she said. 'I {{know it was}} my own fault that Lord St. Erme was allowed to follow us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain was}} a merry-minded man, and he laughed. [...] "It is pretty hard for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that question," [...] said he; [...] "suppose {{you go in}} and find out for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hear, hear! But {{it hardly}} is {{becoming}} in <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> up {{to a man}} so much older than I, or I could say more. Suppose we draw a line here for the present, sir, and get indoors?' ...|$|E
60|$|Morton (slowly and seriously). He {{has left}} <b>me</b> here <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the {{unanswered}} question you asked him. (Enter Don Jose and Col. STARBOTTLE, R. and L.) I {{am here to}} tell you that I am his father, and that he is Alexander Morton.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{without giving}} <b>me</b> time <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> {{he turned and}} left the place, {{followed}} by the others. Only at the gateway the diviner wheeled round on his crutches and glared at us both, muttering something with his thick lips; probably it was curses.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} decide immediately," [...] she said, gently. [...] "A few days hence {{it will be}} early enough for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> send my <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Bulstrode." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he doesn't," [...] Hunterleys declared, [...] "he {{will have}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to. Seriously, I think you {{young people are}} very wise and very foolish and very much to be envied. What does Sidney say about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Wallace {{is a very}} charming young lady, Mr. Ten Eyck," [...] I rejoined, as soon as wonder {{would allow}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> [...] "and I am not {{surprised}} you speak of her in terms of so much admiration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Pleydell,' said Glossin, {{with great}} composure, 'I presume, {{if you were}} my counsel, you would not advise <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> upon {{the spur of the}} moment to a charge which the basest of mankind seem ready to {{establish}} by perjury.' ...|$|E
60|$|Aur. Are you so lost to shame? Morat, Morat, Morat! You {{love the}} name So well, your every {{question}} ends in that; You force <b>me</b> still <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> you, Morat. Morat, who best could tell what you revealed; Morat, {{too proud to}} keep his joy concealed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my honour, sir, {{unless you}} are pleased to be more explicit, it is {{impossible}} for <b>me</b> either <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> or understand you," [...] said the lady; [...] "you speak too seriously for a masquerade pleasantry, and yet not clearly enough to make your earnest comprehensible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Gunning," [...] {{replied the}} man curtly, [...] "captain {{commanding}} His Highness' police. What I want {{is that you}} gentlemen offer no resistance, but come with <b>me</b> quietly <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> on the morrow before Judge Parry, a charge of contravening the laws against betting and gambling." ...|$|R
