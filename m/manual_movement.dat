50|$|Focused {{ultrasound}} {{similar to}} high intensity focused ultrasound, but at much lower powers {{is applied to}} tissues {{in conjunction with the}} local application of pharmacological agent. The ultrasound source (or transducer) is pulsed on and off, and moved in a defined pattern to sonicate the tissue of interest. The pulsing of the ultrasound serves two purposes: to agitate the tissue matrix by extending and compressing it and to keep the tissue from absorbing too much energy and ablating it, so preventing necrosis. The <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> of the transducer allows for control of the sonicated volume of tissue and where the drug may penetrate more readily.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{sprouting}} of corticospinal tract (CST) fibers after spinal cord injury (SCI) contributes to recovery of motor functions. However, the neuroanatomical mechanism underlying the functional recovery through sprouting CST fibers remains unclear. Here we investigated the pattern of reorganization of CST fibers below the lesion site after SCI in adult macaques. Unilateral lesions were made at the level between the C 7 and the C 8 segment. The extent of spontaneous recovery of manual dexterity was assessed with a reaching/grasping task. The impaired dexterous <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> were gradually recovered after SCI. When anterograde tract tracing with biotinylated dextran amine was performed to identify the intraspinal reinnervation of sprouting CST fibers, {{it was found that the}} laminar distribution of CST fibers was changed. The sprouting CST fibers extended preferentially into lamia IX where the spinal motor neuron pool was located, to innervate the motor neurons directly. Instead, few, if any, CST fibers were distributed in the dorsal laminae. The present results indicate that CST fibers below the lesion site after SCI in macaques are reorganized in conjunction with the recovery of dexterous <b>manual</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first manifestation, {{referred}} to as the [...] "Triangular Movement Cycle" [...] or TMC, was a simple paper-based learning technique that was primarily a <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> cycle using physical cue-cards, which allowed for manual-spaced repetition to elicit psychological retention of information. Its origins, however, are not very clear. Using TMC, teachers would move the cards for the student in a one-on-one setting according to either the correct or incorrect feedback from the student.This presented challenges for the teacher or tutor using this method. The first challenge lies in the fact that, although TMC lent itself well to a two-party learning group (i.e. teacher & student), it could also be done by the student themselves on their own. It was a very easy system to utilize once learned, however, it was found exceptionally difficult to teach the complex movement cycle and principles behind such to students, especially where a linguistic barrier was present. The second challenge lay in that the educator needed to create and remember innumerable cue-cards or create custom master lists in order to know the correct answers — and properly guide the student, thus progressing or digressing the card in play. TMC often failed to keep the attention of many students owing to the fact that cards were not very visually appealing. To make them so required tremendous effort — and was very time consuming.|$|E
40|$|When humans interact, {{they may}} {{make use of}} a range of resources, such as head movements, facial expressions, <b>manual</b> <b>movement,</b> body posture and speech. It is assumed that {{participants}} both produce and perceive this stream of information in a differentiated way: Some segments are attended to as belonging to the content of the discourse while others are rather backgrounded and may serve to regulate the interaction in terms of speakership and turn-taking. This thesis is an anthology comprised of four studies that all touch upon the role of these backgrounded segments of behaviour in both spoken and signed interaction. In particular, I analyse <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> phases as well as self-touching behaviour {{in the area of the}} face and the head. It is found that participants may tweak individual movement phases (such as withholding the retraction to a stable rest position or transforming the <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> into a self-touch) that provide an in situ interpretation of the sequential structure (e. g., that a given line of action is complete) and may occasion the emergence of hierarchically structured levels of degrees of involvement (e. g., it may indicate suspension of a given line of action). As a result, I suggest that speakership is best understood as a continuum, rather than a binary concept (i. e. speaker and listener). It turns out that all roles within this spectrum are not static ones but have to be enacted and performed in order to be perceived as such. I show that participants in signed and spoken conversation exploit the same resources, i. e. segments of <b>manual</b> <b>movement,</b> as part of the same practices in order to regulate speakership and turn-taking. Some of these resources are apt to be ascribed a linguistic status as part of the system of a given sign language (e. g., Swedish Sign Language and American Sign Language), while in spoken language they are often regarded as an add-on to vocal resources. This a priori divide between what counts as sign and gesture respectively obscures areas of overlap (cf. Kendon 2008) and, in the light of the results, it is suggested to treat them in the same way. Furthermore, with regard to the geographic distance and linguistic diversi- ty of the languages herein analysed (Swedish Sign Language, Japanese and German), I discuss whether the use of <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> phases as interac- tional practice may be considered a universal in human interaction...|$|E

40|$|How {{specialized}} is {{the infant}} brain for perceiving the facial and <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> displayed by others? Although {{there is evidence}} for a network of regions that process biological motion in adults [...] including individuated responses to the perception of differing facial and <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> [...] how this cortical specialization develops remains unknown. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy [Lloyd-Fox, S., Blasi, A., & Elwell, C. Illuminating the developing brain: The past, present and future of functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 34, 269 - 284, 2010] to investigate the ability of 5 -month-old infants to process differing biological movements. Infants watched videos of adult actors moving their hands, their mouth, or their eyes, all in contrast to nonbiological mechanical movements, while hemodynamic responses were recorded over the their frontal and temporal cortices. We observed {{different regions of the}} frontal and temporal cortex that responded to these biological movements and different patterns of cortical activation according to the type of movement watched. From an early age, our brains selectively respond to biologically relevant movements, and further, selective patterns of regional specification to different cues occur within what may correspond to a developing "social brain" network. These findings illuminate hitherto undocumented maps of selective cortical activation to biological motion processing in the early postnatal development of the human brain...|$|R
40|$|Haemolymph {{and tissue}} samples of Haliotis rubra × laevigata hybrid abalone were taken during a routine stock {{movement}} procedure on an Australian abalone farm {{to look for}} biochemical and histological changes associated with anaesthesia and/or <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> of the abalone, {{both of which are}} used in commercial stock movement operations. Sections of the left kidney, the gill and the surface of the foot were examined under light microscopy and a scoring system was used to measure observed changes and compare treatment groups to controls. The left kidney of anaesthetised abalone contained less protein and haemocytes than control or manually moved abalone on the day of anaesthesia (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), but returned to baseline levels within 1 day. The foot muscle of anaesthetised and moved abalone had areas of denuded epithelium 5 days after anaesthesia (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Protein, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, chloride, calcium and potassium levels were measured in the cell-free haemolymph. The protein levels were significantly elevated compared to controls on the day after anaesthesia and <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), but declined to baseline levels within 3 days. There {{were no significant differences in}} the other measured ions. Benzocaine anaesthesia, with or without subsequent movement, led to greater histological changes in tissues of abalone, than <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> without anaesthetic. Comparison of physiological and histopathological changes with haemolymph immune assays may show whether the non-destructive haemolymph sampling can provide early warning of stressors that cause tissue damage. The methods used can be applied to scientifically assess any husbandry procedures with a view to improve stock management and productivity...|$|E

40|$|In {{evolutionary}} linguistics, experiments using artificial signal {{spaces are}} being used to investigate the emergence of speech structure. These signal spaces need to be continuous, non-discretised spaces from which discrete units and patterns can emerge.

40|$|Body {{image is}} one of the very {{important}} concept for understanding the child's psychological functioning. In our earlier studies, we examined the development of mentally retarded children's body image by means of human figure drawings, and illustrated a closer relationship between the development of motor function and body image. Many handicapped children have difficulty acquiring the body image. This study was attempted, first, to investigate the development of abilities of body image in mentally retarded children by means of three body image tasks, and second, {{to examine the relationship between}} the development of abilities of body image on these tasks and their human figure drawings. Subjects were 24 children with mental retardation enrolled in elementary and junior high school classes for children with disabilities. All chidren were given the Kyoto Child Guidance Clinic Infant Development Test. The children's developmental stages as measured on that test ranged from the two-dimensional operational stage to the three-dimensional operational stage. All the subjects were adminstered the body image tests in order to trace the development of their body image. The tests consisted of the task on imitation of other's <b>manual</b> <b>movements,</b> the task on pointing out the parts of self body, and the task on pointing out the parts of others' body. Moreover each subject was given the Goodenough Draw-A-Man Test. The results were as follow: 1) Difference in body image scores among three types of body image tasks indicated the developmental pattern. But, body image scores on all types increased with the progress through the developmental stages from the stage of two-dimensional operation to that of three-dimensional operation. 2) The correlation between the score of the body image task on imitation of others' <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> and the Draw-A-Man Test score was significant...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{studies have}} shown that during the {{preparation}} of a goal-directed movement, perceptual selection (i. e., visual attention) and action selec-tion (the selection of the movement target) are closely coupled. Here, we study attentional selection in situations in which delayed saccadic eye <b>movements</b> and delayed <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> are prepared. A dual-task paradigm was used which combined the movement preparation with a perceptual discrimination task. The results demonstrate a fundamental difference between the prepara-tion of saccades and of manual reaching. For delayed saccades, attention is pinned to the saccade target until the onset of the response. This does not hold for manual reaching, however. Although fast reaching movements require at-tention, reaches delayed more than 300 ms after movement cue onset can be al-ready performed “off-line”; that is, attention can be withdrawn from the movement target...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between speech and gesture was analyzed in four experiments that compared the initiation time of <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> in single gestural tasks and in dual verbal-gestural tasks. Likewise, vocal onset time was compared in single oral and in dual tasks. The {{findings of the}} study of Levelt et al. (1985) on deictic expressions were replicated. Performance of a concurrent task delayed the vocal onset time but not the gestural initiation time. Interference in the initiation of the vocal response did not diminish with a precueing procedure that facilitated response preparation. In conclusion, support is provided for the assumption of competition for shared resources by the gestural and speech production systems. These systems are also assumed to interact beyond the moment at which responses are selected. (C) 1997 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the speech-gesture relationship of chronic adult stutterers {{in comparison to}} fluent controls based on previous work by McNeill (1979, 1986). Significant {{differences were found in}} the speech and gesture characteristics of the narratives of stutterers as compared to fluent controls on a cartoon retelling task. Stutterers produced fewer cartoon details in their speech and fewer meanings per gesture. As well, stutterers were unable to begin a representational gesture at the same moment as a stuttered disfluency resulting in the freezing of gestures or maintaining the hand at rest. A second experiment showed that stutterers were able to maintain and initiate non-communicative hand movements at the same moment as stuttering. Gesture did not replace speech during moments of stuttering even though <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> during stuttering was possible. The results demonstrate the strength of the speech-gesture relationship and show that stuttering affects both modalities of expression...|$|E
40|$|Two {{patients}} with unilateral {{damage to the}} medial and lateral cerebellum were examined to determine whether local structures in the cerebellum are used to execute programmed movement sequences. Both patients performed a sequential tapping task which required the execution of either a single keystroke or of a sequence of three keystrokes. Movements executed with the contralateral hand showed increases in response onset times as the movement sequence increased from one to three response elements (sequence length effect). Furthermore, noninitial response elements were executed considerably faster than sequence initial responses (position effect). Movements executed with the ipsilateral hand showed a different pattern of results. Damage to medial cerebellar structure had no qualifying effect but damage to the lateral cerebellar structure eliminated effects of sequence length and of response position. The {{results suggest that the}} lateral cerebellum is implicated in the execution of programmed <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> sequences...|$|E
30|$|We are {{building}} {{the argument that}} educational researchers, and more broadly cognitive scientists, should adopt a more nuanced discourse about movement. We view descriptions of <b>manual</b> <b>movement</b> that focus only on how the hand is moving, for example, analyses of the shape, pace, and morphology of the hand’s kinematic path through space, as failing to capture the sensorimotor schemes generating this movement. Namely, objective descriptions of hand trajectory ignore how the student is orienting to the task and environment so as to develop and produce this movement (Brooks & Goldin-Meadow, 2015; Gallagher & Lindgren, 2015; Lindgren, Tscholl, Wang, & Johnson, 2016; Nathan & Walkington, 2016; Ping & Goldin-Meadow, 2008). Nevertheless, we propose, our pedagogical theorizing and intervention should be attending precisely to these schemes. From an enactivist perspective, these schemes, the student’s actionable relation to the biological–cultural context, are the stuff of cognition and thus constitute the goal and mark of conceptual change. In this section we offer empirical findings as evidence supporting our argument for rethinking movement in mathematics teaching and learning.|$|E
40|$|When {{the arms}} move in certain ways, {{they can cause}} the torso to twist or rock. Such {{extraneous}} torso movement is undesirable, especially during sign language communication, when torso position may carry linguistic significance, so we expend effort to resist it {{when it is not}} intended. This so-called “reactive effort” has only recently been identified by Sanders and Napoli (2016), but their preliminary work on three genetically unrelated languages suggests that the effects of reactive effort can be observed cross-linguistically by examination of sign language lexicons. In particular, the frequency of different kinds of <b>manual</b> <b>movements</b> in the lexicon correlates with the amount of reactive effort needed to resist movement of the torso. Following this line of research, we present evidence from 24 sign languages confirming that there is a cross-linguistic preference for minimizing the reactive effort needed to keep the torso stable...|$|R

The NVSG element model defines four elements that describe sign language. <b>Manual</b> <b>movements</b> are expressed as N and V elements, and non-manual markers as S and G elements. We have mostly finalized the descriptive parameters for the N and V elements. Up until this point, we have described approximately 1, 500 words using the NVSG element model.

The initial objective of this comparison was to determine whether hand preference for gestures may constitute a better predictor of hemispheric specialization for language than handedness for tool-use. But other elements may influence the emergence of manual and cerebral asymmetries, starting with the degree of goal-directedness and intentionality that characterize <b>manual</b> <b>movements,</b> as well as hemispheric specialization for functions other than language, and in particular for visual attention. Only by studying these different questions within a single frame of reference will we manage to get a more accurate view on the origin and development of human functional asymmetries...|$|R
