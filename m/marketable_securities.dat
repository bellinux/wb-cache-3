40|$|Controversy exists {{regarding}} {{the extent to}} which real estate continues to behave like real estate once it is securitized as a real estate investment trust (REIT). The purpose of our study is to examine the nature of deviations of securitized real estate from its underlying fundamental value and the role that institutional flow of funds play in this process. Towards this end, we also explore whether the transformation of real estate into a <b>marketable</b> <b>security</b> generates a dual persona for REITs with respect to its market movements.
