40|$|April-A Meeting of the Society for the {{transaction}} of ordinary business, and the reconsideration of the Balance-sheet submitted with the Annual Report for 1907, {{was held at}} the Museum on Wednesday evening, April 7, 1908. Mr. T. Stephens, M. A., F. G. S., in the chair. In reference {{to the question of the}} reconsideration of the Balance-sheet for 1907, the Chairman announced that Mr. Bernard Shaw, their recently-appointed Honorary Treasurer, had taken a great deal of trouble in going through the accounts of the Society for the last four years, and would now furnish any information that was required on the subject. -The Monthly General Meeting of the Society {{was held at the}} Museum on Monday evening, April 13, 1908. Mr. Russell Young in the chair. The Secretary to the Council (Mr. Robert Hall) notified the receipt of valuable literature from kindred societies in all parts of the world, from Russia, Argentina, Canada, the Mediterranean countries, and Great Britain. The Smithsonian Institute, U. S. A., had sent books of very great value. Mr. Hall then gave an account of the travels of himself and friend through Siberia to Moscow and St. Petersburg, and then on to London. May-The monthly General Meeting of the Society was held at the Museum on Monday evening, May 11, 1908. Mr. T. Stephens, M. A., F. G. S., in the chair. The folowing paper was read. — Notes on a Chipped Boulder from near Kempton. By Fritz Noetling, M. A., Ph. D. Mr. R. M. Johnston said the specimen Dr. Noetling had exhibited to them that evening was one of the most interesting that had been found in Tasmania. Mr. R. M. Johnston exhibited a small specimen of a <b>mountain</b> trout (<b>Galaxias</b> truttaceus), captured by Mr. Tute at the Great Lake, which had an abnormal development in the shape of two mouths. Air. A. J. Taylor made some remarks on the so-called bulrush caterpillar (Sphaeria robertsia). He said the caterpillar is interesting because of the peculiar way in which it becomes the host of a vegetable form of life, which uses up the animal structure of the caterpillar for its own nourishment.

50|$|Within the Murray-Darling system, the <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> {{continues}} {{the trend of}} specialisation into upland and lowland habitats, with species found in upland habitats, and the flathead galaxias found in lowland habitats, though G. olidus strays down to the upland/lowland transition zone in some rivers.|$|E
50|$|The AMLR region {{comprises}} 20 native freshwater fish, including catfish, galaxiids, lampreys and eels. Three {{of these}} species are considered threatened nationally while Climbing Galaxias (Galaxias brevipinnis), Congolli (Pseudaphritis urvillii), <b>Mountain</b> <b>Galaxias</b> (Galaxias olidus) and Pouched Lamprey (Geotria australis) are considered Vulnerable in the region.|$|E
50|$|The {{climbing}} galaxias or koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis) is a fish of {{the family}} Galaxiidae found in Australia, New Zealand, and nearby islands.

50|$|The varying vegetation, climates, {{rivers and}} landforms {{in the park}} have created an area rich in {{habitats}} for native animals. A {{study was conducted in}} 1996 on the fauna found at the Cathedral Range State Park. The finding of this study was that the park is home to seventeen native mammals, eight reptiles, one amphibian, one fish and eighty-seven native birds. Common animals observed in the park include the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus). <b>Mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> (Galaxias olidus), a native freshwater fish, was observed in the Little River just before the Little River falls. It is thought that these falls act as a barrier to trout, one of the major predators of the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Galaxias.</b> There have also been occasional sightings of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) in the Little River.|$|E
50|$|Well known native fish {{include the}} Murray cod and golden perch. Lesser known fish are the two-spined blackfish, which survives in the Cotter catchment, the trout cod, which is locally extinct but being restocked, silver perch, {{which is near}} local extinction, Macquarie perch, which is {{endangered}} but still survives in the Cotter River, and the <b>mountain</b> <b>Galaxias,</b> an increasingly threatened small fish now only found in small streams free of trout.|$|E
50|$|The park {{contains}} native {{flora and}} fauna of conservation significance, 20 ha of bushland and several resident threatened species. Colonies of the nationally endangered Southern brown bandicoot exist in the park, as do over 12 species of conservation listed plants. The creek contains native fish such as <b>Mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> (state-listed as Rare) and the wetland supports native Eastern long-necked turtles and native water rats. 47% of the declining birds of the greater Mt Lofty Ranges have been observed in the park.|$|E
5000|$|G. olidus {{occupies}} a vast geographical range from southern Queensland to the Adelaide Hills in South Australia, and while occurring widely in the Murray-Darling river system, {{are also found}} in eastern and southern coastal systems. How much of their coastal distribution is due to natural river capture events (although it is certain much of it is) {{and how much of}} it may be due to migration is not clear, for many <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> species have the ability to [...] "climb" [...] natural migration barriers with modified pelvic fin structures.|$|E
50|$|In most situations, wholly {{freshwater}} galaxiids {{are unable}} to persist {{in the presence of}} exotic trout species, and many are now restricted to the few remaining trout-free habitats. Where these species are found in the presence of trout, the galaxiids usually consist entirely of individuals which dispersed there from an upstream trout-free population, and are not self-sustaining. Numerous localised extinctions of wholly freshwater galaxiid species (i.e. <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias)</b> have been caused by the introduction of exotic trout species (including ongoing illegal stockings) and a number of wholly freshwater galaxiid species are threatened with extinction by exotic trout species and other exotic salmonids.|$|E

5000|$|The diverse faunal {{significance}} of the OPNP {{is evident in the}} riparian, escarpment and grassland environments in the park. The faunal species found in the OPNP range from birds, mammals (such as eastern grey kangaroo, swamp wallaby), reptiles (including long-necked tortoise, the eastern bearded dragon, and the red-bellied black snake), and echidnas. With the park’s programme of intensive induction of native vegetation in the area, several faunal species also started to proliferate. A 1988 mammal survey conducted at OPNP by the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research found bats to be the most diverse group of native mammals in occurrence. A very successful bat roosting box project has been underway for 20 years. Avifaunal species (such as the wedge-tailed eagle) are proliferating. Growling grass frog, and many indigenous fish species (such as the <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias)</b> have also reappeared. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) which was previously in the OPNP in 1916 was relocated into the park in 1989 from Toolern Vale. This is one of many projects run by the Friends of the Organ Pipes National Park. Overall, OPNP authorities have reported 15 mammal native species, 88 species of avifauna, 13 reptile species and 6 amphibian species.|$|E
40|$|Animal {{movement}} {{is an important}} process connecting habitats in heterogeneous landscapes, and can {{play a key role}} in population persistence. Laboratory swim trials were conducted to determine and compare the dispersal capabilities of two native Australian fish, <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> (Galaxias olidus, Family Galaxiidae) and southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis, Family Nannopercidae) that maintain populations in hydrologically variable and intermittently flowing streams in south-eastern Australia. These experiments showed that G. ?olidus had significantly greater swimming endurance under a range of flow velocities. Concurrent field surveys were used to establish whether swimming abilities observed in laboratory studies were consistent with patterns of inferred movement from distribution and abundance patterns observed in the field. Data collected at multiple sites from headwater to lowland reaches along multiple streams revealed substantial temporal changes in the distribution of young-of-year (0 +) G. ?olidus, with spawning occurring at upland sites in winter, followed by downstream larval migration and subsequent upstream movement in late spring. Observed spatial and temporal patterns in G. ?olidus abundances were consistent with a source-sink population structure, which may be disrupted by prolonged cease-to-flow periods during drought years. In contrast, results for N. ?australis suggested limited dispersal, with restricted local populations that persist at sites with permanent surface water. These field and laboratory findings complement our understanding of the spatial population structure of these two species in intermittent streams, and highlight the importance of understanding the role of dispersal in species conservation and habitat restoration.

40|$|Regionalisations {{based on}} species assemblages are a useful {{framework}} for characterising ecological communities and revealing {{patterns in the}} environment. In the present study, multivariate analyses are used to discern large-scale patterns in fish assemblages in the Murray–Darling Basin, based on information from the Murray–Darling Basin Authority’s first Sustainable Rivers Audit (SRA), conducted in 2004 – 2007. The Basin is classified into nine regions with similar historical fish assemblages (i. e. without major human intervention), using data that combine expert opinion, museum collections and historical records. These regions are (1) Darling Basin Plains, (2) Northern Uplands, (3) Murray Basin Plains, (4) Northern Alps, (5) Central East, (6) Avoca Lowland, (7) Southern Slopes, (8) Southern Alps and (9) South-Western Slopes. Associations between assemblages and physical variables (catchment area, elevation, hydrology, precipitation, temperature) are identified and used to reinforce the definitions of regions. Sustainable Rivers Audit data are compared with the historical assemblages, highlighting species whose range and abundance have changed since the early 19 th century. Notable changes include declines in native species such as silver perch, river blackfish, <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias,</b> Macquarie perch, trout cod and freshwater catfish, {{and the advent of}} alien species including common carp, eastern gambusia, goldfish, redfin perch, brown trout and rainbow trout. Less significant declines are evident for native carp gudgeons, golden perch, two-spined blackfish, bony herring and flathead gudgeon. Changes are evident even in regions where habitats have been little disturbed in the past 200 years...|$|E
40|$|Human-induced erosion {{regularly}} delivers massive {{quantities of}} fine sediments into {{streams and rivers}} forming large static bodies of sediment known as sand slugs, which smother in-stream habitat, alter community structure, and decrease biodiversity. Sand slugs are widespread in parts of southeastern Australia {{as well as in}} many other parts of the world, and there is now considerable interest in restoring such affected streams. The reintroduction of large timber is widely suggested as a strategy for restoring habitat complexity, but this has rarely been tested in sand slug- affected streams. We examined the response of fish populations to wood addition to two streams in southeastern Australia that have been impacted by sand slugs. Manipulated sites (three per treatment) had either one or four timber structures added, and these sites were compared with (three) unmanipulated (control) sites before and after the manipulation occurred. Despite a supraseasonal drought during the study, we observed short-term increases in the abundance of <b>Mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> (Galaxias olidus) at the four-structure sites, while both the fourstructure and the one-structure treatments appeared to buffer against drought-induced declines in two other species, River blackfish (Gadopsis marmoratus) and Southern pygmy perch (Nannoperca australis), relative to controls. However, drought eventually caused the complete loss of surface water from these streams and the loss of fish from both manipulated and unmanipulated sites. Thus, although the study supports the use of timber structures as a means of increasing local fish abundances, these beneficial effects were, in these streams, contingent upon permanency of flow. Because sedimentation has depleted the number of permanent refuge pools in these creeks, recovery rates of the fauna (i. e., resilience) are likely to be slow. We therefore conclude that in streams subjected to frequent disturbance, restoring refugia may be as, if not more, important as restoring what we term residential habitat. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Epizootic hematopoietic {{necrosis}} (EHN) is {{a systemic}} iridoviral disease of fish. The epizootic hematopoietic necrosis virus (EHNV) causes EHN in redfin perch and rainbow trout. This disease is highly fatal in redfin perch; affected farms usually have serious economic losses, and severe declines {{can occur in}} wild populations. Rainbow trout {{are less likely to}} be infected, and the cumulative mortality rate is usually low. Closely related viruses cause serious outbreaks of epizootic hematopoietic necrosis in catfish and sheatfish. Currently, the transmission of EHN viruses is incompletely understood. Their control is also complicated by their prolonged survival in the environment and resistance to disinfectants. Etiology Epizootic hematopoietic necrosis is a systemic disease characterized by necrosis of the liver, spleen and hematopoietic tissues within the kidney. This disease is caused by viruses of the epizootic hematopoietic necrosis group in the genus Ranavirus and family Iridoviridae. To date, the causative viruses include EHNV in redfin perch and rainbow trout, and European sheatfish iridovirus (ESV) and European catfish iridovirus (ECV) in catfish and sheatfish. Genetic studies suggest that ECV and ESV are isolates of the same virus; EHNV is a different virus. Other iridoviruses causing systemic necrotizing syndromes may also occur in fish. Species Affected In nature, EHNV has been reported only in redfin perch (Perca fluviatilis) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Species that have been infected experimentally include Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica), mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis), silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus), <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias</b> (Galaxias olidus), Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Other species may also be susceptible. ESV has been reported from sheatfish / wels catfish (Silurus glanis), while ECV can infect European catfish (Ictalurus melas), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and short finned eels (Anguilla australis). Systemic necrotizing iridovirus syndromes have also been reported in other species of fish including turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in Denmark...|$|E
40|$|Six rivers {{within the}} upper Mumbidgee {{catchment}} were sampled for larval and juvenile fish. The rivers represented both regulated and unregulated flow regimes and varied widely in size. There was wide {{variation in the}} larval fish communities supported by each river, {{both in terms of}} the species diversity and total abundance of fish sampled. The highly regulated reach of the Mumbidgee River sampled during this study had the highest numbers of native species and native individuals of any river sampled. In the two rivers selected for further study, the Murmmbidgee and Goodradigbee, there was a high level of inter-annual consistency in the species composition within the reaches sampled, despite considerable change in the temperature and flow regimes of both rivers. This indicates that at least some spawning of those species sampled may occur each year, regardless of environmental conditions. Estimates of the relative abundance of each species sampled changed markedly between years, and it is argued, on the basis of growth information contained in the otoliths, that differential survival of larvae and juveniles was largely responsible for this shift in relative abundance. Otolith microstructure provided information on the date of spawning and early growth patterns of all species sampled in the upper Mumumbidgee catchment. In addition to determining the age and thus 'birth-date' of an individual, the effect of a particular event or series of events has on growth, and subsequent survival, is permanently recorded in the otolith microstructure. This enables accurate back-calculation and correlation to management actions or natural events. No other research tool has this ability to retrospectively assess, on a daily basis, the impacts of management actions on condition and subsequent survival of fish larvae. Species sampled could be separated into three groups based on spawning requirements; those linked with flow, those linked with temperature and generalist species that appear to have river independent cues, such as photoperiod or moon phase. Patterns in growth rate during the early life history stages enabled quantification of the consequences of variation in environmental conditions on the survival and recruitment of various species. Growth was not always highly correlated with water temperature, in fact, for <b>mountain</b> <b>galaxias,</b> high temperatures appear to negatively affect larval condition and subsequent survival. Conversely, carp exhibited a strategy more consistent with common perceptions, with growth and survival increasing with increasing temperature. The study uncovered spawning and growth patterns that were unexpected. Age analysis of western carp gudgeon demonstrated that they had undertaken a mid-winter spawning, when the water temperature in the main channel was far lower than that at which spawning was previously recorded for this species. Redfin perch from the unregulated Goodradigbee River exhibited growth rates exceeding the published upper limits for this and other closely related species. This growth could not be correlated with either temperature or flow, indicating that there are additional factors that dominate growth rates of redfin perch in the Goodradigbee River. The proportion and abundance of native species alone is not necessarily indicative of a 'healthy' or pristine system; some native species may be positively affected by river regulation, at least as juveniles. Comparison of the current larval fish community with likely pre-European fish communities does provide an indication of change to the system. The {{results of this study suggest}} that larval fish growth rates can be strongly influenced by environmental conditions, thus providing a powerful tool for monitoring future change and the factors which cause it. This study has demonstrated the value of larval and juvenile fish age and growth information, derived from otolith microstructure techniques, for many aspects of river management. Current river management priorities for which these techniques provide unique information include the determination of environmental flow regimes and the control of undesirable exotic species such as carp...|$|E
40|$|Australia {{is one of}} the world’s top megadiverse {{countries}} {{based on}} the number of species and levels of endemism of plants and animals, however, the continuing loss of biodiversity, particularly in freshwater environments, {{is one of the}} most serious environmental problems. The Australian freshwater fish fauna, defined as relatively well known, has been described as depauperate when compared with other land masses of similar size and climate. This disparity has been proposed as a consequence of relative differences in environmental and geological factors, and degree of isolation, however, it may also be due to differing taxonomic effort, with an overall decline in freshwater taxonomic research noted since the 1970 s and a dramatic reduction in expertise since the mid 1980 s. Molecular research since the 1980 s has detected species-level genetic diversity in many obligate freshwater fishes, all previously defined primarily on morphological assessments alone. None of these studies have yet been supported by morphological reappraisals to resolve the taxonomy of the species complexes, with some unresolved for over 20 years. The molecular data strongly suggest that the current taxonomic framework for Australian freshwater fishes is incomplete, under represents true levels of species diversity by at least 2 – 3 fold, and our basic knowledge of the number and diversity of freshwater fishes is largely deficient. The Galaxiidae are arguably the most widespread family of Southern Hemisphere freshwater fish, and represent almost half of the species of southern-temperate affinity in Australia. They are relatively morphologically conservative and were considered reasonably well studied morphologically, though recent molecular studies have indicated significant species-level diversity in a nonmigratory species in southern New Zealand and one in South Africa. The nonmigratory <b>Mountain</b> <b>Galaxias,</b> Galaxias olidus, of mainland Australia has a broad geographic range across discrete river systems, and is highly vulnerable to isolation and hence genetic divergence. A taxonomic history of multiple species consolidated into a single taxon, suggesting high levels of morphological variability, combined with recent morphological and ecological data, is strongly suggestive of Galaxias olidus constituting an unresolved, cryptic species complex. The aim of the current study is to investigate levels of genetic diversity within this obligate freshwater fish to assess species boundaries, to undertake a morphometric and meristic analysis of individuals to determine if genetically identified candidate taxa can be morphologically defined, and, if so, to revise the taxonomic framework of the complex, providing redescriptions of any valid nominal taxa and formal description of new taxa. A comprehensive comparative dataset of study material was initially compiled following an evaluation of existing data and specimens. This material consisted of a small amount of existing specimens from museum collections, but was supplemented by a large collection of fresh material from an extensive field sampling program which undertook intensive collecting at a fine spatial scale across the geographic range of the species. Galaxias olidus sensu lato was not supported as a single, well-defined diagnosable species by allozyme analyses (54 loci), but was instead found to comprise a complex of 15 candidate species, most found in sympatry to parapatry (possibly recent sympatry), all diagnosable from one another by multiple fixed differences. Finer-scale genetic substructure was also evident within three candidate species, indicating genetically distinct subpopulations which, with minor exception, appeared to conform to drainage boundaries. Putative hybridization, though detected, appears to be uncommon amongst the candidate species, and was only found between three taxa-pairs, with one taxon common to all pairs. An additional, though unexpected, result was the discovery of high levels of genetic heterogeneity within samples of Galaxias brevipinnis s. l. from mainland Australia used as outgroups, which suggests, for the first time, the presence of an unresolved species complex within this taxon. Based on multivariate analysis the 15 allozymically defined candidate species in Galaxias olidus s. l. were able to be unequivocally diagnosed from each other by unique differences in their morphology, with the majority diagnosable by two independent datasets (morphometrics (29 characters) and meristics (17 characters)), and additional, less consistent morphological characters. When combined with significant molecular characters, each species could be identified on the basis of two, usually three, independent measures of diagnosability and four are considered distinct biological species in sympatry or parapatry and 11 as evolutionary species in allopatry, in the absence of evidence of recent sympatry or parapatry. Galaxias olidus s. s. remains the most variable taxon in the complex. The combined approach of using multiple, independent lines of evidence provides the greatest chance of identifying robust and diagnosable species, particularly in cryptic species complexes where subtle morphological differences that are taxonomically important are masked by other phenotypic variation, and where traditional, morphologically based, studies often fail. Following taxonomic reappraisal Galaxias olidus Günther (sensu strictu) is retained and redefined, two species previously synonymised with G. olidus (Galaxias fuscus Mack and Galaxias ornatus Castelnau) are revised and reinstated as valid species, and 12 new species are described. All taxa are closely related in a monophyletic lineage (to the exclusion of other described species investigated in the genus on mainland Australia), distinct from Galaxias brevipinnis and Galaxias maculatus (includes G. occidentalis and G. rostratus) lineages, and form a grouping of morphologically similar taxa designated as the Galaxias olidus complex. Many morphological characters were found to overlap between species in this complex, and though all were useful in multivariate diagnosis of taxa (i. e. in combination provided discrimination in multidimensional space), many (e. g. meristic characters) were less useful as taxonomic characters in species descriptions. This is due to the high level of morphological conservatism in this complex of species, often with only subtle differences between taxa. Consequently, field-based diagnosis of species relies heavily on combinations of proportionate ratios of characters. The identification of 15 species within the Galaxias olidus complex indicates substantial genetic divergence has occurred in this group of fishes in eastern Australia. The overall pattern of genetic substructuring within, and shallow to relatively deep divergence between species, is characteristic of this group having a long association with, and having undergone extensive evolution in isolation within, Australian freshwater drainages. In addition, the increased level of diversity found in the genus Galaxias (from this study and elsewhere) provides additional support for the long evolutionary history of the Galaxiidae. The basic knowledge of species-level diversity is deficient for Australian freshwater fishes, and may be larger than previously suggested, with numbers of species in some taxa under represented by up to 15 fold. This lack of essential taxonomic knowledge is a fundamental and serious impediment to assessing species loss and in implementing effective strategies for biodiversity conservation. This is particularly critical in the Galaxiidae, where the spread of highly predatory alien salmonids in freshwater systems in the Southern Hemisphere has led to local extinctions and significantly altered galaxiid distributions, and is highly likely to have resulted in the extinction of undiscovered unique lineages, worthy of recognition as species, in small and remote catchments. More broadly, the lack of knowledge of Australian freshwater fish diversity also compromise assessments of diversity and areas of high endemism at the global scale and confound efforts to define. ...|$|E
