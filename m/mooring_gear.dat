50|$|Upon commissioning, Tringa was {{assigned}} to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 8 and operated out of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut. During her first six years of active service, she remained close to the eastern seaboard. Fortunately, her services as a submarine rescue vessel were not required. On the other hand, Tringa remained busy practicing simulated submarine rescues and serving as target ship and recovery ship for submarines in torpedo-firing drills. In addition, she participated {{in a number of}} rescue experiments for the Bureau of Ships, testing diving bells, submarine buoys, ground tackle, <b>mooring</b> <b>gear,</b> and related equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} HB.5 was 17 m {{long and}} had a maximum width of 2.80 m. The forward planing hull had soft chine, ending at a single step under the wings. Entirely {{mahogany}} covered, the hull was divided internally into seven compartments. The bow compartment contained <b>mooring</b> <b>gear</b> and the pilot and co-pilot sat side-by-side in an open cockpit in the second. The flight engineer sat in another open cockpit in the third compartment, just behind the pilots. The fourth compartment contained the passenger cabin, [...] "luxuriously furnished" [...] for ten passengers and provided two large, glazed portholes for viewing. Cabin access was via a starboard side gangplank and the engineer's position. Their baggage, together with sacks of air-mail, was stored in the sixth compartment and the wireless operator housed in the seventh.|$|E
50|$|This wooden-hulled coastal minesweeper, {{equipped}} with magnetic, acoustic, and <b>moored</b> minesweep <b>gear,</b> was originally {{assigned to the}} 13th Naval District, with a home yard of Puget Sound. She operated off the Pacific Northwest until assigned to the Alaskan Sea Frontier 12 April 1944. Reassigned to the 13th Naval District 5 September 1944, she again served along the U. S. Northwest coast.|$|R
5000|$|After fitting out, {{shakedown}} training out of San Pedro, California, {{and post}} shakedown repairs, the net laying ship sailed for Hawaii {{and arrived at}} Pearl Harbor on 29 June. On 20 July, the net layer was ordered {{to report to the}} Commander, Service Force, Pacific, for duty [...] "in the forward areas" [...] and loaded <b>mooring</b> and net <b>gear</b> into August.|$|R
5000|$|Following the Argonne to Seeadler on 27 August {{were the}} {{unclassified}} vessels Silver Cloud, Caribou, Arethusa, and Armadillo, the water barge YW-90, {{and the ocean}} tug Tern towing the concrete barge YO-186. The Caribou brought 65,000 barrels of fuel oil, the Silver Cloud 85,000 and the Arethusa 65,000; the Armadillo 24,000 barrels of Diesel oil and 1,770,000 gallons of aviation gasoline. YW-90 held 280,000 gallons of water, and the concrete YO-186 55,000 barrels. The fleet tug Tawasa towed in the floating drydock ARD-19, while the auxiliary ocean tug ATA-122 arrived towing the barges YF-681, filled with boatswain's stores of manila and wire line, blocks, tackle, <b>mooring</b> <b>gear,</b> etc., and YF-787 with general stores. Bringing in the drydock also meant bringing her in full, for while being towed from port to port her docking space furnished a wealth of cargo room {{for all sorts of}} equipment. On her trip from Eniwetok the ARD-19 carried the little harbor tug YTL-208, 2 pontoon crane barges, 20 LCM's, and 20 LCVP's. Except for the crane barges all these were self-propelled, but none could have made its way across the ocean under its own power. Most of Ogden's detachment was sent down from Kwajalein and Eniwetok. Crane barges, small tugs, and landing craft were vital necessities for supply services within a harbor, and had to go forward. We shall see later how the ARD's continued their usefulness as [...] "moving vans" [...] in the shifting of a service squadron westward.|$|E
5000|$|Yacona reached New London on the {{afternoon}} of 12 July 1918 and disembarked her passengers. She then spent the next several weeks undergoing voyage repairs, first at the New York Navy Yard, from 19 to 25 July, and then at Tietjen and Lang’s Dockyard, Hoboken, New Jersey, from 25 July to 27 August. She shifted to New London (28-30 August), then sailed for Charleston, South Carolina. One day out of New London, she went to general quarters early in the mid watch on 31 August and trained her guns on a “suspicious object.” The dark shape, however, quickly disappeared from sight in the thick haze and the ship’s own smoke. Then, after voyage repairs at Charleston (2-6 August), she put to sea as escort for a convoy of three 110 ft submarine chasers assigned to the French Navy: , , and [...] Reaching Bermuda on 10 September, she sailed five days later for the Azores in company with cruiser [...] and tugs Arctic and Goliah and a covey of submarine chasers, and arrived at her destination on 27 September. As the converted yacht prepared to sail from Ponta Delgada on 2 October, however, her port anchor fouled the <b>mooring</b> <b>gear.</b> To “expedite matters and join the convoy” then sailing for Hamilton, she slipped the anchor and [...] of chain. Less than a half hour into the first dog watch on 9 October, while steaming in company with Chicago, Arethusa, Goliah, Arctic and Undaunted, the yacht spotted another “suspicious object” on the surface and went to general quarters. She commenced firing three minutes later but, after identifying her target as a drifting buoy, ceased fire.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the <b>mooring</b> <b>gear.</b> A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the bell-mouth which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E
