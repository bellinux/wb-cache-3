50|$|This term is {{sometimes}} used, {{and is a}} collective name for the submasseteric (masseteric), pterygomandibular, superficial temporal and deep temporal spaces. The infratemporal space is the inferior portion of the deep temporal space. The superficial temporal and the deep temporal spaces are sometimes together called the temporal spaces. The <b>masticator</b> spaces are paired structures {{on either side of}} the head. The muscles of mastication are enclosed in a layer of fascia, formed by cervical fascia ascending from the neck which divides at the inferior border of the mandible to envelope the area. Each <b>masticator</b> space also contains the sections of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve and the internal maxillary artery.|$|E

Third, prescribed fires require favorable weather conditions to safely burn, therefore not all fire treatments were completed in the same year. Beyond these limitations, we randomly assigned treatments and controls to experimental units and treatment year (Figure 1, Appendix A Figure 1).|$|R

60|$|Nothing in the {{appearance}} of the islanders struck me more forcibly than the whiteness of their teeth. The novelist always compares the <b>masticators</b> of his heroine to ivory; but I boldly pronounce the teeth of the Typees to be far more beautiful than ivory itself. The jaws of the oldest greybeards among them were much better garnished than those of the youths of civilized countries; while the teeth of the young and middle-aged, in their purity and whiteness, were actually dazzling to the eye. This marvellous whiteness of the teeth is to be ascribed to the pure vegetable diet of these people, and the uninterrupted healthfulness of their natural mode of life.|$|R
50|$|This is also {{referred}} to as the masseter space or the superifical <b>masticator</b> space.

60|$|We {{must leave}} the two adventurers winding their way among the broken piles, and venturing boldly beneath the tottering arches of the ruin, to {{accompany}} the reader, at the same hour, within the more comfortable walls of the abbey; where, it will be remembered, Borroughcliffe was left in a condition of very equivocal ease. As the earth had, however, in the interval, nearly run its daily round, circumstances had intervened to release the soldier from his confinement--and no one, ignorant of the fact, would suppose that the gentleman who was now seated at the hospitable board of Colonel Howard, directing, with so much discretion, the energies of his <b>masticators</b> to the delicacies of the feast, could read, in his careless air and smiling visage, that those foragers of nature had been so recently condemned, for four long hours, to the mortification of discussing the barren subject of his own sword-hilt. Borroughcliffe, however, maintained not only his usual post, but his well-earned reputation at the table, with his ordinary coolness of demeanor; though at times there were fleeting smiles that crossed his military aspect, which sufficiently indicated that he considered the matter of his reflection to be of a particularly ludicrous character. In {{the young man who}} sat by his side, dressed in the deep-blue jacket of a seaman, with the fine white linen of his collar contrasting strongly with the black silk handkerchief that was tied with studied negligence around his neck, and whose easy air and manner contrasted still more strongly with this attire, the reader will discover Griffith. The captive paid much less devotion to the viands than his neighbor, though he affected more attention to the business of the table than he actually be stowed, with a sort of consciousness that it would relieve the blushing maiden who presided. The laughing eyes of Katherine Plowden were glittering {{by the side of the}} mild countenance of Alice Dunscombe, and, at times, were fastened in droll interest on the rigid and upright exterior that Captain Manual maintained, directly opposite to where she was seated. A chair had, also, been placed for Dillon--of course it was vacant.|$|R
6000|$|Size of Brain an {{important}} Element of Mental Power.--The brain is universally admitted {{to be the}} organ of the mind; and {{it is almost as}} universally admitted, that size of brain {{is one of the most}} important of the elements which determine mental power or capacity. There seems to be no doubt that brains differ considerably in quality, as indicated by greater or less complexity of the convolutions, quantity of grey matter, and perhaps unknown peculiarities of organization; but this difference of quality seems merely to increase or diminish the influence of quantity, not to neutralize it. Thus, all the most eminent modern writers see an intimate connection between the diminished size of the brain in the lower races of mankind, and their intellectual inferiority. The collections of Dr. J. B. Davis and Dr. Morton give the following as the average internal capacity of the cranium in the chief races:--Teutonic family, 94 cubic inches; Esquimaux, 91 cubic inches; Negroes, 85 cubic inches; Australians and Tasmanians, 82 cubic inches; Bushmen, 77 cubic inches. These last numbers, however, are deduced from comparatively few specimens, and may be below the average, just as a small number of Finns and Cossacks give 98 cubic inches, or considerably more than that of the German races. It is evident, therefore, that the absolute bulk of the brain is not necessarily much less in savage than in civilised man, for Esquimaux skulls are known with a capacity of 113 inches, or hardly less than the largest among Europeans. But what is still more extraordinary, the few remains yet known of pre-historic man do not indicate any material diminution in the size of the brain case. A Swiss skull of the stone age, found in the lake dwelling of Meilen, corresponded exactly to that of a Swiss youth of the present day. The celebrated Neanderthal skull had a larger circumference than the average, and its capacity, indicating actual mass of brain, is estimated to have been not less than 75 cubic inches, or nearly the average of existing Australian crania. The Engis skull, perhaps the oldest known, and which, according to Sir John Lubbock, [...] "there seems no doubt was really contemporary with the mammoth and the cave bear," [...] is yet, according to Professor Huxley, [...] "a fair average skull, which might have belonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage." [...] Of the cave men of Les Eyzies, who were undoubtedly contemporary with the reindeer in the South of France, Professor Paul Broca says (in a paper read before the Congress of Pre-historic Archæology in 1868)--"The great capacity of the brain, the development of the frontal region, the fine elliptical form of the anterior part of the profile of the skull, are incontestible characteristics of superiority, such as we are accustomed to meet with in civilised races;" [...] yet the great breadth of the face, the enormous development of the ascending ramus of the lower jaw, the extent and roughness of the surfaces for the attachment of the muscles, especially of the <b>masticators,</b> and the extraordinary development of the ridge of the femur, indicate enormous muscular power, and the habits of a savage and brutal race.|$|R

50|$|How Doth the Simple Spelling Bee is a {{short story}} by Owen Wister that was {{published}} in book form in 1907. It is a satire about spelling reform efforts of the time, which also humorously and in a good-natured manner pokes fun at academia in general, and the folly of typical professors' endeavours. The story's protagonist is Chickle University professor <b>Masticator</b> B. Fellow, and is about his efforts to enlist the story narrator's support for spelling reform.

Debates quickly ensue regarding whose pronunciation should be considered standard for phonetic spelling.|$|E
5000|$|In 1820, Hancock {{rented a}} factory in Goswell Road, London, where he worked raw rubber with the {{machines}} he had invented. His machines produced a warm mass of homogeneous rubber that could then be shaped and mixed with other materials, and was more easily dissolved than raw rubber. The prototype of his <b>masticator</b> was operated by one man and could only hold 3 oz; it was a wooden machine with a hollow cylinder studded with metal [...] "teeth", with an inner studded core that was hand-cranked. By 1821 he had produced a two-man machine that held 1 lb, and by 1841, he had created a machine that could process up to 200 lb of rubber at a time.|$|E
50|$|Submasseteric abscesses are {{relatively}} rare, {{and may be}} confused with a parotid abscess or parotitis. They tend to be chronic. The submasseteric space may be involved by infections that spread from the buccal space. Sometimes mandibular fractures {{in the region of}} the angle of the mandible may cause an infection of the submasseteric space. The signs and symptoms of a submasseteric abscess may include marked trismus (i.e. difficulty opening the mouth, since the masseter elevates the mandible and it becomes restricted) and swelling in the region of the masseter muscle. The treatment of a submasseteric space infection is usually by surgical incision and drainage, and the incision is placed intra-orally (inside the mouth) or both intra and extra-orally if other parts of the <b>masticator</b> space are involved.|$|E
5000|$|The submasseterric space (also {{termed the}} masseteric space) is a fascial {{space of the}} head and neck (sometimes also termed fascial spaces or tissue spaces). It is a {{potential}} space in the face over the angle of the jaw, and is paired on each side. It is located between the lateral aspect of the mandible and the medial aspect of the masseter muscle and its investing fascia. The term is derived from [...] meaning [...] "under" [...] in Latin and masseteric which refers to the masseter muscle. The submasseteric space is one of the four compartments of the <b>masticator</b> space. Sometimes the submasseteric space is described as a series of spaces, created because the masseter muscle has multiple insertions that cover most of the lateral surface of the ramus of the mandible.|$|E
50|$|The parapharyngeal {{space is}} shaped like an {{inverted}} pyramid. Medial and {{inferior to the}} parapharyngeal space is the carotid sheath, containing the internal carotid artery and cranial nerves IX, X and XI. Behind both the parapharyngeal space and carotid space lies the retropharyngeal space, and deep to this a potential space known as the danger space. The danger space serves as an important pathway for complicated infections of the posterior pharynx to enter the chest and spinal column. Anterior to the parapharyngeal space is the <b>masticator</b> space which contains the lower dental row, muscles of mastication, the inferior alveolar nerve as well as branches of cranial nerve V. Lateral to the parapharyngeal space lies the parotid space, which contains the parotid gland, the external carotid artery and cranial nerve VII. Although initial evaluation is typically by physical exam and endoscopy, follow up with CT and MRI usually is needed if surgical intervention is planned.|$|E
