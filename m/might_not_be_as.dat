25|$|TMS-induced MEPs {{have been}} used in many {{experiments}} in cognitive neuroscience. Because MEP amplitude is correlated with motor excitability, they offer a quantitative way to test the role of various types of intervention on the motor system (pharmacological, behavioral, lesion, etc.). TMS-induced MEPs may thus serve as an index of covert motor preparation or facilitation, e.g., induced by the mirror neuron system when seeing someone's else actions. In addition, MEPs are used as a reference to adjust the intensity of stimulation that needs to be delivered by TMS when targeting cortical regions whose response <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> easily measurable, e.g., in the context of TMS-based therapy.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scientists}} have argued against Edelman's theory, instead suggesting that primary consciousness might have emerged {{with the basic}} vegetative systems of the brain. That is, the evolutionary origin might have come from sensations and primal emotions arising from sensors and receptors, both internal and surface, signaling that {{the well-being of the}} creature was immediately threatened—for example, hunger for air, thirst, hunger, pain, and extreme temperature change. This is based on neurological data showing the thalamic, hippocampal, orbitofrontal, insula, and midbrain sites are the key to consciousness of thirst. These scientists also point out that the cortex <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> important to primary consciousness as some neuro{{scientists have}} believed. Evidence of this {{lies in the fact that}} studies show that systematically disabling parts of the cortex in animals does not remove consciousness. Another study found that children born without a cortex are conscious. Instead of cortical mechanisms, these scientists emphasize brainstem mechanisms as essential to consciousness. Still, these scientists concede that higher order consciousness does involve the cortex and complex communication between different areas of the brain.|$|E

500|$|In May 2011, in The Mix Review, an {{analyzing}} commercial productions, Mike Senior of Sound on Sound revisited {{the original}} mixing of the song. According to him, {{before he started}} the mix, Senior played the song {{a couple of times}} before releasing what thing about it [...] "bugged" [...] him. Working it out, he noted that the harmony of the mix is undermined by the kick drum. [...] "What's My Name?" [...] contains basic harmonies that are a bar of F# minor, a bar of A major and two bars of D-major. Senior stated that on the other side however, there's a very little in the arrangement that could be seen like a traditional melodic bass-line. As the result of that, the [...] "808-style" [...] kick-drum's pronounce pitched components with a power of 37Hz and 74Hz fill that help void with a 'D' note. According to Senior, [...] "the problem is that this only really supports the D‑major chord, destabilizing the home chord of F# minor (by implying that it's actually part of a D‑major 7th chord) and clashing nastily with the A‑major." [...] He further stated that although <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> apparent on small speakers, it still represents [...] "weakness" [...] for him. The section of the song at 3:12 has four bars without the kick-drum and four without it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manner in}} which the {{vertical}} stabilizer separated concerned investigators. The vertical stabilizer is connected to the fuselage with six attaching points. [...] Each point has two sets of attachment lugs, one made of composite material, another of aluminium, all connected by a titanium bolt; damage analysis showed that the bolts and aluminium lugs were intact, but not the composite lugs. This, coupled with two events earlier {{in the life of the}} aircraft, namely delamination in part of the vertical stabilizer prior to its delivery from Airbus's Toulouse factory, and an encounter with heavy turbulence in 1994, caused investigators to examine the use of composites. The possibility that the composite materials <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> strong as previously supposed was a cause of concern because they are used in other areas of the plane, including the engine mounting and the wings. Tests carried out on the vertical stabilizers from the accident aircraft, and from another similar aircraft, found that the strength of the composite material had not been compromised, and the NTSB concluded that the material had failed because it had been stressed beyond its design limit.|$|E

2500|$|Bianca's best friend, Maggie's {{relationship}} with Bianca {{was to be}} strictly platonic. This began to change when viewers cited overwhelming chemistry between the characters' portrayers, Riegel and Hendrickson, and demanded that the show pair Bianca and Maggie romantically. Subtle hints started {{to appear in the}} series suggesting Maggie <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> heterosexual as she claimed, such as her leaving a white rose on Bianca's desk the day she is to go on a date with character Tim Dillon, even insisting on spending more time with Bianca while on the date. In a confrontational episode where a sexually frustrated Bianca finally asks Maggie to define what they are to each other, Maggie, after some avoidance, states that, romantically, she is [...] "into guys" [...] and only guys. The scenes became some of the most debated in the show's history; fans were angry, frustrated, and saddened by the series' refusal to pursue a Bianca and Maggie romance. Riegel and Hendrickson received praise for their performances in the scenes, and Maggie was seen moving on with new male character Henry Chin. Hendrickson stated her dissatisfaction with Maggie becoming romantically involved with a man so quickly after declaring her heterosexuality. She said that it was only a week after Maggie's confrontation with Bianca.|$|E

It is reported to have cost £1million to make, said to be the most expensive stunt EastEnders has ever filmed. The crash was filmed over two days and was directed by Michael Owen Morris, who had to create what was originally scripted as [...] "car hits wall" [...] and compared it to a James Bond film.

[...] Bruce Kluger of Parenting commented likewise: [...] "The computer animation <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>as</b> quaint as the pen-and-ink of the 1980s version, but the new songs and brisk pace make this one a keeper for a new generation." [...] In July 2005, Rob Lowing of Sydney, Australia's The Sun-Herald gave it three stars out of five, and wrote: [...] "Adults will find this computer-generated cartoon as sickly sweet as fairy floss but tiny tots will love the colourful blobsoops, we mean the Care Bears. [...] Support characters that look like toys, four bright songs and lots of giggling will score with the under-fives." [...] Saskatchewan's The Star Phoenix also praised the film and its soundtrack, adding that [...] "Even the movie is [...] "bear"-able for grown-ups with subtle adult humour woven into the silliness." [...] But MaryAnn Johanson of the Flick Filosopher called it a [...] "horrifying attempt at children's entertainment", adding that [...] "The cold CGI animation removes any vestige of coziness {{that might have been}} found in what is essentially a giant advertisement for itself." [...] She referred to the title setting, Joke-a-lot, as [...] "a sort of Oz-meets-Candyland with just a soupcon of pastel near-oddity Tim Burton might have pondered in a moment of sentimental weakness".|$|E
