They’re all {{extremely}} interesting, consisting of: - Morse code, Math + Aircraft Identification. In {{the afternoons}} I have P. T., drill, {{use of the}} Carbine, and other basic things. Next week I have my basic classes in the morning, and academics in the afternoon, and continue to alternate from week to week. These current courses are only about 20 hours in length, thus when I finish them I will start others such as Chart + Map reading, Naval Identification, + Fundamentals of Flight combined with Physics. There are seven men in my room now. They’re all swell fellows. Three came from Catawba with me. Reveille here is at 0545 now, {{it used to be}} at 0500, but lights are out at 2100. We eat in a huge mess hall at equally huge tables, all the lower classmen together. The tables are about 100 feet long, and are the usual six foot width. There are 25 of these tables in the mess hall, SO you can imagine its size. We march to and from meals, and are in the hall a certain time being called to attention at its determination. Whether we’re finished eating or not we have to leave. I am dying to know where Ace is. He must be here. Send me his barracks and room number if you have it. Also please send me some hangers. I am going slowly nuts without them. Send me about a dozen. I will be sending my bathrobe home as we can’t have them here. If there is anything you can think to ask <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask.</b> It would take a volume to tell you all we do here, honey. You know how trains always make you feel lonely? Boy, they do me to. On the way down on the train I was feeling pretty blue, and sure wanted to see you, just plain homesick. It’s all gone now though, no time!

40|$|DISCUSSION PAPER: HARNAD: Let <b>me</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> a {{question}} which {{everyone else who}} has been faithfully attending these sessions is surely burning to ask: If some rules you have described constitute universal constraints on all languages, yet they are not learned, nor are they somehow logically necessary a priori, how did language get that way? CHOMSKY: Well, {{it seems to me}} that would be like asking the question how does the heart get that way? I mean we don't learn to have a heart, we don't learn to have arms rather than wings. What is interesting to me is that the question should be asked. It seems to be a natural question, everyone asks it. And we should ask, why people ask it. My feeling is that if, say, the Martian that I was imagining were to look at earthlings and investigate them he would have no reason to doubt that language is as much an organ of the body as the eye or the heart or the liver. It's strictly characteristic of the species, has a highly intricate structure, developed more or less independently of experience in very specific ways, and so on. It has all the general properties of an organ of the body. Why does it seem so strange to us to think in those terms? In other words, why does it seem to us so strange to us to consider human beings in the mental aspects of their life as we consider any object of the natural world? Why is it so natural to insist on a dichotomy in accordance with which we treat the physical development of humans as belonging to the physical world, but not their mental development? My own feeling is, that what we have here is an inversion of a historical tradition that really ultimately has religious and other roots. Traditionally it was regarded as impossible, for all sorts of reasons, to study the human soul by the method of science. Now, what's interesting to me is, precisely within those tendencies in science that tried to be naturalistic, that tried to defend science against religions, barbarism and so on. Precisely in those branches of science the same curious refusal to deal with the facts persisted, so that the question you raise seems to pose an overwhelming paradox to an investigator. The problem seems overwhelming: to explain the growth of this particular mental organ, human language, through the interaction of a genetically determined system with experience, although analogous questions about other organs do not seem to arise with the same force. I think the question arises in the case of language exactly as it does in the case of the eye, the heart or the sexual organs (to pick something that matures long after birth) and so on. There is every reason to suppose that this mental organ, human language, develops in accordance with its genetically determined characteristics, with some minor modifications that give one language or another, depending on experience. But than, one would say the same about any bodily organ as far as I can see...|$|E

I 2 ̆ 7 m sure that my buddies whether here or abroad share these same thoughts. More so we share our thanks to you for your splendid gifts to us at Easter time. I did receive the cookies and they were really delicious; if you don 2 ̆ 7 t believe <b>me,</b> <b>just</b> <b>ask</b> they [sic] boys who shared them with me. We finished them off here at the dispensary {{in no time at}} all. Once more I thank you for your kindness and thoughtfulness. It sure is wonderful to here [sic] the news of the boys we once knew and will know again [...] some of them if not all. Of course, I realize that all news is not good news and some of it hit me pretty hard. When you know such fellows as Pasco Sennercia [sic] the way I did, and then hear that they have passed away [...] well, it just isn 2 ̆ 7 t so easy to take. It 2 ̆ 7 s hard to believe that men like Mr. Lambert* and Mr. Ripley have left the employ of the school. After all, you know, they were 2 ̆ 2 one of the boys 2 ̆ 2 and like one of the boys we hate to see or hear of them leaving too. As you can see I have changed address again; this time I make my home with the engineers here at Camp Pickett, Va. Yes, I 2 ̆ 7 m right back where I started from [...] Virginia. I 2 ̆ 7 m only atached tot his 1260 th Engineering Combat Battalion through the Medical Detachment. I am the authorized driver for the M. D. attached hereto. Besides driving I keep myself busy with additional duties such as typing and administering first-aid. The job isn 2 ̆ 7 t particularly hard to take but it is rather tedious at times. It has kept me from taking basic training all over again and that I like. I 2 ̆ 7 ve been through Infantry and QM basic for thirteen weeks apiece and that, I believe, is enough for one war. I really haven 2 ̆ 7 t much more to say for my words for obvious reasons must be limited in scope. That, I think, you know for yourself. Thank you, fellow members, for all you 2 ̆ 7 ve done; I hope you shall be able to carry on your work as ably in the future as you have been in the past. I 2 ̆ 7 ve got a post-war date with Bryant after this war. I still have six months work to do before I am entitled to a degree; besides, six months will be a wonderful vacation for me after this war. After going through six months of engineering at Penn State, accounting will seem like a dream [...] I hope. Sincerely,Mario Roque [Handwritten by a BSC member]:*Has not left the College.

[...] Many community members expressed frustration that they did not feel they were being heard at the CSU Board of Governors meeting when final approval was given.

5000|$|On 26 April 1992, Mvuyane {{shot and}} paralyzed Mfanafuthi Khumalo. It {{would appear that}} the killings {{gradually}} affected Mvuyane psychologically as he increasingly resorted to torture and irrational behaviour in resolving criminal cases he was investigating. As regards one of the cases Mvuyane was investigating, the victim (Khumalo) had this to say: [...] Mvuyane said to me I should sit on the sofa, and I asked him what he wanted from me. He said I should not ask him any questions, I must just sit on the sofa. And I moved from the bed and sat on the sofa. As I was sitting there he started insulting me. He abused me verbally and he started hitting me on the chest. When I asked him the reason why he was hitting me, he did not answer <b>me.</b> He <b>just</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> where I was shot before. I said on the knee. As I was still answering him, he shot me on my other knee. He said to me he knew that I didn’t die due to gunshots. Then he gave me a knife and he said I should kill myself. And I have five wounds. I stabbed myself because he was pointing a gun at me, telling me to kill myself. And I threw the knife down and I told him that I was not able to kill myself. Then he continued to shoot me. He shot me on the right arm. I stayed there from 4 o’clock in the morning. He did not take me to the hospital. Then I realised that I should just pretend as if I was dead, because I realised that if he saw that I was not dead he was going to continue shooting me. I pretended that I was dead, and I was bleeding profusely. He left me there, believing that I was dead.|$|R
