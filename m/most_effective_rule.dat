40|$|Febrile {{neutropenia}} is {{a common}} and potentially life-threatening complication of treatment for childhood cancer, which has increasingly been subject to targeted treatment based on clinical risk stratification. Our previous meta-analysis demonstrated 16 rules had been described and 2 of them subject to validation {{in more than one}} study. We aimed to advance our knowledge of evidence on the discriminatory ability and predictive accuracy of such risk stratification clinical decision rules (CDR) for children and young people with cancer by updating our systematic review. The review was conducted in accordance with Centre for Reviews and Dissemination methods, searching multiple electronic databases, using two independent reviewers, formal critical appraisal with QUADAS and meta-analysis with random effects models where appropriate. It was registered with PROSPERO: CRD 42011001685. We found 9 new publications describing a further 7 new CDR, and validations of 7 rules. Six CDR have now been subject to testing across more than two data sets. Most validations demonstrated the rule to be less efficient than when initially proposed; geographical differences appeared to be one explanation for this. The use of clinical decision rules will require local validation before widespread use. Considerable uncertainty remains over the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rule</b> to use in each population, and an ongoing individual-patient-data meta-analysis should develop and test a more reliable CDR to improve stratification and optimise therapy. Despite current challenges, we believe {{it will be possible to}} define an internationally effective CDR to harmonise the treatment of children with febrile neutropenia...|$|E

The first objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy of a weather-driven model for predicting infection by Taphrina deformans in different peach-growing areas. In 12 peach-growing areas in the Prefecture of Imathia, Greece, and over two years, the timing of initial infections differed depending on differences in the microclimate (mainly in temperatures and leaf wetness). There was a difference up to 9 days in the date of disease onset predicted by differences in the microclimate between regions. The model accurately predicted the observed differences in date of first symptom appearance. There was also a good correlation between predicted risk and observed disease severity. In addition, differences were observed among areas in the level of risk and the intensity of symptoms with a trend that areas at higher risk having a higher intensity of symptoms. The second objective {{of this study was to}} investigate advantages arising from using the model for scheduling fungicide applications against peach leaf curl. In five years of trials, the use of the model reduced the number of sprays compared to conventional spray program while achieving similar level of control. The simple rule of "spray one day before first forecasted rain after bud break" also gave good results. Trials were set up in order to determine the risk threshold for spraying based on model predictions. The results indicated that spraying only when the predicted risk was between 40 and 60 (over a maximum of 100) might be the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rule,</b> but further investigations should be conducted to clarify the relationship between the predicted risk, actual peach leaf curl incidence and, more importantly, yield in order to determine the time when fungicide sprays are economically justified...|$|E

Brill's transformation-based learning (TBL) approach to automated POS tagging {{was introduced in}} 1992, combining virtues of rule-based and stochastic methods. Brill's innovative idea was to use machine learning techniques to search through all of rule space for the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rules</b> for tagging ambiguous tokens based on their contexts, but this is computationally infeasible. Typical heuristic patches used in Brill tagging to reduce rule space to tractable sizes seem arbitrary, unempirical, and weak.

40|$|In the {{construction}} of city views, complex and effective models for the communication of the urban image have been progressively refined throughout different historical periods. Portrayals of cities carefully composed by specialists in perspective drawing and architecture show the features of their beauty and symbols of their traditions to the world. At the time, they showed, without fully revealing them, the elements of their military strength and geographical positions: elements rendered through the art of conceiving city views in keeping with specific artistic approaches and distinct means of expression. Every view is a message in which artistic content and narrative meaning are woven into a drawing often created with the input of many other artists. The conception of the work was followed by successive phases of surveying and detailed execution, within a tradition which, from the late Middle Ages onward, was progressively enriched by technical innovations regarding the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rules</b> of perspective.

40|$|Many {{scholars}} of common-pool resources {{have found that}} institutions might solve {{the tragedy of the}} commons. I address a particular situation of natural resource management: that of a protected area. In this situation, interests differ. Local rural inhabitants care about the quality of their environment but also need to exploit the resources for livelihood reasons. An external entity such as the State, a donor, an NGO, or some combination thereof decides {{that there is a need}} for nature conservation in that area. Because of some evidence of failure for a strictly top-down conservationist approach, the external entity decides to apply the concept of participatory conservation: the local inhabitants become stakeholders in the management of the area and become collectively responsible for conservation, with rights to exploit the resources up to some degree. I argue that project designers try to find a solution to nature conservation through the creation of a situation of a commons: creating a community that has rights and duties toward a particular natural area that is endowed with some resources. Many scholars rely mostly on institutions that are endogenously created within the users' community to avoid the tragedy of the commons. However, what happens if institutions are imposed? In participatory conservation initiatives, the community has collective rights over the resources, and in this sense, the issue of endogenous rules for the commons management is relevant. However, the level to which the community should exploit the resource is usually imposed by the external project designers. Using agent-based simulations, I develop a theoretical model to look at the consequences of an imposed institution on the state of a forest and on the users' profit, taking into account the possibilities of violating the imposed rules and facing enforcement. I compare the consequences of this imposed institution with those deriving from an endogenously created institution. I also analyze the interaction between the different kinds of institutions and the individual perceptions of each agent. Many results of the model confirm the quantitative and qualitative findings of the literature: the presence of institutions and enforcement improve the management of the resource with respect to an open-access situation, with different degree of success depending on the kind of institution in place. The two main counterintuitive findings are the following. First, an exogenous institution imposed by external agents may crowd out agents' intrinsic environmental motivations. Second, when an imposed exogenous institution is in place, the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rule</b> is one allowing a sufficient degree of access to resources for the agents, provided that adequate rule enforcement is implemented...|$|E
40|$|Debt limits, {{interest}} coverage ratios, one-off {{balanced budget}} requirements, pay-as-you-go rules, and tax and expenditure limits {{are among the}} most important fiscal rules for constraining intertemporal transfers.

40|$|International audienceIn a patchy environment, predators are {{expected}} to increase turning rate and start an area-restricted search (ARS) when prey have been encountered, but few empirical data exist for large predators. By using GPS loggers with devices measuring prey capture, we studied how a marine predator adjusts foraging movements at various scales in relation to prey capture. Wandering albatrosses use two tactics, sit and wait and foraging in flight, the former tactic being three times less efficient than the latter. During flight foraging, birds caught large isolated prey and used ARS at scales varying from 5 to 90 km, with large-scale ARS being used only by young animals. Birds did not show strong responses to prey capture at a large scale, few ARS events occurred after prey capture, and birds did not have high rates of prey capture in ARS. Only at small scales did birds increase sinuosity after prey captures for a limited time period, and this occurred only after they had caught a large prey item within an ARS zone. When this species searches over a large scale, the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> search <b>rule</b> was to follow a nearly straight path. ARS {{may be used to}} restrict search to a particular environment where prey capture is more predictable and profitable...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} cope with more {{realistic}} production scenarios, scheduling theory has been increasingly considering assembly job shops. Such an effort has raised synchronization of operations and components as a major scheduling issue. <b>Most</b> <b>effective</b> priority <b>rules</b> designed for assembly shops have incorporated measures to improve coordination when scheduling assembly structures. However, by assuming a forward loading, the priority rules designed by these studies schedule all operations as soon as possible, which often leads to an increase of the workin- progress level. This study {{is based on the}} assumption that synchronization may be improved by sequencing rules that incorporate measures {{to cope with}} the complexity of product structures. Moreover, this study favours the idea that, in order to improve synchronization and, consequently, reduce waiting time, backward loading should be considered as well. By recognizing that assembly shop structures are intrinsically networks, this study investigates the feasibility of adopting the Critical Path Method as a sequencing rule for assembly shop. Furthermore, since a Critical Path type scheduling requires a precise determination of production capacity, this study also includes Finite Capacity as a requisite for developing feasible schedules. In order to test the above assumptions, a proven and <b>effective</b> sequencing <b>rule</b> is selected to act as a benchmark and a simulation model is developed. The simulation results from several experiments showed significant reduction on the waiting time performance measure due to the adoption of the proposed critical path type priority rule. Finally, a heuristic procedure is proposed as a guideline for designing scheduling systems which incorporate Critical Path based rules and Finite Capacity approach...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{primary concern}} of this {{dissertation}} is {{the reduction of}} cross-border tax obstacles by improving the VAT rules governing cross border supplies of services and intangibles. These cross-border transactions are on the increase for many countries around the world. Cross-border transactions come with many challenges which impact current VAT rules and systems negatively and expose serious shortcomings in the application thereof. The dissertation examines {{the nature of the}} current cross-border VAT rules in South Africa (SA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and analyses the effectiveness and adequacy thereof. As a result of globalization rapid growth in international trade, specifically by electronic means, is inevitable. Today businesses are certainly becoming more focused internationally and are able to conduct their business activities across borders without constraints. Many VAT rules were designed only taking into account national economic activities and not international activities. The supply of services and intangibles across borders may be made without being reported, recorded and taxed. Many cross-border trading activities may potentially fall outside of the tax net and result in the non-collection of VAT revenues. Many countries have introduced a place of supply rule to mitigate the challenges and uncertainties arising from cross-border transactions. South Africa's value-added tax system does not include a place of supply rule. South Africa's Revenue authorities are currently faced with many challenges and uncertainties regarding the tax consequences of cross border transactions. The effectiveness of SA's existing VAT rules governing exports and imports are increasingly challenged by the growth in online web-based commerce. The difficulty in establishing the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> <b>rules</b> to ensure compliance with VAT obligations on web-based transactions is growing. There is no standard set of VAT rules for cross-border transactions that can readily be applied internationally to every circumstance to determine the place of supply. The aim of this research is to determine whether the introduction of a place of supply <b>rule</b> is an <b>effective</b> solution to resolve the challenges and uncertainties resulting from cross border electronic transactions and ultimately increase VAT revenue. The dissertation specifically includes information on the practical application of the place of supply rule and the challenges facing the UK. A comparison between the VAT rules applied in South Africa for imports versus the UK place of supply rules is made and the significant differences are highlighted. In conclusion it is proposed that the introduction of a place of supply rule in South Africa would be beneficial and would contribute to the development an d improvement of South Africa's VAT system...|$|R
40|$|Classifier {{ensembles}} {{have been}} one of the main topics of interest in the neural networks, machine learning and pattern recognition communities during the past fifteen years [21, 28, 16, 17, 26, 36, 27, 23, 11]. They are currently one of the state of the art techniques available for the design of classification systems and an effective option to the traditional approach based on the design of a single, monolithic classifier in many applications. Broadly speaking, two main choices have to be made in the design of a classifier ensemble: how to generate individual classifiers and how to combine them. Two main approaches have emerged to deal with these design steps: coverage optimisation, focused on generating an ensemble of classifiers as much complementary as possible, which are then fused with simple combining rules, and decision optimisation, focused on finding the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> combining <b>rule</b> to exploit at best a given classifier ensemble [21]. One of the most studied and widely used combining rules, especially in the former approach, is the linear combination of classifier outputs. Linear combiners are often used for neural network ensembles, given that neural networks provide continuous outputs. The simplicity of linear combiners and their continuous nature favoured the development of analytical models for the analysis of the performance of ensembles of predictors, both for the case of regression problems and for the relatively more complex case of classification problems...|$|R
40|$|Substructural {{analysis}} (SSA) {{was one of}} {{the very}} first machine learning techniques to be applied to chemoinformatics in the area of virtual screening. For this method, given a set of compounds typically defined by their fragment occurrence data (such as 2 D fingerprints). The SSA computes weights for each of the fragments which outlines its contribution to the activity (or inactivity) of compounds containing that fragment. The overall probability of activity for a compound is then computed by summing up or combining the weights for the fragments present in the compound. A variety of weighting schemes based on specific relationship-bound equations are available for this purpose. This thesis identifies uplift to the effectiveness of SSA, using two evolutionary computation methods based on genetic traits, particularly the genetic algorithm (GA) and genetic programming (GP). Building on previous studies, it was possible to analyse and compare ten published SSA weighting schemes based on a simulated virtual screening experiment. The analysis showed the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> weighting scheme to be the R 4 equation which was a part of document-based weighting schemes. A second experiment was carried out to investigate the application of GA-based weighting scheme for the SSA in comparison to an experiment using the R 4 weighting scheme. The GA algorithm is simple in concept focusing purely on suitable weight generation and effective in operation. The findings show that the GA-based SSA is superior to the R 4 -based SSA, both in terms of active compound retrieval rate and predictive performance. A third experiment investigated the genetic application via a GP-based SSA. Rigorous experiment results showed that the GP was found to be superior to the existing SSA weighting schemes. In general, however, the GP-based SSA was found to be less effective than the GA-based SSA. A final experimented is described in this thesis which sought to explore the feasibility of data fusion on both the GA and GP. It is a method producing a final ranking list from multiple sets of ranking lists, based on several fusion rules. The results indicate that data fusion is a good method to boost GA-and GP-based SSA searching. The RKP rule was considered the <b>most</b> <b>effective</b> fusion <b>rule...</b>|$|R
