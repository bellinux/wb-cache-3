5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

What did the world want me for? The title {{made me think of}} an entire generation of Lolitas: someone—our parents? God?—needed us to be there, but the need felt neurotic and uncompassionate. In “We Love You Carol and Alison” (my favorite Game Theory song) I'm trying to express that teen alienation thing that the kids go for, but I’m also fishing around for a basis of proper adulthood.|$|E

Sing hosanna to the King!The song is sung in verse-chorus format; {{subsequent}} verses replace [...] "oil <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lamp" [...] {{with a different}} request, with the verb [...] "burning" [...] replaced with an appropriate verb for the request. Thus the second verse runs: [...] "Give <b>me</b> joy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, Keep <b>me</b> singing, Give <b>me</b> joy <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, I pray (etc.)", continuing with a third verse beginning [...] "Give <b>me</b> peace <b>in</b> <b>my</b> heart, Keep <b>me</b> resting" [...] and so on.|$|R

25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

500|$|In January 1896 Yeats moved again, {{into a small}} flat in Woburn Place, {{so as to be}} {{nearer to}} her.

Yeats' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period, and for the duration of their affair, Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet.|$|E

500|$|Wodehouse's {{other new}} venture in 1904 was {{writing for the}} stage. Towards {{the end of the}} year the {{librettist}} Owen Hall invited him to contribute an additional lyric for a musical comedy Sergeant Brue. Wodehouse had loved theatre since his first visit, aged thirteen, when Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience had made him [...] "drunk with ecstasy". His lyric for Hall, [...] "Put <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Little Cell", was a Gilbertian number for a trio of comic crooks, with music by Frederick Rosse; it was well received and launched Wodehouse on a career as a theatre writer that spanned three decades.|$|E
500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop.

500|$|During the Beatles' American tour in August 1965, Harrison's friend David Crosby of the Byrds {{introduced}} him to Indian classical music {{and the work of}} sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Harrison described Shankar as [...] "the first person who ever impressed <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life... and he was the only person who didn't try to impress me." [...] Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music. According to Lavezzoli, Harrison's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles' song [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] "opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music, triggering what Shankar would call 'The Great Sitar Explosion' of 1966–67". Lavezzoli recognises Harrison as [...] "the man most responsible for this phenomenon".|$|E

[...] "Balzac's characters", Robb notes, [...] "were as real to {{him as if he were}} observing them in the outside world".

[...] Writing for the website Sporting News, Jeff Diamond, the Vikings' general manager in 1998, observed that, [...] "Our team played the rest of the game as if it was in shock that our automatic kicker had missed at the most critical time."
