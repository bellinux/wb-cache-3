Radial bladed wheels are often used on particulate-laden gas streams because they are the least sensitive to solid build-up on the blades, but they are often characterized by greater noise output. High speeds, low volumes, and high pressures are common with radial blowers, and are often used in vacuum cleaners, pneumatic <b>material</b> <b>conveying</b> systems, and similar processes.|$|E

The downtime cost of belt conveyor systems may vary from one application to another. The financial loss due to the downtime of belt conveyor systems can be in a range of 100,000 to 200,000 Euro per hour, considering the loss of the revenue from <b>material</b> <b>conveying,</b> and shutdowns of subsequent material processing facilities (Lodewijks, 2015).|$|E

Parameter {{optimization}} of {{screw axis}} with variable diameters and different pitches {{is very important}} to improve the performance of <b>material</b> <b>conveying</b> equipment. But it is a trouble thing with classic theory modeling because of the complexity of material fluidity and screw structure. A PSO-trained BP algorithm is applied to establish the screw axis parameter optimization neural network (NN) model. Taking asphalt transfer vehicle as an example, PSO-BP NN is applied to set up the relationship between input parameters and aim parameter. Practical example shows that the PSO-BP NN has faster convergence and higher computational precision than the other three investigated algorithms, and it provides a powerful parameter optimization approach for screw axis with variable diameters and different pitches...|$|E

Before the experiment, steam is switched to device for purging and replacing the air inside.

The discharging process {{is similar to that of}} the feeding. The barrel and two screw shafts are heated rapidly by induction heating, and materials can be heated rapidly during conveying. The total heating time of the material, that is, the heating residence time, is equal to the <b>material</b> <b>conveying</b> time.|$|E

30|$|In {{continuous}} processing, the way {{of materials}} carrier is important. Fixed bed and fluidized bed are typical installations (Schmidt and Kaminsky 2001; Shen and Zhang 2003; Liu et al. 2008), which are generally considered suitable for laboratory research. Rotary barrel device (or rotary kiln) is an optional scheme for continuous processing of materials (Fortuna et al. 1997; Chen et al. 2006; Sun et al. 2017). The rotary barrel device usually fixes up the heating unit on the outer side, heating the material through heat conduction. The whole equipment is usually larger and the heating may not be efficient. On the other hand, continuous feeding and discharging are not very convenient because of the rotary kiln structure characteristic. Nickerson et al. designed a screw conveyor apparatus with hollow blades (Nickerson 2008; Whitney and Nickerson 2010). The structure of the hollow blade is used for conducting hot fluid and to heat the spiral blade. This way {{takes into account the}} continuity of <b>material</b> <b>conveying,</b> and the total heat transfer area is increased.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between culture, affordance and proficiency. Further, to study the possibility of a cognitive gap between artists and the audience they design for, akin to the Designer-User gap in interaction design and user experience research. In order to contextualize the issue studied, relevant theories in ecological psychology, visual literacy, image interpretation and cognitive models are presented and discussed alongside contemporary industry issues that may have arisen from this type of cognitive gap. As artist and audience might have these vastly different interpretations of identical visual <b>material,</b> <b>conveying</b> or communicating specific design ideas or aesthetics may be compromised or lost in translation, negatively influencing visual communication. The study compared a set of individuals matching either the label of concept artist or target game audience on their unmediated reactions and mental heuristics when encountering a novel design from a familiar genre, using a method of concurrent verbalization. Results were discussed and compared to prevailing theories in cognition, user experience design and the presented research question.
