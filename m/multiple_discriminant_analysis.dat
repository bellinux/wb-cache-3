40|$|For {{classification}} problems, {{feature extraction}} {{is a crucial}} process which aims to find a suitable data representation that increases {{the performance of the}} machine learning algorithm. According to the curse of dimensionality theorem, the number of samples needed for a classification task increases exponentially as the number of dimensions (variables, features) increases. On the other hand, it is costly to collect, store and process data. Moreover, irrelevant and redundant features might hinder classifier performance. In exploratory analysis settings, high dimensionality prevents the users from exploring the data visually. Feature extraction is a two-step process: feature construction and feature selection. Feature construction creates new features based on the original features and feature selection is the process of selecting the best features as in filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In this work, we focus on feature construction methods that aim to decrease data dimensionality for visualization tasks. Various linear (such as principal components <b>analysis</b> (PCA), <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminants</b> <b>analysis</b> (MDA), exploratory projection pursuit) and non-linear (such as multidimensional scaling (MDS), manifold learning, kernel PCA/LDA, evolutionary constructive induction) techniques have been proposed for dimensionality reduction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the usefulness of statistical decomposition measures in the prediction of industrial bond rating changes. Further, the predictive ability of decomposition measures is compared with <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminant</b> <b>analysis</b> on the same sample. The problem of this study is twofold. It stems in general from the statistical problems associated with current techniques employed in the study of bond ratings and in particular from the lack of attention to the study of bond rating changes. Two main hypotheses are tested in this study. The first is that bond rating changes can be predicted through the use of financial statement data. The second is that decomposition analysis can achieve the same performance as <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminant</b> <b>analysis</b> in duplicating and predicting industrial bond rating changes. To explain and predict industrial bond rating changes, statistical decomposition measures were computed for each company in the sample. Based on these decomposition measures, the two types of analyses performed were (a) a univariate analysis where each decomposition measure was compared with an industry average decomposition measure, and (b) a multivariate analysis where decomposition measures were used as independent variables in a probability linear model. In addition to statistical decomposition analysis, <b>multiple</b> <b>discriminant</b> <b>analysis</b> was used in duplicating and predicting bond rating changes.

The variables that best discriminated between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms were the level of operating profitability and size of investments.

From this venerable models, an unmeasurable number of variants have been tested, either the number of indicators compounding the final score was changed to improve the fitness of the index, or the formula was adapted to fit better with peculiar situations such as specific activities (services, start-ups, …) or markets (emerging, blue ships, …).
