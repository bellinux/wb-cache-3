On 20 May 1797 (20 prairial V), Charles Pichegru was elected president of the Council of 500 and Barbé-Marbois of the Council of Elders. Vaublanc himself was named <b>membre</b> du bureau of the Council of 500. On the same day, the Legislature proceeded to replace the republican Director, Le Tourneur (who had gained the position by drawing straws), with the moderate royalist François de Barthélémy, at that time the French ambassador to Switzerland. Vaublanc voted against his nomination, preferring General Beurnonville, who was known for his forcefulness.|$|E

500|$|The colonial {{high society}} of Antananarivo showcased Rabearivelo's work as {{evidence}} {{of the success of the}} French assimilation policy and the beneficial effects of colonialism in Africa. In his journals, the poet wrote that he felt [...] "used" [...] by the French authorities in Madagascar. Governor Montagné awarded him an affiliation (<b>membre</b> correspondant) with the Académie Malgache in 1932. But in 1937, Rabearivelo's trust in the assimilation messages and gestures of Antananarivo's colonial high society was betrayed. He was imprisoned for three days for failing to pay taxes, a penalty from which he should have been exempted due to his status as a low-ranking employee of the colonial administration. He had also been promised that he would represent Madagascar at the 1937 Universal Exposition in Paris, but in May 1937 the colonial authorities informed him that he would not be part of the island's delegation. Consequently, Rabearivelo became embittered toward France and its colonial message of assimilation, a sentiment strongly expressed in his journals. He was likewise rejected by Malagasy high society, who condemned his unconventional behavior and views, particularly in light of his role as husband and father. His compatriots also held him in contempt for his perceived eagerness to embrace the French colonial rule and culture.|$|E

2500|$|Resuming his {{undergraduate}} studies, Lucas won a Chancellor's Medal for Classics and the Browne Medal (1920), and revived {{meetings of}} the Apostles, suspended since 1914, becoming Society Secretary and contributing nineteen papers. He was elected to a Fellowship at King's College in 1920 before he had completed his degree, Keynes paying for him to holiday in Greece with Sebastian Sprott {{on the eve of}} his Tripos. He took a starred first, beginning his career as a Classics lecturer in October 1920. In the spring of 1921 he spent three months in Greece as a student of the British School at Athens, researching the site of the Battle of Pharsalus in Thessaly (see Pharsalus below). Back in Cambridge he switched that year to teaching for the English Tripos (instituted in 1919). He was a member of the Cambridge University English Faculty from 1921–1939 and from 1945–1962. He was a University Reader in English from 1947–1962. His move from Classics to English and his edition of Webster were inspired in large part by Sheppard's March 1920 Marlowe Society production of The White Devil, which made a powerful impression on him: [...] "What could make the Cambridge production of The White Devil in 1920 seem, to at least two who saw it then without preconceptions, the most staggering performance they had ever known?" [...] " [...] has been lucky in finding a writer [...] who takes his standpoint," [...] T. E. Lawrence remarked, [...] "and sums up life rather in his fashion." [...] Lucas's preference, however, lay with Comparative Literature, and after Webster he turned to his Studies French and English (1934; revised 1950) (he was <b>Membre</b> Correspondant Honoraire de L'Institut Littéraire et Artistique de France [...] ). He served as committee member for the Cambridge Greek Play (1921–33). As part-time Librarian at King's (1922–36) he accessioned the donated papers of Rupert Brooke. His students at King's included George Rylands, John Hayward, F. E. Halliday, H. C. A. [...] "Tom" [...] Gaunt, Alan Clutton-Brock, Julian Bell, Winton Dean and Desmond Flower. At the invitation of its literary editor, Desmond MacCarthy, he reviewed poetry and criticism for the New Statesman from 1922 to 1926, having begun his career as reviewer with the Athenaeum in 1920–21, its last year.|$|E

60|$|Last of all, I took {{advantage}} of the opportunity afforded by a meeting of the Anthropological Institute to read a memoir there on the subject, and to bring with me many gentlemen well known in the scientific world, who have this habit of seeing numerals in Forms, and whose diagrams were suspended on the walls. Amongst them are Mr. G. Bidder, Q.C., the Rev. Mr. G. Henslow, the botanist; Prof. Schuster, F.R.S., the physicist; Mr. Roget, Mr. Woodd Smith, and Colonel Yule, C.B., the geographer. These diagrams are given in Plate I. Figs. 20-24. I wished that some of my foreign correspondents could also have been present, such as M. Antoine d'Abbadie, the well-known French traveller and <b>Membre</b> de l'Institut, and Baron v. Osten Sacken, the Russian diplomatist and entomologist, for they had given and procured me much information.|$|E
60|$|When Marsyas was 'torn {{from the}} {{scabbard}} of his limbs'--della vagina della <b>membre</b> sue, {{to use one}} of Dante's most terrible Tacitean phrases--he had no more song, the Greek said. Apollo had been victor. The lyre had vanquished the reed. But perhaps the Greeks were mistaken. I hear in much modern Art the cry of Marsyas. It is bitter in Baudelaire, sweet and plaintive in Lamartine, mystic in Verlaine. It is in the deferred resolutions of Chopin's music. It is in the discontent that haunts Burne-Jones's women. Even Matthew Arnold, whose song of Callicles tells of 'the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,' and the 'famous final victory,' in such a clear note of lyrical beauty, has not a little of it; in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts his verses, neither Goethe nor Wordsworth could help him, though he followed each in turn, and when he seeks to mourn for Thyrsis or to sing of the Scholar Gipsy, it is the reed that he has to take for the rendering of his strain. But whether or not the Phrygian Faun was silent, I cannot be. Expression is as necessary to me as leaf and blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind. Between my art and the world there is now a wide gulf, but between art and myself there is none. I hope at least that there is none.|$|E

6000|$|In 1852 M. Naudin, a {{distinguished}} botanist, expressly stated, in an admirable {{paper on the}} Origin of Species ("Revue Horticole", page 102; since partly republished in the [...] "Nouvelles Archives du Museum", tom. i, page 171), his belief that species are formed in an analogous manner as varieties are under cultivation; and the latter process he attributes to man's power of selection. But he does not show how selection acts under nature. He believes, like Dean Herbert, that species, when nascent, were more plastic than at present. He lays weight on {{what he calls the}} principle of finality, [...] "puissance mysterieuse, indeterminee; fatalite pour les uns; pour les autres volonte providentielle, dont l'action incessante sur les etres vivantes determine, a toutes les epoques de l'existence du monde, la forme, le volume, et la duree de chacun d'eux, en raison de sa destinee dans l'ordre de choses dont il fait partie. C'est cette puissance qui harmonise chaque <b>membre</b> a l'ensemble, en l'appropriant a la fonction qu'il doit remplir dans l'organisme general de la nature, fonction qui est pour lui sa raison d'etre." [...] (From references in Bronn's [...] "Untersuchungen uber die Entwickelungs-Gesetze", it appears that the celebrated botanist and palaeontologist Unger published, in 1852, his belief that species undergo development and modification. Dalton, likewise, in Pander and Dalton's work on Fossil Sloths, expressed, in 1821, a similar belief. Similar views have, as is well known, been maintained by Oken in his mystical [...] "Natur-Philosophie". From other references in Godron's work [...] "Sur l'Espece", it seems that Bory St. Vincent, Burdach, Poiret and Fries, have all admitted that new species are continually being produced. I may add, that of the thirty-four authors named in this Historical Sketch, who believe in the modification of species, or at least disbelieve in separate acts of creation, twenty-seven have written on special branches of natural history or geology.) ...|$|E
