40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} efficacies of {{preparations for}} surgical hand antisepsis {{can be determined}} according to a European standard (prEN 12791 [EN]) and a U. S. standard (tentative final monograph for health care antiseptic drug products [TFM]). The U. S. method differs in the product application mode (hands and lower forearms, versus hands only in EN), the number of applications (11 over 5 days, versus a single application in EN), the sampling times (0, 3, and 6 h after application, versus 0 and 3 h in EN), the sampling methods (glove juice versus fingertip sampling in EN), and the outcome requirements (absolute bacterial reduction factor [RF], versus noninferiority to reference treatment in EN). We have studied the efficacies of two hand rubs according to both methods. One hand rub was based on 80 % ethanol and applied for 2 min, {{and the other one}} was based on 45 % propan- 2 -ol, 30 % propan- 1 -ol, and 0. 2 % <b>mecetronium</b> <b>etilsulfate</b> and applied for 1. 5 min. The ethanol-based hand rub was equally effective as the 3 -min reference disinfection of prEN 12791 in both the immediate (RFs, 2. 97 ± 0. 89 versus 2. 92 ± 1. 03, respectively) and sustained (RFs, 2. 20 ± 1. 07 versus 2. 47 ± 1. 25, respectively) effects. According to TFM, the immediate effects were 2. 99 log 10 (day 1), 3. 00 log 10 (day 2), and 3. 43 log 10 (day 5), and bacterial counts were still below baseline after 6 h. The propanol-based hand rub was even more effective than the reference disinfection of prEN 12791 in both the immediate (RFs, 2. 35 ± 0. 99 versus 1. 86 ± 0. 87, respectively) and sustained (RFs, 2. 17 ± 1. 00 versus 1. 50 ± 1. 26, respectively) effects. According to TFM, the immediate effects were 2. 82 log 10 (day 1), 3. 29 log 10 (day 2), and 3. 25 log 10 (day 5), and bacterial counts were still below baseline after 6 h. Some formulations have been reported to meet the efficacy requirements of one of the methods but not those of the other. That is why we conclude that, despite our results, meeting the efficacy requirements of one test method does not allow the claim that the requirements of the other test method are also met...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, a propanol-based hand rub {{has been}} {{described}} to exceed the efficacy requirements of the European standard EN 12791 in only 1. 5 min significantly. But {{the effect of a}} 1 min preceding hand wash and the effect of one additional minute for evaporation of the alcohol after its application on the efficacy after a 1. 5 min application time has never been studied. Methods We have investigated a propanol-based hand rub (Sterillium ®, based on 45 % propan- 2 -ol, 30 % propan- 1 -ol and 0. 2 % <b>mecetronium</b> <b>etilsulfate)</b> in three variations: with (A) and without (B) a 1 min hand wash before the disinfection of 1. 5 min with immediate sampling after the disinfection; and (C) without a hand wash before the disinfection but with sampling 1 min after the disinfection. The efficacy of the three variations was compared to the reference treatment of EN 12791. All experiments were performed in a Latin-square design with 20 volunteers. Pre- and post-values (immediate and after 3 hr) were obtained according to EN 12791. Results The 3 min reference disinfection reduced resident hand bacteria on average by 1. 8 log 10 steps (immediate effect) and 1. 4 log 10 -steps (sustained effect) respectively. Method A was equally effective as the reference (immediate efficacy: 1. 5 log 10 -steps; sustained efficacy: 1. 6 log 10 -steps). Method B seemed to be more effective (immediate efficacy: 2. 3 log 10 -steps; sustained efficacy: 1. 7 log 10 -steps). Method C revealed the best efficacy (immediate efficacy: 2. 3 log 10 -steps; sustained efficacy: 2. 0 log 10 -steps). A comparison of all three treatment variations and the reference treatment revealed a significant difference for the immediate efficacy (p = 0. 026; Friedman test), but not for the sustained efficacy (p = 0. 430). A post-hoc-test for the immediate efficacy indicated a significant difference between methods A and C (p Conclusion An application of the propanol-based hand rub for 1. 5 min after 1 min hand wash fulfills the efficacy requirements of EN 12791. The efficacy can be improved to some extent by omitting the preceding hand wash and by awaiting the evaporation of the alcohol which is clinical practice anyway. The preceding hand wash has the most negative effect on the immediate effect. Based on our data hands should not be routinely washed before the disinfection period unless there is a good reason for it such as visible soiling. </p...|$|E
