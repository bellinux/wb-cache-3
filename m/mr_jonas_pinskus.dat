50|$|On August 17, 2007, Jonas and his {{brothers}} guest-starred in an episode of Hannah Montana, titled Me and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas.</b> The episode debuted alongside the television film High School Musical 2 and a sneak peek of the new Disney Channel show Phineas and Ferb.

60|$|It {{was pretty}} clear that he regretted his late outbreak, and that he mistrusted its effect on Mr Pecksniff; for as often as that gentleman glanced towards <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> he found <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> glancing at him, which was {{a new source of}} embarrassment. It was but a {{short-lived}} one, though, for <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> soon began to whistle, whereupon Mr Pecksniff, taking his cue from his friend, began to hum a tune melodiously.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} Jonas Brothers guest starred on the Hannah Montana episode [...] "Me and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> Jonas", {{development}} for a TV series and Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock starring the Jonas Brothers, the TV show began.|$|R

By nightfall, Douglas is no better, and his family takes him outside in a cot, in the hope that he will be cooled by a wind.|$|R

60|$|Miss Charity {{replied that}} she was quite well, and gave <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> Chuzzlewit her hand.|$|R
60|$|Neither of {{the sisters}} spoke a word. <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> paused and cleared his throat, which was very dry.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Except,' whispered <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> to his {{favourite}} cousin, 'except {{when one}} lives too long. Ha, ha! Tell {{the other one}} that--I say!' ...|$|R
60|$|Again <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{looked at}} the landscape; then at the coachman; then at the luggage on the roof; finally at Mr Pecksniff.|$|R
60|$|This threat had {{the desired}} effect of {{preventing}} any farther altercation, for <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> immediately proposed an adjournment, and the same being carried unanimously, they departed from the house straightway. On the doorstep, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> gave an arm to each cousin; which act of gallantry being observed by Bailey junior, from the garret window, was by him saluted with a loud and violent fit of coughing, to which paroxysm he was still the victim when they turned the corner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Probably,' {{said the}} parent. 'Years will tame down the wildness of my foolish bird, {{and then it}} will be caged. But Cherry, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> Cherry--' ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{was not in}} {{the best}} of humours, for he merely said, as he looked round, 'We don't want you any more, you know, Mrs Gamp.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I saw a wildness in her eye, t'other day,' said <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> {{addressing}} Charity. 'But you're {{the one to}} sit solemn! I say--You {{were regularly}} prim, cousin!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was thoughtless of us, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> it {{was very}} thoughtless,' said Pecksniff, {{smoothing}} his daugther's hair. 'My darling, {{do you see that}} I am not alone!' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Me and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> and <b>Mr.</b> Jonas" [...] is the 42nd {{episode of}} the Disney Channel series Hannah Montana, and {{features}} the Jonas Brothers as special guest stars. The episode was first aired after the premiere of the Disney Channel Original Movie High School Musical 2 and a sneak peek of the then new series Phineas and Ferb. The episode broke basic cable records with 10.7 million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever. It is also the highest-rated episode of Hannah Montana ever.|$|R
60|$|When {{they had}} been out for some hours and were {{thoroughly}} fatigued, it being by that time twilight, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> intimated that he would show them {{one of the best}} pieces of fun with which he was acquainted. This joke was of a practical kind, and its humour lay in taking a hackney-coach to the extreme limits of possibility for a shilling. Happily it brought them to the place where <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> dwelt, or the young ladies might have rather missed the point and cream of the jest.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{was evidently}} disconcerted, {{and at a}} loss how to proceed. It was a good answer. It seemed a deep one, but such is the wisdom of simplicity!' ...|$|R
60|$|Not she. She {{had seen}} nothing {{but her father}} until now. She saw <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> now, though; and blushed, and hung her head down, as she gave him welcome.|$|R
5000|$|The second chapter {{takes place}} {{sometime}} after the narrator has left Pedro's. It introduces Hogg, raping {{a woman in}} an alley. Hogg calls the narrator to him to [...] "finish him up" [...] orally. Hogg takes the narrator to his truck where he explains that while he is a trucker by trade, he prefers getting paid to rape women. Hogg also reveals a bit about himself and his personal history, painting {{a picture of his}} overall persona, which is one of extreme filth, violence, and sexual sociopathy. They drive to meet <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas,</b> who despite his apparent wealth answers his own door and later is revealed to drive his own limousine. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> is Hogg's current client. After <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> describes Hogg's next assignment Hogg states his intention to bring along several other men, and the narrator as well, to participate. At this point the narrator's place as Hogg's companion is solidly established.|$|R
60|$|When the tea-tray {{was taken}} away, {{as it was}} at last, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{produced}} a dirty pack of cards, and entertained the sisters with divers small feats of dexterity: whereof {{the main purpose of}} every one was, that you were to decoy somebody into laying a wager with you that you couldn't do it; and were then immediately to win and pocket his money. <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> informed them that these accomplishments were in high vogue in the most intellectual circles, and that large amounts were constantly changing hands on such hazards. And it may be remarked that he fully believed this; for there is a simplicity of cunning no less than a simplicity of innocence; and in all matters where a lively faith in knavery and meanness was required as the ground-work of belief, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{was one of the most}} credulous of men. His ignorance, which was stupendous, may be taken into account, if the reader pleases, separately.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> {{withdrew his}} arm, {{and for a}} moment looked at her more like a murderer than a lover. But he cleared his brow by degrees, and broke silence with: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no cousin!' said <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> {{sitting down}} {{beside her on the}} window-seat. 'Don't be in a hurry. There's no {{occasion}} for that, you know. What a cruel girl you are!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' {{repeated}} Mr Pecksniff, after {{a little}} reflection. 'I am not the less obliged to you on that account, <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas,</b> for your liberal hospitality; but {{there really is no}} one.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital!" [...] said Holmes, calmly. [...] "Watson, {{a bucket}} of water over the straw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your {{principal}} missing witness, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> Oldacre." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Sara's Way": Mrs. Eben Andrews {{discusses}} {{her daughter}} Sara and Sara's suitor Lige Baxter with <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jonas</b> Andrews. When Lige's brother's business is ruined, everyone involved {{has a different}} view of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe you'll see {{her there}} yet," [...] said <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Jonas,</b> who always took a hopeful view of everything, even of Sara's contrariness. But she felt discouraged, too. Well, {{she had done}} her best.|$|R
30|$|The {{authors are}} {{grateful}} to Senior Scientist Dr. Bo Madsen and <b>Mr.</b> <b>Jonas</b> Kreutzfeldt Heininge from Department of Wind Energy, Technical University of Denmark for access and advice on composite production and physical tests.|$|R
60|$|The old man sighed, {{and still}} sat cowering before the fire. <b>Mr</b> <b>Jonas</b> shook his Britannia-metal {{teaspoon}} at him, {{and taking a}} loftier position, went on to argue the point on high moral grounds.|$|R
