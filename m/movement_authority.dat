25|$|The {{control center}} {{communicates}} with the train using two conductor cables that run between {{the tracks and}} are crossed every 100 m. The control center sends data packets, known as telegrams, to the vehicle which give it its <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> (how far it can proceed and at what speed) and the vehicle sends back data packets indicating its configuration, braking capabilities, speed, and position.|$|E
25|$|Railway {{signalling}} is {{a system}} used to control railway traffic safely to prevent trains from colliding. Being guided by fixed rails which generate low friction, trains are uniquely susceptible to collision since they frequently operate at speeds that do not enable them to stop quickly or within the driver's sighting distance; road vehicles, which encounter {{a higher level of}} friction between their rubber tyres and the road surface, have much shorter braking distances. Most forms of train control involve <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> being passed from those responsible for each section of a rail network to the train crew. Not all methods require the use of signals, and some systems are specific to single track railways.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system uses}} a loop between the rails, to send {{instructions}} to the train and so the train can send updates to the control centre. Each side of the loop crosses over approximately every 25m, and each 25m section is subdivided into 4 further sections, effectively creating 160 virtual 'blocks' in every kilometre of track. These crossovers cause a 180 degree phase shift that is detected by the train to tell when it has passed over one. The system allows trains {{to get up to}} 50m away from each other while both are moving at very low speeds. The system is capable of bi-directional or [...] "wrong way running", but London Underground has this feature disabled. Thus, a train has to be put into restricted manual to run the wrong way along a track. There are exceptions, such as the sidings north of Wembley Park and West Hampstead, and a small area around Stratford Market Depot where the track becomes [...] "locked out" [...] to any other train but the one given a <b>movement</b> <b>authority.</b> Trains constantly receive speed instructions based on the train's determined position that uses a wheel tachometer between loop crossovers, however they receive definite instructions once they report and have passed over a track loop. S40 does not allow speeds higher than 108km/h, and the 1996 stock had to be upgraded slightly so it could use the new equipment, which includes a Vehicle On Board Computer for the S40 system that must interface with the train's control system.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of mixed level signalling {{is based on}} simple principles using bi-directional data exchange between the Radio Block Centre (RBC) and the interlocking systems. The operator sets a route and {{does not need to}} know if the route will be used for a Level NTC (former LSTM) only or a Level 2-equipped train. A route is locked based on the national principles by the interlocking system and the RBC is informed about the routes set. The RBC checks whether it is possible to allocate a train to the route and then informs the interlocking system that a train is allocated to the route. The interlocking system shows the ETCS white bar aspect to all signals along the route including the signal {{at the end of the}} route and sends no ATB-EG code to the track. The RBC sends a <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> to the train if a Level 2 train is allocated to the route. Otherwise the signal shows the optical proceed aspect and the related ATB-EG code is sent to the track. As soon as a Level 2 train reports itself in rear of a route currently assigned for optical authorisation (e.g. after start of mission procedure or when the driver changes level from Level NTC to Level 2), the optical authorisation is automatically upgraded to a Level 2 <b>movement</b> <b>authority.</b> Consequently, a Level 2 <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> is downgraded to an optical authorisation after a predefined time-out if the driver closes the cab or a fault is detected that restricts the <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> (e.g. if the GSM-R radio coverage is unavailable.) ...|$|E
50|$|CITYFLO 650 {{signalling}} is a CBTC {{system designed}} by Bombardier Transportation. It {{makes use of}} bi-directional radio communication between trains and wayside equipment, as well as true moving block technology, to control train operation. Trains report their position via radio, and a wayside signalling system provides <b>movement</b> <b>authorities</b> to the trains via a radio link.|$|R
50|$|While some PTC systems {{interface}} {{directly with}} the existing signal system, others may maintain a set of vital computer systems at a central location that can keep track of trains and issue <b>movement</b> <b>authorities</b> to them directly via a wireless data network. This is often {{considered to be a}} form of Communications Based Train Control and is not a necessary part of PTC.|$|R
50|$|The main {{concept of}} PTC (as defined for North American Class I freight railroads) {{is that the}} train {{receives}} information about its location {{and where it is}} allowed to safely travel, also known as <b>movement</b> <b>authorities.</b> Equipment on board the train then enforces this, preventing unsafe movement. PTC systems may work in either dark territory or signaled territory, and may use GPS navigation to track train movements.|$|R
50|$|Wayside ETCS system. This {{subsystem}} undertakes {{the management}} of all the communications with the trains in its area. Additionally, it calculates the limits of <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> that every train must respect while operating in the mentioned area. This task is therefore critical for the operation safety.|$|E
50|$|ETCS Level 1 Limited Supervision mode {{allows the}} ETCS cab {{computer}} to disregard some information {{in comparison to}} the traditional Full Supervision mode. Formally, this is possible for all ETCS levels, but it is most commonly used with Level 1 - specifically the ETCS equipment is only used to control the safety restrictions while the communication of a <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> is left to other systems. This allows older tracks to be rebuilt by adding ETCS L1 LS equipment where <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> is derived from the existing lineside equipment or radioed by GSM-R. Studies have shown that ETCS L1 LS has the same capacity as plain Level 1 FS for half the cost. That has led to railway operators pushing for the inclusion of Limited Supervision into the ETCS Baseline 3.|$|E
50|$|Track Warrant Control {{is similar}} to yet {{distinct}} from the concept of Direct Traffic Control (DTC), appearing later as railroads migrated fully from older forms of Train order operation. DTC was designed to facilitate the movement of trains using concepts of blocks and sidings previously used with Train Orders. DTC is only a mechanism to transfer <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> and can only work within an arrangement of predefined blocks. Track Warrant systems appropriate the remaining responsibility of Train Order systems to notify operating personnel of safety directives that include things like temporary speed restrictions, tracks out of service, etc. and combines them with the <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> function of DTC. Furthermore Track Warrants {{are not limited to}} fixed blocks and can be issued and released from almost any explicitly identified landmark along the rail line.|$|E
5000|$|... (b) Continuous Automatic Train Protection: {{provides}} the added value of improved headway while maintaining safe train separation, without depending on axle counters or track circuits. The system will automatically generate <b>movement</b> <b>authorities</b> based on actual locations of moving and fixed obstacles. It {{is used in}} conjunction with external interlockings and provides a replacement for automatic separation signals between interlockings. It can operate seamlessly with existing track circuits, which provides an inherent mechanism to operate mixed-mode traffic.|$|R
50|$|A Radio Block Centre is a {{specialised}} {{computing device}} with specification Safety integrity level 4 (SIL) for generating <b>Movement</b> <b>Authorities</b> (MA) and transmitting it to trains. It gets information from Signalling control {{and from the}} trains in its section. It hosts the specific geografic data of the railway section and receives cryptographic keys from trains passing in. According to conditions the RBC will attend the trains with MA until leaving the section. RBC have defined interfaces to trains, but have no regulated interfaces to Signalling Control and only have national regulation.|$|R

5000|$|Level 2 is {{a digital}} radio-based system. <b>Movement</b> <b>authority</b> and other signal aspects are {{displayed}} in the cab for the driver. Apart from a few indicator panels, it is therefore possible to dispense with trackside signalling. However, the train detection and the train integrity supervision still remain {{in place at the}} trackside. Train movements are monitored continually by the radio block centre using this trackside-derived information. The <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> is transmitted to the vehicle continuously via GSM-R together with speed information and route data. The Eurobalises are used at this level as passive positioning beacons or [...] "electronic milestones". Between two positioning beacons, the train determines its position via sensors (axle transducers, accelerometer and radar). The positioning beacons are used in this case as reference points for correcting distance measurement errors. The on-board computer continuously monitors the transferred data and the maximum permissible speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{a moving}} block system {{as shown in the}} second figure, the train {{position}} and its braking curve is continuously calculated by the trains, and then communicated via radio to the wayside equipment.

50|$|Onboard ETCS system. This {{subsystem}} is {{in charge}} of the continuous control of the train speed according to the safety profile, and applying the brake if it is necessary. It is also in charge of the communication with the wayside ATP subsystem in order to exchange the information needed for a safe operation (sending speed and braking distance, and receiving the limit of <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> for a safe operation).|$|E
50|$|Most {{forms of}} train control involve <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> being passed from those {{responsible}} for each section of a rail network (e.g., a signalman or stationmaster) to the train crew. The set of rules and the physical equipment used to accomplish this determine {{what is known as}} the method of working (UK), method of operation (US) or safeworking (Aus.). Not all these methods require the use of physical signals, and some systems are specific to single track railways.|$|E
50|$|Level 1 is a cab {{signalling}} {{system that can}} be superimposed on the existing {{signalling system}}, leaving the fixed signalling system (national signalling and track-release system) in place. Eurobalise radio beacons pick up signal aspects from the trackside signals via signal adapters and telegram coders (Lineside Electronics Unit - LEU) and transmit them to the vehicle as a <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> together with route data at fixed points. The on-board computer continuously monitors and calculates the maximum speed and the braking curve from these data. Because of the spot transmission of data, the train must travel over the Eurobalise beacon to obtain the next <b>movement</b> <b>authority.</b> In order for a stopped train {{to be able to}} move (when the train is not stopped exactly over a balise), there are optical signals that show permission to proceed. With the installation of additional Eurobalises ("infill balises") or a EuroLoop between the distant signal and main signal, the new proceed aspect is transmitted continuously. The EuroLoop is an extension of the Eurobalise over a particular distance that basically allows data to be transmitted continuously to the vehicle over cables emitting electromagnetic waves. A radio version of the EuroLoop is also possible.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{upcoming}} European Train Control System (ETCS) {{standard level}} 3 allows high-speed trains to follow {{each other at}} close distances. To achieve this, the trains continuously request position dependent <b>Movement</b> <b>Authorities</b> (MAs) via GSM-R based wireless communication from track side Radio Block Centers (RBCs). The grant of an MA is decisive for moving on. We present a Statemate model {{which is used to}} investigate the risk of breaking maneuvers in train platoons that may be caused by an error prone wireless communication infrastructure, namely delays in the communication of MAs. 1 General Description ETCS and GSM-R (Global System for Mobile communications- Railway), an adaptation of GSM wireless protocol, are designed to replace the multitude of incompatible (safety) systems used by European Railways and enable dense, fast transnational railway service. Different ETCS application levels are defined to meet the requirements of particular routes...|$|R

5000|$|SelTrac {{is offered}} in two ways: 1. A {{complete}} integrated solution in which <b>movement</b> <b>authority</b> and interlocking are integrated within wayside zone controllers; this reduces equipment and potential interfacing issues. Integrating {{the management of}} the interlocking with train location information, as communicated through the CBTC system, allows faster response times, more tightly controlled movements, and easier expandability and adaptability. Interfaces within the zone controller are more easily designed than those between subsystems. The integrated system knows the position of each train to a high degree of accuracy. It can control the behavior of the train at all times and, in response to changing conditions, can modify the behavior to ensure safety of the system while offering maximum service.It can adapt its algorithms to take advantage of individual train behavior, and change parameters to ensure optimum use of resources, such as platform availability and traction power. The Limit of <b>Movement</b> <b>Authority</b> setting logic has a high impact on the end system performance, i.e. managing the interlocking in an integrated manner.

25|$|Trains using CBTC locate {{themselves}} {{based on}} measuring their distance past fixed transponders installed between the rails. Trains equipped with CBTC have a transponder interrogator antenna beneath each carriage, which communicates with the fixed trackside transponders and report the trains' location to a wayside Zone Controller via radio. Then, the Controller issues <b>Movement</b> <b>Authorities</b> to the trains. This technology upgrade will allow trains {{to be operated}} at closer distances, slightly increasing capacity; will allow the MTA {{to keep track of}} trains in real time and provide more information to the public regarding train arrivals and delays; and will obviate the need for complex interlocking towers. The trains are also equipped with high-tech computers inside the cab so that the conductor could monitor the train's speed and relative location. The wayside controllers themselves are located in enclosed boxes that can withstand floods and natural disasters. The traditional block systems will remain on these lines despite the installation of CBTC.|$|R
