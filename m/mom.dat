5000|$|... “Mommy Wars," [...] as {{introduced}} by Nina Darnton in a June 1990 Newsweek article, represents the media-staged tensions between stay-at-home <b>moms</b> and working <b>moms.</b> Stay-at-home <b>moms</b> criticize working <b>moms</b> for abandoning {{their children and}} homes to build a personal career, while working <b>moms</b> resent stay-at-home <b>moms</b> both {{because of the time}} and attention they are able to devote to their children, and because of the notion that a mother is only [...] "good enough" [...] if she can devote all her time and attention to the children and household. Susan Podnieks argues that The Mommy Myth, as well as the so-called battle between working <b>moms</b> and stay-at-home <b>moms,</b> are circulated by news media and talk shows, sparking debates about the proper sphere of women. As a result, the general public believes that [...] "there is a bitter war in the suburban cul-de-sacs of the United States between the complacent minivan-driving stay-at-home <b>moms</b> and the overachieving soon-to-be-burnout working mothers who still think they can have it all." [...] This leads to grouping mothers into rigid and rival categories, leading them to feel insecure about their mothering, and in turn leading them to devalue other mothers in order to elevate themselves.|$|R
