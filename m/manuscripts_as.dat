5|$|The {{fourth and}} the last edition of Plain Introduction was {{prepared}} and edited posthumously by Edward Miller (1825–1901). The book was edited by George Bell & Sons. It contains 15 plates with the texts of 40 manuscripts in facsimile (the 1st edition had 12 plates with 36 manuscripts). Some facsimiles were replaced. Instead of 2,094 <b>manuscripts,</b> <b>as</b> recorded in the third edition under six classes, no less than 3,791 were recorded in this edition, an increase of 236 beyond the 3,555 of Gregory, without counting the numerous vacant places which had been filled inp.|$|E
5|$|The passage {{beginning}} at bars 231 ("NUN: Scrutemur vias nostras") presents a rhythmic texture new to Stravinsky, which strongly resembles the multilayered rhythms of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße, which Robert Craft was rehearsing in Stravinsky's home {{at precisely the}} time of composition (16 January to 14 February 1958). Stravinsky attended not only these rehearsals but also the recording sessions for Zeitmaße, following the score with great interest. The published score of Threni is also the first of Stravinsky's works to adopt the notational device of replacing the staves in silent measures with whites space on the page, a feature frequently found in Stravinsky's <b>manuscripts</b> <b>as</b> early as 1916, but only in print from this point onward. This feature {{is also found in}} Stockhausen's score.|$|E

25|$|Alfred is also {{remembered as}} a literate king. He or his court {{commissioned}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was written in Old English (rather than in Latin, which was {{the language of the}} European annals). Alfred's own literary output was mainly of translations, though he wrote introductions and amended <b>manuscripts</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
25|$|He {{sought to}} avoid {{mistakes}} by gathering as many <b>manuscripts</b> <b>as</b> he could for checking the texts. He {{claimed to have}} corrected 5000 mistakes between two editions of Pliny the Elder's Naturalis historia, a work he found very similar to Materia Medica, for which he used at least two editions as well.|$|E

25|$|Protestants and Catholics use the Masoretic Text as {{the textual}} {{basis for their}} {{translations}} of the protocanonical books (those accepted as canonical by both Jews and all Christians), with various changes derived from a multiplicity of other ancient sources (such as the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the Dead Sea Scrolls, etc.), while generally using the Septuagint and Vulgate, now supplemented by the ancient Hebrew and Aramaic <b>manuscripts,</b> <b>as</b> the textual basis for the deuterocanonical books.|$|E

25|$|The Early Christians {{were opposed}} to monumental {{religious}} sculpture, though continuing Roman traditions in portrait busts and sarcophagus reliefs, as well as smaller objects such as the consular diptych. Such objects, often in valuable materials, were also the main sculptural traditions (as far as is known) of the barbaric civilizations of the Migration period, {{as seen in the}} objects found in the 6th-century burial treasure at Sutton Hoo, and the jewellery of Scythian art and the hybrid Christian and animal style productions of Insular art. Following the continuing Byzantine tradition, Carolingian art revived ivory carving, often in panels for the treasure bindings of grand illuminated <b>manuscripts,</b> <b>as</b> well as crozier heads and other small fittings.|$|E
25|$|The Founders' Library was {{the main}} library until the new library opened in 1966. After this time the library housed the University's oldest printed books (1470–1850) and manuscripts (the {{earliest}} being from the thirteenth century), given to Lampeter from 1822 onwards, {{as well as the}} archives of the university. It is a priceless collection unique to Lampeter. Named after its foundersThomas Burgess (1756–1837), Thomas Bowdler (1754–1825), and Thomas Phillips (1760–1851)it served as a resource for research and teaching, particularly in English, History and Mediaeval Studies. In 2005, it was announced that a new £700,000 library building was to be built on campus to house the university's <b>manuscripts,</b> <b>as</b> the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{regional}} styles developed {{based on}} the chance availability of Carolingian <b>manuscripts</b> <b>as</b> models to copy, {{and the availability of}} itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of St. Vaast (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges, as well as at Albi, Figeac, and Saint-Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris a unique style developed at the abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. In Normandy a new style arose in 975. By the later tenth century with the Cluny reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.|$|E
