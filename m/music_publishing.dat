5|$|In December 1995, Michael Jackson {{agreed to}} merge ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> with Sony <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing,</b> a {{division}} of Sony Corporation, to form Sony/ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing.</b> In 2012 an investor consortium led by Sony/ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> acquired EMI <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> for approximately $2.2billion. Sony/ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> and EMI <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> now operate as one company, with the former entity administering the catalogue of the latter under a complex business structure. Following the acquisition, the company became the largest music publisher in the world, with a library of over three million songs under its administration. On March 14, 2016, Sony announced that it had reached a deal to acquire the Jackson estate's stake in the company. The deal was completed on September 30, 2016.|$|E

5|$|Sony/ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> LLC is an American <b>music</b> <b>publishing</b> company {{owned by}} Sony through Sony Entertainment. The company was founded as a {{division}} of Associated Television (ATV) in 1955 by Lew Grade. In 1985, Michael Jackson acquired ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> for $47.5million. Paul McCartney, who had told Jackson {{about the importance of}} owning publishing, admitted he felt somewhat undercut by the purchase, because ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> owned the publishing rights to most of The Beatles' songs, although he did not enter the bidding when it came up for sale in 1984.|$|E

5|$|ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing</b> {{remained}} a successful {{organization in the}} music industry throughout the 1970s. Len Beadle, the company's chief executive, signed up many songwriters and bought numerous song catalogues. The catalog acquisitions, along with the continuing royalties from Lennon and McCartney, ensured that large amounts of money were frequently coming in for ATV <b>Music</b> <b>Publishing.</b> Despite the success of the <b>music</b> <b>publishing</b> organization, other ventures formed by Grade were not performing as well. Pye Records, which continued to distribute music from artists such as Carl Douglas and Barry White, was failing to bring in large amounts of money. The main television arm of ATV lost its government-granted license in its then-current form and was restructured into Central Independent Television.|$|E
