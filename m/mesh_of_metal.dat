500|$|The {{head and}} arm {{had been built}} with {{assistance}} from Viollet-le-Duc, who fell ill in 1879. He soon died, leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier. The following year, Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel and his structural engineer, Maurice Koechlin, decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower. Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure, which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking. A secondary skeleton {{was attached to the}} center pylon, then, to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days, he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> straps, known as [...] "saddles", that were riveted to the skin, providing firm support. In a labor-intensive process, each saddle had to be crafted individually. To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure, Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac.|$|E

50|$|Wire mesh glass (also {{known as}} Georgian Wired Glass) has a grid or <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>metal</b> wire {{embedded}} within the glass. Wired glass, {{as it is}} typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it. The presence <b>of</b> the wire <b>mesh</b> {{appears to be a}} strengthening component, as it is metallic, and conjures up the idea of rebar in reinforced concrete or other such examples. Despite this belief, wired glass is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the glass. Wired glass often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired glass, as the wire amplifies the irregularity of any fractures.This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools.|$|R
50|$|A window screen (also {{known as}} insect screen, bug screen, fly screen, wire mesh) is {{designed}} to cover {{the opening of a}} window. It is usually a <b>mesh</b> made <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> wire, fiberglass, or other synthetic fiber and stretched in a frame <b>of</b> wood or <b>metal.</b> It serves to keep leaves, debris, insects, birds, and other animals from entering a building or a screened structure such as a porch, without blocking fresh air-flow. Most houses in Australia, the United States and Canada {{and other parts of the}} world have screens on the window to prevent entry of flying insects such as mosquitoes, flies and wasps. In some regions such as the northern United States and Canada, screens were required to be replaced by glass storm windows in the winter, but now combination storm and screen windows are available, which allow glass and screen panels to slide up and down.|$|R

Thorium dioxide was commonly a major component; being radioactive it has led to concerns about the safety of those involved in manufacturing mantles.

5000|$|Barbed tape or {{razor wire}} is a <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> strips with sharp edges whose {{purpose is to}} prevent passage by humans. The term [...] "razor wire", through long usage, has {{generally}} been used to describe barbed tape products. While razor wire is much sharper than the standard barbed wire, it is named after its appearance, but is not actually razor sharp. However, the points are very sharp and made to rip and grab onto clothing and flesh.|$|E
50|$|They {{all have}} masts or towers to install antenna systems. In {{most cases the}} mast is a passive {{structure}} to support the antennas. But in low frequency stations (such as AM radio) the mast itself may be the active antenna element. In such cases, the mast is isolated from the ground.(See Monopole antenna). If the mast itself is an active antenna element the ground can be covered by a <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> wires or <b>metal</b> elements to create a reflecting ground. Most of the stations also have facility to receive microwave signals from a microwave link or a telecommunications satellite, (TVRO or RRO).|$|R

50|$|A {{steel cage}} match is a match fought within a cage formed by placing sheets <b>of</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>metal</b> around, in, {{or against the}} edges of the wrestling ring. The most common way of winning is by simply {{escaping}} the cage, either {{over the top of the}} cage wall and having both feet touch the arena floor, or by escaping through the cage door with both feet touching the arena floor. The other occasional ways to win a steel cage match are by pinfall, by submission, though these are less common stipulations in the modern era.|$|R
50|$|A {{perimeter}} fence is {{a structure that}} circles the perimeter of an area to prevent access. These fences are frequently made out of single vertical metal bars connected {{at the top and}} bottom with a horizontal bar. They often have spikes or Barbed wire on the top to prevent climbing. Residential {{perimeter fence}}s are normally made of wood about six inches thick, or a solid wall. Some fences may be string-like pieces of metal stretching across horizontally and vertically, creating a <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E

In the Victorian era the term [...] "mail" [...] was used fancifully for any form of metallic body armour.

50|$|Anping County {{is located}} in the middle of Hebei Province, it is about 100 km away from Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Anping is known for its metal wire mesh in China and around the world. Over five hundred years ago, Anping people began to weave wire mesh products.

50|$|The {{coat of arms}} of De Rijp show two {{herrings}} which {{symbolize the}} importance of the fishing industry for the town. The polders meant that the Rijper ships needed to travel much further before they were on open water. The herring industry remained important however and the stained glass window in the Grote Kerk with the city coat of arms of Enkhuizen, donated by the cooper's guild, shows the barrels that were made for use by the herring packers in De Rijp in 1655. The town had suffered a devastating fire in 1654 which wiped out the southern side of the town and destroyed the church, leaving only the north side (including the city hall) intact. Fortunately the herring ships had been undamaged and it was their industry that enabled the town to rebuild the church. When it was completed in 1655, various guilds such as the coopers, and other towns of North Holland donated stained glass windows with their coats of arms in 1655. These included Medemblik, Alkmaar, Haarlem, Amsterdam, Monnickendam, Edam, Enkhuizen, and Purmerend. This group of stained-glass windows are considered national treasures and were restored in 1993-1995 when safety glass with a fine <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> was installed {{on the outside of the}} window frames but left open at the edges to prevent condensation. Similar safety measures have been taken for the stained-glass windows of Gouda.|$|E

500|$|Four championships {{exclusive}} to the Raw brand were contested for; none was lost as all four [...] championships were retained. The main event was a standard wrestling match, in which WWE Champion John Cena defeated challenger Umaga to retain his championship. Two predominant bouts were {{featured on the}} undercard. The first was a Tag team match, in which World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) fought D-Generation X (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) to a no-contest. Due to WWE rules, a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission, as a result, Rated-RKO retained their titles. Another main match was a steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets <b>of</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>metal</b> around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring.

In SmackDown's main match, The Undertaker defeated Edge by countout, but did not win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship because in WWE, a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification. While in ECW's prime match, WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz defeated ECW Champion Kane and CM Punk to retain the titles.

Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|R

40|$|Many {{problems}} can be solved more efficiently on a <b>mesh</b> <b>of</b> trees network than on a mesh.
