In particular, the economics approach represents an attempt to tailor the concept of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> to market-oriented WTO trade regime. The economics approach has been fundamentally troubled {{by the lack of}} concord among WTO member countries on the question of what constitutes <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Upon examining how differently the notion of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> is perceived across the US, the EU, the Cairns group, the LDCs, and the developed food-importing countries (the G 10), this article theorizes that <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> connotes different contents in different countries/regions that are determined by their particular agricultural problems, which are in turn shaped by the cultural, ecological and economic characteristics unique to each country. The theorizing undertakes to overcome the Euro-centrism that has dictated the discourse of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA).

40|$|<b>Multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> {{is a broad}} concept {{lacking a}} precise and uniform definition. Moreover, {{little is known about}} the {{societal}} importance of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture.</b> This paper is an empirical attempt to fill this gap. To this end, an input-output model is constructed for <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> in the Netherlands. The definition used includes four multifunctional agricultural activities: (i) green care, (ii) tourism, recreation and education, (iii) on-farm sales, and (iv) green services. Multiplier values – indicating the chain impacts of these multifunctional activities in the rest of the economy – are calculated for four Dutch regions. The results show that, in terms of output and employment, <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> is not a main driver for economic growth. Moreover, from the input-output model it appears that <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> leads in particular to more expenditures in the agricultural sector itself, rather than in any other economic sector. As such, the indirect feedback effects of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> on the non-agricultural sectors in the Dutch economy are rather small. The input-output model also show that multiplier values differ over the regions, mainly due to differences in the composition of multifunctional activities. And although the absolute size of employment in <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> is very small, the employment per unit of output is high, especially when compared to the employment/production rate in primary agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Two {{scientific}} {{communities with}} broad interest in sustainable agriculture independently focus on <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> or ecosystem services. These communities have limited interaction and exchange, and each group faces research challenges according to independently operating paradigms. This paper presents a comparative review of published research in <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> and ecosystem services. The motivation {{for this work}} is to improve communication, integrate experimental approaches, and propose areas of consensus and dialog for the two communities. This extensive analysis of publication trends, ideologies, and approaches enables formulation of four main conclusions. First, the two communities are closely related through {{their use of the}} term "function. " However, <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> considers functions as agricultural activity outputs and prefers farm-centred approaches, whereas ecosystem services considers ecosystem functions in the provision of services and prefers service-centred approaches. Second, research approaches to common questions in these two communities share some similarities, and there would be great value in integrating these approaches. Third, the two communities have potential for dialog regarding the bundle of ecosystem services and the spectrum of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture,</b> or regarding land sharing and land sparing. Fourth, we propose an integrated conceptual framework that distinguishes six groups of ecosystem services and disservices in the agricultural landscape, and combines the concepts of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> and ecosystem services. This integrated framework improves applications of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> and ecosystem services for operational use.

Descriptive data analysis demonstrates that the US public considers the multifunctionality of agriculture as an important social issue.

However, if our study restricts the analysis to those who supported the multifunctionality concept, we have a dramatically different result: i. e., voters in the agriculturally abundant regions are likely to pay a significantly higher amount of additional taxes to support farmers for their supply of various multifunctional benefits to our society.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the differences between}} the developed countries in their attitude towards <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture,</b> non-trade concerns and appropriate policy response for addressing <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> and non-trade concerns. The basic differences between the developed countries stem from the potential gains and losses countries face when agricultural trade is further liberalised. The proponents of multifunctionality fear that further liberalised trade reduces their ability to address non-trade concerns and <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> effectively, whereas export-oriented countries see multifunctionality as an excuse for retaining agricultural supports which may result in reduced export opportunities for them. There is a broad consensus among the WTO members that non-trade concerns such as food security, environmental issues, viability of rural areas and food safety are legitimate concerns, which have to be considered when agricultural trade is further liberalised. The concept of <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture,</b> which covers many of the agriculture-related non-trade concerns, has raised conflicting views among the WTO members. Moreover, countries disagree on appropriate policy responses for sustaining and enhancing the multifunctional character of agriculture. The green box policies are the single most widely supported measures for addressing non-trade concerns and <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture.</b> For the Cairns Group and the United States the green box policies represent effective and universal means, whereas for countries with higher production costs they may not be sufficient to sustain the multifunctional character of agriculture, especially in marginal areas. Thus, the high-cost countries are stressing the need to expand the green box to contain some production-linked support in order to address their non-trade concerns effectively. vokMTT Taloustutkimu...|$|E

Within <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture,</b> the different functions can be categorized into five colour categories.

40|$|Ideals of productivist {{agriculture}} in the Western world have faded as the unintended consequences of intensive agriculture and pastoralism have contributed to rural decline and environmental problems. In Norway and Australia, {{there has been an}} increasing acceptance of the equal importance of social and environmental sustainability as well as economic sustainability. Alongside this shift is a belief that primary production needs to move away from an intensive, productivist-based agriculture to one that may be defined as post-productivist. In this paper, we argue that the dualism of productivism and post-productivism as concepts on agricultural policy regimes are too simplistic and discuss whether <b>multifunctional</b> <b>agriculture</b> is a better concept for a comparison of rural primary production at two extreme points of the scale, the market-oriented, liberalistic Australian agriculture and the market-protected small-scale Norwegian agriculture.
