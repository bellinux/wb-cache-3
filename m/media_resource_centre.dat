40|$|The formal {{training}} and education of trainee clinical photographers started in Cardiff in 1969.

Prior to 1990 the trainee intake undertook the British Institute of Professional Photographers (BIPP) Qualifying Examination in Medical Photography, and between 1990 and 2001 they undertook this together with the Master of Science (MSc) in Medical Illustration. In preparation for state registration the Postgraduate Certificate (PGC) in Medical Illustration was developed with content that was appropriate to new entrants into the profession, and trainees were registered for this rather than the MSc in Medical Illustration. Since 2003 the on-job training scheme has been developed to follow a more formal structure closely integrated with the PGC.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this study}} is that Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> of the Eastern Cape ought to provide access to high quality, relevant and appropriate information that is evidence-based and responsive to the needs of health professionals thereby assisting health professionals accomplish their tasks. In order to provide access to quality information, the Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> are expected to provide information services within an acceptable framework of service standards. This study seeks to explore the implementation of standards in the Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> of the Eastern Cape. The study was carried out in two phases namely a literature review and a survey. The study used the quantitative method of collecting data by means of a cross-sectional survey. A self administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was piloted in the Queenstown Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre,</b> after which appropriate changes were made before the commencement of data collection. The study was conducted in the three other Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> of the Eastern Cape, namely Umtata Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre,</b> East London Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> and Port Elizabeth Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre.</b> Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> managers completed the questionnaires. The overall findings of this study show that the three Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> uphold service standards. The results show that the Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> were compliant with the service standards relating to both services and management areas. The Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> were more compliant with standards relating to service areas than they were to standards relating to management areas. The results of the study furthermore demonstrate that the Umtata Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> was most compliant regarding service areas (86, 20 %) compared to the East London Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> (82, 75 %) and the Port Elizabeth Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> (72, 41 %). In regard to management areas, the results show that the Umtata Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre</b> and East London Health Resource were more compliant than the Port Elizabeth Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre.</b> However certain aspects of their service such as availability of space, health and safety, staff performance and development, quality leadership and design and financial management need further attention. The study suggests that further research is required to objectively verify implementation of standards, to solicit health professionals’ opinions and experiences about the services provided by these Health <b>Resource</b> <b>Centres</b> and to find out if there is any connection between the quality of services provided and the quality of patient care...|$|R

50|$|In 1987, Naveen Kishore {{founded the}} Seagull Foundation for the Arts {{which was to}} {{function}} as a not for profit charitable trust. Under that trust, various activities are carried out, one of which has been the Seagull Arts and <b>Media</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre.</b> The Resource Centre possesses a vast Arts library where for a nominal sum, one can become a member. Along with the Arts library, there are film and music libraries. Various activities related to performance in the arts are organized and carried out by the Resource Centre; ranging from dance recitals, play readings, photography exhibitions, book reviews to theater workshops. His background in showcasing in the arts helped Naveen Kishore channelise his energy into the Resource Centre. The selling and showcasing of art acts as fundraisers for the revenue earned on the books is not always enough since most of the books published by Seagull are slow sellers and selling the art helps the company to raise money for its non profit enterprises {{as well as some of}} the profit activities.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of computer, network, multimedia technology, digital <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> with many types and huge amount are increasing dramatically, so {{this results in a}} more serious requirement on digital <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> management. Digital <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> management system based on SOA is put forward in this paper {{in the light of the}} problems of existing <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> management system. SOA, architecture of new generation, is one of the most ideal solutions to integrate application systems. The system solved the problem of heterogeneity fundamentally, and maximum integration and sharing of resources in management system can be achieved. Study achieved an integrated digital <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> management system and the problem of resource sharing was solved so as to adapt to the digital <b>media</b> <b>resource</b> management in big data era...|$|R

40|$|The {{central area}} of {{research}} for this thesis concerns the most effective techniques for practitioners developing and delivering facilitated participatory media projects for the internet within an institutional setting. Through the development and delivery of a web-based, participatory documentary Big Stories, Small Towns, this study explored the complexity of relationships that underlie media participation within public screen institutions such as national broadcasters and screen culture agencies. This involves key principles of trust, power, motivation, access and agency to assist practitioners in managing participatory processes in media practice. This study was comprised of two parts – a creative component (The Project) and a written exegesis. Fifty per cent of the submission for my PhD is comprised of the writing, direction, production and facilitation of Big Stories, Small Towns, which is a web-based participatory documentary, produced in partnership with two public screen institutions, Screen Australia and the <b>Media</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Centre.</b> The project’s main public presentation can be viewed online at www. bigstories. com. au. An archived version of the first site can be viewed at v 1. bigstories. com. au. My accompanying exegesis examines a tradition of documentary production underpinned by participatory practices. The exegesis examines methodologies informed by theories of critical practice to discuss the Big Stories project {{in the context of}} the wider literature drawn from media studies, communication for development, visual anthropology and cultural studies. The study explores participatory media activity and identifies examples that have influenced the Big Stories project. The outcomes of the study are substantial and diverse original contributions to research and practice including an original contribution to both web documentary and participatory media practice, re-imagining community-based documentary and oral history practice in a digital, collaborative environment, actively exploring mechanisms for addressing a multi-level digital divide for regional communities, delivering an original project drawing on partnerships with government, non- government and the private sector to create an innovative output, identified by peers as a form of best practice for web documentary, and bringing communication for development ideals to Australian public screen institutions and creating a large archive of this material...|$|E
40|$|The poor {{performance}} of Junior Secondary {{school students in}} Social Studies {{has been a source}} of concern for government and other stakeholders in education in Nigeria. This is occasioned partly by lack of relevant <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> needed for teaching and learning in Social Studies. This is why this study intended to investigate the extent of availability of school library <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> in the school library media centre and how that has contributed to students’ achievement in Social Studies in JSS in Ondo State. A questionnaire titled “School Library <b>Media</b> <b>Resources</b> Questionnaire” was used to gather information on availability of school library <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> and students’ achievement in Social Studies. A descriptive survey method was employed to analyse the results. The findings indicate that availability of school library <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> was above grand mean of 2. 50 taken together for students, teachers and media specialists respectively (availability = 2. 64) while there was a correlation between students <b>media</b> <b>resources</b> availability and students’ achievement in Social Studies (r=. 87 *,df= 1259, p 3 ̆c. 01).
