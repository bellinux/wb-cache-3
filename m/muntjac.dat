5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian <b>muntjac</b> and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, <b>muntjac,</b> wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
5|$|Herds {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. <b>Muntjac</b> deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E
50|$|Hairy-fronted <b>muntjacs</b> are {{extremely}} difficult to study because of their shyness. Camera-trap photographs have revealed the presence of hairy-fronted <b>muntjacs</b> where they were believed not to have existed for decades, for example in the Wuyanling National Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|<b>Muntjacs,</b> {{also known}} as barking deer and Mastreani deer, are small deer of the genus Muntiacus. <b>Muntjacs</b> are the oldest known deer, thought to have begun {{appearing}} 15-35 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany and Poland.|$|R
50|$|<b>Muntjacs</b> exhibit both diurnality and nocturnality.|$|R
5|$|Wild {{animals that}} are found in Karnataka include the elephant, the tiger, the leopard, the gaur, the sambar deer, the chital or spotted deer, the <b>muntjac,</b> the bonnet macaque, the slender loris, the common palm civet, the small Indian civet, the sloth bear, the dhole, the striped hyena and the golden jackal. Some of the birds found here are the great hornbill, the Malabar pied hornbill, the Ceylon frogmouth, herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons, quails, partridges, lapwings, sandpipers, pigeons, doves, parakeets, cuckoos, owls, nightjars, swifts, kingfishers, bee-eaters and munias. Some species of trees found in Karnataka are Callophyllum tomentosa, Callophyllum wightianum, Garcina cambogia, Garcina morealla, Alstonia scholaris, , Artocarpus hirsutus, Artocarpus lacoocha, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Grewia tilaefolia, Santalum album, Shorea talura, Emblica officinalis, Vitex altissima and Wrightia tinctoria. Wildlife in Karnataka is {{threatened}} by poaching, habitat destruction, human-wildlife conflict and pollution.|$|E
25|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} variability between {{closely related species}} is the <b>muntjac,</b> which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and his colleague Doris Wurster. The diploid number of the Chinese <b>muntjac,</b> Muntiacus reevesi, {{was found to be}} 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian <b>muntjac,</b> Muntiacus muntjak, they were astonished to find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than during}} the rut (mating season) {{and for the first}} six months after giving birth, the adult Indian <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus <b>muntjac)</b> is a solitary animal. Adult males in {{particular}} are well spaced and marking grass and bushes with secretions from their preorbital glands appears to be involved in the acquisition and maintenance of territory.|$|E
50|$|The Indian <b>muntjacs</b> are {{classified}} as omnivores. They are considered both browsers and grazers with a diet consisting of grasses, ivy, prickly bushes, low growing leaves, bark, twigs, herbs, fruit, sprouts, seeds, tender shoots, bird eggs and small warm-blooded animals. Indian <b>muntjacs</b> are typically found feeding {{at the edge of}} the forest or in abandoned clearings. The <b>muntjac’s</b> found in the Nilgiri-Wayand area of south India are always sited in the large tea estates, as they feed mostly the tea seeds. Their large canine teeth help in the processes of retrieving and ingesting food.|$|R
50|$|Wrens, <b>muntjacs,</b> {{hedgehogs}} and weasels {{are present}} and visible all year round.|$|R
25|$|In the {{rhinoceros}} exhibit, Indian rhinoceroses, <b>muntjacs,</b> and oriental small-clawed otters {{share the}} outdoor area. Since then, the three species lived together with no incidents. The 2.5-ton-rhinoceroses share their food with the 30-kilogram <b>muntjacs</b> or go {{into one of}} three ponds where the Asian otters are swimming around the rhinos. The rhino exhibit originally opened in 1959, was extensively renovated, and re-opened in May 2008.|$|R
25|$|Birds include {{green and}} great spotted woodpeckers, {{treecreeper}} and goldcrest and kestrel. <b>Muntjac</b> deer are frequent visitors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the former}} {{range of the}} South China tiger {{possible}} tiger prey species include <b>muntjac,</b> wild pig, serow, tufted deer and sambar.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} {{populations of}} large herbivores include 30 gaur in 1984, and 58 sambar in 1999. Smaller herbivores include 100 Indian <b>muntjac</b> in 1972, 431 wild boar in 1999, 5,045 hog deer in 1999 and barking deer.|$|E
50|$|Paleontological {{evidence}} {{proves that}} Indian <b>muntjacs</b> {{have been around}} since the late Pleistocene epoch at least 12,000 years ago.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] Tufted deer, {{along with}} other <b>muntjacs</b> and the water deer, are the only living cervids with tusks ...|$|R
5000|$|Medium {{and small}} mammals include African hedgehogs, {{domestic}} rabbits, guinea pigs, ferret, prairie dogs, Sicilian donkeys, African pygmy goats, chinchillas, and <b>muntjacs</b> ...|$|R
25|$|During this phase, {{data on the}} karyotypes of {{hundreds}} of mammalian species (including information on diploid numbers, relative length and morphology of chromosomes, presence of B chromosomes) were described. Diploid numbers (2n) were found to vary from 2n = 6–7 in the Indian <b>muntjac</b> to over 100 in some rodents.|$|E
25|$|Tigers are obligate carnivores. They prefer hunting large ungulates, {{frequently}} kill wild pig, {{and occasionally}} hog deer, <b>muntjac</b> and gray langur. Small prey {{species such as}} porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Due to the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|E
25|$|The banded pig (Sus scrofa vittatus), {{also known}} as the Andaman wild boar and once thought to be an endemic subspecies, is {{protected}} by the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 (Sch I). The spotted deer (Axis axis), the Indian <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus muntjak) and the sambar (Rusa unicolor) were all introduced to the Andaman islands, though the sambar did not survive.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the renovated}} and {{expanded}} Indian rhinoceros house opened {{and two years}} later the new rhino outdoor exhibit opened, which also included <b>muntjacs,</b> and Oriental small-clawed otters.|$|R
50|$|The {{valley and}} hills {{surrounding}} it {{are rich in}} wild life. The fauna recorded are the <b>muntjacs</b> (barking deer), wild boars, sambar, Himalayan black bear, Himalayan serow, leopards and foxes.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{birds of}} the reserve include Elliot's pheasant. Mammals include clouded leopard, Asian black bear, Sumatran serow, and sika deer. The reserve hosts a {{population}} of hairy-fronted <b>muntjacs</b> estimated at 300-400 individuals.|$|R
25|$|Predominant {{tree species}} are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A {{wide range of}} animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), <b>muntjac</b> (Muntiacus reevesi) and European adder (Vipera berus).|$|E
25|$|Rodents make up 40% of the mammal species. These include squirrels, mice, voles, {{rats and}} the {{recently}} reintroduced European beaver. There {{is also an}} abundance of rabbits, hares, hedgehogs, shrews, moles and several species of bat. Carnivorous mammals include the fox, badger, otter, weasel, stoat and elusive wildcat. Various species of seal, whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and coastlines. The largest land-based wild animals today are deer. The red deer is the largest species, with roe deer and fallow deer also prominent; the latter was introduced by the Normans. Sika deer and two more species of smaller deer, <b>muntjac</b> and Chinese water deer, have been introduced, <b>muntjac</b> becoming widespread in England and parts of Wales while Chinese water deer are restricted mainly to East Anglia. Habitat loss has affected many species. Extinct large mammals include the brown bear, grey wolf and wild boar; the latter has had a limited reintroduction in recent times.|$|E
25|$|This {{tropical}} rain forest has {{a wide variety of}} wildlife, and some endangered species are found here. Species found in the sanctuary include tiger, bonnet and lion-tailed macaques, Nilgiri langur, gaur (or Indian bison), sambar deer, <b>muntjac</b> (or barking deer), Indian spotted chevrotain (or mouse deer), wild boar, Indian elephant and different species of squirrels, such as the Indian giant and Indian palm squirrels.|$|E
50|$|The {{foothills of}} the Shiwalik Range are forested. Some areas are protected. There are areas of public (village council) and private ownership. Local fauna include sambar, <b>muntjacs</b> (barking deer), woodpeckers, peacocks, parrots and forest pigs.|$|R
50|$|Khao Yai {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of animals. It {{is one of the few}} places in Thailand where wild {{elephants}} still survive. They are regularly seen and are a major tourist attraction. Other larger animals include gibbons, pig-tailed macaques, <b>muntjacs</b> and sambar deer.|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>muntjacs</b> are {{polygamous}} animals. Females {{sexually mature}} {{during their first}} to second year of life. These females are polyestrous, with each cycle lasting about 14 to 21 days and an estrus lasting for 2 days. The gestation period is six to seven months and they usually bear one offspring at a time but sometimes produce twins. Females usually give birth in dense growth {{so that they are}} hidden {{from the rest of the}} herd and predators. The young leaves its mother after about six months to establish its own territory. Males often fight between one another for possession of a harem of females. Indian <b>muntjacs</b> are distinguished from other even-toed ungulates in showing no evidence of a specific breeding season within the species.|$|R
25|$|At Antelope House {{the species}} present are the addax, babirusa, Banteng, Bactrian camel, gerenuk, Grevy's zebra, Indian <b>muntjac,</b> lesser kudu, {{mountain}} bongo, okapi, reticulated giraffe, Somali wild ass, Speke's gazelle, Sichuan takin, Soemmerring's gazelle, Transcapsian urial, and Visayan warty pig. Non-ungulates {{found in the}} Red Rocks include the marsupials red kangaroo and tammar wallaby, {{as well as several}} birds in mixed-exhibits with the ungulates, such as the ostrich, Stanley crane, and grey crowned crane.|$|E
25|$|Nameri National Park - Nameri National Park is in {{the foothills}} of the Eastern Himalayas in the Sonitpur District of Assam. This is {{excellent}} elephant country and was considered to be an elephant reserve. It is an ideal habitat for a host of other animals including the tiger, leopard, sambar, dhole (the Asiatic wild dog), pygmy hog, <b>muntjac,</b> gaur, wild boar, sloth bear, Himalayan black bear, capped langur and Indian giant squirrel.|$|E
25|$|Tigers are carnivores. They prefer hunting large {{ungulates}} such as chital, sambar, gaur, and to {{a lesser}} extent also barasingha, water buffalo, nilgai, serow and takin. Among the medium-sized prey species they frequently kill wild boar, and occasionally hog deer, <b>muntjac</b> and grey langur. Small prey species such as porcupines, hares and peafowl form a very small part in their diet. Because of the encroachment of humans into their habitat, they also prey on domestic livestock.|$|E
