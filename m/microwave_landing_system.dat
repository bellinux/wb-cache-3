25|$|After {{retiring}} from the Air Force, Townsend joined the Boeing Company {{as the head of}} the Supersonic Transport (SST) operations organization. After the SST program was cancelled in 1971, he supported a number of other Boeing efforts including the E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post, the YC-14, the <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System,</b> and the B-2 Spirit. Townsend retired from Boeing in 1986.|$|E
25|$|For {{some time}} the FAA and NASA {{developed}} a much improved system, the <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> (MLS). The entire MLS {{system for a}} particular approach was isolated {{in one or two}} boxes located beside the runway, dramatically reducing the cost of implementation. MLS also offered a number of practical advantages that eased traffic considerations, both for aircraft and radio channels. Unfortunately, MLS would also require every airport and aircraft to upgrade their equipment.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Paul Wild invented Interscan, a {{standard}} <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system.</b> From 1978 to 1985 {{he was chairman}} of the CSIRO, during which time he expanded the organisation's scope and directed its restructuring. He retired from the CSIRO to lead (from 1986) the Very Fast Train Joint Venture, a private sector project that sought to build a high-speed railway between Australia's two most populous cities. Lack of support from government brought it to an end in 1991. In his later years he worked on gravitational theory.|$|E

50|$|East-West {{acquired}} several Douglas DC-3s {{starting in}} 1953 and these 28-seat aircraft steadily replaced the smaller Avro Ansons in operating scheduled services throughout New South Wales. The last example was disposed in 1973 having latterly been operated on research flights into <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> for CSIRO.|$|R
25|$|In {{looking for}} applied {{research}} opportunities, Wild {{discovered that the}} Australian Department of Civil Aviation had been considering a call by the International Civil Aviation Organization for member states to propose a new system to replace the longstanding Instrument Landing System. He very quickly formed {{the concept of a}} <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> and applied his energies to the project with great enthusiasm. The concept was simple: a radar fan beam scans back and forth horizontally while another scans up and down, giving the aircraft's position within a few inches.|$|E
25|$|NASA and the FAA {{also had}} a major {{presence}} at the show, demonstrating their efforts to lower the noise and pollution of air travel. One major program {{at that time was}} the <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system,</b> which would allow aircraft to approach from much wider angles and avoid stacking them up over a single approach vector, spreading out the noise. They also demonstrated new engine technologies and stated that the widely used JT8D fleet would be free of smoke by 1972. A combination of these technologies, along with supercritical wings, composites and artificially stable control systems would improve fuel economy of future airliners by 60%.|$|E
2500|$|Kristiansand {{was one of}} six test {{airports}} {{which received}} a British doppler <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>system</b> in 1977. [...] In the late 1970s the terminal was too small, resulting in the airport opening a new [...] terminal on 22 March 1979, costing NOK19 million. The terminal from the war had been used for domestic services and was converted to cargo terminal. The international terminal was converted to a terminal for the Air Force. Kjevik served 400,549 passengers in 1980, increasing to 477,549 five years later.|$|E
50|$|Following his {{retirement}} {{from his position}} in the FAA, Shaffer {{was involved in the}} ongoing debate over both the inclusion of <b>Microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> in civil aviation during 1978 and to whom the contract for construction of such devices should be awarded, American, British or German companies. Shaffer himself agreed with British assessments that the American manufactured MLS system was inferior and poorly tested.|$|R

2500|$|Starting in 1984, the Government of Canada {{committed}} {{to spend a}} further $20 million on improvements to the airport. A new air traffic control tower was constructed {{at a cost of}} $3 million. The original 1939 tower was no longer tall enough to see over buildings to see approaches to the runways. The new tower was built to a height of [...] and intended to last for 30 years of use. Other parts of the plan included an upgraded passenger terminal, two <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems,</b> expansion of the airport apron, and utilities improvements.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} ability of present day aircraft equipped with automatic flight control systems to fly advanced <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLS) approaches. The tactical approach used to achieve this objective included reviewing the design and autoland operation of the MD- 80 aircraft, simulating the MLS approaches using a batch computer program, and assessing the performance of the autoland system from computer generated data.

40|$|Crew {{procedures}} and workload for <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLS) {{that could be}} retrofitted into existing transport aircraft were evaluated. Two MLS receiver concepts were developed. One is capable of capturing a runway centerline {{and the other is}} capable of capturing a segmented approach path. Crew procedures were identified and crew task analyses were performed using each concept. Crew workload comparisons were made between the MLS concepts and an ILS baseline using a task-timeline workload model. Workload indexes were obtained for each scenario. The results showed that workload was comparable to the ILS baseline for the MLS centerline capture concept, but significantly higher for the segmented path capture concept...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (MLS) allows curved approaches. The <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (MLS) {{introduced}} in the 1970s was intended to replace ILS but fell out of favour in the United States because of satellite based systems. In the 1980s, {{there was a major}} US and European effort to establish MLS. But a combination of airline reluctance to invest and the rise of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) resulted in its not being adopted in civil aviation. MLS is showing a resurgence in the United Kingdom for civil aviation. ILS and MLS are the only standardized systems in Civil Aviation that meet requirements for Category III automated landings. The first Category III MLS for civil aviation was commissioned at Heathrow airport in March 2009.|$|E
50|$|Autoland may be {{used for}} any {{suitably}} approved Instrument Landing System (ILS) or <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>System</b> (MLS) approach, and is sometimes used to maintain currency of the aircraft and crew, as well as for its main purpose of assisting an aircraft landing in low visibility and/or bad weather.|$|E

40|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile analytical approach is outlined for performing the site evaluation of Instrument <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (ILS) and <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLS) {{without resorting to}} the current experimental methods. The problem is treated as one of scattering, using a ray-theoretic approach. A multiwedge model of the terrain ahead of the antenna assembly is generated from standard survey data and an exact ray tracing procedure is evolved to trace all the rays between the antenna elements and approaching aircraft. The power of the current uniform diffraction theory (UTD) to evaluate scattered fields from wedges is extended to include the impedance and roughness of the wedge and the theory {{is applied to the}} multiwedge terrain model for evaluating the field. The results are reduced to a form compatible with ICAO-specified tests and compared with experimental data from real airports...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} regarding the pilot's role in manned space flight {{takes into account}} space missions conducted with the Mercury capsule, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the Shuttle. It is concluded that advancements in digital systems and automation technology have made many of the space pilot's tasks easier. However, these advancements have also made the space pilot's training more complicated. He must {{be familiar with the}} interrelated failure effects in highly complex vehicle systems. The nominal performance of the Shuttle fly-by-wire entry control system depends, for instance, on nominal electrical power from three fuel cells, nominal performance of three hydraulic auxiliary power units, five computers, other equipment, and <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems.</b> The pilot must monitor and manage failures in these systems, and, in addition, must be prepared to intervene if an abort situation creates off-nominal conditions...|$|R

50|$|In Australia, {{design work}} {{commenced}} on {{a version of}} MLS in 1972. Most of this work was done jointly by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), and the Radio Physics Division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The project was called Interscan, one of several <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> under consideration internationally. Interscan was chosen by the FAA in 1975 and by ICAO in 1978 as the format to be adopted. An engineered version of the system, called MITAN, was developed by industry (Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited and Hawker de Havilland) under a contract with DCA's successor, the Department of Transport, and successfully demonstrated at Melbourne Airport (Tullamarine) in the late 1970s. The white antenna dishes could still be seen at Tullamarine until 2003 when they were dismantled.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the navigation and guidance system {{developed for the}} TCV B- 737, a Langley Field NASA research aircraft, and {{presents the results of}} an evaluation during final approach, landing, rollout and turnoff obtained through a nonlinear digital simulation.

The <b>Microwave</b> <b>Landing</b> <b>Systems</b> (MLS) is used for all phases of the flight for navigation and guidance. In addition, for rollout and turnoff, a three coil sensor which detects the magnetic field induced by a buried wire in the runway (magnetic leader cable) is used. The outputs of the sensor are processed into measurements of position and heading deviation from the wire. The results show the concept to be both feasible and practical for commercial type aircraft terminal area control...|$|R
40|$|Current {{approved}} terminal instrument procedures (TERPS) do {{not permit}} the full exploitation of the helicopter's unique flying characteristics.

Precision navigation <b>systems</b> such as <b>microwave</b> <b>landing</b> <b>systems</b> (MLS) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) open the possibility of curved paths, steep glide slopes, and decelerating helicopter approaches. This study evaluated the feasibility, benefits, and liabilities of using helicopter cockpit simulators in place of flight testing to develop enhanced TERPS criteria for non-standard flight profiles and navigation equipment. Near-term (2 to 5 year) requirements for conducting simulator studies to verify that they produce suitable data comparable to that obtained from previous flight tests are discussed. The long-term (5 to 10 year) research and development requirements to provide necessary modeling for continued simulator-based testing to develop enhanced TERPS criteria are also outlined...|$|R
