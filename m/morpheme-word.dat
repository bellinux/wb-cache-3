Because of this tendency, Odia is said to [...] "possess morphology" [...] since almost each used word has an internal compositional structure in terms morphemes. In Odia language, generally, separate words are used to express syntactic relationships which imparts an isolating tendency, while using inflectional morphology could have made the language more synthetic.|$|E

Our model extends the classic phrase-based model by means of (1) word boundary-aware morpheme-level phrase extraction, (2) minimum error-rate training for a morpheme-level translation model using word-level BLEU, and (3) joint scoring with morpheme- and word-level language models. Further improvements are achieved by combining our model with the classic one. The evaluation on English to Finnish using Europarl (714 K sentence pairs; 15. 5 M English words) shows statistically significant improvements over the classic model based on BLEU and human judgments. ...|$|E
