This study investigates whether the sheep uterus can resume its capacity to harbour normal pregnancies after autotransplantation by vascular anastomosis. METHODS From 14 ewes, the uterus, excluding one uterine horn, was isolated along with its oviduct and ovary and preserved ex vivo and then transplanted back with end-to-side anastomosis of the vessels of the graft to the external iliac vessels. After recovery, the ewes underwent surgical examination and serum progesterone measurements to ascertain healing and ovarian activity. Afterwards, five autotransplanted and five control ewes were placed with a ram for <b>mating.</b> Caesarean <b>sections</b> were performed before the estimated term of pregnancy and data on fetal measures were compared. RESULTS Of the 14 ewes, seven survived surgery with ovarian activity intact and grafts showing normal appearance. Mating occurred in four of five transplanted ewes and in five out of five controls, and three transplanted animals and five control animals conceived. In one transplanted ewe, torsion {{of the uterus}} was observed after spontaneous initiation of labour. Foeti from transplanted mothers were comparable in size to those of controls.

50|$|Ruderfer et al. {{analyzed}} the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains {{and concluded that}} matings involving out-crossing occur only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus it appears that, in nature, mating is most often between closely related yeast cells. Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type MATa and MATα come into contact. Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present {{together in the same}} ascus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they can <b>mate</b> (see <b>section</b> “Mating type switching”, above). The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from out-crossing appears to be inconsistent with the idea that production of genetic variation is the primary selective force maintaining mating capability in this organism. However {{this finding is consistent with}} the alternative idea that the primary selective force maintaining mating capability is enhanced recombinational repair of DNA damage during meiosis, since this benefit is realized during each meiosis subsequent to a mating, whether or not out-crossing occurs.|$|R

40|$|This {{chapter on}} Paysandisia archon behavior, ecology, and {{communication}} {{is presented in}} three parts. The first part deals with reproductive behavior and the sex pheromone. In this <b>section,</b> <b>mating</b> behavior is described with a consideration of optimal age and diel periodicity. Early observations have shown that mating can occur {{a few hours after}} adult molting, from noon {{to the beginning of the}} afternoon, according to timing of emergence. The female is described as flying close to perching males and the pair then fly together before mating. The male exhibits a scratching movement with the mid-legs while the female extrudes the abdominal tips. Putative sex pheromone production is discussed in relation to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, electroantennography data, and chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of extracts from females and males. The second part deals with insect-plant interactions. Oviposition behavior is described with respect to timing and the different events leading to host choice. Field observations are reported, showing that the female is attracted by several palm species, and egg-laying behavior after probing the host plant is described. The third part describes the visual system by means of electrophysiological and anatomical analyses, as well as spectral analysis of visual cues. Thus, the possible roles of P. archon eyes and ocelli in specific tasks, such as partner recognition, navigation, and host identification, are discussed. The visual system is generally suitable for diurnal activity, showing good resolving power and excellent color vision, probably tuned to the recognition of conspecifics...|$|R

40|$|This study {{suggests}} {{that the cost of}} providing accommodations for various manned activities in space may be reduced by the extensive use of resources that are commonly found throughout the solar system. Several concepts are proposed for converting these resources into simple products with many uses. Concrete is already being considered as a possible moonbase material. Manufacturing equipment should be as small and simple as possible, which leads to the idea of molding it into miniature modules that can be produced and assembled in large numbers to create any conceivable shape. Automated equipment could build up complex structures by laying down layer after layer in a process resembling stereolithography. These tiny concrete blocks handle compression loads and provide a barrier to harmful radiation. They are joined by a web of tension members that could be made of wire or fiber-reinforced plastic. The finished structure becomes air-tight {{with the addition of a}} flexible liner. Wire can be made from the iron modules found in lunar soil. In addition to its structural role, a relatively simple apparatus can bend and weld it into countless products like chairs and shelving that would otherwise need to be supplied from Earth. Wire woven into a loose blanket could be an effective micrometeoroid shield, tiny wire compression beams could be assembled into larger beams which in turn form larger beams to create very large space-frame structures. A technology developed with lunar materials could be applied to the moons of Mars or the asteroids. To illustrate its usefulness several designs for free-flying habitats are presented. They begin with a minimal self-contained living unit called the Cubicle. It may be multiplied into clusters called Condos. These are shown in a rotating tether configuration that provides a substitute for gravity. The miniature block proposal is compared with an alternate design based on larger triangular components and a tetrahedral geometry. The overall concept may be expanded to envision city-sized self-sufficient environments where humans could confortably live their entire lives. One such proposal is the Hive. It is configured around a unique sunlight collection system that could provide all its energy needs and that could be scaled up to compensate for the reduced solar intensity at greater distances from the sun. Its outer perimeter consists of a cylindrical <b>section</b> <b>mated</b> to two conical end walls that taper inwards toward a small aperture at the center of rotation. Light collected by two huge mirrors of unusual design enters the aperture and is redirected to the inside of the cylinder. The conical end walls are shielded from direct sunlight and are designed to radiate heat into space. They are lined with air ducts that passively recirculate the atmosphere while extracting moisture by condensation. Although there is no immediate demand for spacecraft on this scale, their consideration can influence even the earliest stages of the development process...|$|R
