50|$|In {{the case}} of apples, in which {{research}} is being carried out {{in order to develop}} resistance to diseases such as apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), orchard fireblight (Erwinia amylovora), woolly apple aphid (Eriosoma lanigerum) and collar rot (Phytophthora cactorum), the main sources of resistant material used in breeding programmes such as those being run by East Malling Research Station in England or Hortresearch in New Zealand are <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> resistances derived from crab-apples. The Vf gene for black spot resistance is derived from the ornamental crab-apple species Malus floribunda. Most black spot resistant cultivars developed around the world carry this gene, but there are some selections that carry the Vr (from M. pumila) or Vm (from M. micromalus) gene. <b>Major</b> <b>gene</b> resistances to powdery mildew are derived from M. robusta (Pl1) and M. zumi (Pl2), and the apple cultivar Northern Spy has a long-standing reputation for its <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> resistance to woolly apple aphid. Since early this century this resistance has been used to develop woolly aphid resistant rootstocks such as MM.106 and M.793. Much later it was shown that the cultivar was also very resistant to collar rot and a useful breeding parent for this resistance.|$|E
5000|$|Complex {{segregation}} analysis [...] (CSA) {{is a technique}} within genetic epidemiology {{to determine whether there}} is evidence that a <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> underlies the distribution of a given phenotypic trait.

GY in cross 1 {{was controlled by}} Model E while it was under control of Model E- 1 in other crosses. Additive effects of two <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> were observed in cross 1 while additive effects due to several polygene and negative additive effects related to the <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> were observed in controlling GY {{in the rest of}} the crosses. Transgressive segregates in the segregating populations of all the crosses indicated the presence of favorable and adverse genes in the parents for GY. <b>Major</b> <b>genes</b> heritability was higher than that of the polygene in the segregating populations of all the crosses with highest environmental influence. Additively controlled nature of the trait predicts that selection of desirable recombinants for higher GY may be delayed up to advance generations until favorable genes are accumulated in homozygous condition...|$|R
50|$|The first {{publication}} on an important genetic {{discovery of the}} disease was from Martucciello Giuseppe et al. in 1992. The authors described {{a case of a}} patient with total colonic aganglionosis associated with a 46, XX, del 10 (q11.21 q21.2) karyotype. The <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> of Hirschsprung disease was identified in this chromosomal 10 region, it was the RET proto-oncogene.|$|E
5000|$|CSA {{requires}} phenotypic {{information on}} {{family members in}} a pedigree. A variety of models with different parameters and assumptions {{about the nature of}} the inheritance of the trait are fit to the data. CSA studies may include non-genetic models which assume the trait has no genetic component and is only determined by environmental factors, models which include environmental components as well as multi-gene heritability components, and models which include environment, multi-gene heritability, and a single <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> to best fit the data. [...] CSA software uses a maximum likelihood estimator to assign the best fitting coefficients to each component in all models. Nested models are then tested for their goodness of fit starting at the most complex. If two models are found to fit equally well, the more complex model is rejected in favor of the simpler model. If the best fitting model includes a single <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> component, there is evidence that the trait of interest is under Mendelian control.|$|E

To date, only a few morphological characters have been mapped as <b>major</b> effect <b>genes</b> {{across a range of}} genetic linkage maps based on different types of molecular markers in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.)

40|$|The {{existence}} of <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> affecting fecundity in sheep flocks {{throughout the world}} has been demonstrated. Three <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> whose mutations can increase ovulation rate have been discovered, and all related to the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily. The mutant FecB of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1 B (BMPR 1 B) has an additive effect on ovulation rate. Six mutations (FecX I, FecX H, FecX G, FecX B, FecX L, FecX R) of bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP 15) related with fertility have been identified that share the same mechanism. All the mutants can increase ovulation rate in heterozygotes and cause complete sterility in homozygotes. Homozygous ewes with two new mutations (FecX Gr, FecX O) of BMP 15 had increased ovulation rate without causing sterility. There are five mutations in growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9) associated with sheep prolificacy where FecG E and FecG F have additive an effect on ovulation rate and litter size. The newly identified β- 1, 4 -N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 (B 4 GALNT 2) gene of FecL is proposed as a new mechanism of ovulation rate regulation in sheep. Woodlands is an X-linked maternally imprinted gene which increases ovulation rate. In addition, several putative <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> need to be verified. This review is focused on the identification of the mutations and mechanisms whereby the <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> affecting ovulation rate...|$|R

50|$|There is {{resistance}} to MDMV. Maize plants can {{have up to}} 5 resistance genes in their genetic make up. There are commercially available hybrids that provide good resistance. The <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> for resistance is called mdm1 and it is found on chromosome 6. Mdm1 was identified in Pa405, an inbred line. This chromosomal region of mdm1 is also where resistance genes to two other phtyviridae viruses are located.

40|$|Abstract The Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) was honoured {{to welcome}} {{scientists}} {{from all over}} the world who attended the International Workshop on <b>major</b> <b>Genes</b> and QTL in Sheep and Goats. Approximately 100 participants from 16 countries were registered, contributing 52 oral or poster presentations. A first session was dedicated to the tools available for identifying and localising <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> or QTL in these two species. Molecular techniques, marker panels, radiation hybrids, genome physical maps, and BAC libraries were presented along with genetic, comparative and cytogenetic maps. A second and largest session concerned different traits for which <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> or QTL have been found, i. e., ovulation and other reproduction traits, milk and meat characters, and resistance to disease and wool production. For each group, a guest's paper focused on one sub-trait gave the state of the art: the history, identification and localisation of sources of monogenic and oligogenic variability, genetic determinism (dominance, imprinting, [...] .), effects on the phenotype, physiological mechanisms implied, use in populations, etc. The third session was devoted to the strategies for the use of <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> and QTL in populations, while the last session covered future prospects. A CD (available on request to bodin@toulouse. inra. fr) of the full proceedings was available, and participants invited to give a main paper also had the opportunity to submit it for publication in this special issue of GSE. Nine articles were jointly selected by the Editorial Board of the journal and by the Guest Editor. </p...|$|R

50|$|An {{ortholog}} for LUX named STERILE NODES (SN) {{was discovered}} in Pisum sativum. The name STERILE NODES came from the observation that photoperiod-responsive P. sativum lines formed more vegetative nodes before flowering compared to less photoperiod-responsive lines. The relationship of LUX and SN as orthologs was concluded based on the discovery of functionally and phenotypically similar mutations in SN and LUX, as well as apparent causal linkages between specific polymorphisms and SN mutant phenotypes.

30|$|The genetic {{basis of}} {{qualitative}} resistance to BPH {{has been well}} established and 21 <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> for resistance to BPH have been discovered from rice germplasm including four wild Oryza species (O. officinalis, O. minuta, O. latifolia, and O. australiensis). In some cases, cultivars with <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> for resistance have broken down because of the adaptation of BPH population to highly resistant varieties. It {{has been suggested that}} quantitative resistance to BPH could be more durable (Bosque-Perez and Buddenhagen 1992). However, the genetic basis of quantitative resistance to insect pests was not ascertained due to complex inheritance of the trait and limitations of conventional genetic tools. With the advent of new molecular genetics tools and availability of ideal mapping populations, it has become possible to look for genes involved in expression of complex traits.|$|R
5000|$|She {{has also}} {{previously}} studied {{the evolution of}} the color of mice coats, and its significance for adaptation. In 2013 her team published a paper in the journal Science, describing how coat color in mice was controlled by nine separate mutations within a single gene, named [...] "agouti." [...] Speaking about this discovery, Hoekstra said [...] "The question has always been whether evolution is dominated by these big leaps or smaller steps. When we first implicated the agouti gene, we could have stopped there and concluded that evolution takes these big steps as only one <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> was involved, but that would have been wrong. When we looked more closely, within this gene, we found that even within this single locus, there are, in fact, many small steps." [...] Her work supports the hypothesis that Evolution can occur through incremental changes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bulk flow}} {{hypothesis}} is {{the alternative to}} the cDNA hypothesis, stating that escaped DNA, rather than mRNA, is the mechanism of gene transfer. According to this hypothesis, disturbances to organelles, including autophagy (normal cell destruction), gametogenesis (the formation of gametes), and cell stress, release DNA which is imported into the nucleus and incorporated into the nuclear DNA using non-homologous end joining (repair of double stranded breaks). For example, {{in the initial stages}} of endosymbiosis, {{due to a lack of}} <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> transfer, the host cell had little to no control over the endosymbiont. The endosymbiont underwent cell division independently of the host cell, resulting in many [...] "copies" [...] of the endosymbiont within the host cell. Some of the endosymbionts lysed (burst), and high levels of DNA were incorporated into the nucleus. A similar mechanism is thought to occur in tobacco plants, who show a high rate of gene transfer and whose cells contain multiple chloroplasts. In addition, the bulk flow hypothesis is also supported by the presence of non-random clusters of organelle genes, suggesting the simultaneous movement of multiple genes.|$|E
5000|$|The PTC {{taste test}} {{has been widely}} used in school and college {{practical}} teaching {{as an example of}} Mendelian polymorphism in human populations. Based on a taste test, usually of a piece of paper soaked in PTC (or the less toxic PROP), students are divided into taster and non-taster groups. By assuming that PTC tasting is determined by a dominant allele at a single autosomal gene, and that the class is an unbiased sample from a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, students then estimate allele and genotype frequencies within the broader population. While this interpretation is broadly consistent with numerous studies on this trait, {{it is worth noting that}} other genes, sex, age and environmental factors all influence sensitivity to PTC. Also, there are several alleles segregating at the <b>major</b> <b>gene</b> determining the taste of PTC, particularly in African populations, and the common [...] "taster" [...] allele is incompletely dominant (homozygotes for this allele are more sensitive to PTC than are heterozygotes). Additionally, PTC is toxic and sensitivity to the substitute, PROP, does not show a strong association with the gene controlling ability to taste PTC.|$|E
40|$|Recombination acts on {{the genetic}} map, {{not on the}} {{physical}} map. On the other hand, the physical map is usually more accurate. Choice of the genetic or physical map for positional cloning by allelic association depends on the goodness of fit of data to each map under an established model. Huntington disease illustrates the usual {{case in which the}} greater reliability of physical data outweighs recombinational heterogeneity. Hemochromatosis represents an exceptional case in which unrecognized recombinational heterogeneity retarded positional cloning for a decade. The Malecot model performs well for <b>major</b> <b>genes,</b> but no approach assuming either equilibrium or disequilibrium has been validated for oligogenes contributing to common disease.

40|$|Genome {{research}} in temperate fruit crops has experienced major {{growth over the}} last decade. The development of new markers, particularly microsatellites, has greatly facilitated the construction of comparable linkage maps, {{and the amount of}} information available on map position of <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> and QTLs for the most important agronomic traits, is increasing rapidly. Comparative mapping using transferable markers has been done within the genus Prunus. The present data, based on maps involving seven species (peach, almond, apricot, cherry, P. cerasifera, P. davidiana and P. ferganensis), demonstrate a high level of synteny between all of them, indicating that all Prunus species share the same genome. A similar pattern has been found between apple and pear, and a first comparison between apple and Prunus also suggests a high level of conservation, although some major chromo-some rearrangements are already evident. Based on the synteny within Prunus, it has been possible to place 28 <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> and 28 QTLs on a “consensus ” map, using data from different Prunus inter- and intra-specific populations. Markers tightly linked to some of these <b>major</b> <b>genes</b> are currently used for selection, includ-ing the self-incompatibility locus of Prunus and several disease resistance genes from apple and Prunus. The significant progress recently achieved in the development of genomic tools for this group of species, including a Genome Database for the Rosaceae, will further accelerate {{research in}} this important group of crops...|$|R
