5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

Love of the truth brought me to Tibur, but Onuava’s favorable powers came with me. Thus, divine mother, far from my home-land, exiled in Italy, I address my vows and prayers to you no less.|$|E

25|$|Before I {{experienced}} {{the horror of}} that attack, I was quick to call coward or yellow anyone who showed fear under any circumstances. Nevermore. I don’t know these things, but they speak truth to one. I am not a psychologist, nor a statistician, and less of a philosopher; but the depth of emotion, the dreads of fear, the referees of horrors, and the concentration of self that led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this observation, the fear impulse, or perhaps, better said, the (impulses caused) by fear, are stronger, more demanding than either that of love or hunger...|$|E
25|$|The P.A.B.C. {{initiative}} (Public Art Building Communities), {{has allowed}} <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{a bridge between}} the community, the Restaurant Mama Ayesha’s, the arts and all the people who have made this mural a reality. This could not be done without the support of all the community and the help of the DC Commission and the Restaurant and all the entities who funded the project. I hope that this mural will become a teaching tool of the History of the Presidents for schools, children and the public in general. This is a gift to the City of Washington DC to celebrate this historical moment in American History and will remain open to the public to see for generations to come. This is fulfilling the idea that mural art is available for the public and for the masses.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

500|$|In the {{introductory}} notes to his sheet music for Trois Gymnopédies, Laucke comments: [...] "The characteristic harmonies {{of much of}} the music of Erik Satie belong to the impressionist period and, though originally written for the piano, are extremely well-suited to the natural idiomatic expression of the guitar. This has led <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these transcriptions which will enrich the repertoire of the guitar while remaining faithful to Satie's intentions." ...|$|E

How far would I have gone?... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?" [...] Speer leaves the questions unanswered.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Madsen {{planned to}} create a docudrama-style film but when he {{discovered}} Ketty was a Russian spy and had {{a love affair with}} Flammen he changed his mind. This finding [...] "forced <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film a much more stylish, more noirish piece of work." [...] "Even so, I tried to keep a soft touch style-wise out of respect for the film's subject," [...] said Madsen. He tried to make it feel real by [...] "eliminating the distance to 1944" [...] and directing the film as if it were set in the present.|$|E

Unsatisfied working with the studio's clients, who he felt made [...] "pre-historic trap music", Herren was encouraged to take his music in a more left-field direction, as he was [...] "bored with people barking orders at <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them these really boring rap beats." [...] In return for Herren handling the studio's hip hop clients, the studio owner bought him a Music Production Center (MPC) which Herren would use to create his Prefuse 73 material.|$|E
500|$|David Garrick's {{acceptance}} of Irene for production prompted Johnson to finish rewriting the play. Garrick changed the play's title to Mahomet and Irene, and requested {{changes that would}} make the play more acceptable to his sense of theatrical style. Johnson was initially opposed to the changes and complained that Garrick [...] "wants <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Mahomet run mad, that he may have an opportunity of tossing his hands and kicking his heels". Johnson's friend John Taylor resolved the dispute and Johnson ultimately carried out Garrick's suggestions, which included revising Irene's death scene so that she would be strangled onstage, instead of offstage as originally written.|$|E

500|$|Otherwise, Shinbo granted Urobuchi a {{large amount}} of {{autonomy}} in writing the series and determining the path of the story. In describing his interactions with Iwakami and Shinbo while collaborating on the series, Urobuchi commented that [...] "neither one is the type to show their hand, they would always wait for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the next move." [...] In his effort to create a successful deconstruction of the magical girl genre, Urobuchi studied aspects of traditional magical girl media that were [...] "troubling or overlooked". He also stated that the development of the plot was heavily influenced by the character drawings he saw Aoki design. Other inspirations he credited for contributing to the series included horror fiction author Stephen King as well as previous projects that Shinbo directed such as Hidamari Sketch and Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.|$|E
500|$|An African hip hop and hip hop song, {{the track}} {{was written by}} the two musicians while {{production}} was handled by disc jockey CedSolo.

[...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, let me take you to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's up to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E
500|$|As the Chili Peppers' {{contract}} with EMI {{came to an}} end, they began {{looking for a new}} record company to release their next album. The group reached a consensus to go with Sony BMG/Epic, with the proviso that they buy out their last album from EMI. Even though the label promised it would take only a few days, the process stretched out into several months. Although a deal had been made with Sony/Epic, Mo Ostin of Warner Bros. Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "The coolest, most real person we had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a great record for a rival company. That was the kind of guy I'd want to be working for." [...] The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the {{contract with}} Sony in favor of a deal with Warner Bros. Ostin called an old friend at EMI, who immediately allowed for the label transfer.|$|E
