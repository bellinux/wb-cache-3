5|$|On August 17, when a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for Jamaica, Prime Minister of Jamaica Portia Simpson-Miller convened an emergency meeting of Jamaica's national disaster preparedness council. The Jamaican government finalized evacuation plans, which included converting the country's national arena into a shelter and relocating inmates from two maximum security prisons. Political {{parties in the}} island suspended their campaigning for the August 27 national elections to allow residents {{to prepare for the}} storm. The Caribbean Disaster Emergency Response Agency (CDERA), which was already responding to Hurricane Dean's impact in the Lesser Antilles, contacted the Jamaican Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management to confirm technical and logistics support, and to notify the Jamaican government that utilities teams had been placed on standby should they be needed. The North-West Caribbean Donor Group also met to consider what action <b>might</b> <b>it</b> might undertake in Dean's aftermath.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored {{the lesser of two}} evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its <b>might,</b> <b>it</b> would be much easier to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
500|$|During the First Bulgarian Empire the {{fortress}} {{was part of}} a system of fortifications providing for the defense of Pliska and Preslav, capital cities, and the religious centre of Madara. It then functioned as a minor fort during the 10th–12th centuries, as compared to the glory, economic prosperity and military <b>might</b> <b>it</b> had during the 4th–6th centuries. In the 13th century it again prospered as a political and economic entity of the reborn Bulgarian Empire. When the Byzantines temporarily took control of Preslav in 1278 during the Uprising of Ivaylo Shumen also acquired importance as an administrative and military centre. The fortress continued to thrive in the 14th century until the Ottoman Turks captured it in 1388 during a campaign of their first vizier Çandarlı Ali Pasha.|$|E

500|$|The safety {{concerns}} regarding the LHC collisions have attracted widespread media attention. Various widely circulated newspapers have reported doomsday fears {{in connection with}} the collider, including The Times, The Guardian, The Independent, The Sydney Morning Herald, and Time. Among other media sources, CNN mentioned that [...] "Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise," [...] but it assured its readers with comments from scientists like John Huth, who said that it was [...] "baloney". MSNBC said that, [...] "there are more serious things to worry about" [...] and allayed fears that [...] "the atom-smasher might set off earthquakes or other dangerous rumblings". The results of an online survey it conducted [...] "indicate that a lot of [...] know enough not to panic". The BBC stated, [...] "the scientific consensus appears to be on the side of CERN's theorists" [...] who say the LHC poses [...] "no conceivable danger". Brian Greene in the New York Times reassured readers by saying, [...] "If a black hole is produced under Geneva, <b>might</b> <b>it</b> swallow Switzerland and continue on a ravenous rampage until the Earth is devoured?

500|$|Originally {{opposed to}} the {{inclusion}} of a bill of rights in the Constitution, he had gradually come to understand the importance of doing so during the often contentious ratification debates. By taking the initiative to propose amendments himself through the Congress, he hoped to preempt a second constitutional convention that <b>might,</b> <b>it</b> was feared, undo the difficult compromises of 1787, and open the entire Constitution to reconsideration, thus risking the dissolution of the new federal government. Writing to Jefferson, he stated, [...] "The friends of the Constitution, some from an approbation of particular amendments, others from a spirit of conciliation, are generally agreed that the System should be revised. But they wish the revisal to be carried no farther than to supply additional guards for liberty." [...] He also felt that amendments guaranteeing personal liberties would [...] "give to the Government its due popularity and stability". Finally, he hoped that the amendments [...] "would acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion". Historians continue to debate the degree to which Madison considered the amendments of the Bill of Rights necessary, and to what degree he considered them politically expedient; in the outline of his address, he wrote, [...] "Bill of Rights—useful—not essential—".|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} films feature her in roles as distressed women, and often showed Baker in nude scenes, which few major Hollywood actors were willing {{to do at the}} time. Baker became a {{favorite}} of Umberto Lenzi, with her best-known role being in the aforementioned Paranoia, where she played a wealthy widow tormented by two sadistic siblings. In his review of Paranoia, Roger Ebert said: [...] "Carroll Baker, who was a Hollywood sex symbol (for some, it is said) until she sued Joe Levine and got blacklisted, has been around. She may not be an actress, but she can act. In The Carpetbaggers, there was a nice wholesome vulgarity to her performance. She is not intrinsically as bad as she appears in Paranoia. I think maybe she was saying the hell with it and having a good time." [...] As with Paranoia, the majority of the films she made in Italy received poor critical reception in the United States, though they afforded Baker—who had left Hollywood in debt and with two children to support— an income, as well as fame abroad. In retrospect, Baker commented on her career in Italy and on her exploitation film roles, saying: [...] "I think I made more films [...] than I made in Hollywood, but the mentality is different. What they think is wonderful is not what we <b>might...</b> <b>it</b> was marvelous for me because it really brought me back to life, and it gave me a whole new outlook. It's wonderful to know about a different world." ...|$|E

The author, who has full confidence in his intuition to guide him, has no doubt as to the certitude of his convictions." [...] Jean Piveteau, the vertebrate paleontologist, wrote: [...] "To me, {{it does not seem}} worth discussing this new biological theory at length. For sure [...] the reader will identify in it quite a few Lamarckian reminiscences; but [...] will be precisely the most annoying passages from Lamarck".
