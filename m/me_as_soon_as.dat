2500|$|Táhirih was an {{influential}} poet and follower of the Bábí faith, the predecessor to the Bahá'í Faith, and often mentioned in Bahá'í literature {{as an example}} of courage in the struggle for women's rights. [...] While the writings of Táhirih do not address the issue of women's rights precisely, [...] Táhirih experienced the Báb's revelation as liberating, and broke with Islamic practices that were expected of women, such as appearing in public without a veil at the Conference of Badasht. Her actions which were out of norm caused controversy in the community and some saw her as scandalous or unchaste. [...] To combat the attitudes of the community against Táhirih, the Báb gave her the title Táhirih, meaning the [...] "pure." [...] An unverified quote has been attributed to Táhirih by `Abdu'l-Bahá [...] about her final utterance in 1852: [...] "You can kill <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." [...] According to some scholars this quote is [...] "perhaps apocryphal".|$|E
2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. Little did I know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the dead}} {{of the night in}} secret, Táhirih was taken to the nearby garden Ilkhani in Tehran, and with her own veil was strangled to death. Her body was thrown into a shallow well and stones thrown upon it. A {{prominent}} Bábí, and subsequently Bahá'í, historian cites the wife of an officer who had the chance to know her that she was strangled by a drunken officer of the government with her own veil which she had chosen for her anticipated martyrdom. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance, [...] "You can kill <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women." [...] She was then aged about 35, and was the mother of three children. [...] Dr Jakob Eduard Polak, the Shah's physician, was an eye-witness to the execution and described it as: [...] "I was witness to the execution of Qurret el ayn, who was executed by the war minister and his adjutants; the beautiful woman endured her slow death with superhuman fortitude". `Abdu'l-Bahá eulogized Táhirih writing that she was a [...] "woman chaste and holy, a sign and token of surpassing beauty, a burning brand of the love of God". The Times on 13 October 1852 reports the death of Táhirih, describing her as the [...] "Fair Prophetess of Kazoeen", and the [...] "Bab's Lieutenant".|$|E
