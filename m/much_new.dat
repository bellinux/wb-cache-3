5|$|Amphibians and {{reptiles}} {{were strongly}} {{affected by the}} Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC), an extinction event that occurred ~307 million years ago. The Carboniferous period has long been associated with thick, steamy swamps and humid rainforests. Since plants form the base of almost all of Earth's ecosystems, any changes in plant distribution have always affected animal life to some degree. The sudden collapse of the vital rainforest ecosystem profoundly affected the diversity and abundance of the major tetrapod groups that relied on it. The CRC, which {{was a part of}} one of the top two most devastating plant extinctions in Earth's history, was a self-reinforcing and very rapid change of environment wherein the worldwide climate became much drier and cooler overall (although <b>much</b> <b>new</b> work is being done to better understand the fine-grained historical climate changes in the Carboniferous-Permian transition and how they arose).|$|E

More documentation reveals the lives of the younger sons Madison Hemings and Eston Hemings, and of their descendants, from Madison's memoir, a wide variety of historical records, and newspaper accounts.|$|E

5|$|In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying {{to explore}} the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a {{detailed}} account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then {{under the control of the}} Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip was dangerous and could take two years.

5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. <b>Much</b> <b>new</b> construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have expressed concern about the effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E

25|$|In a reactor that breeds {{at least}} as <b>much</b> <b>new</b> fuel as it consumes, it is not {{necessary}} to add new fissile fuel. Only new fertile fuel is added, which breeds to fissile inside the reactor. In addition the fission products need to be removed. This type of reactor is called a breeder reactor. If it breeds just as <b>much</b> <b>new</b> fissile from fertile to keep operating indefinitely, it is called a break-even breeder or isobreeder. A LFTR is usually designed as a breeder reactor: thorium goes in, fission products come out.|$|E

25|$|Burroughs {{himself was}} very displeased {{with the first}} edition {{and this was the}} main reason for {{rewriting}} it so thoroughly: in 1961 he wrote to his friend Allen Ginsberg that he rewrote it extensively while he was working on Dead Fingers Talk, mostly because he was displeased with the balance of cut-up and more linear material.

25|$|In 1974, Paavolainen's friend Matti Kurjensaari {{published}} a vivid portrait on him.
