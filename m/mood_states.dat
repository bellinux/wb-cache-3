40|$|<b>Mood</b> <b>state</b> {{changes are}} widely {{regarded}} as a symptom of athlete burnout and show potential {{to be used as}} a marker for this condition. The aim of this study was to determine whether changes in burnout scores would be accompanied by similar changes in <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> scores, and to determine the strength of the relationship between burnout and <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> scores at different test points. Forty-one male student rugby union players (mean age: 22. 26 ± 1. 39 years) completed the Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ) of Raedeke and Smith (2001) and the Stellenbosch Mood Scale (STEMS) of Terry, Potgieter and Fogarty (2003) on a three-weekly basis over a five-month pre-season training, pre-competition and competition phase. Data collection consisted of seven test points in total during this period. The ABQ subscale scores remained unchanged throughout the study period, whereas practical significant fluctuations in Total <b>Mood</b> <b>State,</b> Depressive <b>Mood,</b> Anger, Fatigue and Confusion were evident. Practical significant correlations (relationships) were observed between various Burnout and <b>Mood</b> <b>State</b> subscales, notably at test points T 1 (start of the pre-season training phase), T 4 and T 5 (pre-competition phase). The Emotional/Physical Exhaustion and Total Burnout Score in particular were strongly related to various STEMS subscales. However, the strength of the burnout - <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> relationship was inconsistent over the study period. Collectively, these results raise question marks over the use of <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> changes as a marker for burnout in this particular group. Practitioners are, therefore, cautioned against the isolated use of <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> changes as a marker for burnout. [URL]...|$|R

Methods: a total of 123 parents (n?=? 58 fathers, n?=? 65 mothers) of 67 children with newly diagnosed cancer completed three questionnaires separately at the same time measuring parents' negative <b>mood</b> <b>state,</b> parenting stress, and child behavior problems. Results: parents' negative <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> was weakly correlated to more child behavior problems (r?=? 0. 31, p?<? 0. 01), and higher levels of parenting stress were strongly correlated to more child behavior problems (r?=? 0. 61, p?<? 0. 01). Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between parents' negative <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> and child behavior problems (c?=? 0. 29, p?=? 0. 02 (fathers); c?=? 0. 25, p?=? 0. 04 (mothers)) became non-significant after mediating for parenting stress (c'?=? 0. 003, p?=? 0. 98 (fathers); c'?=? 0. 10, p?=? 0. 42 (mothers)).

It involves negative <b>mood</b> <b>states</b> such as subjective distress, fear, disgust, scorn, and hostility. <b>Mood</b> <b>states</b> that are specific to depression include sadness and loneliness that have large factor loadings on negative affect.

A 26 -year follow-up study was conducted among patients >= 18 years treated at the outpatient lithium clinic of the University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands, between November 1973 and December 2000. At each monthly scheduled visit, patients were questioned by a research nurse in a standardized manner about the presence and the severity of nine specific ADRs that frequently occur {{as a consequence of}} lithium treatment and that can be identified by the patients themselves. In addition, lithium serum level was measured and <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> was rated at each visit. A total of 186 patients participated and the median duration of follow-up was 5. 7 years (interquartile range 2. 2 - 11. 8 years). We observed an increased prevalence and severity of ADRs with increased lithium serum level (p < 0. 05), also when adjusting for <b>mood</b> <b>state.</b> The prevalence and the severity of ADRs increased with decreasing <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> into the depressive range and decreased with <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> increasing into the manic range (p < 0. 05), also when adjusting for lithium serum level.

5000|$|The Profile of <b>Mood</b> <b>States</b> (POMS) is a {{relatively}} new psychological rating scale used to assess transient, distinct <b>mood</b> <b>states.</b> This scale was developed by McNair, Droppleman, and Lorr (1971). Advantages of using this assessment include the simplicity of administration and ease of participant understanding. Another feature of the assessment that is notable is POMS psychological states can be assessed quickly due to the simplicity of the test. POMS can be administered and measured through written or online forums. The POMS measures six different dimensions of mood swings over a period of time. These include: Tension or Anxiety, Anger or Hostility, Vigor or Activity, Fatigue or Inertia, Depression or Dejection, Confusion or Bewilderment. A five-point scale ranging from [...] "not at all" [...] to [...] "extremely" [...] is administered by experimenters to patients to assess their <b>mood</b> <b>states.</b> There are two forms of the test; the long form that is administered primarily to adults and the short form which is primarily administered to adolescents.

40|$|Autobiographical {{memory has}} been theorized {{to serve as}} an {{adaptive}} function in coping with negative <b>mood</b> <b>state.</b> To {{gain a better understanding of}} whether autobiographical memory changes with negative <b>mood</b> <b>state,</b> a number of experiments examined the relative accessibility of cognitive content and ability to recall specific event memories in those who had a previous history of depression or showed some aspects of current depressive symptoms. Five separate studies involved 288 participants and examined the effects of negative mood components on autobiographical recall. Studies 1 - 4 examined the autobiographical content by cueing content using a cue word technique to evoke autobiographical memories by means of a modified version of the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT; Williams & Broadbent, 1986). Negative <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> was induced by Velten mood induction technique, and self-reported mood was measured using University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist (UWIST-MACL; Matthews, Jones & Chamberlain, 1990) before and after mood induction. The ability to recall specific event memories was measured in Study 5 by the Sentence Completion for Events from the Past Test (SCEPT; Raes, Hermans, Williams, & Eelen, 2007). The results indicate that negative mood does influence autobiographical recall in terms of content and memory. These results indicate that autobiographical memory is a phenomenon that is in part dependent on negative <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> and in part dependent on current depressive symptoms and history of depression. Increased rumination was particularly responsive to induced negative <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> in those with current depressive symptoms. Reduced levels of activity, alertness, loss of interest and diminished pleasure are aspects of negative mood that seem to be particularly important components of <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> at the time of recall. To gain further insights into <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> effects in autobiographical recall, future directions in mood research should focus on and differentiate between the separate <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> components that are more important in bringing about changes in recalled content, especially in those with either a history of depression or showing current depressive symptoms.

Various benefits of sports participation for individuals with disabilities have been cited, however, the mechanism by which these benefits accrue is largely a matter of speculation. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) is proposed as a theoretical perspective to discuss the benefits of sports participation among adults with spinal cord injury. Purpose. The {{purposes of this study}} were to: (a) identify the relationship of demographic, participation, and self-determination variables with satisfaction with life and positive mood state; (b) identify the best possible prediction of satisfaction with life and positive <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> based on demographics, sports participation, and self-determination variables; (c) to determine interaction effects between self-determination in sport and participation in sport in predicting satisfaction with life and positive <b>mood</b> <b>state.</b> Methods. A cross sectional survey of 72 adults (males = 53, females = 18, mean age = 41) with spinal cord injuries was conducted. Individuals at varying levels of participation in sport were recruited (non-participants in sports = 24, varying participation levels in sports = 46). Results. Two multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the relationship of socio-demographic, sports participation, and self-determination variables in predicting life satisfaction and positive <b>mood</b> <b>state.</b> The overall prediction model of satisfaction with life was significant, F(4, 53) = 4. 582, p<. 01, explaining 20 % of the variance, however, no predictor variables were individually significant in the model.

No interaction effects between self-determination in sports and level of participation in sports were observed in predicting subjective well-being. Conclusions. While satisfaction with life and positive <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> were predicted using participation and self-determination variables, further investigation is needed. Positive <b>mood</b> <b>state</b> was effectively predicted with self-determination in sport being the most influential predictor.
