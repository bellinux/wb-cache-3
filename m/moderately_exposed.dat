40|$|A {{cluster of}} five large {{overlapping}} ignimbrite calderas is <b>moderately</b> well <b>exposed</b> in strongly extended tilted fault-block mountain ranges {{of the central}} Rio Grande rift, southwest of Socorro NM. The Socorro-Magdalena caldera cluster (SMCC) is 85 km long and 20 - 25 km wide. It parallels the southeastern flank of the Colorado Plateau and the WSW-trending San Agustin arm of the rift. Precise 40 Ar / 39 Ar ages of sanidines from the rhyolite ignimbrites demonstrate that the distended calderas become progressively younger to the west-southwest. Large volume ignimbrite eruptions occurred at 31. 9, 28. 7, 27. 9, 27. 4 and 24. 3 Ma. A large satellitic caldera, formed at 28. 4 Ma, is located 20 km south of the main overlapping trend.

His call to create militia protecting religious establishments in wake of social unrest of late 1918 and early 1919 briefly gained him attention in the Cortes. When the conflict between de Mella and Don Jaime exploded into a full-scale confrontation in 1919, Cortina decided {{to side with the}} rebels. However, he was scarcely involved either in internal struggle or later in buildup of the new secessionist organization; in the early 1920s he rather withdrew from politics, attending only vaguely related gatherings. This was the case also following the Primo de Rivera coup of 1923; somewhat sympathetic to Somatén he stayed clear of politics and limited himself to posthumous homages to de Mella. Until 1927 Cortina was listed on various assignments within Ministerio de Fomento.In the early 1930s Cortina returned to Carlist loyalty by joining Comunión Tradicionalista; <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> in propaganda as a veteran figure, he was noted as sitting in minor decorative bodies rather than engaged in real-life politics.

40|$|Analysis of gut {{contents}} and stable isotope composition of intertidal limpets (Patella vulgata) showed a major contribution of macroalgae to their diet, along with microalgae and invertebrates. Specimens {{were collected in}} areas with limited access to attached macroalgae, suggesting a major dietary component of drift algae. Gut contents of 480 animals from 2 <b>moderately</b> wave <b>exposed</b> and 2 sheltered rocky shores in each of 2 regions: western Scotland (55 – 56 °N) and southwest England (50 °N), were analysed in 2 years (n = 30 per site per year). The abundance of microalgae, macroalgae and invertebrates within the guts was quantified using categorical abundance scales. Gut content composition was compared among regions and wave exposure conditions, showing that the diet of P. vulgata changes with both wave exposure and latitude. Microalgae were most abundant in limpet gut contents in animals from southwest sites, whilst leathery/corticated macroalgae were more prevalent and abundant in limpets from sheltered and northern sites. P. vulgata {{appears to have a}} more flexible diet than previously appreciated and these keystone grazers consume not only microalgae, but also large quantities of macroalgae and small invertebrates. To date, limpet grazing studies have focussed on their role in controlling recruitment of macroalgae by feeding on microscopic propagules and germlings. Consumption of adult algae suggests P. vulgata may also directly control the biomass of attached macroalgae on the shore, whilst consumption of drift algae indicates the species may play important roles in coupling subtidal and intertidal production...|$|R

Lifetime exposure assessment, main tests of subclinical kidney damage, and statistical approach were taken from a previous study that had included primarily <b>moderately</b> or heavily <b>exposed</b> workers and had found hydrocarbon-induced nephrotoxic effects. No nephrotoxic effect of exposure could be ascertained in the present study. S-PMA concentration was not increased in hypertensive workers. Thus, the risk of hydrocarbon-induced chronic nephropathy might be extremely low in workers slightly exposed to hydrocarbons. The negative results of some studies might be due to the low lifetime hydrocarbon exposures of the study populations...|$|R
40|$|Intertidal grazing {{gastropods}} play {{an important}} role in structuring rocky shore communities. For many years the main food resource to these animals was considered to be epilithic biofilms. This study shows that macroalgae are a more important component of gastropod diets than was previously appreciated and that biofilms contribute surprisingly little to their trophic ecology. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were used to examine grazer diets, comparing sources of assimilated carbon and nitrogen in gastropod tissues between <b>moderately</b> wave <b>exposed</b> and sheltered sites in northern and southern Britain. Carbon isotope (δ 13 C) values of biofilms were considerably lower than those of grazing gastropods at all of the sites examined. The δ 13 C values of grazer tissues were much more closely related to the carbon isotope values of macroalgae, demonstrating the importance of these foods to intertidal grazing gastropods. Nitrogen isotope values were consistent with this conclusion and reflected differences in the source pools of nitrogen between the two sampling regions. Gut contents analysis was used to directly quantify the diet of the intertidal limpet Patella vulgata in detail. Biofilms and corticated/leathery macroalgae contributed most substantially to patterns of ingested materials and limpet diet was strongly influenced by food availability. Animals from sheltered and northern sites consumed more macroalgae whilst animals from southern sites consumed more biofilm. Stable isotope data from mensurative experiments confirmed the important role of food availability in controlling limpet diets. Data from manipulative caging experiments provided further evidence for this effect and also showed that species identity and interspecific competition influence trophic ecology in intertidal gastropods. Patella depressa isotope values remained different from those of Patella vulgata irrespective of food availability and competition in experimental cages. Stable isotope ratios of Patella vulgata and Littorina littorea, distinct in single species cages, converged towards a common value when held together.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this work}} has been {{to find out the}} {{occupational}} oxidative stress, immunological and genotoxic health hazards among α-cypermethrin (CYP) pesticide-exposed workers. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed including 200 workers divided into 3 groups according to the level of exposure: highly exposed group (50 workers), <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> group (50 workers) and unexposed group (100 workers). All workers were subjected to detailed laboratory investigation for gene P 53 mutations, immunological parameters as a cluster of differentiation into 3 percentage (CD 3 %), CD 4 % and CD 8 % in addition to peripheral blood total leukocytic and platelet counts that were measured. Spectrophotometer technique was used for detection of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Air samples were collected with a High Volume Small Surface Sampler for measurement of α-cypermethrin level. Results: A highly exposed group to the α-cypermethrin had lower CD 4 /CD 8 as compared to an unexposed group with statistically significant difference. As regards gene mutation, exons 5 a and 6 were more frequent among the highly exposed group as compared to no mutation among <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> and unexposed groups with significant difference. As regards antioxidants; SOD, CAT, GSH and GPx were higher among the unexposed group as compared to the highly and <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> group with statistically significant difference. Significant negative correlation was found between working years and antioxidant parameters. Conclusions: Repeated exposure to α-CYP may lead to gene mutations, immunological disturbances and oxidative stress. Strict safety precautions are required not only for workers but also for public users. Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017; 30 (4) : 603 – 61...|$|E

Renewal of ultrafine aerosols {{in the marine}} boundary layer may lead to repopulation of the marine distribution and ultimately determine the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Thus the formation of nanometre-scale particles can lead to enhanced scattering of incoming radiation and a net cooling of the atmosphere. The recent demonstration of the chamber formation of new particles from the photolytic production of condensable iodine-containing compounds from diiodomethane (CH 2 I 2), (O’Dowd et al., 2002; Kolb, 2002; Jimenez et al., 2003 a; Burkholder and Ravishankara, 2003), provides an additional mechanism to the gas-to-particle conversion of sulphuric acid formed in the photo-oxidation of dimethylsulphide for marine aerosol repopulation. CH 2 I 2 is emitted from seaweeds (Carpenter et al., 1999, 2000) and has been suggested as an initiator of particle formation. We demonstrate {{here for the first}} time that ultrafine iodine-containing particles are produced by intertidal macroalgae exposed to ambient levels of ozone. The particle composition is very similar both to those formed in the chamber photo-oxidation of diiodomethane and in the oxidation of molecular iodine by ozone. The particles formed in all three systems are similarly aspherical. When small, those formed in the molecular iodine system swell only <b>moderately</b> when <b>exposed</b> to increased humidity environments, and swell progressively less with increasing size; this behaviour occurs whether they are formed in dry or humid environments, in contrast to those in the CH 2 I 2 system. Direct coastal boundary layer observations of molecular iodine, ultrafine particle production and iodocarbons are reported. Using a newly measured molecular iodine photolysis rate, it is shown that, if atomic iodine is involved in the observed particle bursts, it is of the order of at least 1000 times more likely to result from molecular iodine photolysis than diiodomethane photolysis. A hypothesis for molecular iodine release from intertidal macroalgae is presented and the potential importance of macroalgal iodine particles in their contribution to CCN and global radiative forcing are discussed...|$|R

Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic agent, is associated with decreased cardiovascular mortality in obese type 2 diabetic patients. Therefore, we assessed the role of metformin in glucose-induced activation of PKC-beta 2 and determined the mechanism of its effect in human umbilical venous endothelial cells grown to either normo- (5 mmol/l) or hyperglycemia (10 mmol/l) and <b>moderately</b> and acutely <b>exposed</b> to 25 mmol/l glucose. We studied PKC-beta 2 activation by developing adenovirally expressed chimeras encoding fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and conventional 02 isoform (PKC-beta 2 -GFP). Glucose (25 mmol/l) induced the translocation of PKC-beta 2 -GFP from the cytosol to the membrane in cells grown to hyperglycemia but not in those grown in normal glucose medium. Metformin (20 mu mol/l) prevented hyperglycenda-induced PKC-beta 2 -GFP translocation. We also assessed oxidative stress under the same conditions with a 4 -((9 -acridine-carbonyl) amino) - 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin-oxyl, free radical (TEMPO- 9 -AC) fluorescent probe. We observed significantly increased radical oxygen species production in cells grown in hyperglycemia medium, and this effect was abolished by metformin. We show that in endothelial cells, metformin inhibits hyperglycemia-induced PKC-beta 2 translocation because of a direct antioxidant effect.

The action plan is a proposal, not a legally binding document. Elatine hexandra is a small, aquatic or amphibious, vascular herb in the family Elatinaceae. In Sweden, it usually appears as a summer annual on {{the very edge of}} freshwater lakes or streams. Some populations have over-wintering individuals that occur at depths well below the ice-cover. Typically, the habitat is a <b>moderately</b> wave <b>exposed</b> littoral with inorganic, silty-sandy substrate, covered with a thin layer of mud. The lake habitats have clear water, a near neutral pH and may rep-resent one of the two lake types that are included in the habitat directive, i. e. “Oligotrophic waters containing very few minerals of sandy plains” and “Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters with vegetation of the Littorelletea uniflorae and/or of the Isoëto-Nanojuncetea”. The species has been found in approx. 55 Swedish lakes or running waters since 1980. With a few exceptions, the occurrences are restricted to river basins of southwest Sweden with outlets in Skagerrak and Kattegat (County Administration Boards of Värmland, Västra Götaland, Jönköping, Halland and Kronoberg). In the Swedish red list Elatine hexandra is classified as Endangered (EN). The main threats include deteriorating water quality. Eutrophication, acidification and brownification (increase in water color and dissolved organic matter) have adverse effects on growth and reproduction of the species. Other threats include exploitation of shorelines and water level regulations. The action plan proposes measures against deteriorating water quality in lakes with known occurrences of Elatine hexandra. Further, it points out the need for revision and ecological considerations of present water level regulations. Other suggestions aims to increase the conservation awareness among land owners, nature resource managers and municipality planners. These suggestions include production and spread of an information folder and implementation of conservation related information in the database WISS (Water Information System Sweden). WISS is an open information tool used in the planning cycle of river basin management. Finally, the action plan proposes additional investigations of the distribution in lakes and of the presence in seed-banks, as well as field studies on how growth and reproduction is affected by water regulations. With help of these results, lakes suitable for restoration measures can be selected. The action plan is valid for the period 2013 - 2018 and the costs are estimated to approx. 1 430 000 SE...|$|R

40|$|Sedentary {{consumers}} play {{an important}} role on populations of prey and, hence, their patterns of abundance, distribution and coexistence on shores are important to evaluate their potential influence on ecosystem dynamics. Here, we aimed to describe their spatio-temporal distribution and abundance in relation to wave exposure in the intertidal rocky shores of the south-west Atlantic to provide a basis for further understanding of ecological processes in this system. The abundance and composition of the functional groups of sessile organisms and sedentary consumers were taken by sampling the intertidal of sheltered and <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> shores during a period of one year. The sublittoral fringe of sheltered areas was dominated by macroalgae, while the low midlittoral was dominated by bare rock and barnacles. In contrast, filter-feeding animals prevailed at exposed shores, probably explaining the higher abundance of the predator Stramonita haemastoma at these locations. Limpets were more abundant at the midlittoral zone of all shores while sea urchins were exclusively found at the sublittoral fringe of <b>moderately</b> <b>exposed</b> shores, therefore, adding grazing pressure on these areas. The results showed patterns of coexistence, distribution and abundance of those organisms in this subtropical area, presumably as a result of wave action, competition and prey availability.

A higher degree of resistance was observed in other species of Lycopersicon. While only one accession of L. cheesmanii Riley was tested, it could not be infected by either of the two methods. L. pimpinellifolium (Jusl.) Mill. genotype EC 251580 was similarly resistant. In L. peruvianum (L.) Mill., five EC accessions could not be infected by whitefly inoculation, with three of these being resistant and two moderately resistant in agroinoculation. This study demonstrates the importance of the agroinoculation technique in the virus resistance screening programs and identifies several good sources of {{resistance to the}} Tomato leaf curl virus in Lycopersicon species...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{decline of}} coral reefs {{globally}} underscores {{the need for}} a spatial assessment of their exposure to multiple environmental stressors to estimate vulnerability and evaluate potential counter-measures. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study combined global spatial gradients of coral exposure to radiation stress factors (temperature, UV light and doldrums), stress-reinforcing factors (sedimentation and eutrophication), and stress-reducing factors (temperature variability and tidal amplitude) to produce a global map of coral exposure and identify areas where exposure depends on factors that can be locally managed. A systems analytical approach was used to define interactions between radiation stress variables, stress reinforcing variables and stress reducing variables. Fuzzy logic and spatial ordinations were employed to quantify coral exposure to these stressors. Globally, corals are exposed to radiation and reinforcing stress, albeit with high spatial variability within regions. Based on ordination of exposure grades, regions group into two clusters. The first cluster was composed of severely exposed regions with high radiation and low reducing stress scores (South East Asia, Micronesia, Eastern Pacific and the central Indian Ocean) or alternatively high reinforcing stress scores (the Middle East and the Western Australia). The second cluster was composed of <b>moderately</b> to highly <b>exposed</b> regions with moderate to high scores in both radiation and reducing factors (Caribbean, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Central Pacific, Polynesia and the western Indian Ocean) where the GBR was strongly associated with reinforcing stress. Conclusions/Significance: Despite radiation stress being the most dominant stressor, the exposure of coral reefs could be reduced by locally managing chronic human impacts that act to reinforce radiation stress. Future research and management efforts should focus on incorporating the factors that mitigate the effect of coral stressors until long-term carbon reductions are achieved through global negotiations. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} in a Dutch cohort dietary patterns and other lifestyle habits in relation with disease burden. Our {{aim was to}} define the healthiest dietary pattern in the Netherlands and provide insight in the lifestyle factors {{that are associated with}} this pattern. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were used to measure the burden of chronic diseases. QALYs can be interpreted as the healthy life expectancy. In our study, never smoking, a normal weight (defined as BMI< 25 kg/m 2), a physically active life and adherence to a Mediterranean-style of diet were all positively associated with healthy life expectancy. A Mediterranean-style diet is characterized by a high intake of vegetables, fruit and fish, moderate intake of alcohol and dairy and low intake of meat. A dietary pattern resembling the Mediterranean diet was associated with a longer life in good health: participants who scored high on this pattern had 0. 17 [95 % CI 0. 05; 0. 30] more QALYs than participants with a low score, equivalent to a two months longer life in good health. For a dietary pattern that was in agreement with guidelines of the World Health Organization, measured with the Healthy Diet Indicator, we found similar relations with QALYs (0. 15 95 % CI [0. 03; 0. 27]). A combination of a healthy diet with never smoking, a normal weight and being physically active was associated with almost 2 years of life longer in good health, 1. 75 QALYs [95 % CI 1. 37; 2. 14]. We investigated relations between alcohol consumption and healthy survival in greater detail. Moderate drinkers (5 - 14. 9 g for women, 5 - 29. 9 g for men) had a lower chronic disease burden (mean DALYs: - 0, 27 [95 % CI - 0, 43;- 0, 11]), while former drinkers had a higher disease burden (mean DALYs: 0, 81 [0, 03; 1, 59]) than light drinkers (0 - 4. 9 g). This association was mainly observed among older participants and was, as expected, driven by a lower disease burden due to cardiovascular diseases. An inactive lifestyle, a large waist circumference, no dietary supplement use and skipping breakfast were all associated with an unhealthy dietary pattern, both in low and high educated participants. Only: in low educated persons smoking was related to an unhealthy dietary pattern, while in high educated persons current and former smoking was related to a healthier diet. We also found that women who had been <b>moderately</b> or severely <b>exposed</b> to the Dutch famine (1944) in their early adolescence later became more frequent smokers, at higher doses. Severely famine exposed women also became more often physically inactive than unexposed women. Our results imply that, next to having direct biological effects that increase chronic disease risk, famine exposure might indirectly relate to chronic disease risk through unhealthy lifestyle factors. We conclude that in a Dutch population adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with the lowest disease burden. An unhealthy pattern is associated with several other unhealthy lifestyle characteristics. And, a combination of healthy lifestyle behaviors is related with a significantly longer healthy life. This indicates that public programs aiming at improving health could benefit from targeting at a cluster of modifiable lifestyle factors...|$|R
