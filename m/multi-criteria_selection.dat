40|$|The {{procurement}} of {{a construction}} contractor normally involves {{some form of}} prequalification. The better prequalification regimes adopt a structured multi-criteria approach (i. e. contractor evaluation based on a multiple of factors over and above cost). This research solicits contractors' viewpoints on prequalification, in contrast to earlier works which have tended to present clients' perspectives. Contractors are dissatisfied with the frequency and adequacy of current prequalification regimes. An investigation of the mutual benefits of <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>selection</b> leads to the suggestion that such benefits could be better capitalized upon. Contractors' perceived levels of importance (with respect to selection criteria considered by clients during the selection process) are evaluated and show that, in line with earlier findings, 'cost' is still the predominant selection factor, followed by 'contractor experience' and 'company reputation'. A comparison between contractors' rankings of the selection criteria with similar rankings derived from an earlier survey of clients, finds significant correlation, indicating that contractors agree with clients' importance levels of <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>selection</b> factors.

40|$|For over a century, admissions {{officers}} and enrollment managers {{have relied on}} external validation of merit in selective admission of undergraduates. A main criterion used for selection is standardized testing, i. e., the SAT and ACT. Since these tests have been long-suspected and then shown to contain class and race biases while not accurately predicting retention (Banerji), the Schedler Honors College at the University of Central Arkansas (UCA) shifted to a holistic, <b>multi-criterion</b> <b>selection</b> process, de-emphasizing standardized tests, and then analyzed the outcomes. The statistical analysis served two goals. The first was to test whether variables in the admissions model, developed in 2007, predicted retention; the results led {{to changes in the}} weighting of variables for a revised rubric that we have used since 2010. The second goal was to improve enrollment of a more racially diverse population of students. Our findings demonstrated that most variables used in typical higher education admissions protocols did not accurately predict retention in the Schedler Honors College at UCA. Only one variable correlated to retention in honors, namely, high school grade point average (hsGPA).

40|$|This study {{surveyed}} IDOT staff about roundabouts, evaluated two popular roundabout {{software programs}} (aaSIDRA and RODEL), developed a <b>multi-criteria</b> site <b>selection</b> procedure, {{and used it}} to identify 10 potential intersections in Illinois that may reduce fatalities and severe injuries by using a roundabout. IDOT jurisdiction includes three roundabouts built or under construction and four roundabouts in planning stages. One third of IDOT districts were familiar with the RODEL and aaSIDRA, but they did not have working knowledge of the software. Some districts were concerned about proper roundabout usage by unfamiliar, younger, or elderly drivers. For the same traffic conditions, aaSIDRA yielded higher delay than RODEL for most of the reasonable volume combinations. Capacity values from RODEL are very similar to FHWA???s 2000 Guide and both are higher than the new NCHRP 572 model, but aaSIDRA???s capacity curves are similar to that of NCHRP 572. This study used aaSIDRA for developing the proposed site <b>selection</b> procedure. A <b>multi-criteria</b> site <b>selection</b> procedure was developed and its application is presented. The factors considered in the site selection process included crash history, intersection delay (LOS), roundabout capacity, distribution of traffic volume among approaches, location of intersection, and input from ???local??? engineers. The site selection process was used to identify the top 10 potential roundabout locations in Illinois. Further modification to this procedure is needed to cover other types of roads (multi lane) and traffic conditions. It is recommended that, for the time being, IDOT follow the FHWA Roundabout Guide (2000) in conjunction with the findings of recently published NHCRP Report 572 as a guideline for the design of roundabouts. The upcoming FHWA Roundabout Guide and a new roundabout chapter in the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual will include significantly new information {{that could be used in}} developing a roundabout design guide for IDOT.

30|$|In this paper, {{instead of}} the {{classical}} approach to the <b>multi-criteria</b> location <b>selection</b> problem, a new approach was presented based on selecting a portfolio of locations. First, the indices affecting the selection of maintenance stations were collected. The K-means model was used for clustering the maintenance stations. The optimal number of clusters was calculated through the Silhouette index. The efficiency of each cluster of stations was determined using the Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes input-oriented data envelopment analysis model. A bi-objective zero one programming model was used to select a Pareto optimal combination of rank and distance of stations. The Pareto solutions for the presented bi-objective model were determined using the invasive weed optimization method.

The multi-criteria analysis ranked the systems, while the portfolio check determined whether all important aspects were covered. The <b>multi-criteria</b> <b>selection</b> included issues such as benefits, costs, deployment and users, and the portfolio check confirmed, for example, that the systems addressed all vulnerable road user groups, covered all impact categories, and covered different types of ITS (infra-based, car-based, VRU-based and cooperative ITS).|$|E

Three criteria have been used: (1)  spatial proximity; (2)  physical similarity; (3)  stream gauging network topology. An extensive assessment of our spatial proximity method variant is made on a 149 catchment-data set located in the Rhine-Meuse catchment. The competitiveness of the method is evaluated against spatial interpolation of catchment model parameters with ordinary kriging. We found that the spatial proximity approach is more efficient than ordinary kriging. When distance to upstream/downstream stream gauge stations is considered as a second order criterion {{in the selection of}} donor catchments, an unprecedented level of efficiency is reached for nested catchments. Nevertheless, the spatial proximity method does not take advantage from physical similarity between donor catchments and receiver catchments because catchments that are the most hydrologically similar to each catchment poorly match with the catchments that are the most physically similar to each catchment...|$|E
