5|$|Paulus van der Sloot {{was arrested}} on 22 June 2005, for {{questioning}} in Holloway's disappearance. He was ordered released on 26 June {{after three days of}} questioning. According to Aruba's chief prosecutor, one of the Kalpoe brothers told investigators that Paulus, who at the time was training to be a judge, advised that without a body, the police would have no case. Beth Holloway pursued Van der Sloot's parents in the ensuing <b>media</b> <b>circus</b> on Aruba. She said that Paulus acknowledged that they could not control their son and had sent him to a psychiatrist.|$|E

His secret lover, public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel), appears to be his nemesis as she hounds him about a client who is the lost victim of police bureaucracy.

5|$|Van der Sloot's cell {{became the}} target of a <b>media</b> <b>circus,</b> with reporters vying to gain {{exclusive}} access and report about his prison surroundings. Since his incarceration, he has only consented to interviews to De Telegraaf, in which he admitted to extorting the Holloway family and said that he received a number of marriage proposals in his cell, including one from a woman who wanted to have his child. Van der Sloot reportedly receives fan mail from around the world, though mostly from women residing in the United States and the Netherlands. According to sources within the prison, Van der Sloot sought $1 million in exchange for an on-camera interview.|$|E

5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A <b>media</b> <b>circus</b> followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E
5|$|During Nixon's {{visit to}} the Soviet Union in 1959, Khrushchev took part in what later {{became known as the}} Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned {{argument}} in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country. Khrushchev was invited to visit the United States, and did so that September, spending thirteen days. Khrushchev arrived in Washington, DC on his first {{visit to the}} United States on 15 September 1959. The first visit by a Soviet premier to the United States resulted in an extended <b>media</b> <b>circus.</b> Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families. The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington, concluding with a meeting with U.S. President Eisenhower at Camp David. During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism. Khrushchev was supposed to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement. He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home in Hyde Park, New York. While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Media</b> <b>circuses</b> make up {{the central}} plot device in the 1951 movie Ace in the Hole about a self-interested {{reporter}} who, covering a mine disaster, allows a man to die trapped underground. It cynically examines {{the relationship between the}} media and the news they report. The movie was subsequently re-issued as The Big Carnival, with [...] "carnival" [...] referring to what we now call a [...] "circus". The movie was based on real-life Floyd Collins who in 1925 was trapped in a Kentucky cave drawing so much media attention that it became the third largest media event between the two World Wars (the other two being Lindberghs solo flight and the Lindbergh kidnapping).|$|R

25|$|Sensationalism, in general, {{is a form}} {{of being}} {{extremely}} controversial, loud, or attention grabbing. In the context of the media, sensationalism refers to claims that the media chooses to report on shocking events or to exaggerate, at the expense of accuracy and objectivity, in order to improve viewer, listener or readership ratings. This criticism, also known as <b>media</b> <b>circus,</b> is proffered by both Israelis and Palestinians as a possible explanation for alleged bias.|$|E

40|$|My {{knowledge}} of Japanese {{media coverage of}} China is largely limited to print media, and mostly as a regular consumer of the major liberal daily Asahi Shimbun. Despite this relatively narrow window, several features of Asahi‘s China coverage strike me as noteworthy. One obvious difference with American newspaper reporting is a far greater focus on historical features. During the past year, Asahi ran an excellent series on turning points East Asian history, that included essays on Japan’s colonial expansion in Korea, Taiwan, China {{and other parts of}} Asia. One series of articles compared the way these events were described in Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese and PRC textbooks. In general the articles were insightful and well-documented and did not back away from Japan’s historic aggression in Asia. At the same time, they discussed subjects {{that would not have been}} covered by Americans including the lives of Japanese in former colonial possessions. These progressive elements aside, Asahi, also chases the scandalous China stories that other major Japanese outlets chase. This bias towards dramatic and/or violent events is not so different from the West, particularly US television, but the proximity and greater human resources of Japanese media in China mean that headline events there produce a huge volume of reporting in Japanese media outlets. This year these <b>media</b> <b>circuses</b> included the Tibet riots, and the “frozen dumpling” incident in which Chinese-manufactured frozen dumplings were found to have agricultural poisons on the surface of the packages. The dumpling incident, in particular, was front page news for days, even though no fatalities were involved...|$|R

Ace in the Hole (alternate title, The Big Carnival) is a 1951 film by Billy Wilder based on the <b>media</b> <b>circus</b> surrounding the attempted rescue of a man stuck in a cave. The film depicts a fictional incident, but Collins is mentioned by name in the dialogue. He is mentioned in two novels by Kentucky writers Robert Penn Warren and James Still: The Cave and River of Earth.|$|E

Australia won the First Test in Brisbane by an innings in {{three and a half}} days, with Taylor contributing 69. In the Second Test at Bellerive Oval, Taylor scored 123 in the second innings to set up a winning total. In the Third Test in Sydney, he made 59 as Australia collapsed for 172 in the second innings and conceded the match. He ended the series with a healthy 338 runs at 67.60.|$|E
25|$|In July 2011, Daredevil relaunched with vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2011), with writer Mark Waid. Waid {{focused on}} {{emphasizing}} the character's powers and {{perception of the}} physical world. In the premiere issue, Murdock finds {{he can no longer}} serve as a trial lawyer due to past allegations of his being Daredevil causing a case he represents in court to turn into a <b>media</b> <b>circus.</b> Two issues later, Nelson and Murdock have developed a new business strategy of serving as consulting counselors, by teaching clients how to represent themselves in court. Daredevil joins the New Avengers in a story written by former Daredevil series writer Brian Michael Bendis. Daredevil appeared as a regular character in the 2010–2013 New Avengers series in issues #16–34 (November 2011– January 2013). At one point, Foggy begins to question Matt's sanity, ultimately leading to a fallout between the two. They reconcile once the truth is discovered. Daredevil vol. 3 ended at issue #36 in February 2014, in which Matt is forced to publicly reveal his Daredevil identity, resulting in his being disbarred by New York and prompting him to again relocate to San Francisco.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1990s, {{there have}} been efforts by the {{government}} to revitalize the craft. One of these was the Jugar a las Muñecas. De las Lupes a las Robóticas project managed by artist María Eugenia Chellet from 1991 to 2008. It worked to create innovation in the dolls, creating images from mass <b>media,</b> the <b>circus,</b> harlequins, and animal/human figures. The dolls were painted in acrylics and decorated with items such as clothing, beads, feathers, ribbons and more. The main goal of the project was to see the dolls not as anonymous handcrafts but rather as works of art. This project was sponsored by CONACULTA and had workshops and exhibitions in various parts of Mexico. This was followed in 2010 by the Miss Lupita project headed by Caroline Esparragoza in Mexico City, with support from Chellet and the Fondo Nacional para las Artes y Cultura. The goal of this project is to preserve the traditional techniques to make the dolls but to update the designs. Dolls were created by ordinary people with help from artisans and artists and the results were exhibited in Mexico, Japan and Portugal. There was even a workshop to make the dolls in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 February, Chinese-language {{newspaper}} Sharp Daily {{published a}} set of floor plans purporting {{to be of the}} 2,400-square-foot illegal basement at one of Tang's properties comprising a store room, fitness room, changing room, cinema and wine-tasting room dating from 2003. Tang said the drawing [...] "does not match. basement is basically used for storage." [...] The Buildings Department said that the property was inspected on 22 January 2007, and no unauthorised structures were found. Experts believe that the secret basement standing larger than the footprint of the house was no afterthought: engineers have largely discounted the possibility of building such a large underground structure after completion of the main house. The filed building plan showed foundation piles were driven five metres deep, enough space to harbour at least one storey underground. A <b>media</b> and political <b>circus</b> gathered in York Road as inspectors made a site visit on 16 February: media hired building cranes to gain vantage over the property; Leung Kwok Hung led a protest outside Tang's residence. In a press conference, Tang's wife took responsibility for the illegal basement facility. Tang refused media requests to tour the house. He said: [...] "An illegal structure is an illegal structure. It doesn't matter what the facilities inside are." [...] Tang was widely criticised for hiding behind his wife, and was then under pressure to quit the race.|$|R

Brooke Hart, a young man of 22 and recent graduate of Santa Carla University, was appointedby his father, Alex Hart, owner of the Hart Department Store, {{the vice president of the}} company. The Hart family was one of most respectedand wealthiest families in San Jose. The kidnapping and murder became national news, and the lynching of the two accused defendantsmarked the first and last lynching in San Jose since 1854. After Hart 2 ̆ 7 s body was discovered in the San Francisco bay on November 26, 1933,mob violence broke out and an angry mob rushed the jail and the two men were dragged to Saint James Park where they were beaten,stripped of their clothes, and hung. This story made national news and a <b>media</b> and political <b>circus</b> followed. California Governor JamesRolph Jr. shamefully applauded the actions of the mob, for which he was condemned by President Franklin Roosevelt and former PresidentHerbert Hoover. In the aftermath, gruesome street hawkers sold post-cards of the event, while others sold pieces of the tree limbs assouvenirs. The trees were finally cut-down, the jail and new post-office were badly damaged, and the mob was never indicted by the SantaClara Grand Jury. The failure of due process, the murders of the two defendants, and the lawlessness that prevailed is an important story inthe larger framework of the history of lynching in the United States.

500|$|The most {{gripping}} {{news story}} of the pre-Code era was the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby {{on the evening of}} 1 March 1932.

Newsreels featuring family photos of the child (the first time private pictures had been [...] "conscripted for public service") asked spectators to report any sight of him. On May 12, 1932, the child's body was found less than five miles from the Lindbergh home.
