Kills described this sound as mixing hip-hop-resembling strong percussion with electric guitar-led instrumentals.

AllMusics <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> was appreciative of the single, which he described as a [...] "catchy pop moment". A critic from BlackBook agreed, stating that [...] "songs like 'Fascinated' [...] sparkle with a catchy confidence". A staff member from Filter Magazine claimed that [...] "surely your 80's obsessed best friend will love it". Bergstrom from PopMatters criticized [...] "Fascinated", which he called an [...] "undistinguished, flat-out boring song".

In <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar's</b> AllMusic review, he stated that the album [...] "is not as warm or immediately enticing as much of Ivy's previous work", but commended the [...] "detached electronica" [...] feeling from songs [...] "Fascinated", [...] "Lost in the Sun" [...] and [...] "She Really Got to You".|$|R

500|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>Collar,</b> {{writing for}} AllMusic, {{declared}} [...] "The record's collaborative foundation crackles on every track, but Hayley Williams, a ballsy, extroverted frontwoman {{with a voice}} big enough to stop time, proves unequivocally to be the cunning talent of the band, no matter how vital York and Davis may be". Collar regards it their best album. At AbsolutePunk, Jack Appleby said [...] "Instead of pursuing all things epic or intentionally moving to a specific sound, the band had a blast pursuing every genre under the sun, creating a damn good album in the process...Chances are you won't dedicate undivided attention to Paramore, but you'll regularly queue the whole record." [...] He concluded with that the album isn't for everyone, but has something that anyone could enjoy.|$|E

He also noted that Kills' personality, although similar to that of Pink and Lady Gaga, was [...] "enough [...] to keep your attention". Writing in Idolator, Sam Lansky highlighted Bhasker's production, which he credited with making the album cohesive. Lansky opined that Kills had evolved as a songwriter and given legitimacy and [...] "richness" [...] to Troubles songs. So So Gay Magazine praised Trouble as an evolution from her previous album Perfectionist, and stated that Kills [...] "remains largely unknown and underrated; astonishing considering the quality of her two albums.

PopMatters', John Paul gave the album 10 out of 10 saying [...] "Perhaps no other recording better illustrates how Miles Davis bridged the gap between jazz’s old guard and its younger visionaries" [...] The Observer's Dave Gelly said [...] "Summer is traditionally the season for unearthing treasures from the jazz archives, {{and this is a}} real prize".|$|R
500|$|<b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of Allmusic complimented {{the classic}} Christmas songs {{composed}} in a [...] "light, contemporary pop fashion," [...] noting Aly & AJ's original songs as standouts on the album. Logan Leasure of Jesus Freak Hideout commended Aly & AJ's [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals on the tracks, but said carols such as [...] "The First Noel" [...] and [...] "Deck the Halls" [...] {{were a bit}} boring, due to the acoustic feel of the set. Overall, Leasure said [...] "This album has its good share of standout tracks that are sure to satisfy any fan of modern Christmas music." [...] He specifically pointed out [...] "Little Drummer Boy" [...] and the impressive lyrical content of [...] "Not This Year.

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 68, based on ten reviews. Despite its [...] "boardroom-defined objectives" [...] and [...] "safety", Al Fox, writing for BBC Music, considered the music itself [...] "notable quality" [...] and reliable. <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> from AllMusic {{described it as}} an [...] "immediately catchy mix of dancey pop that maximizes the group's shared lead-vocal approach and peppy, upbeat image." [...] Kate Wills from The Independent praised the uptempo material while defining the ballads as jarring, a notion shared by John Dolan of Rolling Stone. Although he dubbed it [...] "actually pretty great – certainly better than it needs to be," [...] Sam Lansky for Idolator thought the album is predictably generic, and interpreted it as [...] "a little cynical, even as it excels in making some of the purest pop of the year." ...|$|E

Writing for Alternative Press, Scott Heisel felt {{the song was}} one of the [...] "moments of diversity that really make Paramore shine". Billboards Brad Wete remarked that the song's instrumentation helped it pass an [...] "average rock song" [...] status. <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of AllMusic billed the song as an [...] "immediate classic". For Stereogum, Chris DeVille opined that the song was [...] "crack". Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone commented that, on [...] "Ain't It Fun", Williams transitions to a new musical genre on Paramore with an [...] "I-will-survive warrior priestess" [...] attitude. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Brian Mansfield from the USA Today newspaper and Consequence of Sound's Amanda Koellner selected [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] as a standout from the album. Koellner commented that [...] "when the band allows each track a little more breathing room, they show some growth {{and have a good time}} doing it."

500|$|Title {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan observed, [...] ", the EP hooks similar trickle-down Beyoncé empowerment themes to sugary doo-wop and girl-group melodies." [...] AllMusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> lauded Trainor's vocal ability as [...] "soulful" [...] and [...] "highly resonant" [...] on the record. Christina Garibaldi of MTV News {{felt that the}} title track showcased Trainor's [...] "impressive" [...] rapping skills. Stereogum's Chris DeVille wrote, [...] "Title suggests she might {{have a shot at}} outlasting 'All About That Bass' if only she finds some new subject matter to sing about." [...] DeVille, however, commended the EP's production, opining, [...] " [...] how to craft a hit, both in terms of punchy major-key music and cheeky, meme-able lyrical turns," [...] and went on to conclude that Trainor is a [...] "very capable singer" [...] and is able to [...] "project lots of character and emotion within a relatively limited range". In a mixed review, a writer for the Knoxville News Sentinel commented, [...] "After 'Bass,' Title loses its element of surprise and leaves even appreciative listeners to wonder what else Trainor's got to offer".|$|E
500|$|Just Chillin {{received}} less than favorable critical reception. Allmusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> awarded the album {{two out of}} five stars and noted his preference for Brown's 1994 studio album After the Storm. Collar thought that Brown incorporated too many programmed drums and [...] "mid-tempo jams", producing more [...] "urban and gritty" [...] tracks than his other instrumental albums. He compared [...] "The Feeling I Get" [...] to [...] "instrumental Maxwell" [...] and called Janet Jackson's [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] a standout track which reflects Brown's [...] "overall vision to turn jazz to pop and vice versa". Chris Walker of JazzTimes also noted the album's laid-back pace ("almost too relaxed") and thought it lacked Brown's [...] "trademark zestfulness". Walker complimented the vocalists' performances, which produced a [...] "pleasant, soulful aura", but felt they were [...] "far removed" [...] from Brown. He wrote that [...] "Just Chillin'" [...] and [...] "Dancing in the House" [...] displayed Brown's acumen; Walker also complimented [...] "Night Drive", {{in part because of}} Braun's trumpet performance, and considered [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] the highlight of the album. In 2003, the album earned Brown the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album.|$|E

Eight days later, the album debuted at No. 57 on the Billboard album charts, showcasing [...] "her gargantuan chops and sweet charm". <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of AllMusic added that the arrangements were [...] "grandiose" [...] for someone of Ryan's age, but they were [...] "more than matched by her truly impressive vocal talent." [...] Los Angeles Daily News reviewer Sandra Barrera wrote that Ryan handled the songs [...] "like the old pro that her big, powerful voice makes you think she is".|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Grady Smith for Entertainment Weekly described its lyricism as [...] "terribly misguided" [...] for One Direction's target audience. Melinda Newman of HitFix, polarised by its lyrical content, wrote that women want men to pretend their flaws {{do not exist}} and not see them. Both Kate Wills of The Independent and Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan criticised the lyrical content as jarring. Although Bill Lamb of About.com shared Smith's sentiment, he favoured Gosling's [...] "beautiful" [...] production of the song and the group's [...] "top notch" [...] vocal performance. Al Fox of BBC Music, who noted a [...] "pursuit for credibility", felt that One Direction were [...] "handing in their identity" [...] with [...] "Little Things". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times dismissed Sheeran's songwriting as [...] "unusually lumpy {{in the hands of}} such a polished group". In contrast, Alexis Petridis for The Guardian described the track as [...] "noticeably more sophisticated lyrically and emotionally than anything else on the album." [...] The Boston Globe editor Sarah Rodman selected the [...] "essential" [...] song as the album's [...] "best" [...] attribute, and <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> from AllMusic considered the ballad [...] "an air of maturity to One Direction's admittedly squeaky-fresh sound." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt that [...] "Little Things" [...] can be interpreted as [...] "minor signs of growth" [...] for the boy band.|$|E

He stated that the album often [...] "brings to mind the intonations of Mariah Carey which are most likely intentional." [...] Collar closed the statement saying that Yours Truly [...] "makes the most of her talent." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly graded the album an A-, calling the album [...] "pure pop bliss" [...] and [...] "one of the most purely enjoyable albums of the year" [...] that is powered by her [...] "lithe, Broadway-honed voice". At The New York Times, Jon Caramanica gave a positive review of the album, writing that television shows such as American Idol and Glee [...] "have been responsible for an intense surge of interest in music on television, but they haven't left much of a mark on the shape of pop. That's because both shows are fundamentally conservative institutions, privileging the familiar and the unchallenging. They're about emulating, not innovating." [...] Caramanica commended Grande for becoming the first [...] "identifiable pop star" [...] who takes the [...] "rules of those enterprises, uses them as a foundation, and innovates atop them... She uses the [...] "Glee"/"Idol" [...] template as a jumping-off point to make modern pop-R with a sturdy vintage backbone." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Hornbuckle of So So Gay {{described}} [...] "DNA" [...] as [...] "an addictive {{slice of}} dark pop, with the chorus breakdown remaining {{not only a}} highlight on this track, but of the entire album." [...] The song was well received by Vicky Newman from Shields Gazette, who felt that it demonstrates the group's [...] "stunning" [...] harmonies and allows their voices to [...] "shine". Newman also wrote that the song's urban edge manifests Little Mix's growth and development. Gigwise's Andrew Trendell praised the track's production, writing, [...] "The skittering beats and little quirks of [...] 'DNA' make it instantly memorable." [...] Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail complimented the song's choral middle-eight, deeming it [...] "an inventive sonic flourish". [...] "DNA" [...] was described as [...] "pop perfection" [...] by Lewis Corner of Digital Spy, who highlighted the song's [...] "spooky synths, pumping heartbeats and gothic choir finale". John Earls from British newspaper, Daily Star, positively reviewed the single, calling it [...] "a winning formula," [...] in addition to awarding it a {{nine out of ten}} rating. Earls went on to mention that the song is [...] "A regal anthem that'll have all of Girls Aloud wondering how they didn't release it first, the Little Mixers are sounding huge at last.". [...] "DNA" [...] was deemed [...] "amazing" [...] by Clemmie Moodie of the Daily Mirror. Eve Barlow for NME likened the song to Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] and described it as [...] "a banger". According to Hackford Jones of music website, Pressparty, [...] "DNA" [...] is [...] "a storming slice of future-pop" [...] and [...] "a vibrant and commanding modern-day pop anthem that has the Little Mix personality stamped all the way through it." [...] Amy Gravelle of Entertainment Wise felt that the song represents the group's [...] "feisty charm". Gravelle also described the track as [...] "an infectiously catchy pop belter that proves the girls {{have what it takes to}} keep up with the best of their rivals." [...] Ciara Moore from The College View said that [...] "DNA" [...] won Little Mix a legion of teenage fans. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman called the song [...] "bludgeoning, booming techno pop". 4Music's Trent Maynard said that [...] "DNA" [...] is a [...] "much darker turn for the cheery foursome, but just as catchy and polished as their previous single." [...] The song was described as [...] "an absolute gem" [...] by Lizzie Cox of Sugar. Rick Fulton of the Daily Record positively reviewed the song, awarding it three out of five stars. Fulton deemed the song as [...] "feisty electro fun" [...] and [...] "a bit harder than 'Wings'". He also added, [...] "it seems Little Mix have big aspirations to be around for a lot longer than most of 's winners." [...] Nicky Diaz of The Miami Hurricane said that [...] "DNA" [...] shows the group's edgier side. Diaz went on to praise the track's harmonies and lyrics, writing, [...] "The stand-out harmonies on this song are incredible and the lyrics are catchy". <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of AllMusic called the track [...] "a truly catchy, infectious cut".|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Too Little Too Late" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of AllMusic also gave the song a positive review, saying [...] "Jojo is an assured and likeable performer who can somehow embody the yin-yang persona of a suburban cheerleader slinging hip-hop attitude, {{as she does}} in the video for the ridiculously overwrought and utterly addictive lead-off single, 'Too Little Too Late'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> {{also gave}} the album a {{positive}} review, stating: [...] "Damage, is a mature breakup album that still retains {{all of the}} band's youthful, sock-to-the-gut pop energy. [...] The album also builds nicely upon the power pop/dance-rock vibe of their 2010 release, Invented, with an even more focused, lyrical approach that helps make {{this one of the}} band's most cathartic and moving albums of its career." [...] Scott Heisel, writing for Alternative Press, praised Johannes' production, stating: [...] "Thankfully, Damage easily bests the previous two Jimmy Eat World full lengths, and its high points rival those of Futures and Bleed American. Recorded to tape by Alain Johannes (Queens of the Stone Age, No Doubt), the album is full-bodied and warm, with an organic bleed from the drum mics and a sonic resonance you just can't get digitally." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Christian Music Zine, David Huey rated it four-and-a-half stars, {{and called}} it [...] "solid front to back and a can’t miss."

[...] At Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies rated it a perfect five stars, and he said [...] "this is the most complete album the band have made." [...] Kevin Thorson of CM Addict rated it four-and-a-half stars, and proclaimed the album to be [...] "perfectly executed". At The Christian Manifesto, J.F. Arnold rated it four stars, and he evoked that [...] "This album is my favorite Switchfoot album to date, though that admittedly isn't saying much." [...] However, Allmusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> rated it three stars, and noted that the album come from a [...] "creatively energized and committed state of mind that should please longtime fans and produce {{more than a few}} ear-catching moments." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Take It All," [...] {{the seventh}} track, written and {{recorded}} with Francis [...] "Eg" [...] White and Jim Abbiss before {{the breakdown of}} Adele's relationship, is a piano and vocal ballad that borrows heavily from pop, soul and gospel. In his review of 21, Allmusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> called the song the album's centrepiece, [...] "an instant-classic" [...] {{in the same vein}} as [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going," [...] and [...] "All by Myself," [...] and a [...] "cathartic moment for fans who identify with their idol's Pyrrhic lovelorn persona." [...] The track precedes [...] "I'll Be Waiting," [...] the second of two songs produced by Epworth, which diverges from the scathing [...] "Rolling in the Deep" [...] in its optimistic tone and brisk, lilted melody. A protagonist's mea culpa for a relationship gone wrong, she declares to wait patiently for her lover's inevitable return. The song was compared to the work of Aretha Franklin for its [...] "huge vocal sound on the chorus, rolling piano and boxy snare," [...] while Tom Townshend of MSN Music described its brass section as a Rolling Stones-esque [...] "barroom gospel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Light {{received}} largely favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post described the record as an [...] "instant mood-lifter," [...] writing that [...] "There’s not a lethargic moment here [...] the band’s exuberance is barely containable." [...] Stephen Thompson of NPR felt In Light reflected [...] " [...] that knockabout, anything-goes vibe, {{just in time}} for the season that suits it best." [...] Devon Maloney of The Phoenix called the record [...] "an impressive step forward — it seriously contends for the title of this summer's go-to indie-pop record." [...] Allmusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> called In Light an [...] "accomplished, ambitious debut," [...] while comparing it to [...] "the peppy pseudo-Afro pop of Vampire Weekend and the percussive, improv-heavy dance rock of Local Natives." [...] Ryan Reed of Paste felt the record rose above its reference points, [...] "because the songs are usually excellent [...] speaking strictly sonics, In Light is literally the brightest album I’ve heard in ages." [...] Q felt [...] "This world music/indie rock mix is countered by the affecting melancholy of their quieter moments," [...] while Ari Lipsitz of CMJ opined that Givers were a [...] "seriously cute band that writes seriously catchy love songs that you will probably seriously enjoy — if you're all right with that ebullience thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic editor <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> {{stated that}} Goulding [...] "dresses up her {{powerful}} lark {{of a voice}} with a delicately laced veil of digital effects." [...] He continued, [...] "An ambitious work by an artist intent on developing her total sound, Halcyon finds Goulding poised {{at the edge of}} artistic and career possibilities." [...] In a review for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes expressed, [...] "If the songwriting doesn't quite measure up to U.K. art-pop divas like Kate Bush, the hooks always go to town, and her voice—Dolly Parton-dazzling in the upper register—mates gorgeously with electronics". PopMatters' Geoff Nelson concluded, [...] "On Halcyon Goulding amplifies her music genealogy, both who she is and who she's been, in what is an often successful attempt to transition to iconic stardom [...] The outcome is a bit flawed and a very loud version of her biggest and smallest self." [...] USA Todays Jerry Shriver viewed that on Halcyon, Goulding [...] "presents an edgier, more aggressive showcase for her swooping, stratosphere-piercing vibrato", while noting that [...] "er tone, balanced between girlish and womanly, is appealing, as is her clear intent to be an Artist. One wishes, however, she'd frolic in the heather now and then for contrast." [...] Despite calling the album a [...] "well-crafted, stylish piece of work", Andy Gill of The Independent felt that [...] "it's hard to love songs that try to hide." [...] The Guardians Rebecca Nicholson opined that the album [...] "isn't nearly as wet as its predecessor", but added that [...] "the main flaw of Halcyon is that it occasionally feels a bit too much—and that's something Goulding, perennially painted as the timid type, may not be so sad about." [...] Hayley Avron of the NME critiqued, [...] "Mainly, Halcyon sees Goulding's quirky-as-usual vocals lazily spliced into factory-standard chart dance. On 'Joy' and 'I Know You Care' her artistry is briefly allowed to breathe, away from the desperate bombast of the suffocating backing tracks." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's most {{positive}} review to date came from Cameron Adams, {{writing for the}} Brisbane-based newspaper The Courier-Mail. Adams approved the band's decision {{to follow up on}} the sound of their commercially successful debut album, Conditions, marking the album as [...] "faithful" [...] in his one-word description of the album. Adams noted [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together" [...] as the album's two potential hits, describing them as [...] "better than 90-per-cent of what's in the charts and on the radio now." [...] While he felt that the album [...] "bit over-thought in parts - like they needed help to do what once came naturally to get the blasted record out", he concluded his review by stating that Thick as Thieves was [...] "undeniably strong, if lacking risks - this is everything The Temper Trap do very well indeed." [...] Also approving of the reversion to the sound of Conditions was Jules LeFevre of Australian music magazine website FasterLouder, who noted, [...] "at first glance [...] appears to be an attempt to reclaim the spotlight on the festival stages, but on closer inspection reveals a sturdy core." [...] LeFevre praised Mandagi's falsetto vocals as the album's strongest element, claiming it to be the band's [...] "edge", on top of the [...] "colossal, anthemic choruses, sky high hooks, [...] guitar lines that push and push and push and explode." [...] LeFevre continued by praising the largely guitar-driven composition of the record, in spite of Lorenzo Sillitto's exit, and commented positively on the [...] "simpler, gritter, more blues and classic rock driven" [...] guitars helmed by Joseph Greer. Contrasting to this, however, is LeFevre's sharp criticism of the album's lyricism, describing them as [...] "cringe-worthy", and disapproving of songs such as [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together", although stating that the lyrics felt [...] "comfortable" [...] in context of the music itself. <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar</b> of the American-based online music guide AllMusic noted that the departure of Sillitto and Greer's move into the role as lead guitarist had virtually no effect on the band's music. In writing a positive review for AllMusic, he also praised Mandagi's vocals as a [...] "powerful and emotive" [...] presence on the album, commenting on the [...] "scintillating" [...] combination of his vocals and the album's [...] "thick wave of electric guitars, pulsing synths, and drums", comparing the sound to the music of Cee Lo Green and The Killers. Collar additionally described Thick as Thieves as [...] "a heartfelt love letter to The Temper Trap's fans who have stuck with them since Conditions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Living for the Weekend {{garnered}} mixed reviews, with critics {{noticing the}} lack of personality and direction. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy called the album [...] "a compilation of perfectly serviceable pop" [...] but felt that [...] "as a group, the Saturdays sound lost." [...] Elliot Robinson of So So Gay wrote that the record [...] "occasionally perpetuate the more faceless dance pop its predecessor unfortunately introduced to the girls' sound" [...] and that it [...] "does feel rather calculated at times with some generic filler tracks." [...] However, he called it [...] "an enjoyable romp" [...] and [...] "an improvement over previous effort On Your Radar." [...] Christopher Toh of Today wrote that [...] "it’s not the best {{album of the year}} by any means, but it is great as background music for your weekend party, so in that sense, it works." [...] Another common criticism among reviewers was the difference in quality between the album's first and second half. Jon O'Brien of omg! noticed that [...] "like its predecessor, [...] {{the latter part of the}} record is virtually indistinguishable thanks to an over-reliance on the hands-in-the-air dance-pop that has dominated the charts since the rise of David Guetta et al" [...] and stated that [...] "if the Sats could have sustained the momentum of its opening half, then Living For The Weekend could have been a late contender for pop album of the year." [...] The reviewer of the Shields Gazette noticed the same problem, but found the second half [...] "inconsequential as opposed to horrid," [...] saying that [...] "it lacks personality in places, but it’s a better effort than many would expect from a group commonly [...] likened to a third-rate Girls Aloud." [...] Matthew Horton of Virgin Media noted that the album contains the band's [...] "best run of singles [...] ever," [...] but otherwise felt that it [...] "drags" [...] and that it is [...] "at least two tracks too long." [...] Angus Quinn of York Vision felt the same way, stating that the record [...] "really struggles once you're past the singles" [...] and that [...] "the album tracks could fit into almost anyone else's repertoire." [...] Patrick Gough of the Bournemouth Daily Echo found that [...] "the quality is strong and consistent for the first seven tracks, but after last year's single 30 Days, the songs become more generic" [...] and felt that [...] "the Saturdays have bags of charm and style but their identity gets a little lost towards the end of this album." [...] Darryl Sterdan of the Canadian Winnipeg Sun gave a negative review, describing the album as [...] "instantly forgettable pop, R and dance piffle about boys" [...] and saying that the band [...] " [...] best be living for the weekend, since that’s about as long as this will be on anybody’s playlist." [...] A more favorable review came from AllMusic's <b>Matt</b> <b>Collar,</b> who noticed that Living for the Weekend [...] "attempts to build upon the group's heightened profile with a bevy of infectious pop, soul, and electronic dance-club cuts that showcase the girls’ resonant vocal chops" [...] and described it as [...] "an album of delicious pop" [...] that [...] "goes a long way toward helping the Saturdays achieve their dreams of worldwide diva domination."
