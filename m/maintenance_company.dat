5|$|Under the April 1942 organization, each {{infantry}} battalion had an anti-tank platoon {{with four}} 37mm guns (1/4 ton trucks, {{better known as}} jeeps, were authorized as prime movers) and each regiment an anti-tank company with twelve (towed by 3/4 ton trucks). Each of the four divisional artillery battalions possessed six anti-tank guns, the combat engineering battalion had nine pieces (towed by M2 halftracks); in addition, the division's headquarters company had four (towed by 3/4ton trucks) and the divisional <b>maintenance</b> <b>company</b> two.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of 9mm ammunition for the Owen Guns was discovered, apparently because the ammunition {{was in the}} LST {{that had not been}} completely unloaded. An emergency airdrop was requested at 10:30. In Port Moresby, the 1st Air <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Company</b> prepared 30 parachutes, each attached to two boxes containing 2,560 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a total of 153,600 rounds. This was loaded onto three USAAF B-24 Liberator bombers at Wards Airfield that took off at 16:55. They arrived over the Finschhafen area after dark at 19:15, where a drop zone in a Kunai patch was marked by men holding hand torches. Of the 115,000 rounds that were dropped, about 112,000 were recovered.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the DISCOM {{consisted}} of a Headquarters Company, a Division Materiel Management Center, a Division Data Center, the 15th Medical Battalion, 15th Adjutant General Battalion, 15th Finance Company, 15th Supply and Transport Battalion, 27th Maintenance Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company. In October 1984, the 1st and 2nd Forward Support Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached to the unit. The following year saw the Army of Excellence Reorganization (AOE) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions (maintenance, medical, and supply and transport) into the 4th Main Support Battalion. The AOE reorganization also added the 493rd Transportation Company (Aircraft Maintenance) to the Division Support Command. The forward and main support battalions, along with the Aviation <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Company,</b> were redesignated in 1987, becoming the 15th and 115th Forward Support Battalions, 27th Main Support Battalion, and 227th Transportation Company (Aviation Maintenance).|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 1937, Captain Félix Verdeja, {{commanding}} the <b>maintenance</b> <b>company</b> of the Nationalist Batallón de Carros de Combate ("Tank Battalion"), began to privately {{develop a new}} light tank. His position, with direct access to Panzer Is and T-26s, gave Verdeja direct evidence of the shortcomings of current tank models in terms of combat ability and maintenance issues. Verdeja established a future tank requiring the 45millimetre (1.77in) gun fitted in the T-26; two coaxial light machine guns; a low profile, all-around armor greater than 15millimetres (0.6in), with a turret mantlet plate of at least 30millimetres (1.2in); road speed of , combat range of , and a capable suspension and new track system. This latter requirement was based on experiences with existing light tanks, which frequently lost their tracks in combat. These requirements and solutions were presented in October 1938 to Colonel Díaz de la Lastra, commanding officer of the Agrupación de Carros de Combate. Although the project was approved, the program had to use scrap to build the first prototype {{due to a lack}} of resources and money. Despite early obstacles, including criticism from von Thoma, the program continued and Verdeja was awarded a warehouse in Zaragoza to continue with the construction of the prototype.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of working capital {{management}} on profitability in industrial <b>maintenance</b> service <b>companies.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Analytical modeling has been used as the research method. Finnish industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>companies</b> have been analyzed on the basis of their financial statements. Findings – We reveal a significant negative correlation between the cycle times of operational working capital and the return on investment of industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>companies.</b> Light fixed assets and good profitability of the maintenance sector emphasize the importance of working capital management. Large <b>maintenance</b> service <b>companies</b> seem to achieve competitive advantage over small and medium sized maintenance service providers through both fixed assets- and working capital-related economies of scale, and through the fact that large maintenance service providers often focus on providing services mostly for their host companies. Research limitations – The scarcity of large enterprises in the market in question precludes the use of a more extensive sample in the analysis. Practical implications – In the industrial maintenance service business, more attention should be paid to active management of working capital. We can conclude that this holds true especially in large industrial maintenance service enterprises. Originality/value – We contribute to the unexplored perspective of industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>companies.</b> Previous studies of industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>companies</b> have not addressed working capital management, which gains more and more attention under the volatile economic circumstances of the present day.

25|$|After {{the ambush}} of the 507th <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Company</b> during the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March, {{the bodies of}} several U.S. {{soldiers}} {{who had been killed}} in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. Donald Walters, no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the Third Geneva Convention. Sergeant Walters was initially reported to {{have been killed in the}} ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition. However, an eyewitness later reported that he had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured, and he was posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War Medal in 2004. It was alleged in the authorized biography of Pfc. Jessica Lynch that she was raped by her captors after her capture, based on medical reports and the pattern of her injuries, though this is not supported by Ms Lynch. Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, who later helped American forces rescue Lynch, stated that he saw an Iraqi Colonel slap Lynch while she was in her hospital bed. The staff at the hospital where Lynch was held later denied both stories, saying that Lynch was well cared for. While Lynch suffers from amnesia due to her injuries, Lynch herself has denied any mistreatment whilst in captivity.|$|E
25|$|Private {{first class}} Jessica Lynch of the 507th <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Company</b> was seriously injured and {{captured}} after her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces during the Battle of Nasiriyah.

Launching from the recently captured airfield at Talil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from 1st and 2nd battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from DEVGRU along with Para Rescue Jumpers and Combat Controllers from the 24th Special Tactics Squadron conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw {{attention away from the}} hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of AGMS Pandur forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks whilst the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.|$|E
