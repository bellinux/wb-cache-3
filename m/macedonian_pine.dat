5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), black pine (P.nigra), and <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E
5|$|Suillus sibiricus {{has been}} {{recorded}} in parts of Europe, North America and Siberia. The fungus forms strict ectomycorrhizal associations with pines of the subgenus Strobus. These include Swiss pine (Pinus cembra) in the Alps and Tatras of central Europe, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (P.peuce) in the Balkans, western white pine (P.monticola) and limber pine (P.flexilis) in the Pacific Northwest of North America, P.banksiana in Quebec, Canada, and Siberian pine (P.sibirica) and Siberian dwarf pine (P.pumila) in Siberia and the Russian Far East. The range of the fungus is hence limited by {{the distribution of the}} host tree. S.sibiricus has also been shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizae with the Himalayan species P.wallichiana in pure culture conditions in the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The {{species with}} highest {{conservation}} importance is Suillus sibiricus which in Europe grows {{only in the}} forests of <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, and in the forests of Swiss pine in the Alps. The number of edible mushrooms is 38, including Agaricus augustus, mosaic puffball (Handkea utriformis), peppery milk-cap (Lactifluus piperatus), weeping milk cap (Lactifluus volemus), charcoal burner (Russula cyanoxantha), Russula grisea and Russula olivacea.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{precious}} parts of Pirin are designated reserves. [...] "Bayuvi Dupki - Djinjiritsa" [...] is a biosphere reserve {{under the auspices}} of UNESCO, where unique formations of white and <b>Macedonian</b> and Bosnian <b>pine</b> trees are to be found, together with more than 27 Bulgarian and 43 Balkan relict species.|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} fungi species in the park is 306. They are {{classified}} into 3 classes, 26 orders, 54 families and 140 genera. The most common order are Agaricales with 109 species and the most diverse families are Tricholomataceae (62 species), Russulaceae (40 species), Cortinariaceae (31 species), Coriolaceae (19 species) и Boletaceae (15 species). The species distribution by forest ecosystems is as follows: beech (69), alder (47), spruce and fir (80), and <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (36).|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} part of the range, which is also the highest one, is protected by the Pirin National Park, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Pirin is noted for its rich flora and fauna, {{as well as for the}} presence of a number of relict species. Much of the area is forested, with some of the best preserved conifer woods in Bulgaria, holding important populations of the Balkan endemic species <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine,</b> Bosnian pine and Bulgarian fir. Animals include many species of high conservation value, such as brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer, chamois, etc.|$|E
25|$|There are 35 {{tree species}} in the park, which is 32% of the 109 tree species found in Bulgaria. Coniferous woods form 68.3% of the forests and {{deciduous}} woods make up the other 31.7%. The distribution by species is as follows: European beach – 21.6%, dwarf mountain pine – 17.4%, Norway spruce – 16.7%, Scots pine – 14.6%, silver fir and Bulgarian fir – 12.7%, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> – 6.9%, sessile oak and Rila oak – 4.6%, silver birch – 1.5%, common aspen – 1.3%, grey alder – 1.1%, other – 1.6%. The {{average age of the}} woods is 99 years; centenary forests form 53.7% of the total forest mass.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} cover 70% of the park's territory. The lowest zones (800–1500m) are {{occupied with}} beech forests consisting primarily of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), riparian deciduous forests dominated by grey alder (Alnus incana) and mixed forests of beech, common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and hop hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia). Above these ecosystems are located xerothermic oak forests, {{dominated by the}} local endemic Rila oak (Quercus protoroburoides) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea), whose upper zones are covered by European beech, European silver fir (Abies alba) and Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis). Coniferous ecosystems occupy altitudes between 1300 and 2200m and consist of Norway spruce (Picea abies), <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus peuce), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and firs. Secondary ecosystems that replace primeval forests cover 5% of the park consist mainly of common aspen (Populus tremula), silver birch (Betula pendula) and common hazel (Corylus avellana) replacing spruce and pine forests.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vegetation}} of Pirin is vertically {{divided into}} five distinct elevation zones: Mediterranean, deciduous, coniferous, that combined form {{the tree line}} reaching approximately altitude of 2,000m, shrubs forming the subalpine line up to 2,500m and alpine meadows, {{also known as the}} alpine line above 2,500m. The Mediterranean zone is dominated, among other, by pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens) and Oriental Hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis), the deciduous zone by European oak (Quercus robur) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica), and the coniferous— by <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus peuce), Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The subalpine line is mainly covered with dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and common juniper (Juniperus communis). The alpine line is covered with grass, moss, lichen and abundant in bilberries and rare flowers such as the edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum). Pirin is home to Bulgaria's oldest tree, the 1300–year Baikushev's pine— a Bosnian pine that is a contemporary of the foundation of the Bulgarian state in 681 AD.|$|E
50|$|National Park of Pelister in Bitola {{is known}} for the {{presence}} of the endemic <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine,</b> as well as some 88 species of plants representing almost 30 percent of Macedonian dendroflora. The <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine</b> forests on Pelister are divided into two communities: pine forests with ferns and pine forests with junipers. The <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine,</b> as a specific conifer species, is a relict of tertiary flora, and the five-needle pine Molika, was first noted on Pelister in 1893.|$|E

50|$|Like other European and Asian white pines, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> is very {{resistant}} to {{white pine blister rust}} (Cronartium ribicola). This fungal disease was accidentally introduced from Europe into North America, {{where it has}} caused severe mortality in the American native white pines (e.g. western white pine, sugar pine, whitebark pine) in many areas. <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> is of great value for research into hybridisation and genetic modification to develop rust resistance in these species; hybrids with eastern white pine inherit some resistance.|$|E
50|$|There are 16 tree species; of {{them three}} are Balkan endemic taxa with limited areal — the Bulgarian fir (Abies borisii-regis), <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus peuce) and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii). The largest area is {{occupied}} by dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) - 59.62 km2, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus peuce) - 54.15 km2, Norway spruce (Picea abies) - 23.79 km2, European beech (Fagus sylvatica) - 10.98 km2 and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) - 8.93 km2. The Macedonian and the Bosnian pines in Pirin National Park constitute respectively 42% and 52% of their total area in Bulgaria.|$|E
50|$|C. ribicola is {{native to}} China, and was {{subsequently}} introduced to North America. Some European and Asian white pines (e.g. <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine,</b> Swiss Pine, Blue Pine) are mostly resistant to the disease, having co-evolved with the pathogen.|$|E
50|$|A part of Maja e Ropës {{mountain}} {{was declared}} a floral mountain reserve in 1955, covering {{an area of}} 25 hectares of mainly <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine,</b> pine and beech. In the same year the Kozhnjar area was declared a fauna reserve in particular to protect the chamois, covering an area of 161 hectares.|$|E
50|$|<b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> is also {{a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in parks and large gardens, giving reliable steady though not fast growth {{on a wide range}} of sites. It is very tolerant of severe winter cold, hardy down to at least -45 °C, and also of wind exposure. It is locally naturalised Punkaharju in eastern Finland.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} {{deciduous}} oaks (most prominently Quercus frainetto Ten., {{as well as}} Q. cerris L., Q. pubescens Willd. and others) dominate most of the ecoregion's forests, interspersed higher up mountainsides (above 800-1200 m) mostly with European beech and such conifers as Scots pine, Bosnian pine, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine,</b> silver fir and Norway spruce. The highest peaks support alpine tundra vegetation.|$|E
50|$|Scots pine is {{the only}} pine native to {{northern}} Europe, forming either pure forests or mixed with Norway spruce, common juniper, silver birch, European rowan, Eurasian aspen and other hardwood species. In central and southern Europe, it occurs with numerous additional species, including European black pine, mountain pine, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine,</b> and Swiss pine. In {{the eastern part of}} its range, it occurs with Siberian pine, among others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} species of {{vascular}} plants in the ecoregion are estimated at 3,000. The lower areas are covered with mixed deciduous woods, most prominently with European beech, Oriental hornbeam, European hornbeam and several oak species. The higher zones are dominated by coniferous forests — Scots pine, Bosnian pine, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine,</b> Bulgarian fir, Silver fir, Norway spruce, etc. The highest altitudes support shrubs, heath and Alpine tundra.|$|E
50|$|Bitola {{is located}} in the southwestern part of Macedonia. The Dragor River flows through the city. Bitola lies at an {{elevation}} of 615 meters above sea level, at the foot of Baba Mountain. Its magnificent Pelister mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> or pinus peuce, as well as a well-known ski resort.|$|E
50|$|The {{species with}} highest {{conservation}} importance is Suillus sibiricus which in Europe grows {{only in the}} forests of <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> in Bulgaria and the Republic of Macedonia, and in the forests of Swiss pine in the Alps.

50|$|The {{climate is}} mediterranean, having hot summers and {{generally}} warm to cool, dry winters. Furthermore, the mount {{falls within the}} Illyrian deciduous forests terrestrial ecoregion of the Palearctic Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The mount {{is also part of}} the Llogara National Park, which is noted for its rich biodiversity and vegetation. The western flank of the mount is vegetated by species such as the Bulgarian fir, Austrian pine, Bosnian pine and <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} conifer species in the Balkan Peninsula. Its durable wood is highly valued in construction, furniture production, wood-carving and cooperage. The tree is also exceptionally good at adapting to severe mountain climate conditions, which makes it a valuable species for afforestation on high terrain for protection against erosion. The local population use P. peuce resin to cure wounds, pectoral, skin and stomach diseases, varicose veins and other illnesses.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} fungi species in the park is 306. They are {{classified}} into 3 classes, 26 orders, 54 families and 140 genera.

The species distribution by forest ecosystems is as follows: beech (69), alder (47), spruce and fir (80), and <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine</b> (36).|$|E
50|$|The flora of {{the region}} is diverse and is {{characterized}} with high endemism due to the combination of southern geographic latitude and high altitude variation. The forests are host to several plants such as Beech, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine,</b> Bosnian Pine, Norway spruce, and Silver fir. The fauna is represented by 64 species of mammals, such as the brown bear, gray wolf, chamois, lynx, roe deer, wild boar, western capercaillie, golden eagle, eurasian otter and 14 species of amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|Pinus peuce (<b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine)</b> (Macedonian: Молика, Molika) is {{a species}} of pine native to the {{mountains}} of Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo, the extreme southwest of Serbia, and the extreme north of Greece, growing typically at (600-) 1,000-2,200 (-2,300) m altitude. It often reaches the alpine tree line in this area. The mature size is up to 35-40 m height, and 1.5 m trunk diameter. However, {{the height of the}} tree diminishes strongly near the upper fores limit and may even obtain shrub sizes.|$|E
50|$|Limber pine is {{susceptible}} to white pine blister rust, caused by Cronartium ribicola, a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except Arizona, where {{it has not yet}} been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. Swiss pine, <b>Macedonian</b> <b>pine),</b> which are strongly resistant to the disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{forests are}} made up mainly of Norway Spruce and Bulgarian Fir, with some <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine,</b> Scots Pine, and at the tree-line, Mountain Pine, and mixed {{deciduous}} forest at lower altitudes, mainly beech, birch, aspen and alder. Regarding the herbaceous plants, well established populations of Veratrum album {{are present in the}} mountain so as other species commonly called 'lilies'. There are also Orchids as the East European green-winged orchid (Orchis morio) that grows in the higher parts. Lungworth (Pulmonaria officinalis) is another widespread herbaceous plant in Vitosha and it develops in dank sites under the shade of the forest.|$|E
50|$|Musala is {{situated}} within the Rila National Park, which is {{noted for its}} rich flora, including species such as <b>Macedonian</b> <b>Pine</b> and Bulgarian Fir in the forests on its middle slopes, and fauna; {{it is one of}} the easiest places in Europe to see the wallcreeper. All major mountain ranges of Bulgaria can be seen from the top; these include Vitosha to the northwest, Sredna Gora towards the northeast, the Balkan Mountains along most of the northern horizon behind Vitosha and Sredna Gora, the Rhodope Mountains to the southeast, Pirin to the south, Osogovo and Ruy Mountain to the west, and of course Rila.|$|E
