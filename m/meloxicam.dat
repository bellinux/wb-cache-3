25|$|Use of {{diclofenac}} {{in animals}} {{has been reported}} to have led to a sharp decline in the vulture population in the Indian subcontinent – a 95% decline by 2003 and a 99.9% decline by 2008. The mechanism is presumed to be renal failure, however toxicity may be due to direct inhibition of uric acid secretion in vultures. Vultures eat the carcasses of livestock that have been administered veterinary diclofenac, and are poisoned by the accumulated chemical, as vultures do not have a particular enzyme to break down diclofenac. At a meeting of the National Wildlife Board in March 2005, the Government of India announced it intended to phase out the veterinary use of diclofenac. <b>Meloxicam</b> is a safer candidate to replace use of diclofenac. It is more expensive than diclofenac, but the price is coming down as more drug companies begin to manufacture it.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{significant}} thiazoles include mainly dyes and fungicides. [...] Thifluzamide, Tricyclazole, and Thiabendazole are marketed {{for control}} of various agricultural pests. Another widely used thiazole derivative is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug <b>Meloxicam.</b> The following anthroquinone dyes contain benzothiazole subunits: Algol Yellow 8 (CAS# [...] ), Algol Yellow GC (CAS# [...] ), Indanthren Rubine B (CAS# [...] ), Indanthren Blue CLG (CAS# , and Indanthren Blue CLB (CAS#). These thiazole dye are used for dyeing cotton.|$|E
2500|$|Non-surgical {{intervention}} is usually via a suitable {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) which doubles as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller. Typical NSAIDs used for hip dysplasia include carprofen and <b>meloxicam</b> (often sold as Rimadyl and Metacam respectively), both used to treat arthritis resulting from dysplasia, although other NSAIDs such as [...] tepoxalin (Zubrin) and prednoleucotropin ("PLT", a combination of cinchophen and prednisolone) are sometimes tried. NSAIDs vary dramatically between species as to effect: a safe NSAID in one species may be unsafe in another. It is important to follow veterinary advice.|$|E
50|$|In dogs, the {{absorption}} of <b>meloxicam</b> from the stomach is not affected {{by the presence of}} food, with the peak concentration (Cmax) of <b>meloxicam</b> occurring in the blood 7-8 hours after administration. The half-life of <b>meloxicam</b> is approximately 24 hours in dogs.|$|E
50|$|The {{existing}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{differ in}} their relative specificities for COX-2 and COX-1; while aspirin and ibuprofen inhibit COX-2 and COX-1 enzymes, other NSAIDs appear to have partial COX-2 specificity, particularly <b>meloxicam</b> (Mobic). Aspirin is ≈170-fold more potent in inhibiting COX-1 than COX-2. Studies of <b>meloxicam</b> 7.5 mg per day for 23 days find a level of gastric injury {{similar to that of}} a placebo, and for <b>meloxicam</b> 15 mg per day a level of injury lower than that of other NSAIDs; however, in clinical practice <b>meloxicam</b> can still cause some ulcer complications.|$|E
5000|$|On October 27, 2010, the FDA {{issued a}} boxed warning {{regarding}} the use of Metacam (<b>meloxicam)</b> oral suspension in cats in the United States. <b>Meloxicam</b> is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is approved in the U.S. for a single post-operative injection in cats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) with analgesic and fever reducer effects. It is {{a derivative}} of oxicam, {{closely related to}} piroxicam, and falls in the enolic acid group of NSAIDs. It was developed by Boehringer-Ingelheim. <b>Meloxicam</b> starts to relieve pain about 30-60 minutes after administration.|$|E
50|$|A pooled {{analysis}} of randomized, controlled studies of <b>meloxicam</b> therapy {{of up to}} 60 days duration found that <b>meloxicam</b> {{was associated with a}} statistically significantly lower number of thromboembolic complications than the NSAID diclofenac (0.2% versus 0.8% respectively) but a similar incidence of thromboembolic events to naproxen and piroxicam.|$|E
50|$|First line {{treatments}} include Naproxen (Aleve), Celecoxib (Celebrex) <b>Meloxicam</b> (Mobic), Piroxicam (Feldene), Indomethacin (Indocin), Diclofenac (Voltaren).|$|E
5000|$|Since 2003, <b>meloxicam</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} in the U.S. for use in dogs {{for the management of}} pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis, as an oral (liquid) formulation of <b>meloxicam.</b> The January 2005, the product insert added a warning in bold-face type: [...] "Do not use in cats." [...] An injectable formulation for use in dogs was approved by the FDA in November 2003.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{as an alternative to}} Diclofenac by the RSPB to prevent deaths of vultures.|$|E
50|$|As of June 2008, <b>meloxicam</b> is {{registered}} for long-term use in cats in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, <b>meloxicam</b> is {{approved}} for use only in canines, whereas (due to concerns about liver damage) it carries warnings against {{its use in}} cats except for one-time use during surgery. [...] In spite of these warnings, <b>meloxicam</b> is frequently prescribed [...] "off-label" [...] for non-canine animals including cats and livestock species. [...] In other countries, for example The European Union (EU), there is a label claim for use in cats.|$|E
50|$|A {{peer-reviewed journal}} article cites feline {{overdose}} of NSAIDs, including <b>meloxicam,</b> {{as being a}} cause of severe kidney damage in cats.|$|E
50|$|In the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), {{very little}} <b>meloxicam</b> is {{absorbed into the}} blood after oral {{administration}} (that is, it has poor bioavailability).|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{findings}} on diclofenac, {{the drug was}} banned for veterinary use in India on March 11, 2006; Nepal followed suit in August, 2006, and Pakistan shortly thereafter. A replacement drug was quickly developed and proposed after tests on vultures in captivity: <b>meloxicam.</b> <b>Meloxicam</b> affects cattle {{the same way as}} diclofenac, but is harmless for vultures. Diclofenac for human use was still being diverted into veterinary uses through black markets in certain parts of India as of 2009.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> {{is used in}} {{veterinary}} medicine, {{most commonly}} in dogs and cats, but also sees off-label use in other animals such as cattle and exotics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> use {{can result}} in {{gastrointestinal}} toxicity and bleeding, headaches, rash, and very dark or black stool (a sign of intestinal bleeding). Like other NSAIDs, its use is {{associated with an increased}} risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. It has fewer gastrointestinal side effects than diclofenac, piroxicam, naproxen, and perhaps all other NSAIDs which are not COX-2 selective. Although <b>meloxicam</b> inhibits formation of thromboxane A, it does not appear to do so at levels that would interfere with platelet function.|$|E

50|$|Diclofenac causes {{kidney failure}} in {{several species of}} vultures. In March 2006 the Indian Government {{announced}} its support for {{a ban on the}} veterinary use of diclofenac. Another NSAID, <b>meloxicam,</b> {{has been found to be}} harmless to vultures and should prove to be an acceptable substitute for diclofenac. When <b>meloxicam</b> production is increased it is hoped that it will be as cheap as diclofenac. As of August 2011 the ban for veterinary use for approximately a year did not prevent diclofenac use across India. Small numbers of birds have bred across peninsular India, in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.|$|E
50|$|In October 2004, a {{formulation}} {{for use in}} cats {{was approved}} for use prior to surgery only. This is an injectable <b>meloxicam,</b> indicated for as a single, one-time dose only, with specific and repeated warnings not to administer a second dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> blocks {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX), {{the enzyme}} responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2—the {{first step in}} the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are mediators of inflammation.Meloxicam has been shown, especially at its low therapeutic doses, selectively to inhibit COX-2 over COX-1.|$|E

5000|$|Several NSAIDs {{have been}} found to be harmful to {{scavenging}} birds. Diclofenac, carprofen, flunixin, ibuprofen and phenylbutazone were associated with mortality. <b>Meloxicam</b> has thus far been found to be [...] "Vulture-Safe" [...] and its use in veterinary treatment of livestock is being encouraged.|$|E
50|$|Oxicam is a {{class of}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) that bind closely to plasma proteins. Most oxicams are unselective inhibitors of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The exception is <b>meloxicam</b> with a slight (10:1) preference for COX-2, which, however, is only clinically relevant at low doses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> (another NSAID) {{has been}} found to be {{harmless}} to vultures and should prove an acceptable alternative to diclofenac. The Government of India banned diclofenac, but over a year later, in 2007, it continued to be sold and remains a problem in other parts of the world.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{consists}} of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like carprofen and <b>meloxicam),</b> or chronic pain medications, like tramadol. Serious cases may require {{surgery to remove}} the troublesome disk contents. A dog may need {{the aid of a}} cart to get around if paralysis occurs.|$|E
50|$|Currently, {{only the}} Cambodia and Burma populations {{are thought to}} be viable though those populations are still very small (low hundreds). It has been {{suggested}} that <b>Meloxicam</b> (another NSAID) as a veterinary substitute that is harmless to vultures would help in the recovery. Campaigns to ban the use of diclofenac in veterinary practice have been underway in several South Asian countries.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, {{where the}} product has been {{available}} since the early 1990s, it is licensed for other anti-inflammatory benefits including relief from both acute and chronic pain in dogs. In June 2007, an oral version of <b>meloxicam</b> was licensed for the long-term relief of pain in cats.Meloxicam is also licenced for use in horses, to relieve the pain associated with musculoskeletal disorders.|$|E
50|$|Carprofen {{should not}} be {{administered}} concurrently with steroids, as this can cause ulcers in the stomach. Dogs should be taken off carprofen for three full days before ingesting a steroid (such as prednisolone). Carprofen {{should not be}} given {{at the same time}} with other types of medications such as other NSAIDs (aspirin, etodolac, deracoxib, <b>meloxicam,</b> tepoxalin) or steroids such as dexamethasone, triamcinolone, cortisone or prednisone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Meloxicam</b> {{concentrations}} in synovial fluid range from 40% to 50% {{of those in}} plasma. The free fraction in synovial fluid is 2.5 times higher than in plasma, due to the lower albumin content in synovial fluid as compared to plasma. The significance of this penetration is unknown, but it {{may account for the}} fact that it performs exceptionally well in treatment of arthritis in animal models.|$|E
50|$|Commercial {{significant}} thiazoles include mainly dyes and fungicides. Thifluzamide, Tricyclazole, and Thiabendazole are marketed {{for control}} of various agricultural pests. Another widely used thiazole derivative is the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug <b>Meloxicam.</b> The following anthroquinone dyes contain benzothiazole subunits: Algol Yellow 8 (CAS# 6451-12-3), Algol Yellow GC (CAS# 129-09-9), Indanthren Rubine B (CAS# 6371-49-9), Indanthren Blue CLG (CAS# 6371-50-2, and Indanthren Blue CLB (CAS#6492-78-0). These thiazole dye are used for dyeing cotton.|$|E
50|$|Combat Lifesavers are not, however, trained or {{permitted}} to perform (among other things) laryngoscopy, single lumen tracheal intubation {{or any kind}} of surgery (such as emergency cricothyrotomy), since all involve a high risk of failure and serious additional injury to the patient when performed by a non-expert. Likewise, CLSs are not {{permitted to}} carry or dispense any medication (aside from the acetaminophen, <b>meloxicam</b> and moxifloxacin pills carried in every soldier's Combat Pill Pack) without specific orders from their Battalion Surgeon.|$|E
50|$|The {{slender-billed}} vulture is {{a protected}} species {{listed on the}} appendix II list of CITES, because its numbers have declined rapidly. Its decline {{is largely due to}} the use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac in working farm animals. Diclofenac is poisonous to vultures, causing kidney failure, and is being replaced by <b>meloxicam</b> (another NSAID), which is not toxic to vultures. The retail sale of Diclofenac is banned by law in India; however, Diclofenac is still acquired illegally and applied to livestock.|$|E
50|$|Non-surgical {{intervention}} is usually via a suitable {{non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug}} (NSAID) which doubles as an anti-inflammatory and painkiller.
