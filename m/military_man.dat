5|$|As a <b>military</b> <b>man,</b> al-Mu'tasim's outlook was utilitarian, and his {{intellectual}} pursuits {{could not be}} {{compared with those of}} al-Ma'mun or his successor al-Wathiq, but he continued his brother's policy of promoting writers and scholars. Baghdad remained a major centre of learning throughout his reign. Among the notable scholars active during his reign were the astronomers Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi and Ahmad al-Farghani, the polymath al-Jahiz, and the distinguished Arab mathematician and philosopher al-Kindi, who dedicated his work On First Philosophy to his patron al-Mu'tasim.|$|E

Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who {{liked the fact that}} as a naval officer Bradbury was both a <b>military</b> <b>man</b> and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E

5|$|In 1918, Molotov {{was sent}} to Ukraine {{to take part in}} the civil war then {{breaking}} out. Since he was not a <b>military</b> <b>man,</b> he took no part in the fighting. In 1920, he became secretary to the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Bolshevik Party. Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the Central Committee and Orgburo, and putting him in charge of the party secretariat. He was voted in as a non-voting member of the Politburo in 1921, and held the office of Responsible Secretary and also married Soviet politician Polina Zhemchuzhina.|$|E
5|$|Tecumseh, not {{yet ready}} to oppose the United States by force, was away {{recruiting}} allies when Harrison's army arrived. Tenskwatawa, a spiritual leader but not a <b>military</b> <b>man,</b> was in charge. Harrison camped near Prophetstown on November 6 and arranged to meet with Tenskwatawa the following day. Early the next morning, however, warriors from Prophetstown attacked Harrison's army. Although the outnumbered attackers took Harrison's army by surprise, Harrison and his men stood their ground for more than two hours. The Native Americans were ultimately repulsed when their ammunition ran low. After the battle, they abandoned Prophetstown and Harrison's men burned it to the ground, destroying the food supplies stored for the winter. The soldiers returned to their homes.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands {{was a world}} {{military}} and commercial power by 1625, competing in the Caribbean with the English. The Dutch wanted to establish a military stronghold in the area, and dispatched Captain Boudewijn Hendricksz (also known as Boudoyno Henrico or Balduino Enrico) to capture Puerto Rico. On September 24, 1625, Enrico arrived at the coast of San Juan with 17 ships and 2,000 men. Enrico {{sent a message to}} the governor of Puerto Rico, Juan de Haros, ordering him to surrender the island. De Haros refused; he was an experienced <b>military</b> <b>man</b> and expected an attack in the section known as Boqueron. He therefore had that area fortified. However, the Dutch took another route and landed in La Puntilla.|$|E

5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a <b>military</b> <b>man</b> {{in the middle of a}} desert, by giving them a can of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman automatically running forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's living rooms. The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The refugee plot was used due to the producers being unable to film in Haiti. Colonel Wharton was portrayed by Daniel Benzali, who later went on to star in the ABC series Murder One. While the producers agreed {{that he did not}} look like a <b>military</b> <b>man,</b> they felt he had the quality they were looking for in the role. For the sequence where a man emerges from Scully's hand and strangles her, a male actor pushed his gelatine covered fingers through a mechanical hand. The episode started production in late December 1994, and after a Christmas break was completed in January 1995. The Haitian refugee camp was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard. Sump pumps had to be used on the graveyard of the episode's ending as it was shot during a particularly rainy January.|$|E
