25|$|A {{music video}} was {{released}} for the song, directed by Shuichi Banba. It features scenes of Ochi in a Western-style prairie, standing in wooden farming structures {{and next to}} a windpump. The music video also features an old man dressed in Western clothing, and {{a little girl who}} resembles Ochi. Many scenes depict the old <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the little girl, who is replaced by the fully-grown Ochi. The man gives some seeds to the little girl, who plants them. In the final scenes of the video, one of the seeds sprout into a red wildflower.|$|E
25|$|In the video, Norwood {{plays an}} all-seeing, all-knowing narrator, who gives the central male {{character}} pause with her wicked glances that {{let him know}} she's watching his every move. The pursuit starts with the singer performing the first lines of her song {{in the back of}} a cruising bus, while observing her boarding <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> a female, both discussing vehemently with each other. She's constantly moving and dancing, before the scene shifts to a scaffolding in front of a fenced building, where she performs the chorus in dusty backgrounds. The next scene shows her standing under a traffic light at a plied crossing, wearing a grey outfit and big glasses, wherefrom she enters a near barber shop and performs afresh in a hairdresser chair. At the same time the camera shows her man flirting with two girls. The video ends with a backflash on all locations Norwood was seen at, also catching the daytime in front of the sinking sun.|$|E

A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with the <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him. The man {{told him it was}} [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the development}} of Super Mario Sunshine with producer Takashi Tezuka and directors Yoshiaki Koizumi and Kenta Usui, it was mentioned that the game's development began with the idea of gameplay involving a water pump. However, at first the developers thought that the world was too daringly out of character with Mario. Therefore, they tried using a man-type character, but thought this was too odd and that [...] "if there was a <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Mario, {{there is a sense of}} incongruity." [...] There were ten candidates for possible water nozzles, and FLUDD was chosen because of fitting in the game's setting, despite it not being one of the favorites. They also stated that several Yoshi features were omitted, such as Yoshi vomiting water fed to him.|$|E
500|$|For {{the landing}} each man carried a {{rucksack}} weighing [...] containing extra ammunition, for the Brens, mortars, Vickers K guns and PIATs. This {{was on top}} of their own personal weapon and ammunition. Unusually each man chose whether to would wear a steel helmet or the Commando green beret. No. 4 Commando were in the second wave and landed behind the initial assault battalion, from the East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 3rd Infantry Division. Captain Porteous described how their dead and wounded were [...] "just swilling around in the water." [...] Captain McDougal later wrote, [...] "as we were coming ashore the assault troops were committing suicide by trying to dig in on the beach. In passing I kicked the nearest man telling him to keep going. The man was dead. So was the <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him and a third was seriously wounded by machine gun fire." [...] The Commandos followed their drills and cleared the beach as quickly as possible. Once clear they headed for their assembly area, which was also the commando medical post. Leaving their rucksacks behind, they set off along the Lion sur Mer road towards their objectives.|$|E
500|$|Elliott was {{admitted}} to the 1st Australian General Hospital in Heliopolis on 7 May 1915, was discharged on 26 May, and rejoined the 7th Battalion at Anzac on 5 June. On 8 July he was in his headquarters behind Steele's Post when he received word that the Turks were in an Australian tunnel near the German Officers' Trench. Characteristically, he went forward in person to ascertain the situation, entering the tunnel with two men. Some [...] from the end there was a flash in his face, and the man behind him was shot. Elliott drew his pistol and barricaded the tunnel with sand bags, refusing help for fear that anyone else coming forward might also be hit. The tunnel was blocked off, and sealed with an explosion. On 8 August 1915, the 7th Battalion moved into positions captured the previous day in the Battle of Lone Pine, and he took over responsibility for the defence of the entire position. He led his men from the front trenches, steadying them in an uncertain situation. They fought off a series of Turkish counterattacks, winning four Victoria Crosses in the process. In the fighting, a <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him was shot dead, splashing him from head to foot with blood and brains, but he was not decorated for the battle despite inspirational leadership. Apparently his name, originally {{at the top of the}} recommendations for decorations, had been struck off the list. On 28 August, Elliott was evacuated to England towards the end of August with pleurisy, and [...] did not rejoin the 7th Battalion until 7 November. On 18 December, one day before the evacuation of Anzac, he sprained his ankle and was evacuated ahead of his troops. He was mentioned in despatches on 28 January 1916.|$|E

500|$|As {{the game}} began Gordon-Cumming {{discussed}} the tapestry with Wilson, commenting {{that the different}} colours of the cloth {{made it difficult to}} see the counters; Gordon-Cumming put a piece of white paper in front of him on which to place his now highly-visible stake. Although many of the inexperienced party were playing for small stakes, Gordon-Cumming was betting between £5 and £25 for a coup; he played the [...] system of betting, in which if he won a hand with a £5 stake, he would add his winnings to the stake, together with another £5, as the stake for the next hand. Soon after play began Stanley Wilson thought he saw Gordon-Cumming add two red £5 counters onto his stake after the hand had finished, but before the stake had been paid—a method of cheating known in casinos as after he thought that this had happened a second time, Wilson turned to Levett and, according to the later court transcripts, whispered [...] "My God, Berkeley, this is too hot!" [...] further explaining that [...] "the <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me is cheating!" [...] After Levett also watched for a few minutes, he agreed, saying to Wilson [...] "this is too hot". After half an hour the game was completed and the prince congratulated Gordon-Cumming on his play; the future king also asked Mrs Wilson for a more suitable table for the following day. Stanley Wilson instructed the butler to move a longer, three-foot wide table in and cover it with green baize. Wilson then discussed the cheating with Levett. The two men were uncertain what steps to take, and agreed that Stanley would ask his brother-in-law, Lycett Green, for his advice. Although Lycett Green thought it impossible that Gordon-Cumming would have cheated, Stanley told him that he was certain, as was Levett.|$|E
500|$|Sam Lansky of {{the website}} Idolator, noted how the video was a [...] "high-concept" [...] one further [...] "balancing out the {{low-level}} minimalism of the... track with arresting visuals and a star-studded cast". Mike Wass {{of the same}} website deemed it a recreation of the riot scene of the singer's own [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] (2011). He further described Destiny's Child reunion as [...] "heartwarming". Michelle Collins, a journalist of Vanity Fair echoed his statements, noting how the band reunion was the video's key moment. Although Anupa Mistry of Spin felt that the video for [...] "Superpower" [...] {{was one of the}} [...] "relatively mundane" [...] on the visual album, it was a feat of [...] "production value and styling". Kathy Iandoli from Vice, praised the singer's overall look in the clip. MuuMuse's [...] Bradley Stern felt the clip was one of the singer's [...] "most artistic moment", praising her [...] "ridiculously sexy stealth superhero outfit". He interpreted the wall of police officers as critics, political statements and life obstacles and concluded that the last image where the singer is seen holding hands with the <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her is a [...] "lasting" [...] one. The Fader writer Michael Zelenko said that the clip resembled a short movie with Beyoncé as [...] "an Occupy-style protest heroine leading a ragtag gang". Listing it as the fifth best video on the album, Melinda Newman of HitFix elaborated how the video managed to transform the [...] "simple love ballad into a political statement", furthering how it added meaning to its lyrics. rent DiCrescenzo of the magazine Time Out named it the sixth best on the album. Trent Wolbe of The Verge criticized Åkerlund's work on the album, feeling that his contributions [...] "feel like boring opulence porn", something he found on [...] "Superpower".|$|E

2500|$|The nave of the {{basilica}} {{was covered in}} mosaics representing Old Testament events of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt across the Red Sea. [...] "The nave mosaics (which represents stories of Old Testament history and accordingly offered Christians in Rome a new 'past') are illusionistic in a colorful and impressionist manner" [...] as this scholar puts it the scene was filled with movement, emotion, and it was to inspire thinking of Rome's [...] "new" [...] past; the past of the Old Testament. As one scholar describes it: [...] "Moses strikes {{the waters of the}} Red Sea in a heroic gesture, his toga in light and dark grays and blues, but lined in black, the folds white lines, the tunic underneath light blue; the <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> him wears a deep blue toga over a gray and white tunic." [...] Another panel shows the demise of the Egyptians in the Red Sea. An observer describes the mosaic: [...] "The Egyptians, clad in blue armor with gold bands and scarlet cloaks wildly flying, drown in the greenish blue waters; the horses, white or light brown shaded with darker browns, highlighted in white, the accoutrements a bright red." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early Anglo-Saxon society {{attached}} great {{significance to}} the horse; a horse {{may have been an}} acquaintance of the god Wodan, and/or they may have been (according to Tacitus) confidants of the gods. Horses were closely associated with gods, especially Odin and Freyr. Horses {{played a central role in}} funerary practices as well as in other rituals. Horses were prominent symbols of fertility, and there were many horse fertility cults. The rituals associated with these include horse fights, burials, consumption of horse meat, and horse sacrifice. Hengist and Horsa, the mythical ancestors of the Anglo-Saxons, were associated with horses, and references to horses are found throughout Anglo-Saxon literature. Actual horse burials in England are relatively rare and [...] "may point to influence from the continent". A well-known Anglo-Saxon horse burial (from the sixth/seventh century) is Mound 17 at Sutton Hoo, a few yards from the more famous ship burial in Mound 1. A sixth-century grave near Lakenheath, Suffolk, yielded the body of a <b>man</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> that of a [...] "complete horse in harness, with a bucket of food by its head." [...] Pagan Anglo-Saxons worshipped at a variety of different sites across their landscape, some of which were apparently specially built temples and others that were natural geographical features such as sacred trees, hilltops or wells. According to place name evidence, these sites of worship were known alternately as either hearg or as wēoh. Almost no poem from before the Norman Conquest, no matter how Christian its theme, is not steeped in pagan symbolism and their integration into the new faith goes beyond the literary sources. Thus, as Lethbridge reminds us, [...] "to say, 'this is a monument erected in Christian times and therefore the symbolism on it must be Christian,' is an unrealistic approach. The rites of the older faith, now regarded as superstition, are practised all over the country today. It did not mean that people were not Christian; but that they could see a lot of sense in the old beliefs also" ...|$|E
