Linear permanent-magnet electrical motor includes outer stator, inner stator, and permanent-magnet plunger oscillateing axially between extreme {{left and right}} positions. Magnets arranged to produce centering force and allows use of only one coil of arbitrary axial length. Axial length of coil chosen to provide required efficiency and power output...|$|E
