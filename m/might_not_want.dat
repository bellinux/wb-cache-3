5|$|Although {{she writes}} under the pen name J. K. Rowling (pronounced rolling), her name, before her remarriage, was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target {{audience}} of young boys <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to read a book}} written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K (for Kathleen) as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. She calls herself Jo. Following her remarriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling and her entry in Who's Who lists her name also as Joanne Kathleen Rowling.|$|E

The people depicted in these photos <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have them appear on the Internet. Police arrest photos, considered public record in many jurisdictions, are often posted on the internet by numerous online mug shot publishing sites.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, {{after the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler, {{who had been}} imprisoned for treason, {{appointed}} Rosenberg {{as the leader of}} the National Socialist movement, a position he held until Hitler's release. Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.|$|E

25|$|In early June, {{the club}} agreed the signings of Cardiff City winger Chris Burke, Coventry City striker Marlon King (who was accused by his former club of having reneged on a verbal {{agreement}} {{to remain with}} them), Dundee United midfielder Morgaro Gomis, and PSV forward Danny Koevermans, {{all of whom were}} out of contract and thus available as free agents under the Bosman ruling. When McLeish resigned on 12 June, Burke and King had already signed pre-contract agreements, but the moves for Gomis and Koevermans had not reached that stage. The Gomis deal was completed, but Koevermans pulled out, reluctant to join a club whose future manager <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> him. Hughton's first signing was Inverness Caledonian Thistle striker Adam Rooney, also a free transfer under the Bosman ruling, soon followed by Scotland international defender Steven Caldwell, recently released by Wigan Athletic. United States international defender Jonathan Spector, who was released by West Ham United after their relegation, joined four days before the league season opened, and West Bromwich Albion's New Zealand international striker Chris Wood arrived three days later on a month's loan, later extended for a further month.|$|E
500|$|As {{the year}} 1900 began, Hanna hinted that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to run McKinley's {{re-election}} campaign, stating {{that he was}} suffering from rheumatism. [...] In spite of his statement, the senator did want to run the campaign, but McKinley (who apparently saw an opportunity to show the public that he was not Hanna's creature) was slow to ask him. [...] This was a source of great stress to Hanna, who was concerned about the campaign and his relationship with McKinley; the senator fainted in his office during the wait and may have suffered a heart attack. [...] In late May, the President announced that Hanna would run his campaign. Margaret Leech suggested that McKinley was angry at Hanna for unknown reasons, thus the President's [...] "uncharacteristic coldness". [...] Morgan, on the other hand, wrote that [...] "the president was using his usual indirect pressure and the power of silence. [...] He wanted and needed Hanna, but on his own terms." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the [...] episode [...] "A Simple Investigation", it was decided to insert the scene that Behr and Wolfe had previously created. Behr mused at the time that while Sinatra <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to portray the character, perhaps someone similar to Steve Lawrence would. Behr named the character Vic Fontaine, a combination of two names he had been planning to use for some time. It was not until some time later that Behr noticed a similarity in naming between the new character and one from the 1972 film The Godfather. But Lawrence was unavailable and the scene proved too long {{to be included in the}} episode, so once again the idea was put on hold. Behr was unsure how to write the character into the show until it became apparent that it could be included as part of the Odo/Kira Nerys relationship after Kira found out about Odo's feelings for her in the episode [...] "Children of Time". Rather than film an individual scene, he decided that an entire 1960s-era Las Vegas themed episode should be created, resulting in {{the production}} of [...] "His Way".|$|E

500|$|Though Bobby is [...] "fairly content, {{at least}} on the surface, to be alone in the world", he slowly comes to be a {{surrogate}} father for Sam and Dean. On this relationship, Beaver feels that [...] "Bobby's concerned about them both, with Dean's sense of self, but there's a sort of undercurrent of worry about Sam. Sam seems to have more of the heart of darkness about him than Dean does... I just sense that there's this ongoing watchful eye that Bobby's got on Sam." [...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it is absolutely necessary. For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be. Bobby's position is, more or less, 'if you have a family member with a drinking problem and you want to stage an intervention, you <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do it in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lovejoy's {{views on}} slavery became more extreme {{and he called}} for a {{convention}} to discuss the formation of a state Anti-Slavery Society. Many in Alton began questioning allowing Lovejoy to continue printing in their town. After an economic crisis in March 1837, Alton citizens wondered if Lovejoy's views were contributing to hard times. They felt southern states, or even St. Louis, <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do business with their town if they continued to harbor an abolitionist.|$|E

30|$|Work could thus {{be divided}} in two: {{half of the}} time people would work as paid labour, {{and half of the}} time in sharing economy and {{voluntary}} work. Enterprises could also take part in the sharing economy – the whole economy could at least to some degree be based on bartering, with no monetary transactions. If people had plenty of meaningful activity, they <b>might</b> even <b>not</b> <b>want</b> material things as they do today. A virtuous circle might thereby emerge: when people receive help from others, they also want to give back.|$|R

2500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle gave a {{positive}} review and welcomed Barr back to television. [...] He said, [...] "She's foulmouthed, abrasive and suffers absolutely nothing gladly. Yet, as always, her own foibles crack her {{up as much}} as they do her boyfriend or visiting eldest son. The fact that she's completely unafraid to hold herself up to ridicule endears her to her audience". [...] He also noted that a reality show format [...] "probably fits Barr better than, say, another sitcom [...] ". He ended his review saying, [...] "The wild pigs <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to stick around, but the rest of us should be willing to give Roseanne's Nuts a shot for a few episodes, at least. [...] Scott D. Pierce of The Salt Lake Tribune said in his review, [...] "As reality shows go, Roseanne's Nuts is pretty mild. Oh, she's bleeped a lot. And there's some blurring of nudity. (Ick.) But mostly it's just Roseanne being Roseanne on a macadamia nut farm".|$|E

[...] Peter Bradshaw gave it 5/5 stars, commenting {{that this is}} the first time in which he could actually identify with a small live octopus. Bradshaw summarizes his review by referring to Oldboy as [...] "cinema that holds an edge of cold steel to your throat." [...] David Dylan Thomas points out that rather than simply trying to [...] "gross us out", Oldboy is [...] "much more interested in playing with the conventions of the revenge fantasy and taking us on a very entertaining ride to places that, conceptually, we <b>might</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go." [...] Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave Oldboy a score of [...] "B-", calling it [...] "a bloody and brutal revenge film immersed in madness and directed with operatic intensity," [...] but felt that the questions raised by the film are [...] "lost in the battering assault of lovingly crafted brutality." ...|$|E

Alone of the virtues, says Aristotle, justice looks like [...] "someone elses good", an argument also confronted by Plato in his Republic.|$|R

The coroner should have been notified, since the Duke had not seen a doctor in the 14 days before his death. Because of a {{loophole}} in the law, Adams, though present at death, could sign the death certificate to state that the Duke died naturally. The Duke's sister was married to Harold Macmillan, and some have argued that Macmillan, who became Prime Minister during preparations for the trial, <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>wanted</b> this case to be investigated further: The Attorney-General, Manningham-Buller, attended Cabinet meetings regularly.|$|R

60|$|Nor was he less solicitous for {{the defence}} {{than he had}} shown himself for the {{regulation}} of his kingdom.

But that a suitable revenue <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be <b>wanting</b> for the support of his fleets and fortifications, he gave great encouragement to trade, which, by the piracies on the coasts, and the rapine and injustice exercised by the people within, had long become a stranger to this island.|$|R

50|$|WuDunn and Kristoff {{make the}} claim that if girls were allowed to garner an {{education}} {{they would be able}} to prosper. At this point in time however, it is preferred for boys to go to school than girls because it is believed that they will actually be able to make something out of themselves. Many families have to choose between which of their kids with gain an education because uniforms and school fees might be hard to keep up with if every child goes to school. Girls might also work early on, preventing them from school. Education for girls is also shamed by communities because they fear what an educated woman can do. Some men <b>might</b> <b>not</b> even <b>want</b> to marry an educated woman due to the fear that they will be deemed as inferior to her.|$|R

500|$|It {{had also}} been some time since a Copland piece had been {{appreciated}} widely by audiences. His opera The Tender Land had not fared well, either in its original or revised forms. Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland's ballet Dance Panels, {{despite the fact that}} he had commissioned it. None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s—Connotations, Music for a Great City, Emblems and Inscape—made much of an impact with audiences. Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland's compositional output. [...] Copland was aware that dodecaphonism did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes, [...] "By the sixties, serialism had been around for over fifty years; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore." [...] Nonetheless, he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be pigeonholed. He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963, [...] "People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want. Nobody wants to be an 'American' composer now as they did." [...] He told another friend, [...] "Young composers today wouldn't be caught dead with a folk tune!" [...] He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have <b>wanted</b> to be left behind. At the same time, he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have become totally at home with serialism. He confided to Verna Fine, [...] "I don't feel comfortable with the twelve-tone system, but I don't want to keep repeating myself." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{integrity}} of the civil servants needs to be greatly improved in order to turn Malaysian Vision 2020 into a reality. This objective {{of this research was}} to determine the level of awareness, knowledge and understanding on noble values particularly integrity among selected civil servants in selected State Government agencies in Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. The respondents were selected based on a purposive sampling technique. The research used a quantitative approach where self-administered structured questions were distributed. Descriptive and inference analysis were carried out to meet the research objectives outlined. The research findings showed that there were civil servants groups who were unclear and uncertain about the meaning of integrity in public sector. Those with shorter length of services were found to be less knowledgeable on the rule and procedure which led to them being unsure about integrity. Length of service was found to be inversely related to the perception on the knowledge of integrity, corruption and quality of service delivery. In this research, respondents might or <b>might</b> have <b>not</b> disclosed the actual truth when answering questions. Most heads of departments <b>might</b> have <b>not</b> <b>wanted</b> to disclose actual work realities of their offices. They, in particular, did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to wash their dirty linen in public. For that reason, future research may improve on such limitation...|$|R
