5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years in the <b>military</b> <b>and</b> a final period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome.

During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of civil strife (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, usurpation attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E
