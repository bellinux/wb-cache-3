50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{derivatives}} {{has been used in}} pharmaceutical research. Examples include chimeric and humanized <b>minretumomab,</b> as well as a fusion protein of a <b>minretumomab</b> single-chain variable fragment and the enzyme beta-lactamase.|$|E
50|$|Radiolabelled <b>minretumomab</b> {{has also}} been tested for the {{treatment}} of solid tumours, but without success. Iodine (131I) and lutetium (177Lu) <b>minretumomab,</b> for example, were shown to induce human anti-mouse antibodies; no tumour response was observed in Phase I and II clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|TAG-72 is {{also the}} target of the {{anti-cancer}} drugs anatumomab mafenatox and <b>minretumomab.</b>|$|E
50|$|Iodine (125I) <b>minretumomab</b> is an iodine-125 radiolabelled {{derivative}} {{that was}} developed {{for the detection of}} tumours in radioimmunoassays such as CA 72-4.|$|E
50|$|<b>Minretumomab</b> (CC49) is a mouse {{monoclonal}} antibody {{that was designed}} {{for the treatment of}} cancers that express the TAG-72 antigen. This includes breast, colon, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Apparently, it never got past Phase I clinical trials for this purpose.|$|E
50|$|TAG-72 is a {{tumor marker}} {{and can be}} {{measured}} with radioimmunoassays like CA 72-4, which uses the monoclonal antibodies indium (111In) satumomab pendetide and iodine (125I) <b>minretumomab.</b> This assay has a good specificity for gastric cancer, with a correlation to the neoplasia's extension. It is used to identify relapses {{of the disease and}} to follow up the treatment.|$|E
