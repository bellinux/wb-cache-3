5|$|Mitchell {{plays in}} the style of a stay-at-home defenceman. While with the Vancouver Canucks, he {{established}} himself as their top shutdown defenceman, being matched up against opposing teams' best players and spending significant time on the penalty kill. He had usually formed a defensive pairing on the Canucks with the often offensive-minded Kevin Bieksa. Bieksa has credited Mitchell with teaching him to be <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of game situations before jumping into the rush.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|Staffrooms {{are funny}} places, full of articulate, mad people. They have a {{tremendous}} sense of black humour, but there's a layer of dust over them. They are immature because they're in a children's environment all the time. They have a strange perspective; because they spend all day with kids, they are <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of kids' culture than adults'. When they read about a former pupil who has become head of ICI, they always say, 'But that boy's an idiot. He's crap at geography.' The boy is condemned forever because in the 1960s he didn't know all the capitals of the Third World.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E

5|$|The 'Best' and 'Back' {{service was}} highly criticized by analysts and customers. Braathens SAFE {{had a strong}} image, and unlike SAS, that was branded as 'The Businessman's Airline', Braathens SAFE {{was seen as the}} people's airline. It also drew {{goodwill}} from being Norwegian-owned, and that it displayed the Flag of Norway on the tailplane. Prior to the rebranding, no airline in Norway had ever operated a two-class service on domestic flights—including SAS. Professor of Sociology Per Morten Schiefloe commented that the introduction of segregation of passengers offended passengers. Customers who previously had been paying full price, became <b>more</b> <b>aware</b> of the savings on using 'Back' tickets. At the same time, people who wanted to travel with discounted tickets felt that they got better service and were not treated as second-rate customers with SAS. This caused Braathens to lose customers at both ends. The rebranding itself not only cost money to initiate, but also increased operating expenses, because cabin crew needed to move the curtain depending on the number of passengers on each class. Planes were sometimes delayed for hours, particularly {{in the beginning of the}} service, due to the increased work load on the handling and cabin crew.|$|E

According to Mirosław Nagielski, however, the Poles under Żółkiewski purposefully chose to engage the opponent at that time, hoping to catch them asleep.|$|E
