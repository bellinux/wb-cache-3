40|$|<b>Multiple</b> <b>selections,</b> though heavily used in file {{managers}} and drawing editors, are virtually nonexistent in text editing. This paper describes how <b>multiple</b> <b>selections</b> can automate repetitive text editing. Selection guessing infers a <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> from {{positive and negative}} examples provided by the user. The <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> can then be used for inserting, deleting, copying, pasting, or other editing commands. Simultaneous editing uses two levels of inference, first inferring a group of records to be edited, then inferring <b>multiple</b> <b>selections</b> with exactly one selection in each record. Both techniques have been evaluated by user studies and shown to be fast and usable for novices. Simultaneous editing required only 1. 26 examples per selection in the user study, approaching the ideal of 1 -example PBD. <b>Multiple</b> <b>selections</b> bring many benefits, including better user feedback, fast, accurate inference, novel forms of intelligent assistance, {{and the ability to}} override system inferences with manual corrections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this research, a new <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm, {{which is}} known as “static range {{statistical}} <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm ” is proposed. This algorithm is developed based on the statistical knowledge about the uniform distribution nature of the data which has been arranged according to certain order in the file. A global file with n keys is distributed evenly among p peers in the peer-to-peer network. The selection algorithm can performs <b>multiple</b> <b>selections</b> concurrently to find multiple target keys with different predefined target ranks. The algorithm uses a fixed filter approach in which the algorithm is able {{to make sure that}} the target key is within certain filter range in each local file. The range is made smaller and smaller as the selection process iterates until all target keys are found. The algorithm is able to reduce the number of messages needed and increases the success rate of all <b>multiple</b> <b>selections</b> in the selection process compared to the previous <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms proposed by Loo in 2005.

40|$|Zooming user {{interfaces}} are increasingly popular on mobile devices with touch screens. Swiping and pinching finger gestures {{anywhere on the}} screen manipulate the displayed portion of a page, and taps open objects within the page. This makes navigation easy but limits other manipulations of objects that would be supported naturally by the same gestures, notably cut and paste, <b>multiple</b> <b>selection,</b> and drag and drop. A popular device that suffers from this limitation is Apple’s iPhone.

40|$|International audienceDespite {{their success}} as {{optimization}} methods, evolutionary algorithms face many difficulties to design artifacts with complex structures. According to paleontologists, living organisms evolved by opportunistically co-opting characters adapted to a function to solve new problems, a phenomenon called exaptation. In this paper, we draw the hypotheses (1) that exaptation requires {{the presence of}} <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> pressures, (2) that Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) can create such pressures and (3) that the modularity of the genotype {{is a key to}} enable exaptation. To explore these hypotheses, we designed an evolutionary process to find the structure and the parameters of neural networks to compute a Boolean function with a modular structure. We then analyzed the role of each component using a Shapley value analysis. Our results show that: (1) the proposed method is efficient to evolve neural networks to solve this task; (2) genotypic modules and <b>multiple</b> <b>selections</b> gradients needed to be aligned to converge faster than the control experiments. This prominent role of <b>multiple</b> <b>selection</b> pressures contradicts the basic assumption that underlies most published modular methods for the evolution of neural networks, in which only the modularity of the genotype is considered...|$|R
