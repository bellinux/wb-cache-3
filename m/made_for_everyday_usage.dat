40|$|Terminal Server {{technology}} is a field that promises to solve {{a lot of problems}} by moving the desktop into the cloud. As most users are still using pc:s we want to examine what it is that hold thin clients back. To answer that we study what the current technology provides, and attempt to point out what it lacks. To provide background information I have evaluated several terminal servers, which use different protocols. The study shows that this {{technology is}} still immature. Multimedia, which is essential to modern desktop use, needs a lot more work. So does 3 D graphics which may not be essential but still important to many users. These problems may require solutions that breaks compatibility with legacy applications, by requiring multimedia and 3 D applications to use a network- transparent API, rather than accessing hardware directly like they currently do. I present a possible solution to the problems with multimedia, by using an API where codecs can be moved to the client. When it comes to 3 D the solution may become more complex. The current API:s are to close too hardware and a more abstract scene graph may be needed to provide a sufficient level of abstraction. As a result of these limitations terminal server technology is only fit for office <b>usage,</b> and not <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b> However, video presentations that may be needed in some offices are becoming more common on the Internet. I conclude that while the terminal server approach is promising, the existing technology is not mature enough <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b> Most users require multimedia and optionally 3 D graphics for a complete desktop experience. Those are the areas that need more attention in order to satisfy the end users. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

50|$|As {{with its}} Lotus Seven precursors, Caterhams are {{constructed}} of aluminium sheet {{attached to a}} tubular steel chassis. Nosecone and wings are either GRP or carbon fibre depending on specification. All Sevens are front engined with rear-wheel drive and two seats. Their extremely high performance is achieved through light weight (less than 500 kg on some versions) rather than particularly powerful engines. As well as a lightweight chassis and bodywork, Caterham Sevens achieve their very low mass through their lack of comfort and safety oriented features such as a fixed roof, doors, radio, air-conditioning, airbags, traction/stability control, ABS, satellite navigation or cruise control. As a result, the Seven is somewhat limited in its practicality <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> and is instead recognised by driving enthusiasts for its focus on driving enjoyment, making it an ideal track/race car or 'Sunday' car.|$|R

METHODS: Participants {{in this study were}} 56 community dwelling, elderly women, with subjective complaints of memory loss. Cognition was assessed using a computerized battery of memory and attention tasks designed to be sensitive to age-related declines to fluid intelligence, and a measure of verbal recall. Biochemical measures of selected nutrients, homocysteine, markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood safety parameters were also collected. All cognitive and haematological parameters were assessed at baseline and 16  weeks post-treatment. RESULTS: The multivitamin improved speed of response on a measure of spatial working memory, however benefits to other cognitive processes were not observed. Multivitamin supplementation decreased levels of homocysteine and increased levels of vitamin B(6) and B(12), with a trend for vitamin E to increase. There were no hepatotoxic effects of the multivitamin formula indicating this supplement was safe <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> in the elderly.

This approach is not suitable <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b> The last decade have seen a growing trend to- wards using smartphones <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> applications. This offers a new possibility of collecting data for fitness tracking. This report investigates to what extent accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartphone attached to an arm can be used to detect and separate push-ups from other workout exercises. A complete workout performed by two subjects have been recorded and analysed. A window based pre-processing technique was applied to extract features of the workout data. Support vector machines (SVM) and multi layer perceptrons (MLP) have been used to classify the data based on the feature extraction. Dips was the exercise easiest confused as push-ups. When a sample containing push-ups and dips was tested by a two layer perceptron trained on a variety of exercises not including dips, more false positives than true positives was acquired. A total of 87. 5 % correct classifications was obtained when the training data consisted of an entire workout by the first subject and the test data consisted of the same workout by the second subject. In the opposite case a total of 95. 6 % correct classifications were acquired.
