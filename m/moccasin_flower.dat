5000|$|Because Minnesota was {{sponsoring}} {{an exhibition}} at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, the then-current governor of Minnesota, William Merriam, appointed an all-male board to supervise the preparations. However, a group known as the Women's Auxiliary Board took over the 'women's work' and created a six-person committee to design the state flag. The boards then held a contest to design the flag, and 200 entries were submitted. The winner of the contest was Amelia Hyde Center, who received $15 for her winning design. Center's design was white {{on one side and}} light blue on the other. In the center was the state seal wreathed with white <b>moccasin</b> <b>flowers,</b> on a blue field. A red ribbon in the seal bore a motto, L'Étoile du Nord (French for [...] "The Star of the North"). The years 1819 (establishment of Fort Snelling), 1858 (statehood), and 1893 (adoption of the flag) appeared in gold around the state seal. [...] "Minnesota" [...] was written under the state seal in gold and 19 gold stars arranged in clusters to form the points of a star, representing the fact that Minnesota was the 19th state to be admitted after the original 13 states. [...] The first Minnesota flag was made of silk and was embroidered by Pauline and Thomane Fjelde, who won a gold medal for their creation.The flag was adopted on April 4, 1893.|$|R
