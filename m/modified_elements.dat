40|$|Previous {{research}} on prenominal modification in tanka is scarce and has only taken partial aspects into consideration, namely, pronouns as <b>modified</b> <b>elements</b> and verbs as modifying elements, using only classical waka from the Man’yōshū as material. In light of this, {{the present study}} included all parts of speech that appear either as modifying elements or <b>modified</b> <b>elements</b> and analyzed prenominal modification in the renowned modern tanka collection Sarada Kinenbi. It also partially compared the results to the previous {{research on}} the Man’yōshū. It {{has been found that}} the attributive noun phrases are the most abundant kind of prenominal modification and that attributive adjective phrases are fewest in Sarada Kinenbi. Also, there are more single-word phrases/clauses than complex ones. Regarding complex phrases/clauses, the elements that accompany these are mostly complements. Further, more second person pronouns are modified than first person pronouns. Moreover, these second person pronouns were found to be most commonly modified by attributive clauses. Also, among the 14 verbs that modify pronouns, only the two verbs shinjiru (to believe) and konomu (to like) where found to match Inagaki’s definition “mental verbs”. Finally, Kagimoto’s (1999) claims regarding the Noun Phrase Accessibility Hierarchy in the Man’yōshū proved to be valid in Sarada Kinenbi as well...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} two-dimensional quadrilateral {{plane stress}} element and a modified three-dimensional brick element {{have been developed}} to eliminate the weakness of the conventional finite elements in determining the stress distributions along free boundaries. The results obtained by the said <b>modified</b> <b>elements</b> are in good agreement with the theoretical and experimental results and are superior to the conventional finite element results. A comparison is made between the proposed approach of improving stress calculations and another approach which employs the least square fitting method. The comparison shows that the two approaches provide comparable accuracy but the latter is more difficult to implement. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. For {{hexahedral}} meshes, it {{is difficult}} to make topological modifications which preserve conformal property and which are local to the <b>modified</b> <b>elements.</b> This is most easily understood in how changes affect the dual surfaces (“sheets”) and lines (“chords”), which have non-local extent in hexahedral meshes. A set of three operations is proposed which represent distinct local changes to the hex mesh and its dual. These operations are shown to compose the larger set of “flipping” operations described by Bern et. al. The relation between these dual-based operations and the insertion of a Boy surface in the dual, described by Bern, is also discussed. ...|$|E

Although intact hobo elements are germline specific, an hsp 70 promoter-hobo transposase fusion is active in the soma. Analysis of the hsp 70 -promoted transcript does not provide evidence for splicing. Moreover, the hobo promoter confers germline bias to a highly sensitive reporter, delta 2 - 3 P transposase. These results indicate that hobo transposition is germline specific due to regulation of transposase production at the level of transcription. Thus, although hobo is similar to the P transposable element in organization and tissue specificity, it differs in the underlying mechanism governing germline specific activity...|$|E

Two models were used in this study to verify the applicability of the <b>modified</b> <b>element</b> to express spontaneous rupture propagation.

40|$|Informal {{settlements}} are a form {{of housing}} found {{in many parts of}} the world. Self-help housing in informal settlements has different influences that are denoted in the customs and preferences of the residents, which in turn, are reflected on the elements of house exteriors as well as its interior. Colonias in the U. S-Mexico border region are a model of informal settlements. The purpose of this study is to analyze the social and cultural influences on housing fronts in Webb County Colonias. The study focuses on investigating traditional features, vernacular forms, building rituals, and social features as they relate to the morphology of house fronts and their production. The housing model of Geddes and Bertalanffy explained by Turner (1972) was the premise of establishing the argument of this study. A mixed-method approach was used in data gathering from the following three Colonias: Los Altos, Larga Vista, and Rio Bravo. Utilized methods included image-based research through systematic random sampling of housing fronts in the Colonias, as well as a group-administered structured survey distributed during community monthly gathering for food distribution. The development of the research process and methodology incorporated the input of the local community and local leaders and volunteers assisted in its implementation. The study concluded that past and present experiences of Colonias residents have intense impacts on different aspects contributing to the themes comprising the morphology of Colonias housing fronts. A classical pattern of migration as well as maintained contact and continuous dialogue between residents and their kin were found to result in preserving the inherent native culture of the Colonias?????? residents and can thus be considered as core elements. This preservation of native culture was indicated by utilization of semi-private space, traditional roof forms, privacy and security elements, and building rituals. The study also identified additional secondary <b>modified</b> <b>elements,</b> represented by the lack of gates utilization as a measure of security. These core and <b>modified</b> <b>elements</b> coincide with the Geddes and Bertalanffy model and therefore it can be deduced that this model can be applied in the case of the Colonias...|$|E
