40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of a preceding flexion or extension movement on the static interaction of human finger flexor tendons and pulleys concerning flexion torque being generated. Six human fresh frozen cadaver long fingers were mounted in an isokinetic movement device for the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. During flexion and extension movement both flexor tendons were equally loaded with 40 N while the generated moment was depicted simultaneously at the fingertip. The movement was stopped at various positions of the proximal interphalangeal joint to record dynamic and static torque. The static torque was always greater after a preceding extension movement compared to a preceding flexion movement in the corresponding same position of the joint. This applied for the whole arc of movement of 0 - 105 degrees. The difference between static extension and flexion torque was maximal 11 % in average at about 83 degrees of flexion. Static torque was always smaller than dynamic torque during extension movement and always greater than dynamic torque during flexion movement.

5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the <b>mechanical</b> <b>fingers</b> to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and ovality issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|R

The <b>mechanical</b> <b>finger</b> was covered with clean, dry, unfinished fabric and rubbed against the contaminated specimen. The amount of pesticide transferred to the clean fabric was measured by liquid scintillation counting of the radiotracer. Tests showed that more pesticide was transferred from contaminated 65 % polyester/ 35 % cotton fabric than from 100 % cotton fabric. More pesticide was transferred from heavier weight cotton denim than from lighter weight cotton denim. The nondurable starch finish reduced the pesticide transfer from both the 100 % cotton fabric and the 65 % polyester/ 35 % cotton shirtweight fabric.

Two tractor-driven test devices were developed under this specific objective. The first one was a high capacity compressor, and the stream of air produced by it was directed onto one side of a row of plants. The second one was a device producing two counter-flowing air streams colliding in the middle of a row of plants. The frequency of the air pulses was adjusted steplessly by varying the rotational velocity of the shutters closing and opening the outlets of the fans. In the field trials with the device based on a compressor-generated air stream, two air pulse frequencies were used: 500 and 540 pulses per minute (8. 3 and 9 Hz). The mean detachment force was 0. 727 N. About 50 % of ripe raspberries were removed from the bushes.

40|$|Abstract—Low pain {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} reported in hypertensive subjects as well in groups deemed to be at increased risk of development of the disorder. However, it is uncertain whether individual differences in pain sensitivity are associated prospectively with increases in blood pressure. In the current study, 24 -hour blood pressure and heart rate variability were recorded in 110, 22 -year-old men previously assessed at age 14 years for casual blood pressure and pain sensitivity (<b>mechanical</b> <b>finger</b> pressure). Significant correlations were observed between pain tolerance in 14 -year-olds and current 24 -hour systolic blood pressure (r 0. 37, P 0. 01) and diastolic blood pressure (r 0. 36, P 0. 01). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that information regarding pain tolerance improved prediction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure at age 22 years beyond that afforded by differences in blood pressure, parental history of hypertension, and body mass index at age 14 years. Similar analyses revealed that average pain sensitivity at age 14 was also associated with 24 -hour high-frequency heart rate variability (r 0. 28, P 0. 01) and low-frequency/high-frequency heart rate variability at age 22 (r 0. 35, P 0. 01), suggesting increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic tone among individuals less sensitive to pain.

40|$|A growing {{literature}} has reported {{a significant reduction}} in pain sensitivity among hypertensioe animals and humans. One of the key questions about this finding is whether a reduced sensitivity to pain can be observed in normotensive individuals who go on to develop high blood pressure. Blood pressure was re-assessed in one hundred and fifteen 19 year-old boys initially tested at age 14, when they were also presented with a pain stimulus (<b>mechanical</b> <b>finger</b> pressure). Analyses indicated that information regarding pain sensitivity improved prediction of changes in blood pressure beyond that afforded by differences in blood pressure at age 14, parental history of hypertension, and body mass index. Similar results were found in comparable analyses predicting 24 -hour blood pressure recorded in one hundred and seventeen of the young men at age 22. Significant associations were also observed between pain sensitivity in 14 year-olds and 24 -hour heart rate variability in various frequency bands at age 22, suggesting increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic tone among individuals less sensitive to pain. In order to further assess the relationship between autonomic function and pain sensitivity, one hundred and sixteen adolescent boys were assessed for pain sensitivity and autonomic responses to orthostatic challenge. Analyses indicated that exaggerated autonomic responses to postural change were associated with reduced pain sensitivity. Finally, to examine the potential role of endogenous opioids in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia, a group of young normotensive men were administered low-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve 5 stimulation (TENS), which has been demonstrated to elicit endogenous opioid release, prior to being presented with two painful stimuli (electric shock and arm ischemia).

40|$|High blood {{pressure}} is associated with decreased sensitivity to pain in humans and animals. Interestingly, hypoalgesia has also been observed in normotensive organisms at risk for hypertension, suggesting {{that it may be}} related to processes involved in the development of hypertension rather than with elevations of {{blood pressure}} per se. Sensitivity to laboratory and naturalistic daily aches and pains was assessed in young normotensive women and men with or without a parental history of hypertension and varying degrees of resting blood pressure. In women, risk for hypertension, as defined by a parental history of hypertension, relatively elevated systolic blood pressure, or a combination of the two, was associated with decreased pain reports and increased pain threshold for <b>mechanical</b> <b>finger</b> pressure, but not for the cold pressor test. Offspring of hypertensives also exhibited a reduced response to the pain stimuli compared to offspring of normotensives as assessed by the objective physiological measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). Group differences observed in the laboratory were generally maintained in reports of daily pain, with significant correlations emerging between laboratory and naturalistic pain reports. To assess the role of cardiopulmonary baroreceptor stimulation in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia, young men varying in risk for hypertension were exposed to finger pressure during a period of passive leg elevation and two control periods. Men with relatively elevated systolic blood pressure exhibited reduced pain during the period of leg elevation but not while in a supine position, nor following the valsalva manoeuver. The results of these studies support an association between risk for hypertension and pain sensitivity. This relation appears to extend to naturalistic pain encountered in daily life. Further, there is promising evidence suggesting that this relationship is influenced by cardiopulmonary baroreceptor activity...|$|E
