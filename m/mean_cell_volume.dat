The possible sites of interference of anticonvulsants with folate activity in the body, and problems associated with folic acid supplements during anticonvulsant therapy, are discussed. During the survey it was confirmed that the <b>mean</b> red <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> is abnormally increased in many cases of Down's syndrome.

50|$|With modern lab equipment, the {{hematocrit}} {{is calculated}} by an automated analyzer and not directly measured. It {{is determined by}} multiplying the red cell count by the <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume.</b> The hematocrit is slightly more accurate as the PCV includes small amounts of blood plasma trapped between the red cells. An estimated hematocrit as a percentage may be derived by tripling the hemoglobin concentration in g/dL and dropping the units.|$|E
50|$|The mean corpuscular volume, or <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> (MCV), is {{a measure}} of the average volume of a red blood {{corpuscle}} (or red blood cell). The measure is attained by multiplying a volume of blood by the proportion of blood that is cellular (the hematocrit), and dividing that product by the number of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in that volume. The mean corpuscular volume is a part of a standard complete blood count. In a laboratory test that computes MCV, erythrocytes are compacted during centrifugation.|$|E
50|$|The anemia is {{moderate}} to severe and dimorphic. Microscopic viewing of the red blood cells will reveal marked unequal cell size and abnormal cell shape.

The <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> is commonly decreased (i.e., a microcytic anemia), but MCV may also be normal or even high. The RDW is increased with the red blood cell histogram shifted to the left. Leukocytes and platelets are normal. Bone marrow shows erythroid hyperplasia with a maturation arrest.|$|E

Quantitative measurements were made of organic carbon levels and of <b>cell</b> numbers, <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volumes,</b> and total biovolumes for all three microbial populations. A mathematical model based on Monod kinetics was developed to describe this four-trophic level predator-prey system.

40|$|The beritabilities {{of human}} blood cell {{characteristics}} were estimated {{in a study}} of 206 pairs of young adult twins, male and female. White cell numbers, indices related to circulating red cell mass (haemoglobin, red cell count, and haematocrit), and platelet numbers and size all appeared to be accounted for by genetic and nonshared environmental influences only. <b>Mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> (of the erythrocytes) appeared to be influenced by environmental factors shared by siblings {{as well as the other}} two sources of variation. Correlation between red cell count and haemoglobin is modulated by both genetic and environmental factors, but the negative correlation between red cell numbers and size is due mainly to genetic factors independent of those influencing haemoglobin.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between specific {{growth rate of}} Escherichia coli and the concentration of limiting nutrient (glucose or phosphate or tryptophan) has been determined for populations in a steady state. At high concentrations the specific growth rate is independent of the concentration of nutrient, but at low concentrations the specific growth rate is a strong function of the nutrient concentration. Such a relationship was predicted by Monod; however, Monod's equation does not predict the relationship over {{the entire range of}} nutrient concentration. If parameters of the equation are estimated from the results obtained at low concentrations, then at high concentrations of nutrient, the specific growth rate is significantly higher than that predicted by Monod's equation. These results were interpreted on the basis that the rate of growth is controlled by at least two parallel reactions and that the affinities of the enzymes catalyzing these reactions are different. The {{relationship between}} specific growth rate and <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> was also measured, and the results indicate that <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> depends not only on the specific growth rate but also {{on the nature of the}} limiting nutrient. There are different mean cell volumes at the same specific growth rate established by different limiting nutrients. Therefore, the <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> is not uniquely determined by the specific growth rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{cartilaginous}} infrapharyngobranchial II (part of the upper pharyngeal jaws) in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia elegans was investigated in four successive early postembryonic stages. Total cell number, individual cell volumes, total cell, total matrix and total cartilage volume were accurately measured or calculated. The share of cell and matrix volume increase in the overall growth was calculated {{for each of the}} transitions. Matrix volume increase accounted for almost 60 % of the overall rudiment increase. Non-hypertrophic cells and the matrix produced by them together accounted for about three quarters of the total cartilage volume increase. Zones with particular characteristics (cell orientation, cell shape, degenerative features, etc.) were distinguished {{in each of the four}} stages separately. The sequence of increasing <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> between zones was interpreted as reflecting growth directions within the cartilage. Apposition probably largely contributed to the observed cell volume increase. <b>Mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> and mean matrix volume per cell showed a highly significant positive relation.

Procedure Blood samples, collected by venipuncture, were analysed within 6 hours of collection for red cell count, haemoglobin, packed <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> plasma glucose, white cell count and differentials. Results Haemoglobin concentrations appeared to increase with age and ranged from 6. 0 to 20. 9 g/dL. Packed <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> and plasma glucose concentration {{did not appear to}} vary with age. White cell counts ranged from 6. 3 to 7. 0 x 10 (9) /L and differential counts indicated neutrophils > lymphocytes > monocytes > eosinophils > basophils. In general, the values for packed <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> red <b>cell</b> count, <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> <b>volumes</b> and <b>mean</b> <b>cell</b> haemoglobin concentrations were within ranges previously reported for captive or sedated rusa deer.

The <b>mean</b> total tumour <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> of 10 scirrhous carcinomata was 287 - 6 mm 3, or 2155 % of the entire neoplasm.
