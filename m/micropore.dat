40|$|It has {{recently}} been revealed that high-density pre-existing hydrogen <b>micropores,</b> formed during production processes, exhibit premature growth and coalescence under external loading at room temperature, thereby inducing ductile fracture.

In the present study, synchrotron X-ray microtomography was applied to the in situ observation of deformation and fracture in Al–Mg alloys at a high temperature. High-density hydrogen <b>micropores</b> were observed in the alloys. Flow localization controlled deformation through the mechanism of solute drag creep. A combined effect of grain boundary sliding and heterogeneous nucleation on particles was also confirmed to accelerate the growth of pre-existing hydrogen <b>micropores</b> and cavities.

For high-pressure (4. 0 MPa) Xe- 129 NMR measurements, the hard-carbon samples in Xe gas showed three peaks at 27, 34 and 210 ppm.

The NMR spectrum of a sample evacuated at 773 K and exposed to 0. 1 MPa Xe gas at 773 K for 24 h showed two peaks at 29 and 128 ppm, which were attributed, respectively, to the xenon atoms adsorbed in the large pores (probably mesopores) and <b>micropores</b> of hard-carbon.
