A useful formal definition of <b>multicriteria</b> heuristic graph <b>search</b> problems is provided. Then the fundamental issues in <b>multicriteria</b> <b>search</b> are described in detail and a general framework is developed. Several new procedures are presented and analyzed for the usual multicriteria decision rules: multiobjective, multiattribute, goal satisfaction, and lexicographic search...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of finding {{multimodal}} journeys in transportation networks, including unrestricted walking, driving, cycling, and schedule-based public transportation. A natural {{solution to this problem}} is to use <b>multicriteria</b> <b>search,</b> but it tends to be slow and to produce too many journeys, several of which are of little value. We pro-pose algorithms to compute a full Pareto set and then score the solu-tions in a postprocessing step using techniques from fuzzy logic, quickly identifying the most significant journeys. We also propose several (still multicriteria) heuristics to find similar journeys much faster, making the approach practical even for large metropolitan areas. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{approximate}} k-NN search in large scale image databases, based on top-k multi-criteria search techniques. The method defines a simple index structure based on sorted lists, {{which provides a}} good compromise between fast retrieval, storage requirements and update cost. The search algorithm delivers approximate results with guarantees about false negatives, with fast emergence of good approximations, monotonically improved and leading if necessary to an exact result. Experiments with the on-disk implementation show that our method produces very good approximate results several {{times faster than the}} Baseline method.

40|$|Shortest Path Problems (SPP) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied problems in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR). It consists in finding the shortest path between two given nodes in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent arcs is minimized. However, real life problems frequently involve the consideration of multiple, and often conflicting, criteria. When multiple objectives must be simultaneously optimized, the concept of a single optimal solution is no longer valid. Instead, a set of efficient or Pareto-optimal solutions define the optimal trade-off between the objectives under consideration. The <b>Multicriteria</b> <b>Search</b> Problem (MSP), or Multiobjective Shortest Path Problem, is the natural extension to the SPP when more than one criterion are considered. The MSP is computationally harder than the single objective one. The number of label expansions can grow exponentially with solution depth, even for the two objective case. However, with the assumption of bounded integer costs and a fixed number of objectives the problem becomes tractable for polynomially sized graphs. A wide variety of practical application in different fields can be identified for the MSP, like robot path planning, hazardous material transportation, route planning, optimization of public transportation, QoS in networks, or routing in multimedia networks. Goal programming is one of the most successful Multicriteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques used in Multicriteria Optimization. In this thesis we explore one of its variants in the MSP. Thus, we aim to solve the <b>Multicriteria</b> <b>Search</b> Problem with lexicographic goal-based preferences. To do so, we build on previous work on algorithm NAMOA*, a successful extension of the A* algorithm to the multiobjective case. More precisely, we provide a new algorithm called LEXGO*, an exact label-setting algorithm that returns the subset of Pareto-optimal paths that satisfy a set of lexicographic goals, or the subset that minimizes deviation from goals if these cannot be fully satisfied. Moreover, LEXGO* is proved to be admissible and expands only a subset of the labels expanded by an optimal algorithm like NAMOA*, which performs a full Multiobjective Search. Since time rather than memory is the limiting factor in the performance of <b>multicriteria</b> <b>search</b> algorithms, we also propose a new technique called t-discarding to speed up dominance checks in the process of discarding new alternatives during the search. The application of t-discarding to the algorithms studied previously, NAMOA* and LEXGO*, leads to the introduction of two new time-efficient algorithms named NAMOA*dr and LEXGO*dr, respectively. All the algorithmic alternatives are tested in two scenarios, random grids and realistic road maps problems. The experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of LEXGO* in both benchmarks, as well as the dramatic reductions of time requirements experienced by the t-discarding versions of the algorithms, with respect to the ones with traditional pruning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} an automatic wireless LAN access points planning approach {{based on a}} multicriteria modelling and solving. A realistic and efficient wLAN planning approach can not only assess usual objectives based on radio coverage. It has to further implement a Quality of Service (QoS) constraint. In this work, a QoS criterion {{is defined as the}} mean available bandwidth per user, derived from a Markov-based performance evaluation model of the medium access control (MAC) layer behavior. Optimizing both coverage and QoS objectives results in finding the optimal trade-off between these concurrent criteria. Rather than optimizing a weighted sum of the optimization criteria that provides a single solution, it is herein proposed to develop a dedicated <b>multicriteria</b> <b>search</b> algorithm. Its main feature is to provide several solutions, each one representing a peculiar tradeoff between the objectives. The planning process estimates for each solution the optimal number of APs and their placement. The AP's coverage is estimated with a powerful multi-resolution radio propagation simulator previously described. This paper presents results for a QoS oriented planning process providing a predefined minimum per-user throughput. The example provided herein applies for 200 users distributed over a 12600 m 2 building floor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Facing {{the limits}} of {{traditional}} tools of resource management within computational grids (related to scale, dynamicity, etc. of the platforms newly considered), new approaches, based on peer-to-peer technologies are emerging. The resource discovery {{and in particular the}} service discovery is concerned by this evolution. Among the solutions, a promising one is the indexing of resources using trie structures and more particularly prefix trees. The major advantages of trie-structured approaches is the capability to support search queries on ranges of values with a latency growing logarithmically in the number of nodes in the trie. Those techniques are easy to extend to <b>multicriteria</b> <b>searches.</b> One drawback of using tries is its inherent poor robustness in a dynamic environment, where nodes join and leave the network, leading to the split of the tree into a forest, which results in the impossibility to route requests. Within most recent approaches, the fault-tolerance is a prevention mechanism, often replication-based. The replication can be costly in term of resources required. In this paper, we propose a faulttolerance protocol that reconnects subtrees a posteriori, after crashes, to have again a connected graph and then reorder the nodes to rebuild a consistent tree. ...|$|R

40|$|A good address {{system has}} always been {{important}} for the systematic recording of personal or company information and for the effective delivery of products. In a society that demands rapid exchanges of information, an address serves also {{as a key to}} associate various governmental records, to link data of varying levels of summary, and to assist in strategic planning. In a city with complex building structures and street networks such as Hong Kong, a number of problems are encountered with addresses. These include the existing diverse address systems retained in a number of governmental units; the bilingual nature of the address system caused by a legacy of Hong Kongâ€™s past as a British colony populated largely by the Chinese; the three-dimensional variation of defining spatial units; and the lack of a clear postal code system all have led to diffculties in establishing a unifed address system for the exchange of information. In this paper, the authors will try to examine all of these complexities in terms of the historical development of the address system and the physical setting of the city, followed by a proposal for a compartmentalized addressing model to cater to all existing variations. The model is to be implemented in a relational database with semantic data structures to facilitate <b>multicriteria</b> <b>searching</b> and analysis.

40|$|The {{inability}} {{to develop an}} accurate and precise parameter estimation method for catchment hydrochemical models has been a persistent problem. We investigate the use of multicriteria calibration techniques and {{the selection of the}} criteria as a first step in solving this problem. We applied a <b>multicriteria</b> <b>search</b> algorithm to the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM) of the Emerald Lake watershed, Sequoia National Park, California. A total of 21 chemical and hydrologic criteria were available for determining model performance. Four subsets of these criteria were selected for the multicriteria analysis using three different methods. The first set used the four least correlated observations of stream chemical composition. A second set of criteria was determined by using the four species with the least correlated root mean square error criteria values (p < 0. 05 for each pair). Finally, two sets were chosen using the results of a multicriteria sensitivity analysis. The most accurate and precise results were observed using criteria selected using results from a sensitivity analysis, with the correlation analyses being a poor method for selecting criteria. This set of criteria emphasizes attributes of the model structure, the observations, and our understanding of the processes influencing watershed hydrology and water quality. Also, our results gave improved estimates of several hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in addition to identifying a flaw in the current representation of mineral weathering within the AHM, as applied to the Emerald Lake watershed...|$|R

40|$|The {{concern of}} this thesis is to discuss {{different}} multicriteria games solution concepts. Multicriteria {{game is a}} special case from the game theory if the payoff function {{of at least one}} player is a vector and the player wants to maximize all the criteria at the same time. The thesis is divided into four chapters. In the first instance a few motivation examples are introduced. Subsequently the history of the multicriteria games is mentioned. The theoretical chapter follows. It contains five sections - introduction of new definitions; the structure of the set of equilibria for two person <b>multicriteria</b> games; <b>searching</b> equilibria points by the help of scalarization of the vector-valued function; introduction of ideal equilibria points and ways how to find them; the comparison of used methods. The last solution concept is demonstrated by the real example. Finally a theoretical chapter with new results is included. ...|$|R
