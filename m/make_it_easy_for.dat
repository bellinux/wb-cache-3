5|$|Chiang {{ran into}} stiff {{opposition}} from his officers, including the powerful Chief of Staff of the Military Affairs Commission He Yingqin, the Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, {{the head of}} the Fifth War Zone Li Zongren, and his German advisor Alexander von Falkenhausen. They argued that the Chinese Army needed more time to recover from its losses at Shanghai, and pointed out that Nanking was highly indefensible topographically. The mostly gently sloping terrain in front of Nanking would <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the attackers to advance on the city, while the Yangtze River behind Nanking would cut off the defenders' retreat.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2007, Bennett {{proposed}} using {{tax money}} to pay for a new $500 million arena in Renton, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. After failing to reach a deal {{by the end of the}} legislative session, Bennett gave up his attempt in April 2007. On November 2, 2007 the team announced it would move to Oklahoma City as soon as it could get out of its Key Arena lease. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, maintained a stance that the Sonics were expected to stay in Seattle until their lease expired in 2010 and said the city did not intend to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Bennett to move the team early. Over concerns the city would accept a buyout of the lease, a grassroots group filed a citywide initiative that sought to prevent the city from accepting such an offer from Bennett's group. The Seattle City Council later unanimously passed an ordinance modeled after the initiative.|$|E

Two other former winners, Philippe Thys and Odile Defraye started the race. The war had been only over for seven months, so most cyclists {{did not have a}} chance to train enough for the Tour. For that reason, there were almost no new younger cyclists, and the older cyclists dominated the race. The organisation did not <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> the cyclists: with 5560km it was longer than all the previous Tours, and since then only the 1926 Tour de France has been longer.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, {{fans of the}} Cincinnati Reds {{stuffed the}} ballot box and elected 7 Reds players to start in the All-Star Game: Johnny Temple (2B), Roy McMillan (SS), Don Hoak (3B), Ed Bailey (C), Frank Robinson (LF), Gus Bell (CF), and Wally Post (RF), and the only non-Red elected to start for the National League was St. Louis Cardinals first baseman Stan Musial. While the Reds were a great {{offensive}} team, most baseball observers agreed {{that they did not}} deserve seven starters in the All-Star Game. An investigation ordered by Commissioner Ford Frick showed that over half of the ballots cast came from Cincinnati, as the Cincinnati Enquirer had printed up pre-marked ballots and distributed them with the Sunday newspaper to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> Reds fans to vote often for their favorite stars.|$|E
25|$|Responsible men {{can become}} more deeply {{convinced}} of {{the truth of the}} doctrine laid down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control. Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards. Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings—and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation—need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Smith {{published}} Songs of a Little Child’s Day, {{which included}} 66 songs of original compositions by Smith and text by Emilie Poulsson. The songs {{focused on a}} limited range to <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> high-pitched children's voices to sing the works {{and most of the}} songs contained sixteen bars or less. Accompaniment lines for the piano, duplicated the vocal lines, but had artistic flourishes, such as a section in the piece [...] "The Busy Wind", which used a repetitive pattern of sixteenth notes to imitate the sound of blowing wind. In honor of the 25th anniversary of Hull House, in 1915, five of Smith's compositions were published as The Hull-House Songs. The themes represented social issues which were prevalent at the time including [...] "The Land of the Noonday Night" [...] about mining safety, the [...] "Suffrage Song" [...] about women's voting, and [...] "The Shadow Child" [...] about child labor with words penned by poet, Harriet Monroe. As early as 1901, she had written compositions for poems with social themes, such as the work she created for Morris Rosenfeld's poem [...] "Sweat Shop". Other works Smith authored include: [...] "Song Pictures"; [...] "Twelve Songs for Twelve Boys"; [...] "The Golden Asp" [...] (cantata); [...] "Wedding Music" [...] (No. 1 and No. 2); [...] "Trolls' Holiday" [...] (operetta); and [...] "Twelve Songs".
