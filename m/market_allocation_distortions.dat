The <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> of risk depends significantly on the young generation’s willingness to substitute intertemporally and on government policy. Safe government debt shifts productivity risk from old to young while wage-indexed social security is essentially neutral.

The <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> is generally inefficient, except for the special case of wage-proportional incomes and logarithmic utility.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} an infinitely-repeated Bertrand game {{in which}} each firm (principal) internally offers a contract to a privately-informed agent to obtain in-formation owned by the agent, and externally colludes with the other firm, so as to allocate market share in a state-dependent way. This paper asks how firms can achieve efficiency of <b>market</b> <b>allocations</b> in an inter-firm collusive relationship while achieving efficiency of internal contracts. The main finding is that firms using internal contracts can achieve efficiency of market allocations; conversely, efficiency of <b>market</b> <b>allocations</b> leads to that of internal contracts. This interac-tion between internal contracts and self-enforced agreement of <b>market</b> <b>allocations</b> facilitates the optimal collusion in which two firms act as a single firm...|$|R

This analysis develops a detailed free <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> program.

The thesis analyzes representative water users from the Urban, Industrial and Agricultural sectors of the valley. A marginal cost curve for reducing water use is developed for each representative. These curves are {{used to determine the}} compliance costs for each allocation plan. This study concludes that the free <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> program is more efficient than the MCWRA's allocation program, assuming both plans use similar water use monitoring systems.

This is achieved by constraining the low-risk house-hold while subsidizing the interest rate for the high-risk household. A higher score (i. e. prior that the household is low risk) relaxes the constraint on low-risk households and increases the subsidization for high-risk, which increases utility for both types as credit scores rise. We calibrate the model to salient features of the unsecured credit market and consider the welfare consequences of different information regimes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{market prices}} ignore {{external}} effects, hence miss-allocate energy generation between (polluting) {{fossil fuels and}} (clean) solar technologies. Correcting the failure requires understanding the <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> forces at hand. An important feature of solar energy is that its cost of supply is predominantly due to upfront investments in capital infrastructure (rather than to the actual supply rate) and this feature has far reaching implications for the <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> outcome. Studying the <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> process, we specify {{the conditions under which}} solar technologies penetrate the energy sector. The framework is then used to analyze policy regulation in the form of taxing fossil energy and subsidizing investments in solar energy. The first policy measure addresses undesirable environmental effects {{associated with the use of}} fossil fuels and the second internalizes the benefits of learning by doing in the solar industry. Under certain conditions, a temporary subsidy on solar energy investments gives rise to a flourishing, self-sustained solar industry that will (eventually) drive fossil energy out of production. energy, solar technologies, fossil fuels, price thresholds, regulation, environmental damage, learning by doing, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Marketing, C 61, Q 42, Q 58,...|$|R

40|$|<b>Distortion</b> <b>allocation</b> {{varying with}} {{wavelength}} in lossy compression of hyperspectral imagery is investigated, {{with the aim}} of minimizing the spectral distortion between original and decompressed data. The absolute angular error, or spectral angle mapper (SAM), is used to quantify spectral distortion, while radiometric distortions are measured by maximum absolute deviation (MAD) for near-lossless methods, for example, differential pulse code modulation (DPCM), or mean-squared error (MSE) for lossy methods, for example, spectral decorrelation followed by JPEG 2000. Two strategies of interband <b>distortion</b> <b>allocation</b> are compared: given a target average bit rate, distortion may be set to be constant with wavelength. Otherwise, it may be allocated proportionally to the noise level of each band, according to the virtually lossless protocol. Comparisons with the uncompressed originals show that the average SAM of radiance spectra is minimized by constant <b>distortion</b> <b>allocation</b> to radiance data. However, variable <b>distortion</b> <b>allocation</b> according to the virtually lossless protocol yields significantly lower SAM in case of reflectance spectra obtained from compressed radiance data, if compared with the constant <b>distortion</b> <b>allocation</b> at the same compression ratio...|$|R

40|$|An {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} the market for urban land is formulated by combining continuous models of land consumption with discrete choice models of household location, firm location, and land allocation. The {{model of the}} demand for residential land is a composite of a continuous model of household land consumption and a discrete choice model of household location. The models of the demand for industrial and commercial land are composites of continuous models of firm land consumption and discrete choice models of firm location. The model of the supply of residential, industrial, and commercial land is a discrete choice model of landowner allocation decisions. When combined with a Walrasian price adjustment mechanism, the models of land demand and land supply can be used to calculate an equilibrium land <b>market</b> <b>allocation,</b> where the supply and demand for residential, industrial, and commercial land are equated. The residential, industrial, and commercial land rents that are a solution to the equilibrium land <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> model completely determine the locations of households and firms; the land consumption levels of households, industrial firms, and commercial firms; and the land allocation decisions of landowners. The mathematical properties of the land demand and land supply models ensure the existence and uniqueness of a set of equilibrium land rents. The equilibrium land <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> model is used to simulate the market for urban land in the Portland/Vancouver metropolitan region. For the Portland/Vancouver region, solutions to the equilibrium land <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> model are calculated for a baseline scenario, an urban growth boundary scenario, and a property tax scenario. Differences between equilibrium land rents, household and firm locations, equilibrium land use, and household, firm, and landowner welfare measures are examined to evaluate the simulated effects of the urban growth boundary and property tax polices. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in monopolistic competition theory {{is whether the}} market allocates resources efficiently. This paper generalizes the Spence-Dixit-Stiglitz framework to heterogeneous firms, addressing when the market provides optimal quantities, variety and productivity. Under constant elasticity demand, each firm prices above its average cost, yet we show <b>market</b> <b>allocations</b> are efficient. When demand elasticities vary, <b>market</b> <b>allocations</b> are not efficient and reflect the distortions of imperfect competition. After determining the nature of market distortions, we investigate how integration {{may serve as a}} remedy to imperfect competition. Both market distortions and the impact of integration depend on two demand side elasticities, and we suggest richer demand structures to pin down these elasticities. We also show that integration eliminates distortions, provided the post-integration market is sufficiently large.

When generations overlap, this failure can be mitigated by properly designed social arrangements. We show that public financing {{of education and}} public pensions can be designed to implement an intergenerational transfer scheme supporting the complete <b>market</b> <b>allocation.</b> Neither the public financing of education nor the pension scheme we consider resemble standard ones. In our mechanism, via the public education system, the young borrow from the middle aged to invest in human capital. They pay back the debt via a social security tax, the proceedings of which finance pension payments. When the complete <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> is achieved, the rate of return implicit in this borrowing-lending scheme should equal the market rate of return...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{synthesis}} of two Schumpeterian views: that growth is driven by innovation, and {{that the level of}} financial market development affects the growth process. We adopt an endogenous growth model where growth is driven by R&D activities of entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs must borrow to fund R&D, but heterogeneity and unobservability of entrepreneurial ability creates credit restriction. The extent of financial market development is defined as the number of high ability agents in the financial market. Having a more developed financial market facilitates the allocatin of resources to the innovation sector, at the same time reduces the number of entrepreneurs available to the innovation sector. We characterize equilibrium in the financial market, and find that <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> of entrepreneurs only coincides with the growth maximising allocation when all value created by innovation are divided by entrepreneurs, otherwise the <b>market</b> <b>allocation</b> is typically not growth maximising, and low grow trap may exist.
