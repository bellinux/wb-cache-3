Arkose conglomerate and mudstone {{of the lower}} Crystal Spring Formation were created from muddy debris derived from stream erosion of these uplands. A warm shallow sea spread over the area as the Amargosa aulacogen slowly subsided; thick sequences of lime-rich ooze with abundant colonies of algae called stromatolites were then laid down. Dolomite and limestone resulted, forming the middle part of the Crystal Spring Formation. The upper part was formed after silt and sand destroyed the algal <b>mat,</b> <b>forming</b> siltstone and sandstone.

This work investigates the tensile and flexural properties of sisal fibre reinforced epoxy composite.

The water catchments {{worked well for}} a short period such as within three years after the construction. In this study, samples from the damaged areas showing reddish brown microbial mats with iron bacteria, and green microbial mats with diatoms were observed by optical and electron microscopy, XRF and XRD analyses. The green microbial mats were more remarkable in areas mainly containing smectite clays versus sandstone areas rich in ferrihydrite. The green microbial <b>mats</b> <b>formed</b> in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was more than 8 mg/L, and the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was more than + 300 mV. On the other hand, the reddish-brown microbial <b>mats</b> <b>formed</b> in areas where the DO was less than 6. 2 mg/L, and Eh was less than + 300 mV. The reddish-brown microbial mats consisted of ferrihydrite formed by iron oxidizing bacteria at the outlets of the drainage pipes. In landslide areas, we pointed out the necessity of maintenance based on groundwater, microorganisms and geological features which contribute to the spread of clays. We propose two methods to prevent the formation of biomats in landslide fields, such as connected pipes and different materials used for drainage pipes...|$|R

In this study, the damage situation in such an institution by microbial <b>mats</b> <b>formed</b> by iron bacteria, and examined growth environment of iron bacteria on drainpipes at landslide areas in Niigata prefecture. The microbial <b>mats</b> were <b>formed</b> by iron bacteria, such as Toxothrix trichogenes and Leptothrix ocheracea. The microbial mats were more remarkable in areas mainly containing clays than sandstone areas. The microbial mats were seen in the aquatic environment where the oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) was in the range of + 165 to + 244 mV and the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) was in the range of 2. 7 to 7. 4 mg/L. In addition, more microbial <b>mats</b> were <b>formed</b> around the part in the range of about 0 to 15 meters from the aperture mouth of drainpipes, while less microbial <b>mats</b> were <b>formed</b> in the deep part of drainpipes. The formation of microbial mats was remarkable under the condition where the reductive groundwater was exposed to the atmosphere and suddenly changed into an oxidation state.
