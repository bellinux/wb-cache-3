Snow plowing and salt spreading {{are the most}} common counter-measures for making our roads safer for motorists. To assist highway <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities</b> with better planning and allocation of winter maintenance resources, this study introduces an analytical model to estimate the required number of trucks for spreading operation subjective to pre-specified service time constraints considering road geometry, weather and traffic. The complexity of the research problem lies in dealing with heterogeneous road geometry of road sections, truck capacities, spreading patterns, and traffic speeds under different weather conditions and time periods of an event. The proposed model is applied to two maintenance yards with seven road sections in New Jersey (USA), which demonstrates itself fairly practical to be implemented, considering diverse operational conditions...|$|R

A long panel of firms and households allows us to shed light on the effects of road quality for firms and pre-existing households. Methodologically, we propose a new road quality instrument using a nationwide panel dataset of road surface roughness to predict road quality from temporal variation in budgets exogenously allocated to different road <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities.</b> We first show that higher road network quality leads to job creation in the manufacturing sector. We then show that this is reflected in household consumption and income. Third, we show evidence of an occupational shift from agriculture into manufacturing and improved profits for those who stay in agriculture. The gap in average income between agriculture and manufacturing employment is reduced with road quality but not eliminated. ∗The authors thank seminar participants at UC Berkeley, Millenium Challenge Corporation, the RAND Cor-poration, University of Toronto, and University of Ottawa for helpful comments and suggestions.

40|$|A {{performance}} specified {{maintenance contract}} (PSMC) is a medium to long term maintenance contract running typically over a 10 year period. The contract covers {{all aspects of}} road network maintenance activity including day to day maintenance, resurfacing and reconstruction costs. The PSMC contract is based around the contractor meeting various performance standards {{in return for a}} lump sum amount. This paper illustrates the benefits of a PSMC style asset maintenance solution in managing a network such as that proposed in the Challenge. A PSMC maintenance solution offers benefits to the road <b>maintenance</b> <b>authority</b> through the ability of the Contractor to programme work at the optimum time, rather than being constrained to relatively even annual budgets. In this paper, a 15 % saving was predicted over the 20 year analysis period with no loss of level of service, through the ability to fund maintenance works in a more optimal fashion. This paper concludes that PSMC contracts offer an attractive asset maintenance solution. The lump sum contract price also provides greater certainty of long term expenditure levels than a more traditional year by year approach. There are further benefits of PSMC contracts which are not addressed as part of this paper such as economies of scale, certainty of work efficiencies, quality drivers on the Contractor to “do it right first time ” and proactive maintenance programmes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} climate, budgets {{for the maintenance of}} public buildings are unlikely to meet the ever-increasing maintenance needs. Although it is unlikely that this problem can be overcome completely without an injection of further resources, it is possible for government <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities</b> to improve the situation by ensuring that the best solution in terms of 'value for money' is achieved in the planned maintenance programme. A maintenance plan which is based on a rational assessment of priorities and up-to-date knowledge of the condition of the property stock will help to ensure the best use of available resources. Based on the multi-attribute maintenance prioritization model developed by Alan Spedding, Roy Holmes and Qiping Shen at the University of West of England, which is simple in practice and flexible from a management point of view, this paper presents the results of some further research into this area by modifying the original model using an analytical hierarchy process in deciding the weightings of the criteria set out in the prioritization model.

40|$|AbstractThe {{road and}} {{railroad}} networks {{are the most}} important elements of the infrastructure system and bridges are the main connective parts. Moreover, bridges are considered as important points in critical arteries. If the bridges deteriorate, because of aging, fatigue, loading, weather conditions, natural disaster and etc. repair works will be more expensive than maintenance works. The available budget for rehabilitation and maintenance usually is not enough for holding the system in a certain condition level its whole life. In our country bridge maintenance isn’t important as their construction. Bridge <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities</b> haven’t any serious view towards prevention maintenance, and while there isn’t any structural failure, they don’t take any effective measures.

40|$|The wear {{of wheels}} and rails is of major concern for every railway and vehicle <b>maintenance</b> <b>authority,</b> since {{reprofiling}} and replacing worn wheels and rails absorb {{a significant part}} of their maintenance budget. The wear can be divided into several categories based on the result of the wear, such as homogenous wear, corrugation, fatigue, etc. This paper is focused on the corrugation and its reduction. The underground railway network has the particularly to be loaded by vehicles with similar dynamics, similar dimensions, similar weights and running at similar velocities, thus similar responses to the excitations are expected. The proper corrugation mechanism is not well understood. Despite the fact that the corrugation is common for many railway tracks, its main features seem to be rather different from one to another, specific for a given track and vehicle fleet. According to hypothesis found in literature, the corrugation occurs as a result of longitudinal slip between wheel and rail supported by variation of track impedance. Some eigenmodes of the vehicle-track system are excited, which cause corrugation wear. Higher speeds (high-speed railways) as well as low axle loads (underground railways) encourage the growth of corrugation. The corrugation is usually observed in areas where high contact vibrations with slip are present. There are particularly two basic locations (i) curves and (ii) traction and braking areas. The corrugation propagation in the curves, mostly of small radius, is excited by the difference in the path length for the left and right wheel. The difference is just partially compensated by the conicity of the wheels. The possible solutions to decrease rail and wheel wear are summarised to three categories: (i) maintenance of tracks and vehicles, (ii) track design, and (iii) vehicle design. The basic phenomenological simulation model is implemented. The model is used to investigate possible explanation of the corrugation formation. The simulation parameter study performed with the phenomenological model is presented. The application of semi-active technology in order to decrease corrugation propagation is discussed. The semi-active track and its control is modelled and simulated. The preliminary results indicate that semi-active sleepers are able to decrease corrugation propagation significantly...|$|E

40|$|In 1992, an {{overview}} of speeding measures was published for 80 km/h roads {{in support of the}} development, implementation and evaluation of road safety policy. Following evaluation, it was shown that this overview was not, or hardly used. The question therefore arose with the Dutch state government as to how recently acquired knowledge could be effectively transferred to the implementation of speeding policy to allow this knowledge to actually be put into practice. In order to discover what knowledge the implementors of road safety policy require and what form of presentation they prefer, interviews were conducted with several road <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities</b> and other bodies closely involved in the application of road safety measures, where the process of taking measures was more closely examined. The steps distinguished in this report are as follows: setting priorities with respect to road safety; approach and choice of measures; implementation of measures; financing; and activation of other parties. In all steps of the process, large differences appeared to exist between municipalities, provinces, police regions and Provincial Road Safety Boards (ROVs). These differences are due to various factors, such as the level of priority given to road safety, the personal interest in road safety {{and the degree to which}} parties motivate each other to take measures. Measures can be instigated via two forms of approach: curative or preventative. In general, it can be said that all bodies involved are most satisfied with the preventative method. The 'ad hoc' solutions are not described, as they are mainly granted in response to local protests, but generally have little or no long-term effect. Not all bodies put road safety high on the agenda. Many initiatives have been instigated to improve this: working groups, project groups, and courses. The impression is given that more, and more effective, measures are taken in regions where these types of activity are taking place. Also, the amount of time and manpower available to promote road safety has a bearing. Amongst the police, the effort expended on road safety appears to differ per region. In general, the recent internal reorganisation seems to have led to a reduction in local police familiarity. However, the greatest obstacle is that, as regards prioritising, road safety often 'loses' from the offensive against crime. All bodies seem to agree that the structural setting aside of road safety tasks would be the most effective solution to this problem. This would have to be expressed in terms of the allocation of permanent positions to perform this task. The general opinion was that the transfer of knowledge should preferably be realised through personal contacts. The missionary role was named in this context by various groups: someone who personally goes 'on the road' to activate, stimulate and support road <b>maintenance</b> <b>authorities</b> or police with respect to road safety policy. Particularly to stimulate municipalities, more time and manpower should be made available within the ROVs. In some provinces, this method has been applied for some time and good results have been achieved. In addition, a need was expressed for the exchange of information between the various bodies. It is thought that this can be achieved through structural cooperation relationships, in which representatives meet more often that is the case at present. There is also a need for a kind of overview of all experiments that have been performed, so that when choosing road safety measures, it is not necessary to 'invent the wheel' all over again.
