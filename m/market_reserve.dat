5|$|The area of Princes Street {{between the}} Exchange and <b>Market</b> <b>Reserve</b> was a {{frequent}} source of dispute {{in the early years}} of European settlement. This area, at that time on the foreshore of Otago Harbour was a traditional landing site for Māori waka. Captain Cargill, the founder of the new city, wished to follow the British practice of keeping the foreshore as public land. As the town spread, the area around the landing site became populated by settlers, and visiting Maori relied on the coastal strip as a place to set up their encampments. The southern Commissioner for Crown Lands, Walter Mantell noted the problem and proposed to his superiors in Wellington that a site be found at which the Māori could erect permanent structures, naming the Princes Street foreshore as the preferred site. Mantell and Cargill, who had been bitter political opponents for the control of the early settlement, quickly found themselves at loggerheads over the proposal, and disputes over the ownership and allocation of the land dragged on for over two decades, finally being settled in the courts in 1877.|$|E

Other prominent {{buildings of}} the period also designed with classical detailing include the Cairns Masonic Temple and the Cairns Post building.

In 1885 the Cairns Municipal Council was set up to administer the town area, and an allotment of land was set aside as a municipal reserve some blocks away from the main settlement of lower Abbott Street, on the corner of Aplin Street. The Cairns Municipal Council Chambers, a timber building, was constructed on the site, and in 1886 the Council applied for a public <b>market</b> <b>reserve</b> on land adjoining the municipal reserve fronting Lake Street, with a roadway entrance from Abbott Street.

30|$|The {{operations}} of PtG plants discussed in Sections  3.1 and 3.2 {{rely on the}} price signals in the energy market to compensate the high investment costs of PtG plants, while the results are not optimistic due to their high investment costs and high electricity prices in the energy market. In addition to the energy market, ancillary service markets such as regulation and <b>reserve</b> <b>markets</b> could provide additional revenues for PtG plants. Generally, the price for ancillary services, especially the service price for providing regulation service, is comparable to or even higher than the energy market prices. Typically, the PtG plants are capable to participate in regulation <b>market</b> and <b>reserve</b> <b>market,</b> where the prices of these services will provide additional rewards to the PtG plants.

The following study is assessing the economic impact of wind turbines participating in control <b>reserve</b> <b>markets</b> under different parameters. The assessment determines the maximum cost saving potential of wind turbines participating in secondary and tertiary control <b>reserve</b> <b>markets.</b> Results show that under current market conditions cost saving potentials can be achieved within the given scenarios. This will lead to decreasing balancing costs. In the first part (chapter 4 & 5) of the study it is explained how the offers from wind farms can be calculated. In order to bid on control <b>reserve</b> <b>markets</b> the wind park operator has to calculate an offer, which is based on a defined security level for the forecast. Therefore the operator will use probabilistic forecasts to calculate the offerable amount of control reserve. In the second part (chapter 6) these offers are entered into existing control reserve dispatch lists. The economic impact is evaluated as the difference between two scenarios. One that will serve as the reference scenario without wind turbine participation and one that includes the bids from wind farms. By this means different parameters are examined. This includes the variation of the security level, changes in the block length of control reserve products, bidding for positive and negative products and differences in the mechanism to proof the provision of energy from controlreserves for intermittent producers. Results show that cost saving potentials can reach up to 21 % in tertiary control <b>reserve</b> <b>market</b> and up to 24 % on secondary control <b>reserve</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R
