5|$|A <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> {{example is}} the {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{decorative}} pattern, {{designed in}} 1917 by Matrena Markevich, is {{displayed on the}} hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional 'rushnyk', a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> social functions, such as a host offering guests bread and salt served on a rushnyk.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E

50|$|The {{wings are}} {{terminated}} by pavilions which feature large sundials set beneath their pediments. The pavilions {{were intended to}} house dovecotes on the uppermost floor, while the rooms below were for wine-making, stables and domestic use. In many of Palladio's villas similar pavilions were little <b>more</b> than <b>mundane</b> farm buildings behind a concealing facade. A typical feature of Palladio's villa architecture, {{they were to be}} much copied and changed in the Palladian architecture inspired by Palladio's original designs.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to set, costume and prop details, DC provided access to footage from the films (in particular, scenes of Batman jumping from {{a building in}} [...] "Minor Setbacks" [...] derive from the films) to emphasize the differences between Batman's use of the OnStar system and the <b>more</b> normal <b>mundane</b> usage. In {{addition to}} DC having input on the scripts, customer research reminded the company that [...] "Batman always gets the villain," [...] which had apparently been missed.|$|R
5|$|Since its premiere, 2001: A Space Odyssey {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and interpreted by professional film critics, amateur writers and science fiction fans, {{virtually all of}} whom have mentioned its deliberate ambiguity. Questions about 2001 range from uncertainty about its deeper philosophical implications about humanity's origins and final destiny in the universe, to interpreting elements of the film's more enigmatic scenes such as the meaning of the monolith, or the final fate of astronaut David Bowman. There are also simpler and <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> questions about what drives the plot, in particular the causes of Hal's breakdown (explained in earlier drafts but kept mysterious in the film).|$|E
5|$|The {{dimensions}} of a Book of the Dead could vary widely; the longest is 40m long while some are {{as short as}} 1m. They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> texts; care was taken to frame the text within margins, and to avoid writing on the joints between sheets. The words peret em heru, or 'coming forth by day' sometimes appear on the reverse of the outer margin, perhaps acting as a label.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{methods have}} {{confirmed}} the high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in ancient Egypt. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts of garlic, probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under a mosquito net. However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> purpose of avoiding the discomfort of mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E
5000|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{called the}} film [...] "flawed but fascinating" [...] and a [...] "feverish {{plunge into the}} toxic cloud of decadence" [...] as Malick offers a [...] "corrosive {{critique}} of Hollywood hedonism". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said that the [...] "resolutely poetic and impressionist" [...] film [...] "conveys most bracingly the fleeting nature of human exchange", but the end result [...] "is a certain tedium and repetitiveness along with the rhythmic niceties and imaginative riffs... this one mostly operates on a <b>more</b> dramatically <b>mundane,</b> private and even narcissistic level The Tree of Life".|$|R
5000|$|The Guardian {{remarks that}} in the documentary, Wolf [...] "concentrates on the strange, {{bubbling}} energy and intensity", although he could have also presented the <b>more</b> sad or <b>mundane</b> aspects of teenage life.

40|$|Our paper {{analyzes}} {{the relation between}} social media and political movements in contemporary world. Many authors consider that social media, especially social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are responsible for triggering the revolutions in the Arab world.

Our response is that social media played an important, but only instrumental role...|$|R
5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> mass, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E
5|$|UNITY is {{a secret}} {{international}} organization headquartered somewhere in England that protects humanity from outsiders that want {{to take over the}} world. In 1960, over half of the UNITY's elite agents are murdered by an unknown assassin within a week, leaving UNITY with a critical manpower shortage. They are forced to send UNITY agent Cate Archer and her mentor, Bruno Lawrie, on a series of high-profile missions. Cate is an ex-, and is UNITY's first female spy operative. UNITY's leaders, Jones and Smith, are skeptical of Cate working as a field agent, and have previously relegated her to <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> assignments. Intelligence reveals that a Russian assassin named Dmitrij Volkov and a new terrorist organization named H.A.R.M. are responsible for the murders of UNITY's former agents. Cate and Bruno embark on a dangerous assignment in Morocco, which later turns out to be an ambush set up by Volkov and his men. Cate manages to escape Morocco whilst Bruno is shot by Volkov. In the UNITY headquarters, Jones and Smith reveal that Volkov killed Bruno simply because he was the traitor, to which Cate reacts with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and Old Time Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E
40|$|Computer-assisted {{interactive}} visualization {{has become}} a valuable tool for discovering the underlying meaning of tabular data, including categorical tabular data. The capabilities of the <b>more</b> traditionally <b>mundane</b> kinds of pictures like scatter plots can be expanded to usefully depict categorical tabular data by incorporating annotations and transforms, and by integrating the extensions into an interactive system. Keywords: annotation, categorical, data, glyph, multivariate, plot, scatter, tabular, transform, visualization. 1. Introduction Computer graphics and interactivity are great enablers for effective visual mining of multivariate tabular data. Larger and more diverse data domains are explorable and minable. Increasingly diverse types of meaningful pictures can be created, linked, and refined in real time. Transform functions, which remap data values according to an algorithm, can be dynamically applied and cascaded onto data variables to seek even more revealing visualizations [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{novel as}} a {{literary}} form has from the beginning tended toward a preoccupation with the daily concerns {{of the middle class}} and with the crises of average men and women. So {{it is no surprise that}} contemporary novelists dramatize the confrontation with evil in a <b>more</b> realistic and <b>mundane</b> manner than, say, Greek tragedy or the epic poem would. The evils in the 20 th century, as experienced by unexceptional and often antiheroic characters, fill the pages of important contemporary American novels...|$|R
50|$|Some militaries (including the People's Republic of China, Great Britain, Germany, Soviet Union and United States) have {{redesigned}} the bayonet {{used with}} their issued rifle to include survival knife features. Historically, bayonets had functioned poorly as field knives, due to being designed primarily {{to turn a}} rifle into a thrusting weapon and only secondarily (if at all) {{to work as a}} field knife. The newer models function <b>more</b> acceptably for <b>mundane</b> tasks while remaining capable of being attached to the muzzle of a rifle.|$|R

25|$|Technology is {{properly}} defined as any application of science {{to accomplish a}} function.

5000|$|Stéphane Miroux is a {{man whose}} vivid dreams and {{imagination}} often interfere with his ability to interact with reality. He is coaxed back to his childhood home after his divorced father passes away and his mother, Christine, finds him {{a job in a}} calendar printing company in France. His mother implies the position is a creative role, and he prepares colourful drawings, each showing a disaster, for his [...] "disasterology" [...] calendar. However, nobody appreciates his talents and it transpires that his mother had led him on - the real vacancy is for nothing <b>more</b> than <b>mundane</b> typesetting work. While leaving his apartment to go to work one day, Stéphane injures his hand helping his new neighbor move a piano into her apartment. The new neighbor, Stéphanie, invites Stéphane into her apartment (unaware that he lives next door) where her friend Zoé tends to his wound. Stéphane initially forms an attraction to Zoé, though he suspects it is instead Stéphanie who likes him.|$|R
5000|$|According to Kay, Kelsang Gyatso downplays the oracle of Shugden, {{since it}} {{conflicts}} with {{his notion of}} Shugden being a Buddha: the oracle may have been marginalised by Geshe Kelsang because his presence raised a doctrinal ambiguity for the NKT. According to traditional Tibetan teachings, none of the high-ranking supramundane protective deities ‘would condescend to interfere with <b>more</b> or less <b>mundane</b> affairs by speaking through {{the mouth of a}} medium’. The notion of oracular divination may thus have been problematised for Geshe Kelsang in light of his portrayal of Dorje Shugden as a fully enlightened being.|$|R
25|$|The former {{prisoners of}} war and the mutineers sailed Seringapatam to New South Wales, {{stopping}} in Otahite on the way.

25|$|Real-life {{crime scene}} {{investigators}} and forensic scientists warn that popular television shows like CSI (often specifically citing CSI) {{do not give}} a realistic picture of the work -- wildlly distorting the nature of crime-scene investigators' work, and exaggerating the ease, speed, effectiveness, drama, glamour, influence, scope, and comfort level of their jobs -- which they describe as far <b>more</b> <b>mundane,</b> tedious, limited, and boring, and very commonly failing to solve a crime.|$|E
5000|$|Kay {{notes the}} {{presence}} of the oracle of Shugden conflicts with Kelsang Gyatso's portrayal of Shugden as a Buddha, since Buddhas do not have oracles.

According to traditional Tibetan teachings, none of the high-ranking supramundane protective deities ‘would condescend to interfere with <b>more</b> or less <b>mundane</b> affairs by speaking through the mouth of a medium’ (NebeskyWojkowitz 1956: 409).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a group of six short stories that, as a whole, explore the {{conundrum}} of righteousness. They all ask the question of whether someone can be wrong even if they are, from a moralistic or power-holding point of view, correct. The title for this thesis, "Ex Vitro," is the Latin term for growing naturally. It is also the title of one of the stories. It holds an inherent irony, in that neither the plots nor the characters in these stories are permitted natural growth. The stories themselves are apportioned into two sections. The first, entitled "Foreign," examines a variety of moral conundrums from a science fiction/fantasy point of view. The second part, entitled "Domestic," focuses <b>more</b> on <b>mundane</b> family matters. Their critical focus is derived from the theories of Cultural Studies/New Historicism. The "Foreign" stories examine various issues through the prism of New Historicism. Each examines an institution, how it exercises its power, and how it affects individual constituents. The "Domestic" stories are closer to pure Cultural Studies. The characters in this section of the collection represented are ordinary, middle and lower-middle-class people grappling with commonplace struggles - infertility, home buying and health insurance coverage...|$|R
2500|$|Members of the Space: 1999 cast were {{disenchanted with}} the scripts. Martin Landau: [...] "They changed it because {{a bunch of}} American minds got into the act {{and they decided to}} do many things they felt were commercial. Fred Freiberger helped in some respects, but, overall, I don't think he helped the show, I think he brought a much <b>more</b> ordinary, <b>mundane</b> {{approach}} to the series." [...] One particular episode ('', which dealt with the threat of an intelligent rock) was of such allegedly deficient quality that it sparked a confrontation between Freiberger and the cast. Landau disliked the story so strongly that he wrote the following notes on his copy of the script: [...] "All the credibility we're building up is totally forsaken in this script."; [...] "...Story is told poorly."; and [...] "The character of Koenig takes a terrible beating in this script — We're all schmucks." [...] Anholt revealed that, [...] "the more the cast complained about a script's flaws, the more intractable and unyielding Freiberger became." [...] Dissatisfaction on Landau's part about scripts was not new to Year Two, though. Sylvia Anderson remembers that he often voiced criticisms of scripts during production of the first series.|$|R
25|$|On 25 July, Carpenter began DASH {{qualification}} trials and, {{although one}} drone malfunctioned and crashed at sea, the DASH control team successfully dropped three exercise torpedoes during evolutions in August.

25|$|With the {{creation}} of the first Yugoslavia, Meštrović's focus shifted to <b>more</b> <b>mundane</b> topics such as musical instruments or chapels. He particularly oriented himself towards religious items, mostly made of wood, under artistic influence from the Byzantine and Gothic architecture. The most renowned works from his early period are the Crucifix and Madonna; later he became inspired by Michelangelo Buonarroti and created a large number of stone reliefs and portraits. The Croatian dinar featured Meštrović's work History of the Croats.|$|E
25|$|Happiness forms {{a central}} theme of Buddhist teachings. For {{ultimate}} freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. <b>More</b> <b>mundane</b> forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see sukha). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings.|$|E
40|$|The {{main reason}} modern machine {{learning}} mechanisms outperform hand-crafted solutions is {{the availability of}} high-quality data in large quantities. We observe that although many day-to-day activities in software engineering (such as bug triaging, reverting regressions, or even implementing code for properly scoped problems) could possibly be automated, we lack the necessary monitoring tools to capture all relevant information. Bug trackers and version control rely mostly on plain text, and specifications are informal or at best semi-structured. After setting the stage via a short excursion to the year 2047, we discuss how a ubiquitous AI, which can learn from every interaction a human developer has with a machine, could take over more and <b>more</b> of the <b>mundane</b> responsabilities in software engineering. We outline how this change will affect software engineering practice as well as education...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} widely {{featured}} extraordinary substances in Crystalicum. Found on all worlds save one (The Planet), it develops underneath the Earth's surface and is therefore mined and extracted. The crystal has numerous uses. After being set in a special socket it can bestow the socketed item with special or magical properties. It {{can be used as a}} battery for crystal-based weaponry. Crystals power the Void-faring ships' engines. In fact, they power many <b>more</b> or less <b>mundane</b> devices, usually fitted to the crystal's elemental manifestation. They are also an integral part of focuses - items characters with magical abilities use to perform their magic (a Crystal fit to be set in a focus is both rare and valuable, since it cannot be worked in anyway, and must have developed the right shape naturally).|$|R
