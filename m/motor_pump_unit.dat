With {{the development of}} submersible linear <b>motor</b> technology, rodless <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> {{have been widely used}} in oil exploration. However, the ground indicator diagram method cannot be used to diagnose the working conditions of rodless <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> because {{it is based on the}} load change of the polished rod suspension point and its displacement.

The advantage of this new method is its use of a simple feature extraction method and advanced genetic algorithm to optimize the threshold and weight of the RBF neural network. In this paper, we extract the characteristic value from the operation parameters of the submersible linear motor and oil wellhead as the input vector of the fault diagnosis model.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate and enhance dynamic performance for a vertical <b>pumping</b> <b>unit.</b> The original electric <b>motor</b> of the <b>pump</b> <b>unit</b> had been replaced by another one different in design and weights. Vibration has been increased greatly after installing the new motor. Consequently, it is necessary to estimate the change in the vibration characteristics owing to the difference in the boundary conditions of the new motor. Measured vibration levels and frequency analysis were dangerous at 1 × due to resonance problem. Finite Element Analysis was used to model the motor structure in order to find its natural frequencies and mode shapes. The results confirm that the third natural frequency is very close to 1 × operating speed with deviation about 1 %. To solve the resonance problem, it was recommended to increase the structure stiffness. The results after modifications confirmed that the overall vibration level decreases by 89 %.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} of the research is to investigate the effect of periodic switching on/off in cyclical pumping on resistance to wear of high voltage electric <b>motors</b> of main <b>pump</b> <b>units.</b> Frequent <b>motors</b> starts in a cyclic pumping lead to accelerated wear of the mechanical motor parts owing {{to the impact of}} dynamic loads at startup, as well as winding insulation due to high inrush currents flow. As a result accelerated depreciation may decrease residual life, overhaul period and service life of electric motors. The main factors affecting the service life of insulation motors are winding temperature, and as a consequence, the thermal aging of the insulation. The use of variable frequency drive can significantly reduce the cyclic transfer modes, or even eliminate them. The authors obtained analytical expressions for the evaluation of insulation deterioration {{at the start of the}} motor, which allow us to study the impact of the following factors: insulation class, the start time, break time at work, initial and nominal temperature, the temperature rise of the windings over the ambient temperature. Cold starts and hot operating conditions, as well as the percentage of the hottest startups in the total number of starts have a drastic impact on insulation deterioration. The obtained expressions for the isolation depreciation are used to determine the change timing of overhauls of high voltage electric main <b>pump</b> <b>units.</b> The developed method was tested and approved by the use of a variable frequency drive at th...|$|R

40|$|This paper calls {{attention}} {{to the importance of}} social cooperation in irrigation farming. It argues that a mere focus on the technical aspect of irrigation, disregarding its social aspects undermines the long-term benefits of irrigation to rural livelihoods. This assertion draws on lessons from small-irrigation practices in Fogera, in the Blue Nile Basin of Ethiopia, where I conducted fieldwork-based qualitative research. In recent years irrigation farming has drawn a growing interest among farmers in rural Fogera. Farmers practise small-scale irrigation that includes traditional irrigation and <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Farmers assert that irrigation has brought farming benefits through cultivation of more crops as well as new crops that serve food and cash purposes. Such benefits have particularly spurred the enthusiasm for <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. However, the practice of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation largely relies on the motor-pump technology, overlooking the social scheme of irrigation. While traditional irrigation involves more social cooperation involving joint activities, water allocations and irrigation schedules, lack of social cooperation and such institutional conditions is widespread in <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. Local classification of irrigation practices also associate the mechanism of irrigation use and management including water use regulations and water use turns with traditional irrigation in contrast to <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation. The neglect of social cooperation within current practices of <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation will have significant adverse implications on long-term practices. Farmers have been already concerned about how competitions for water are growing, limiting the duration of water availability and creating water shortage. The study suggests that while farmers’ willingness to practise <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> irrigation in Fogera has been stimulated by its livelihood benefits, sustained benefits of this irrigation scheme require social cooperation and feasible institutional conditions that can mediate water usage across user villages...|$|R

40|$|Because of its versatility, {{electricity}} consumption {{continues to grow}} {{all over the world}} more rapidly than any other energy form. The portion of the United States' primary energy supply used as electricity has expanded from near zero {{at the turn of the}} century to 38 percent in 1987. Electric motors use as input about 64 % of all electricity in the U. S. and many other countries. The cost of powering motors in the U. S. is estimated to be roughly $ 90 billion a year. In terms of primary energy input, motor energy use in the U. S. is comparable to all auto energy use. Electric motors are the largest users of energy in all mineral extraction activities. In oil fields, electric <b>motors</b> drive the <b>pumping</b> <b>units</b> used for lifting the oil and water to the surface.

So far, actual motor loading of all operating oil fields motors has been determined by actual field measurements.

40|$|In agriculture, the {{coexistence}} of {{different forms of}} land tenancy or labour contract has been explained so far by several theories related to Marshallian inefficiency, incentives, risk sharing, and transaction costs, including supervision costs. These theories and the empirical evidences have greatly contributed to explain the reasons behind land tenancy or labour contract choice. This study follows up on this. Moreover, it intends to take a further step by focusing particularly on the production technologies at plot level, and by designing and testing a theoretical model based on household profit optimization. This model will {{take into account the}} supervision costs of labour (i) to compare optimum profit derived from plots based on household labour, a sharecropping labour contract, and a wage labour contract, controlling for irrigation equipment (ii) to test the efficiency of the labour contract choice using data from Senegal’s horticultural zone. As expected, the production elasticity of labour decreases when improved irrigation equipment like a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> is used. The technology displays an increasing return to scale on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> and a constant return to scale on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump.</b> While on plots without a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> the sharecropping contract is the efficient labour contract choice, leading to a higher optimum profit for the household, on plots irrigated with a <b>motor</b> <b>pump,</b> the wage contract is the best labour contract choice. Consequently, we can conclude from this finding that the use of a <b>motor</b> <b>pump</b> drives out the sharecropping contract in favour of household labour and the wage labour contract. land tenancy, labour, sharecropping, wage, contract, supervision, household, profit optimization, efficient, irrigation equipment, horticulture, Senegal, Agricultural Finance,...|$|R
