As Love later reflected, [...] "The {{best thing that ever}} {{happened}} to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E
2500|$|In her 2010 {{episode of}} Behind the Music, Courtney Love {{reflected}} on her formative years in rock music in Portland, Oregon, and said, [...] "The {{best thing that}} ever happened to <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> was Kat", noting their friendship and musical collaboration. Because of Kat's closeness with Kurt Cobain, Bjelland went to Seattle immediately after Kurt Cobain's death in 1994. Bjelland also participated in the Behind the Music segment on Love in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|She said, [...] "It is {{one thing}} for me to come before a public magistracy and there to speak what they would have me speak and another when a man comes to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of {{friendship}} privately." [...] Hutchinson's defense was that she had spoken only reluctantly and in private, and that she [...] "must either speak false or true in my answers" [...] in the ministerial context of the meeting. [...] The court, however, did not make any distinction between public and private statements.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that Reitman was working on a screenplay, based on Joyce Maynard's novel. Talking about the story, Reitman said that [...] "I read it, and I saw the movie in my head. It challenged <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that I liked. It was different from everything else I’ve read." [...] He also admitted that it was completely different from his previous work and said that [...] " [...] deals with a very complex drama. And I may not nail it on this film, it may just be my first step." [...] Reitman wanted to make the film right after his 2009 film Up in the Air, but due to Winslet's scheduling conflicts, he chose to direct Young Adult first.|$|E
2500|$|A planned {{film version}} of [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" [...] to star Diamond and Streisand fell through when Diamond instead starred in a 1980 remake of the Al Jolson classic The Jazz Singer {{alongside}} Laurence Olivier and Lucie Arnaz. Though the movie received poor reviews, the soundtrack spawned three Top 10 singles, [...] "Love on the Rocks", [...] "Hello Again", and [...] "America", the last of which had emotional significance for Diamond. [...] "'America' {{was the story of}} my grandparents," [...] he told an interviewer. [...] "It's my gift to them, and it's very real for <b>me</b> ... <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> it speaks to the immigrant in all of us." [...] The song was performed in full by Diamond during the finale of the film. (An abbreviated version played over the film's opening titles.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go at <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Joe Henry, with the former two also {{producing}} it. Ahmadzaï also provided programming, acoustic guitars and keyboards, while Michel Colombier arranged strings. It was composed using common time in the key of D major, with a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals range from the lower octave of G3 to the higher note of A4. Sonically, [...] "Don't Tell Me" [...] was considered [...] "a country meets dance" [...] track with trip hop beats infused with an acoustic [...] "folksy" [...] riff. During an interview for Interview Magazine, in March 2001, Madonna discussed the lyrics, stating, [...] "To me it is a romantic song. Just, you know, rip my skin off, do not tell me who I should love, or how I should love. Don’t tell me to give up. To <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> it’s like that Frank Sinatra song, 'If I can make it there, I’ll make it anywhere'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) and I hit on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track in my place during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that I had bought completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The get-up was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated myself on the plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E

60|$|I {{should have}} forgiven him altogether, I believe, {{if he had}} been in any manner apologetic to me; but he wasn't that. He kept reassuring <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> I found irritating. Mostly, however, his solicitude was for Aunt Susan and himself.|$|E
60|$|Lucy had {{not spoken}} the whole time I was {{relating}} my story. Her serene eye beamed on <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to betray the interest she felt; but not a syllable escaped her until her father had made the observation just given.|$|E
