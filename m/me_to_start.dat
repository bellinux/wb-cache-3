500|$|..... these {{poems are}} all in a {{particular}} set form which I have elaborated, and the word [...] "quartet" [...] does seem to <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> people {{on the right track}} for understanding them ("sonata" [...] in any case is too musical). It suggests to me the notion of making a poem by weaving in together three or four superficially unrelated themes: the [...] "poem" [...] being the degree of success in making a new whole out of them.|$|E
500|$|He joined Conference Premier rivals Cambridge United on {{a two-year}} {{contract}} for a £15,000 fee on 6 August 2008. His debut {{came in a}} 1–0 win away to Northwich Victoria on 9 August 2008, and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008. Soon after he was told by manager Gary Brabin to provide more support for the team's strikers, with Challinor agreeing, saying [...] "It will put the added responsibility on <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> shooting and take some pressure off the forwards. If the midfield can get some goals as well, then {{that will help the}} team". He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against Weymouth in a 1–0 home win on 11 October 2008, coming from a low right-footed shot into the corner from 25yards.|$|E

It is {{the conclusion of}} the doctors here in London that I must undergo surgery immediately. Unfortunately, the timing of this urgent surgery does not allow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> touring in early October because of the required period of hospitalization and recuperation. I must remain optimistic that all will turn out well".|$|E

He inspired me. He’s been able to have these conversations with me since the mid ’80s. He pushed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> writing Little Earthquakes, so he’s been in my life for so long. (Before July of last year), I hadn’t seen him for 14 years. And even though he’s 70, he’s as sharp as he ever was.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{trustees}} of the Studio Museum in Harlem read my proposal, interviewed me and hired <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> an Artist-in-Residence program. [...] That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue). [...] It was a loft, a factory {{going out of business}} that had a lot of sewing machines in it. [...] Mel Edwards and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program. [...] That was the beginning. [...] I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program."

2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he was going to call The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines." ...|$|E
