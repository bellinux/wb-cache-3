5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> divided into three parts: the primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control muscle tone, posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E
5|$|In around 1 {{percent of}} infections, {{poliovirus}} spreads along certain nerve fiber pathways, preferentially replicating in and destroying motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or <b>motor</b> <b>cortex.</b> This {{leads to the}} development of paralytic poliomyelitis, the various forms of which (spinal, bulbar, and bulbospinal) vary only with the amount of neuronal damage and inflammation that occurs, and the region of the CNS affected.|$|E
5|$|The brain {{contains}} several motor {{areas that}} project {{directly to the}} spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, {{which is responsible for}} coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|Paul Broca {{associated}} {{regions of}} the brain with specific functions, in particular language in Broca's area, following work on brain-damaged patients. John Hughlings Jackson described {{the function of the}} <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> by watching the progression of epileptic seizures through the body. Carl Wernicke described a region associated with language comprehension and production. Korbinian Brodmann divided {{regions of the}} brain based on the appearance of cells. By 1950, Sherrington, Papez, and MacLean had identified many of the brainstem and limbic system functions. The capacity of the brain to re-organise and change with age, and a recognised critical development period, were attributed to neuroplasticity, pioneered by Margaret Kennard, who experimented on monkeys during the 1930-40s.|$|E
5|$|The cortex {{is mapped}} by {{divisions}} into about fifty different functional areas known as Brodmann's areas. These areas are distinctly different when seen under a microscope. The cortex {{is divided into}} two main functional areas – a <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> and a sensory cortex. The primary sensory areas receive signals from the sensory nerves and tracts by way of relay nuclei in the thalamus. Primary sensory areas include the visual cortex of the occipital lobe, the auditory cortex in parts of the temporal lobe and insular cortex, and the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe. The primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> which sends axons down to motor neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord, occupies the rear portion of the frontal lobe, {{directly in front of the}} somatosensory area. The remaining parts of the cortex, are called the association areas. These areas receive input from the sensory areas and lower parts of the brain and are involved in the complex cognitive processes of perception, thought, and decision-making. The main functions of the frontal lobe are to control attention, abstract thinking, behavior, problem solving tasks, and physical reactions and personality. The occipital lobe is the smallest lobe; its main functions are visual reception, visual-spatial processing, movement, and colour recognition. There is a smaller occipital lobule in the lobe known as the cuneus. The temporal lobe controls auditory and visual memories, language, and some hearing and speech.|$|E

25|$|Patients with SPS {{generally}} have high amounts of high {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} antibody titers. About 80 percent of SPS patients have GAD antibodies, compared with about {{one percent of the}} general population. The overwhelming majority of people who have GAD antibodies do not contract SPS, indicating that systematic synthesis of the antibody is not the sole cause of SPS. GAD, a presynaptic autoantigen, is generally thought to {{play a key role in}} the condition, but exact details of the way that autoantibodies affect SPS patients are not known. Most SPS patients with high-titer GAD antibodies also have antibodies that inhibit GABA-receptor-associated protein (GABARAP). Autoantibodies against amphiphysin and gephyrin are also sometimes found in SPS patients. The antibodies appear to interact with antigens in the brain neurons and the spinal cord synapses, causing a functional blockade with gamma-aminobutyric acid. This leads to GABA impairment, which probably causes the stiffness and spasms that characterizes SPS. There are low GABA levels in the <b>motor</b> <b>cortexes</b> of SPS patients.|$|R
40|$|Functional {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (fNIRS) is recently utilized as a {{new approach}} to assess resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in the human brain. For any new technique or new methodology, it is necessary to be able to replicate similar experiments using different instruments in order to establish its liability and reproducibility. We apply two different diffuse optical tomographic (DOT) systems (i. e., DYNOT and CW 5), with various probe arrangements to evaluate RSFC in the sensorimotor cortex by utilizing a previously published experimental protocol and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results exhibit similar spatial patterns and strengths in RSFC between the bilateral <b>motor</b> <b>cortexes.</b> The consistent observations are obtained from both DYNOT and CW 5 systems, and are also in good agreement with the previous fNIRS study. Overall, we demonstrate that the fNIRS-based RSFC is reproducible by various DOT imaging systems among different research groups, enhancing the confidence of neuroscience researchers and clinicians to utilize fNIRS for future applications...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{present study}} {{hypothesized}} {{that side of}} stroke and level of recovery influence motor system organization after stroke. Methods—Functional MRI was performed on 14 control subjects and 21 patients with chronic stroke during index finger tapping (control subjects, right; patients, recovered side). Results—On functional MRI, stroke patients with right arm involvement showed (1) significantly smaller activation in contralateral <b>motor</b> <b>cortexes</b> compared with control subjects; (2) smaller ipsilateral (nonstroke) premotor and larger contralateral (stroke-side) sensorimotor activation compared with patients with left arm involvement, although electromyogram across groups was similar; and (3) 2. 7 -fold–larger contralateral sensorimotor cortex activation, ventrally, in those with full recovery compared with those with partial recovery, despite similar tapping force, frequency, range of motion, and electromyogram between groups. Supplementary motor area activation was unrelated to level of recovery. Conclusions—After stroke that causes mild to moderate initial impairment and mild residual hand weakness, cortical organization varies with side of injury and with final motor status. The findings may have implications for treatment after stroke. (Stroke. 2003; 34 :e 23 -e 28.) Key Words: brain mapping neuronal plasticity recovery of functio...|$|R
25|$|Studies that {{developed}} algorithms to reconstruct movements from <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> neurons, which control movement, {{date back to}} the 1970s.

He also found that dispersed groups of neurons, in different areas of the monkey's brains, collectively controlled motor commands, but was able to record the firings of neurons in only one area at a time, because of the technical limitations imposed by his equipment.|$|E
25|$|Oscillations {{have been}} {{commonly}} {{reported in the}} motor system.

Using intra-cortical recordings, similar changes in oscillatory activity {{were found in the}} <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> when the monkeys performed motor acts that required significant attention. In addition, oscillations at spinal level become synchronised to beta oscillations in the <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> during constant muscle activation, as determined by cortico-muscular coherence. Likewise, muscle activity of different muscles reveals inter-muscular coherence at multiple distinct frequencies reflecting the underlying neural circuitry involved in motor coordination.|$|E
25|$|A neural {{model for}} {{voluntary}} action proposed by Haggard comprises two major circuits.

The second involving the parietal-pre-motor circuit for object-guided actions, for example grasping (premotor cortex, primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> primary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex, {{and back to}} the premotor cortex). He proposed that voluntary action involves external environment input ('when decision'), motivations/reasons for actions (early 'whether decision'), task and action selection ('what decision'), a final predictive check (late 'whether decision') and action execution.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSomatoform {{disorders}} (SD) {{are common}} medical disorders with prevalence rates between 3. 5 % and 18. 4 %, depending on country and medical setting. SD {{as outlined in}} the ICD- 10 exhibits various biological, social, and psychological pathogenic factors. Little {{is known about the}} neural correlates of SD. The aims of this meta-analysis are to identify neuronal areas that are involved in SD and consistently differ between patients and healthy controls. We conducted a systematic literature research on neuroimaging studies of SD. Ten out of 686 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed using activation likelihood estimation. Five neuronal areas differ between patients with SD and healthy controls namely the premotor and supplementary <b>motor</b> <b>cortexes,</b> the middle frontal gyrus, the anterior cingulate cortex, the insula, and the posterior cingulate cortex. These areas seem to have a particular importance for the occurrence of SD. Out of the ten studies two did not contribute to any of the clusters. Our results seem to largely overlap with the circuit network model of somatosensory amplification for SD. It is conceivable that functional disorders, independent of the clinical impression, show similar neurobiological processes. While overlaps do occur it is necessary to understand single functional somatic syndromes and their aetiology for future research, terminology, and treatment guidelines...|$|R

Aphasia is the inability to speak, and {{can be caused by}} damage to Broca's area or the <b>motor</b> <b>cortex.</b> Alexia is the inability to read, which can arise from damage to Wernicke's area, among other places. Agraphia is the inability to write which can also arise from damage to Broca's area or the <b>motor</b> <b>cortex.</b> In addition, damage to large areas of the brain can result in any combinations of these disorders, as well as a loss of other abilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{source of}} {{nonlinearity}} in the fMRI response {{is from the}} refractory period, where brain activity from a presented stimulus suppresses further activity on a subsequent, similar, stimulus. As stimuli become shorter, the refractory period becomes more noticeable. The refractory period does not change with age, nor do the amplitudes of HDRs. The period differs across brain regions. In both the primary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex</b> and the visual cortex, the HDR amplitude scales linearly with duration of a stimulus or response. In the corresponding secondary regions, the supplementary <b>motor</b> <b>cortex,</b> which is involved in planning motor behavior, and the motion-sensitive V5 region, a strong refractory period is seen and the HDR amplitude stays steady {{across a range of}} stimulus or response durations.

During the concentric phase, however, the <b>motor</b> and pre-motor <b>cortex</b> (BA 4 / 6) was recruited when contrasted to the eccentric phase. Interestingly, the brain activity of this region was reduced, when compared to the mean activity of the session, during the eccentric phase. Thus, the neural mechanisms governing imagined concentric and eccentric contractions appear to differ. We propose that the recruitment of the pre-frontal cortex is due to an increased demand of regulating force during the eccentric phase.
