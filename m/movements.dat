5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like <b>movements.</b> In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating. These <b>movements</b> are usually abrupt and irregular and present during both rest and sleep.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal <b>movements,</b> {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal <b>movements,</b> for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid <b>movements</b> may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful <b>movements</b> or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless <b>movements</b> such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal <b>movements</b> such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

5|$|The cantata {{is written}} in seven <b>movements,</b> with a {{symmetrical}} form: {{the first and last}} <b>movements</b> are for chorus and orchestra; the second and sixth <b>movements</b> are recitatives; the third and fifth <b>movements</b> are arias in two parts with da capo repeats only for the instrumental ritornello; and the central fourth movement is an accompanied solo. The metrical English translations below of the texts of the first six <b>movements</b> are by Henry Sandwith Drinker; and that of the seventh movement (chorale) is from the 1722 Psalmodica Germanica of John Christian Jacobi and Isaac Watts.|$|E

5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated <b>movements</b> pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries <b>movements</b> from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The cranial nerves carry <b>movements</b> related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E
5|$|The <b>movements</b> 1 (Magnificat), 7 (Fecit potentiam) and 12 (Gloria patri) are the {{cornerstones}} of the composition: {{they are}} in the tonic key (E major for BWV 243a, D major for BWV 243), and are the only <b>movements</b> that feature a five-part chorus as well as a tutti orchestra. The chorus also sings in movement 4 (Omnes generationes), accompanied by an orchestra without trumpets and timpani. Each of these four choral <b>movements</b> are, in the version without the Christmas hymns, followed by two <b>movements</b> for a vocal soloist, the second one often with richer scoring. In the <b>movements</b> for vocal soloists the instrumentation is as usual in Bach's cantata's: the soloists are accompanied by an obbligato instrument, only strings and/or continuo. Movement A (Vom Himmel hoch) is the only a cappella movement.|$|E

The melody is similar to that of the opening, which hints at the cyclic form of the piece.

40|$|Induced <b>movement,</b> illusory <b>movement</b> in a {{stationary}} stimulus resulting from adjoining <b>movement,</b> has received steady experimental investigation {{over the last}} 70 years or so. It is observed under different viewing conditions {{in a wide variety}} of displays that differ considerably in overall size and in form of inducing and induced stimuli. Explanations have been diverse, some being based on relations within the display and others invoking mediation by other aspects of the observer's perception. Probably, no one explanation can account for all forms of induced <b>movement.</b> Current knowledge about induced <b>movement</b> may have important implications for visual perception of object morion. Induced <b>movement</b> is one of a number of phenomena—including apparent <b>movement,</b> autokinetic <b>movement,</b> and <b>movement</b> aftereffect—in which <b>movement</b> is perceived, although the corresponding distal stimulus is physically stationary.
