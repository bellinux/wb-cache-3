25|$|Advances {{in recent}} decades greatly lowered the cost of wind power {{making it one of}} the most {{competitive}} alternate energies and competitive with higher priced natural gas (before shale gas). Wind energy's <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source.|$|E
25|$|Grignard {{reagents}} {{are produced}} in industry {{for use in}} situ, or for sale. As with a bench-scale, the <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that of initiation; {{a portion of a}} previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator. Grignard reactions are exothermic, and this exothermicity must be considered when a reaction is scaled-up from laboratory to production plant.|$|E

With all the traffic passing by, the Inn is a perfect cover for Company {{research}} and other work. However, when Mendoza arrives, the <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> lighting a fire to cook dinner, given that everything is soaked by the rain.|$|E
25|$|A <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that, as {{with other}} types of phylogenetic inferences, the actual {{evolutionary}} history cannot be established with certainty. As a result, it is difficult to obtain a representative test set of HGT events. Furthermore, HGT inference methods vary considerably in the information they consider and often identify inconsistent groups of HGT candidates: it is not clear to what extent taking the intersection, the union, or some other combination of the individual methods affects the false positive and false negative rates.|$|E
25|$|The most {{irreparable}} type of desertification is the salinization {{process that}} forms marshy salt flats. A major factor {{that contributes to}} these conditions is inefficient use of water because of weak regulation and failure to charge for water that is used. Efficiency in application of water to the fields is low, but the <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> leakage in main and secondary canals, especially Turkmenistan's main canal, the Karakum Canal. Nearly half of the canal's water seeps out into lakes and salt swamps along its path. Excessive irrigation brings salts to the surface, forming salt marshes that dry into unusable clay flats. In 1989 Turkmenistan's Institute for Desert Studies claimed that the area of such flats had reached 10,000km².|$|E

25|$|Findings {{on general}} {{investigations}} (such as blood tests) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{the distinction between}} cholesterol embolism and vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction. Worsening kidney function after an angiogram may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure (contrast nephropathy). Other causes {{that may lead to}} similar symptoms include ischemic renal failure (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as thrombotic microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).|$|E
25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E
25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

50|$|Scott's <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> {{that there}} was very little detail on the surface. The best images of the site only had 66 ft (20 m) {{resolution}} and photoanalysers had overenhanced the images. The <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> overestimating the depth of craters, so as to make them have shadows at higher sun angles. Fortunately he was able to see four craters, Matthew, Mark, Luke and Index (the reason it was called Index and not John was due to Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an outspoken atheist who had sued NASA over the reading of Genesis during Apollo 8. Although she lost the case, NASA remained squeamish on overtly religious announcements on later flights).|$|R

500|$|Kill the Irishman {{contains}} four historical inaccuracies. This {{has been}} noted by critics, one of whom said the film's <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that it seemed [...] "all too willing to sacrifice historical accuracy {{in the name of}} an easy-to-digest narrative". Shondor Birns was murdered on March 29, 1975, whereas in the film this occurs on March 8. The movie also misspells the name of a nearby parish known as 'St. Malachi's'; in the movie it is spelled 'St. Malichy's'.|$|E
500|$|The ISR defines three {{forms of}} inner-party supervision: top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top and peer-to-peer. Of the three, bottom-to-top {{is the least}} {{institutionalised}} and was presented as the moral – but not institutional – responsibility of ordinary party members. The mechanism for lodging complaints against higher-level party officials or proposing their dismissal was unspecified. According to Ting Gong, the <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that if an ordinary party member lodges a complaint or accuses an official of corruption, [...] "there {{is no guarantee that}} personal petitions will be accommodated or even processed as they are subject to further investigation and the approval of higher-level authorities".|$|E
500|$|Kemp was {{a critic}} of {{association}} football, known as soccer in the United States. In 1986, during a House floor debate over whether the United States should host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, Kemp proclaimed: [...] "I {{think it is important}} for all those young out there—who someday hope to play real football, where you throw it and kick it and run with it and put it in your hands— a distinction should be made that football is democratic capitalism, whereas soccer is a European socialist sport." [...] Kemp compared his speech to George Carlin's 1984 comedy routine on the differences between baseball and American football and wrote that his [...] "tongue was firmly planted in cheek" [...] when making the speech. Despite the levity of the speech, it garnered significant backlash. However, he continued to insist that soccer's <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> [...] "it doesn't have a quarterback". Kemp noted that about half of his grandchildren play or have played organized soccer and claimed to have [...] "changed" [...] his position on soccer. He even attended the 1994 FIFA World Cup with longtime soccer fan Henry Kissinger, although he wrote during the 2006 FIFA World Cup that soccer can be interesting to watch but is still a [...] "boring game".|$|E

[...] "The Alliance isn't some evil empire", he explains, but rather a largely benevolent bureaucratic force. The Alliance's <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that it seeks to govern everyone, {{regardless}} of whether they desire to belong to the central government or not.

The <b>main</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{that each of the}} local database management systems may be using a different type of concurrency control scheme. Integrating this is a challenging problem, made worse if we wish to preserve the local autonomy of each of the local databases, and allow local and global transactions to execute in parallel. One simple solution is to restrict global transactions to retrieve-only access. However, the issue of reliable transaction {{management in}} the general case, where global and local transactions are allowed to both read and write data, is still open." ...|$|E
