In this study, the membrane material challenges of post combustion carbon dioxide capture performed in a membrane contactor are developed with a 30 % aqueous MEA solution as chemical solvent. A simple, sensitive, non destructive and relevant experimental technique based on gas permeability measurement is proposed in order to estimate membrane / solvent compatibility.

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) fibers can be {{manufactured}} to form nets which can find application as prosthesis in hernioplasty. One {{of the most}} important problem to deal with when nets are applied in vivo consists in the reproduction of bacteria within the net fibers intersections. This occurs right after the application of the prosthesis, and causes infections, thus it is fundamental to remove bacteria in the very early stage of the nets application. This paper deals with the physico-chemical characterization of such nets, pre-treated by atmospheric pressure plasma dielectric barrier discharge apparatus (APP-DBD) and functionalized with an antibiotic drug such as chitosan. The physico-chemical characterization of sterilized nets, before and after the functionalization with chitosan, was carried out by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with EDS spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, drop shape analysis (DSA), X-ray diffraction and thermal analyses (TGA and DSC). The aim of the work is to individuate a good strategy to characterize this kind of materials, to understand the effects of polypropylene pre-treatment on functionalization efficiency, to follow the <b>materials</b> <b>ageing</b> in order to study the effects of the surface treatment for in vivo applications...|$|E

For some <b>materials</b> <b>ageing</b> is negatively addressed as decaying, for other ones it may have a positive effect to be defined as evolution or maturation. What are the factors that lead to a positive or a negative perception of ageing objects? In other words, what parameters and emotions are ultimately bonded to the idea of evolution or decay? Our main intent is to move the first steps needed to answer these questions to support designers during the phase of material selection.

40|$|Many {{membrane}} suppliers recommend sdium hypochlorite (NaOCl) as cleaning agent. Despite {{the popularity}} of this chemical for membrane cleaning, {{there is still a}} lack of publications regarding NaOCl short- and long-term effect on fouling removal. To properly conduct this optimization study (i. e. obtain the required level of reproducibility and confidence), a rigorous methodology was proposed and applied in this paper. The results indicated that cleaning efficiency varied between single and cyclical (i. e. repeated fouling/cleaning cycles) cleanings. While 1 % of NaOCl provided 95 % efficiency in single cleaning, only 87 % removal efficiency was observed during cyclical cleanings. The potential effect of NaOCl on polymeric <b>materials</b> <b>ageing</b> has drawn attention and recent studies have been dedicated {{to assess the impact of}} its exposure on numerous membrane materials. Still, the effect of NaOCl on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, commonly used in membrane material for water and wastewater treatment) is discussed in limited references only. Under accelerated cleaning conditions (2 % NaOCl), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) showed chemical changes in membrane functional groups of the PVDF flat sheet membrane, indicating possible ageing effect. This ageing study revealed that PVDF membrane exhibited a two-step-degradation mechanism: first, the removal of its surface modification substance, followed by the increase of its relative hydrophilicity. These results were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR spectroscopy, contact angle and hydraulic measurements...|$|E

The Cu-rich low-alloy heat-resistant steel 15 NiCuMoNb 5 (WB 36, material number 1. 6368) which is used as piping and vessel material in boiling water reactor (BWR) and pressurized water reactor (PWR) nuclear power plants in Germany was under special investigations. In all damage situations observed in plants, the operating temperature was between 320 ° and 350 oC. and the damage was combined with a shift in the ductile-to-brittle-transition-temperature (ADBTT) of the notched-bar impact test to higher temperatures. Micromagnetic NDT techniques were applied to characterize the material degradation which is enhanced when low cycle fatigue loads are superimposed to the precipitation process of Cu-rich particles. As Cu-rich-precipitates play also an essential role in neutron embrittlement of pressure vessel material, the same NDT techniques were applied to predict ADBTT at irradiated Charpy specimen. Austenitic stainless steel A 1 S 1 321 is used in German plants as surge- and spray-pipeline material which under service is exposed to cyclic thermo-mechanical loads. The contribution in the long Version will document the ability of ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements to sensitively characterize the whole fatigue life from the beginning to the end of life.

40|$|MBR {{suppliers}} {{are largely}} recommending NaOCl as the cleaning agent. Despite {{the popularity of}} this chemical for membrane cleaning, {{there is a lack}} of publications regarding NaOCl optimum cleaning conditions. To properly conduct this optimization study (i. e. obtain the required level of reproducibility and confidence), a rigorous methodology is still required. The potential effect of NaOCl on polymeric <b>materials</b> <b>ageing</b> has drawn attention and recent studies have been dedicated to assess the impact of its exposure on numerous membrane materials (except polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)). PVDF and polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers were investigated using unwashed yeast as model fouling solution, while mixture of sodium alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) acted as feed solution for PVDF flat sheet. The cleaning efficiency and optimum NaOCl concentration were found to vary between the different membrane materials and between single and cyclical cleanings. During cyclical cleaning, foulant was more difficult to remove. When 2 % NaOCl was used, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy showed a change in membrane function groups on PVDF flat sheet, indicating ageing occurrence. NaOCl agemg caused changes in membrane properties. PP hollow fibers became more brittle with 60 % elongation decrease after 13 weeks. PVDF flat sheet membrane exhibited two-steps-degradation mechanism; firstly, the removal of its surface modification substance, and secondly, the increase of its hydrophilicity. These results were confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR Spectroscopy, contact angle and hydraulic measurement. Enzyme is an alternative option for membrane cleaning. However, the enzymatic cleaning study did not present encouraging results. Optimum cleaning efficiency for protease (68 %) and amylase (73 %) were found to be lower compared to NaOCl cleaning (95 %). Lowry and Dubois methods found that residual foulants were present on the membrane after the cleaning process, which caused fouling to occur faster when membrane was re-used...|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive testing (NDT) {{is mainly}} {{discussed}} as inspection task to detect materials non-regularities and/or inhomogeneities after certain production process steps (casting, forging, rolling, joining, welding, etc.) {{of the material}} and components. The task is to detect and to classify non-conformities which very often also are named 'defects' of which the size is a lifetime limiting factor under static as well as cyclic loads. Concerning the number of NDT-applications in practice this task is still {{at the top of}} the list if we discuss safety relevant components which during lifetime are under mechanical loads superimposed by other ageing effects like thermal ageing, creep and corrosion. However, in the last decades NDT has more and more developed also microstructure- and stress-sensitive technology which nowadays has a breakthrough in on-line process monitoring and control. These NDT-technologies with their measuring quantities show potential to early detect <b>materials</b> <b>ageing</b> and degradation or to find correlation to mechanical properties like the yield strength, tensile strength or the hardness. Systems were recently developed to on-line characterize these properties, for instance, in a hot-dip-galvanizing line in the steel sheet production for car bodies or in the rolling mill for heavy steel plates. Railway traffic has to be safely performed the more high speed trains are in use which suffer under fatigue and wear - mainly restricted of the near-surface regions in wheels as well in the rail. IZFP has developed automated systems which are in application for a daily quick check of the surface state, i. e. in order to detect surface-breaking nonconformities. In that case the train rolls at low speed (4 - 6 km/h) on a track with EMAT-transducers build-in the rails. Other systems check the wheel after 150000 km running distance or after 25 o 000 km if the wheels are removed from the cars in order to re-profiling the surface. Pipelines are the most safe transportation facility of oil and gas, compared with for instance tankers, however, the lines are under influence of the medium, the load and corrosion effects. Therefore pipelines are periodically inspected by so-called 'intelligent pigs', i. e. inspection tools based on magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic inspection which are pumped with the medium through the pipe detecting corrosion wall thinning or even stress corrosion cracking. The contribution introduces into the different inspection tasks, the NDT systems developed and their potential to contribute to an economical and safe technical world...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work involves {{the study of}} the effects of the nanometric-scale silicon carbide particulates (n-SiCp) on the mechanical properties of the Al 7075 alloy. In the last few years, nanometric-scale reinforcements have shown the potential for revolutionary changes in the metal matrix composites to replace the existing monolithic alloys and their composites reinforced with micrometric-scale reinforcements. In this study an attempt was made to introduce hard nanometric-scale particulates in a high strength (Al 7075) matrix for possible achievement of novel properties in the composites. The project work was divided into: (a) synthesis of both the monolithic Al and its composites using the powder metallurgy (P/M) technique, (b) tensile testing and dry abrasive testing of all the materials, (c) explanation of the experimental results obtained and the microstructural characterization of all the materials using diffractometry, metallographic techniques and microscopy. Firstly, both the unreinforced Al and its composites were synthesized using the P/M and hot extrusion route. Reinforcement particulates of micrometric-size (&# 956;-SiCp) and nanometric-size (n-SiCp) along with their different volume fractions were added separately to study their effects on the mechanical behaviour of the Al rix. T 6 (solution treatment and artificial ageing) heat treatment was used to increase the hardness and strength of all the <b>materials.</b> <b>Ageing</b> behaviour was studied to observe any effect of the reinforcement particulates on the ageing kinetics and hardness of the composites. X-ray diffraction was performed to determine the crystal structures of all the materials and any reaction phase formed in the composites. Tensile tests were performed to measure the stiffness, 0. 2 % yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and ductility of all the materials at both room and levated temperatures. Dry abrasive wear tests were used to measure wear rates of all the materials. The n-SiCp were not uniformly dispersed in the Al matrix and clustered mainly at the grain boundaries. Clustering increased with increases in the volume fraction of the n-SiCp. Stiffness of the composites increased and the ductility decreased with an increase in the volume fraction of the reinforcement particulates at both room and elevated temperatures. Enhancement in the stiffness of the composites was higher at elevated temperature than at room temperature. Strength of the composites remained the same in comparison with that of the monolithic Al and no change was observed with increases in the volume fraction of the n-SiCp. The n-SiCp proved to be a better reinforcement than the traditional &# 956;-SiCp in terms of imparting higher ductility to the composite. The abrasive wear rate decreased with the addition of the n-SiCp in the Al matrix. It was found to be dependent on the particulate size and its volume fraction. The wear resistance of the &# 956;-SiCp/Al composite was higher than those of the n-SiCp/Al composites and it was attributed to the large size of the &# 956;-SiCp. Fractography and microscopy using optical, scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy were performed for failure analysis and microstructural analysis of all the materials. The incorporation of the reinforcement particulates altered the nature of fracture from being ductile in the unreinforced Al to brittle in the composites. At elevated temperature, the fracture mechanism transformed from brittle to ductile rupture in the composites. In summary, inclusion of the n-SiCp in a very little amount demonstrated that they have the ability to further improve the performance of the high strength Al 7 xxx series alloys. Non-uniform dispersion and clustering of the particulates are considered to be the main hindrances in utilising their full potential. It is believed that after fixing these issues the strength and other mechanical properties of the Al matrix can be further increased...|$|E

The assessment of <b>material</b> <b>ageing</b> requires narmally extensive destructive testing by using different kinds of testing and samples. One example is the use of the Charpy impact technique. The possibility to use of Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, for assessing <b>material</b> <b>ageing</b> is very promising and needs further investigation, assessment and qualification. The possibility to qualify Non Destructive Techniques, NDT, at least for some of the above mentioned ageing cases, would make the studies on ageing and the relative assessment much easier and cheaper, saving a lot o f money and resources in Europe. Futhermore, it would make it possible to assess on site various components that now-a-days can only be assessed either by calculation or by means of very expensive sample gaining techniques. This last factor would mean a terrific increase in EC citizen safety.
