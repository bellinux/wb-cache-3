5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, Welsh hopes of {{advancing}} the cause of female suffrage centred around the Liberal Party and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, {{one of the most}} important Welsh politicians of the day. After Liberal success in the 1906 Election failed to materialise into political change, suffragettes and in particular members of the <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), took a hard line stance towards their Members of Parliament, engaging in direct action against them.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{participation}} {{in the civil rights}} movement, King was criticized by many groups. This included opposition by <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> blacks such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Stokely Carmichael was a separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. Omali Yeshitela urged Africans to remember the history of violent European colonization and how power was not secured by Europeans through integration, but by violence and force.|$|E
5|$|Like Nasser, Gaddafi favoured the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and his group, Fatah, over <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> and Marxist Palestinian groups. As {{the years}} progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{night after}} the first shootings, five <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> were killed in gun battles with police and two more were arrested. More police officers {{were reported to have}} been killed or injured during the firefights.|$|R
5000|$|The Director General of Jammu and Kashmir Police {{said that}} [...] "Pakistan-based militant outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba" [...] is {{responsible}} for the attack. Subsequently Indian Police arrested Mohammad Abdullah alias Abu Talah of Lashkar-e-Taiba in connection with this massacre. Seven <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> belonging to Lashkar-e-Taiba were arrested later.|$|R
5000|$|The Palestinian militants moved {{positions}} frequently {{during the}} more than 4 hours of fighting creating the impression that many <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> were involved. They lured Israeli forces off the [...] "Path of Worshipers" [...] into the narrow alley, later known as the [...] "Alley of Death".|$|R
5|$|However, after 1912 {{he became}} more radical and began to {{predicted}} the liberation of the Africans {{and the end of}} colonial rule, and began to foster closer links with a number of other independent African churches. From 1914, he preached <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> sermons, often referring to Old Testament themes, concentrating on such aspects as the Israelites' escape from slavery in Egypt , Chilembwe himself {{was not part of the}} apocalyptic Watch Tower movement, which was popular in central Africa at the time and later became known as Kitawala in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but some of his followers may have been influenced by it. The leader of Watch Tower, Charles Taze Russell had predicted that Armageddon would begin in October 1914, which some of Chilembwe’s followers equated to an end to colonial rule.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Mandela {{published}} Long Walk to Freedom, {{an autobiography}} based around a manuscript {{he had written}} in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in Bloemfontein, at which a <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she {{expressed an interest in}} reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation of immigrant middle-class women, there was still a definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E
50|$|December 5, four <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> {{are shot}} dead. Two NATO {{soldiers}} are wounded in Kandahar by a suicide bomber. A British {{attack on a}} Taliban-held valley results {{in the death of}} one soldier and wounding of another. The attack is repelled and British forces fail to complete their objectives.|$|R

50|$|The Nagalim is a {{proposed}} independent {{country for the}} Naga people. In the 1950s, the Naga National Council led a violent unsuccessful insurgency against the Government of India, demanding a separate country for the Nagas. The secessionist violence decreased considerably after {{the formation of the}} Naga-majority Nagaland state, and <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> surrendered after the Shillong Accord of 1975. However, the majority of Nagas, operating under the various factions of National Socialist Council of Nagaland, continue to demand a separate country.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2013, it was {{reported}} that the US had drastically scaled back drone attacks in order to appease the Pakistani military, which was under growing pressure to move to end American [...] "airspace violations". The CIA was instructed to be more [...] "cautious" [...] and limit the drone strikes to high-value targets, to cut down on so-called signature strikes (attacks that target a group of militants based purely on their behavior). Pakistani military officials had earlier stated that these drone attacks cannot continue at the tempo they are going at, and that civilian casualties in these strikes are spawning <b>more</b> <b>militants.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Now disorganised, the paratroopers {{scrambled}} to find {{cover in the}} mountain brush, as fifty <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> rushed towards their position in a pincer movement from the southern ridge and the village. In addition, several [...] "well-trained snipers" [...] amongst the militants were present, as were heavy mortars, and presented unexpected problems for the Coalition forces. Rocket-propelled grenades damaged three Afghan National Police vehicles. The men of Carmin 2 dispersed over more than 200 metres to shelter themselves and found themselves pinned down. 600 metres below, the VABs started supporting Carmin 2 with suppressing fire from their 12.7mm machine guns.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the same}} day, Palestinians {{increased}} the daily rocket barrage on Israel injuring three persons and causing a traffic accident {{in which two}} were wounded. The Israeli Air Force killed 15 <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> and a civilian in retaliatory attacks. The Iron Dome successfully intercepted 90% of the rockets targeted. On March 10, attacks on Israel continued, without causing damage. Several Palestinians were killed while preparing to fire rockets. Militants fired guns {{in the air and}} crowds chanted [...] "Revenge, revenge!" [...] during funeral processions in Gaza City. Particulars of individual Palestinian rocket attacks on March 9: ...|$|R
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, a <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> {{brand of}} Rastafari emerged. The vanguard {{of this was}} the House of Youth Black Faith, a group whose members were largely based in West Kingston.|$|E
25|$|This {{experience}} radicalised Harney {{and although}} he was initially {{a member of the}} London Working Men's Association he became impatient with the organization’s failure to make much progress in the efforts to obtain universal suffrage. Harney was influenced by the <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> ideas of William Benbow, James Bronterre O'Brien and Feargus O'Connor.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{translation}} of the Bible into one of France's regional languages, Arpitan or Franco-Provençal, had been prepared by the 12th-century pre-reformer Peter Waldo (Pierre de Vaux). The Waldensians became <b>more</b> <b>militant,</b> creating fortified areas, as in Cabrières, perhaps attacking an abbey. They were suppressed by Francis I in 1545 in the Massacre of Mérindol.|$|E
50|$|His {{leadership}} and constant planning, were {{fundamental to the}} growth of the organization in the capital and in certain farmer groups, most of them associated in the past with the Ligas Agrarias Cristianas movement. During the next few years, the OPM grew unexpectedly; in fact, so unexpectedly that it had <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> than his poor security system would allow it. The organization even military trained a small group of his members not heavily armed. It never really did anything, even though in {{the first few months of}} 1976 the organization counted with a group of leadership that was composed by a small number of Paraguayans students that studied in Corrientes, Argentina.|$|R
25|$|On May 17, heavy street {{fighting}} {{started in}} the towns of Kanju and Matta and the Army was slowly advancing towards Mingora. Also, {{a few days later}} fighting {{started in the}} area of the Takhtaband bridge for control of this crossing point. On May 20, a key town in Buner was captured by the Army. The Army captured Sultanwas in fighting which, according to the military, killed one soldier and 80 militants, another nine soldiers were wounded. By May 23, Kanju, Matta and the Takhtaband bridge had been secured by the military, but fighting was still going on in Takhtaband itself and the Buner and Dir districts, where nine <b>more</b> <b>militants</b> were killed. Meanwhile, the military was surrounding the main militant base in the Peochar Valley.|$|R
50|$|<b>More</b> recently, <b>militant</b> {{underground}} organisations {{have attempted}} to resume armed struggle {{as a means of}} achieving political change. Among these the Pune-based Abhinav Bharat group - named after Veer Savarkar's original organisation - has reportedly been campaigning {{for the establishment of a}} Hindu State or Nation (Hindu Rashtra).|$|R
25|$|The {{leadership}} of the international union mistrusted the <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> local leadership in Chicago and in other large urban locals, which had strong Socialist loyalties. When it tried to disenfranchise those locals' members at the UGW's 1914 convention, those locals, representing {{two thirds of the}} union's membership, bolted to form the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America.|$|E
25|$|With the band's newfound {{fame and}} success came {{numerous}} problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham. Epic requested more marketable output. The Black Panther Party demanded that Stone make his music <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> and more {{reflective of the}} black power movement, replace Greg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists, and replace manager David Kapralik.|$|E
25|$|The motives {{behind the}} strike were wages, {{establishment}} of a grievance process, reduced workloads and more funding for public education. However to win on these issues, Shanker and Cogen argued, the city's teachers {{had to be in}} one union. In early 1960 the Teachers Guild merged with a splinter group from the <b>more</b> <b>militant</b> High School Teachers Association to form the United Federation of Teachers (UFT).|$|E
50|$|Georgian {{officials}} {{also said they}} planned {{to build up the}} number of border troops near Chechnya and Ingushetia, another Russian republic. Russia accused Georgia of allowing Chechen fighters to raid across the border. On June 15, 2003, 15 <b>more</b> Chechen <b>militants</b> entered the area and took refuge in a two-story house.|$|R
5000|$|In 1941, the ETU's longstanding General Secretary, Jimmy Rowan, retired.

50|$|Safdar Nagori, {{the general}} {{secretary}} of SIMI, was arrested by Madhya Pradesh Police from a flat in Sanyogitaganj, Indore on 26 March 2008. Ten other SIMI militants, including his brother Kamruddin, were also arrested in the operation. Following a week of interrogation of the accused, they revealed {{the location of a}} farmhouse in Choral, 35 km from Indore, which was used as a training camp by SIMI militants. The police were told the camp trained SIMI members from Jharkhand, Kerala, Karnataka and some other states in physical exercise, combat and organisation philosophy. Police found arms, ammunition, radical literature in Urdu and Hindi and explosives at the farmhouse and arrested two <b>more</b> <b>militants.</b> Further investigations revealed the existence of SIMI's women's wing called Shaheen Force. Police also found 122 super-explosive gelatine sticks, 100 detonators and switchboards buried underground in Gawali village.|$|R
