Will and Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale) have since reconciled, and are raising a son, Ben. Karen and Jack grow tired {{of the fact that}} Will and Grace are not {{speaking}} with each other, so they lure them to the same place and force them to make up. The four meet at Will and Vince's apartment, and even though Will and Grace have a pleasant evening together, they find that too <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> between them, and drift apart.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} games, the player character receives his first Pokémon, a choice between Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, from the region's local Pokémon scientist Professor Elm and then begins his journey to win the eight Gym Badges of the Johto region and then challenge the Elite Four and Champion to become the region's new Pokémon Master. Opposing him is his mysterious rival, a boy who stole {{one of the other}} Pokémon from Professor Elm and regularly challenges the player to test his strengths. The player also encounters the villainous Team Rocket, having reunited to seek out their previous leader Giovanni to return the group to their former glory. After the player defeats Team Rocket once and for all and defeats the Elite Four and Champion of the Pokémon League on Indigo Plateau, the player can then travel to the Kanto region from the previous games and challenge the Gym Leaders there, discovering how <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in the three years following the events of Red and Blue. After defeating the Kanto region's Gym Leaders, the player is allowed to enter the treacherous Mt. Silver area, home to very powerful Pokémon, and deep within Mt. Silver's caves is Red, the protagonist of Red and Blue, who the player can challenge for the most difficult battle in the game.|$|E

500|$|Day of the Tentacle: Remastered has {{received}} positive reviews, with the PC version having an aggregate review score of 87/100 tallied by Metacritic. Reviewers generally praised the title as having not lost its charm since its initial release, but found {{some aspects of}} the remastering to be lackluster. Richard Corbett for Eurogamer found the game [...] "every bit as well crafted now as it was in 1993", but found the processes used to provide high-definition graphics from the original 16-bit graphics to making some of the required shortcuts taken in 1993 for graphics, such as background dithering and low animation framerates, more obvious on modern hardware. IGNs Jared Petty also found the remastered to still be enjoyable, and found the improvement on the graphics to be [...] "glorious", but worried that the lack of a hint system, as was added in The Secret of Monkey Island remastered version, would put off new players to the game. Bob Mackey for USgamer found that while past remastered adventure games have highlighted how <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in gamers' expectations since the heyday of adventure games in the 1990s, Day of the Tentacle Remastered [...] "rises above these issues to become absolutely timeless".|$|E
500|$|The kiss {{generated}} strong {{reaction from}} {{the media and the}} celebrities alike. Nekesa Mumbi Moody from Associated Press deduced [...] "Twenty years after the first MTV Video Music Awards, and not <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> — Madonna still makes jaws drop and cheeks blush." [...] Brian Hiatt from Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "The close-up of [...] locking lips with the 21-year-old Spears was an indelible MTV moment — sexy, vaguely transgressive, and as meaningless as it was entertaining." [...] Elysa Gardner from USA Today explained that the performance [...] "offered a poignant reminder of MTV's role in defining a youth culture that {{has become something of a}} tease — winking at convention without offering any fresh alternatives." [...] The MTV producers were skeptical, saying that [...] "It was sensational, but I wonder what the good folk in places like Provo, Utah state, would make of it. Middle America is not gonna let this one go lightly." [...] When asked about it, Madonna revealed, [...] "I am kissing [...] and passing my energy on to her. Like kind of a mythological fairytale." [...] The performance was listed by Blender magazine as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history. MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of the MTV Video Music Awards. In Madonna's 2004 Re-Invention World Tour, a remix interlude of [...] "Hollywood" [...] featured a breakdancer, a firedancer, a bellydancer, a tapdancer, and a skateboarder. The screens displayed animations of tarot cards. The performance was included in the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. On the same tour, the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] contained samples from the remix [...] "Into the Hollywood Groove".|$|E

I thought about how much is different and how <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed,</b> and if it's not brought up in Jessica, when will it be brought up? So I was like, 'Yeah, you should.'

2500|$|Still {{further to}} the north, the steep fellsides above the Inlier are unenclosed and grazed {{exclusively}} by sheep.

[...] Regular [...] "gathers" [...] would be held to round them up for dipping and shearing. [...] <b>Much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed</b> in this respect, however, since the catastrophic foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. The [...] "hefted" [...] herds which had previously acquired a useful territorial instinct were all lost and are now only slowly being replaced.

Sheep numbers are now closely controlled.

6000|$|Or {{apart from}} all Transcendentalism, {{is it not}} a plain truth of sense, which the duller mind can even {{consider}} as a truism, that human things wholly are in continual movement, and action and reaction; working continually forward, phasis after phasis, by unalterable laws, towards prescribed issues? How often must we say, and yet not rightly lay to heart: The seed that is sown, it will spring! Given the summer's blossoming, then there is also given the autumnal withering: so is it ordered not with seedfields only, but with transactions, arrangements, philosophies, societies, French Revolutions, whatsoever man works with in this lower world. The Beginning holds in it the End, and all that leads thereto; as the acorn does the oak and its fortunes. Solemn enough, did we think of it,--which unhappily and also happily we do not very much! Thou there canst begin; the Beginning is for thee, and there: but where, and of what sort, and for whom will the End be? All grows, and seeks and endures its destinies: consider likewise how much grows, as the trees do, whether we think of it or not. So that when your Epimenides, your somnolent Peter Klaus, since named Rip van Winkle, awakens again, he finds it a changed world. In that seven-years' sleep of his, so <b>much</b> <b>has</b> <b>changed!</b> All that is without us will change while we think not of it; much even that is within us. The truth that was yesterday a restless Problem, has to-day grown a Belief burning to be uttered: on the morrow, contradiction has exasperated it into mad Fanaticism; obstruction has dulled it into sick Inertness; it is sinking towards silence, of satisfaction or of resignation. To-day is not Yesterday, for man or for thing. Yesterday there was the oath of Love; today has come the curse of Hate. Not willingly: ah, no; but it could not help coming. The golden radiance of youth, would it willingly have tarnished itself into the dimness of old age?--Fearful: how we stand enveloped, deep-sunk, in that Mystery of TIME; and are Sons of Time; fashioned and woven out of Time; and on us, and on all that we have, or see, or do, is written: Rest not, Continue not, Forward to thy doom! ...|$|E
