5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San <b>Martín</b> <b>had</b> requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E

5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> impacted the islands a few weeks earlier.

A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that he}} would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} reached the village, Alder learned why {{his life had}} been spared. One of the Mingo chiefs, Succohanos, and his wife, Whinecheoh, were an aging couple who had lost their son, and planned to adopt Alder as a replacement. Alder was forced to run the gauntlet, as a rite of passage, and after he {{exhibited}} bravery during the trial, he was adopted and cared for by Whinecheoh. The Indian's other prisoner, Mrs. <b>Martin,</b> <b>had</b> been promised {{to a man in}} another village, and was taken away during Alder's adoption ceremony.|$|E
5|$|After his retirement, San Martín {{intended}} {{to live in}} Cuyo. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the Argentine Civil Wars continued. The unitarians wanted to organize {{the country as a}} unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who preferred a federation of provinces. San <b>Martín</b> <b>had</b> good relations with the federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but tried to stay neutral. San Martín's wife, María de los Remedios de Escalada, died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires.

5|$|By 1997, <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During {{a weekend}} in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's {{keyboard}} player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over four days in February 1999.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years out}} of the World Junior Championships, <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> formed a new team and won his first provincial championship. This {{qualified}} him {{and his team of}} Kevin Park, Dan Petryk and Don Bartlett for the 1991 Labatt Brier. At the 1991 Brier, Martin finished the round robin with an 8–3 win-loss record, tying Saskatchewan for first place. Martin knocked off British Columbia in the semifinal, and then beat Saskatchewan (skipped by Randy Woytowich) with a score of 8–4 in the final. The rink was then off to the 1991 Canada Safeway World Curling Championships in Winnipeg. Martin turned the tables, going undefeated through the round robin. After beating Norway's Eigil Ramsfjell in the semifinal, Martin's team lost in the final, losing to Scotland's David Smith with a score of 2–7.|$|E
5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that <b>Martin</b> <b>had</b> nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations. The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations.|$|E
