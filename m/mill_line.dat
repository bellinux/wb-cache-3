40|$|As the {{nanotechnology}} {{is becoming}} {{an important aspect of}} science research and development, the application of the focused ion beam (FIB) technique is getting more attention. The focused ion beam is a tool for milling tiny objects. This research explored the characterization of FIB by relating <b>milled</b> <b>line</b> widths with their milling time. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is used to image the <b>milled</b> <b>lines</b> and ImageJ to analyze the images. We found that the through-lens-detector (TLD) provides the best SEM image by reducing the shadowing effect which interfered with the data analysis. A logarithmic relation between the <b>milled</b> <b>line</b> width and <b>milling</b> time was determined. These presented results can help scientists design a FIB milling experiment in the future...|$|R

50|$|A private railway line {{operated}} by Whakatane Board Mills (now Carter Holt Harvey Whakatane) formerly connected the company's mill {{on the western}} side of the river to the Taneatua Branch line at Awakeri. The Whakatane Board <b>Mills</b> <b>Line</b> was freight only, with no passenger service. In 1999 operation of the Whakatane Board <b>Mills</b> <b>line</b> was taken over by Tranz Rail (now KiwiRail) and the line was renamed the Whakatane Industrial line. The line has since been closed and lifted, and the Taneatua Branch line is used for tourist excursions.|$|R

At this time, the stations in Yeovil were Pen Mill, on the GWR's Wilts Somerset and Weymouth line, and the Hendford terminus of the B&ER.

One block later, at Mahaffey Line Drive, SC 914 travels along the Lancaster Mill-Springdale line for a few blocks. On {{the northwest corner of}} Lancaster Memorial Park cemetery, it enters Springdale proper. It curves to the southeast and intersects the eastern terminus of Grace Avenue.

Here, Airport Road continues to the southeast.|$|E
5000|$|Jacoby {{was born}} in Adelaide to Hannah (née Mathieson) and Daniel Jacoby. The Jacoby family moved from to Western Australia in 1891, and Mathieson Jacoby (who {{had worked for the}} Telegraph Department in South Australia) {{initially}} gained work in Perth as an agent for Adelaide firms. In 1893, assisted by their father, he and his two brothers (Frederick and Ted) bought a vineyard in the Perth Hills, abutting the Smiths <b>Mill</b> <b>Line</b> of the Eastern Railway. After talking with the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area, Jacoby decided to adopt [...] "Mundaring", an approximation of their name for the area, as the name of the property, which was subsequently extended to the nearby railway siding and eventually to the surrounding locality. In December 1897, the vineyard was incorporated as a limited liability company - the Mundaring Vineyard Company. Jacoby was made managing director, despite having lost his left eye in a blasting accident earlier in the year. He already had poor sight in his other eye, which had been struck by a stockwhip when he was thirteen. One of the nurses at the hospital where Jacoby recovered after his accident was Mary Cresswell. The two married in January 1899, and had three sons and a daughter together.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of the shortening {{the cycle of}} selection was tested in maize, by using the MHI line (Moldovan Haploid Inducer) for inducing haploids in five F 1 elite single crosses, made {{for the purposes of}} further inbreeding and gaining new elite inbred lines. Obtained number of haploid plants was quite enough for the further breeding, by using 15 F 1 plants as the female parent for the <b>Mill</b> <b>line</b> as the male parent. Doubling of the chromosome number of a smaller number of haploids was quite successful. With such obtained dihaploid plants a 100 % successful selfing and crossing with opposite testers was made. All of this gained {{to the conclusion that the}} process of breeding in maize could be conducted in three phases: 1. F 1 x MHI for producing and selecting of haploids (could be done in the winter nurcery) 2. Doubling of the chromosome number of the obtained haploids and sowing this plants in the field along with the appropriate opposite testers. Selfing of this plants and outcrossing (as males) to the testers. 3. Sowing of selfed progenies ear to row for the phenotypic selection of the obtained dihaploid lines, and sowing of the test-crosses in the trials for the check of their combining ability. Only dihaploid lines which performe good per se and in the test-crosses could be further commercially used. ...|$|E
40|$|Formulation of the problem. Significant {{influence}} {{on the quality of}} rolled steel have various defects on its surface, which in its turn inherited from surface defects of billet and possible damage to the surface of rolled steel in the rolling <b>mill</b> <b>line.</b> One of the criteria for assessing the quality indicators of rolled steel is rationing of surface defects [1; 2; 3; 6; 7]. Current status of the issue. Analyzing the different requirements of regulations to the surface quality of the rolled high-carbon steels, we can conclude that the maximum allowable depth of defects on the surface of billet should be in the range of 2. 0 [...] . 5. 0 mm (depending on the section of the billet, method of its production and further the destination) Purpose. Develop a methodology for calculating the maximum allowable depth of defects on the steel billet surface depending on the requirements placed on the surface quality of hot-rolled steel. Results. A simplified method of calculation, allowing at the rated depth of defects {{on the surface of the}} hot-rolled steel to make operatively calculation of the maximum allowable depth of surface defects of steel billets before heating the metal in the heat deformation was developed. The findings shows that the maximum allowable depth of surface defects is reduced with increasing diameter rolled steel, reducing the initial section steel billet and degrees of oxidation of the metal in the heating furnace...|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{fast and}} {{efficient}} method is demonstrated for the fabrication of very homogeneous periodic nano-cone arrays on planar Si substrates by {{focused ion beam}} milling. The approach makes use of the actual shape of the ion beam by simply <b>milling</b> <b>lines</b> in vertical and horizontal direction with the lines separated by the targeted periodicity. If beam currents and, thus, beam diameters are chosen appropriately, this patterning approach results in nano-cone arrays with apex radii of 25 nm and below. Arrays with periodicities of 600, 300, and 150 nm are realized with minimum processing times {{of the order of}} 30 s for an area of 30 μm 2 without a change in the quality of the cones by area scaling. To a certain extent, height, aspect ratio, apex radius and shape of the individual cones can b e varied using different beam diameters. While constant dwell times are used for planar samples, it is shown that homogeneous nano-cone arrays can only be realized on the whole surface of protruded rectangular mesa structures if the patterning strategy is adapted appropriately. In the successfully modified approach the dwell time is gradually decreased along the <b>milled</b> <b>lines</b> {{from the center of the}} array towards the edges and a frame like pattern is added at the edges of the protruded structures...|$|R
