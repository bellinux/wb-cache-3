40|$|Inhalation {{of sodium}} <b>metabisulphite</b> {{is thought to}} induce bronchoconstriction by release of sulphur dioxide. We sought to {{establish}} the reproducibility of the airway response to inhaled sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> given in increasing doubling concentrations (0. 3 to 160 mg/ml) to 13 asthmatic and five atopic non-asthmatic subjects and the contribution of cholinergic mechanisms to this response. In 15 of the 18 subjects bronchoconstriction was sufficient to allow calculation of the dose of <b>metabisulphite</b> causing a 20 % reduction in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) from baseline values (PD 20 <b>metabisulphite).</b> The 95 % confidence limit for the difference between this and a second PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> determined 2 - 14 days later was 2. 5 doubling doses. The difference between repeat PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> measurements was unrelated {{to the number of}} days between challenges or change in baseline FEV 1. Ten subjects returned for a third study 3 - 120 days after the second challenge; variability in PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> did not differ from that seen {{between the first and second}} challenges. PD 20 methacholine was determined between the two <b>metabisulphite</b> challenges and found to correlate with PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> (r = 0. 71). Inhaled ipratropium bromide 200 micrograms given in a randomised, placebo controlled, crossover study to 10 subjects increased PD 20 methacholine 42 fold but had no significant effect on the response to <b>metabisulphite.</b> A single inhalation of the PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> in five subjects induced maximal bronchoconstriction 2 - 3 minutes after inhalation, with a plateau in FEV 1 lasting a further four minutes before recovery. A further single inhalation of the same PD 20 dose 43 minutes later produced a 27 % (SEM 4 %) smaller fall in FEV 1 than the first inhalation. These results show that <b>metabisulphite</b> PD 20 values measured over days and weeks show similar reproducibility to those reported for histamine inhalation and that PD 20 <b>metabisulphite</b> correlates with methacholine responsiveness.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Exercise {{and inhaled}} sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> {{are thought to}} cause bronchoconstriction in asthma through {{different}} mechanisms. The response to both stimuli becomes refractory with repeat challenge. The mechanism of refractoriness is unclear, although depletion of mast cell derived mediators or neurotransmitters has been suggested. Recent studies suggest a common mechanism involving release of inhibitory prostaglandins. If this is true, exercise and sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> induced bronchoconstriction should show cross refractoriness. METHODS [...] Thirteen subjects with mild asthma and previously established exercise and sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> induced bronchoconstriction performed two sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenges (giving a single dose previously shown to cause a 20 % fall in FEV 1) on one study day, and two exercise tests on another. The second challenge proceeded after recovery (FEV 1 > 95 % baseline) from the first. Subjects then attended on two further occasions when an exercise test was performed after sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> and a sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge after exercise. RESULTS [...] When expressed as the percentage reduction in the area under the change in percentage FEV 1 curve over 20 minutes (AUC) the response to exercise was reduced by a mean 62. 3 % (95 % CI 46. 5 % to 78. 1 %) following a first exercise challenge, and by 50. 7 % (95 % CI 27. 8 % to 73. 6 %) following a sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge. The response to a sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge was reduced by a mean of 80. 2 % (95 % CI 68. 9 % to 91. 5 %) when it followed a sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge, and by 37. 3 % (95 % CI 15. 1 % to 59. 5 %) following an exercise challenge.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Inhaled frusemide {{inhibits}} airway {{responses to}} sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> and other indirect bronchial challenges in asthma by undetermined mechanisms which {{may relate to}} its ability to stimulate prostaglandin release. Inhalation of sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> provokes indirect bronchoconstriction, possibly by activating sensory nerves. To investigate the role of cyclooxygenase products in the airway actions of frusemide and sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> {{the effects of a}} potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor, flurbiprofen, alone and in combination with frusemide were investigated against airway responsiveness to sodium <b>metabisulphite.</b> METHODS [...] In a double blind double placebo controlled study, 12 mild asthmatic subjects attended on four occasions to undergo three inhalation challenges with sodium <b>metabisulphite.</b> A baseline challenge was performed one hour before oral intake of flurbiprofen 200 mg or matched placebo, and two hours before inhalation of frusemide 40 mg or matched placebo. A second challenge was performed immediately after inhalation of frusemide (two hours after flurbiprofen) with a further challenge three hours later. The log concentration provoking a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (log PC 20) was used to assess airway responsiveness to sodium <b>metabisulphite.</b> RESULTS [...] Frusemide caused an immediate 1. 9 doubling dose protection and a lesser 0. 7 doubling dose protection at three hours. This protection was enhanced by flurbiprofen at both time points to 2. 7 (early) and 1. 9 (late) doubling doses. In addition, flurbiprofen alone significantly reduced airway responsiveness to sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> by 1. 1 doubling doses at both two and five hours. CONCLUSIONS [...] The generation of bronchoprotective prostaglandins is unlikely to underlie the inhibitory action of frusemide against airway responsiveness to sodium <b>metabisulphite.</b> Endogenous contractile prostaglandins within the airways may be involved in the bronchoconstrictor response to sodium <b>metabisulphite...</b>|$|E

In Experiment 1 two sorghum varieties (MP, JM) were evaluated and three sorghums (HP, Tiger, HFQ) in Experiment 2; the two experiments were separate but very similar. The five sorghums were extensively characterised and all five diets contained 620 g/kg sorghum and were formulated to be nutritionally equivalent. In both studies, each dietary treatment was offered to six replicate cages (6 birds per cage) for a combined total of 540 male Ross 308 chicks. The effects of sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, apparent digestibility coefficients of starch and protein (N) and starch and protein digestive dynamics were determined. Sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> significantly enhanced energy utilisation. Across both experiments, 3. 50 g/kg sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> increased AME on a dry matter basis by 0. 34 MJ {{from an average of}} 11. 97 – 12. 31 MJ/kg and similarly increased N-corrected AME by 0. 42 MJ from 11. 43 to 11. 85 MJ/kg.

Study Design: Evaluation of the effects of peeling, blanching and sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> pretreatments on the ease of drying, particle size distribution, colour and pH of yam bean flour using a 2 x 3 factorial design. Place and Duration of Study: Yam bean roots were obtained from the CSIR-Crops Research Institute, Kumasi, Ghana. All reagents used were obtained from accredited suppliers in Accra, Ghana. Actual experimental studies were conducted at the laboratories of the CSIR-Food Research Institute, Accra, Ghana, between August 2012 and November 2013. Methodology. We subjected peeled and unpeeled yam bean tubers (Pachyrhizus erosus) to three pretreatments involving blanching at 100 C for 3 min; soaking in 0. 1 % sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> solution for 3 min and no treatment control. Samples were dried at 55 C for 6 hours, cooled to room temperature, milled, sieved and the flour analyzed for ease of drying as indicated by the final moisture content, colour, pH, and ease of milling as indicated by particle size distribution. Results: The pretreatment methods had significant (p> 0. 05) effects on the colour of the flour samples. Peeling, followed by sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> pretreatment produced whitest yam bean flour (L-value of 90. 89). Flour samples from unpeeled roots recorded lower pH (p> 0. 05) than those from peeled samples. The combined effects of peeling and sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> or blanching pretreatments produced flours with desirable pH values. The blanched sample had coarser particles (50 %> 100 m) compared to the no treatment control and sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> treated flours (30 %> 100 m).

Bronchoconstriction due to inhaled sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> {{is thought to}} involve neural pathways and to be independent of mediator release; whether it shows refractoriness is uncertain. We have sought evidence of refractoriness to the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> in subjects with mild asthma, and have tested {{the hypothesis that the}} development of refractoriness involves inhibitory prostaglandins. Twelve subjects were challenged twice with a dose of sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> previously shown to cause a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1); the second challenge proceeded after recovery from the first. The response to sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> was expressed as the maximum % fall in FEV 1 and area under the change in FEV 1 curve over 20 min (AUC). Nine subjects were studied after double-blind treatment with oral indomethacin, 50 mg t. d. s., or placebo, for 3 days. The second sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> challenge caused significantly less bronchoconstriction than the first (mean maximum fall in FEV 1 13. 1 and 24. 3 %, respectively). Nine subjects showed a greater than 50 % reduction in the response to the second challenge (mean reduction in AUC 73. 7 %).

40|$|Inhaled frusemide {{protects against}} the bronchoconstrictor {{response}} {{to a wide range}} of stimuli that cause bronchoconstriction by indirect mechanisms. One possible explanation for this protection relates to the known ability of frusemide to enhance synthesis of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Studies in vitro suggest that PGE 2 might protect against indirectly acting bronchoconstrictor challenges rather than those that act directly on airway smooth muscle, though little is known about the effects of PGE 2 in vivo. The effect of inhaled PGE 2 on the bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> (a stimulus with an indirect action) and methacholine (which acts directly on airway smooth muscle) was studied in nine patients with asthma. Subjects were studied on four days, inhaling PGE 2 (100 micrograms) or placebo in a double blind fashion followed immediately by a cumulative dose challenge with sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> or methacholine. The response to the constrictor stimuli was measured as the provocative dose causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20). There was no significant change in FEV 1 after inhaled PGE 2 compared with placebo, nor any significant change in the response to methacholine; the geometric mean methacholine PD 20 was 0. 9 mumol after PGE 2 and 0. 56 mumol after placebo (mean difference 0. 7 (95 % confidence limits [...] 0. 1, 1. 5) doubling doses). PGE 2, however, protected against sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> the geometric mean sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> PD 20 being 11. 8 mumol after PGE 2 and 1. 8 mumol after placebo (mean difference 2. 5 (95 % CL 1. 9, 3. 1) doubling doses). PGE 2 conferred significantly greater protection against sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> than methacholine (mean difference 1. 8 (95 % CL 0. 8, 2. 8) doubling doses). This suggests that PGE 2, like frusemide, has an inhibitory effect on pathways relevant to the bronchoconstriction induced by sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> with little or no effect on those relevant to methacholine...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the possibility that tandem inclusions of a reducing agent and a protease may advantage chicken-meat production and to ascertain if the established benefits of including sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> in sorghum-based diets extend to wheat-based diets. The study comprised a 2  ×  2  ×  2 factorial array of treatments in which either nutritionally iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic wheat- or sorghum-based diets, without and with sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> (2. 75  g/kg), without and with protease (1, 000 units/kg) were offered to broiler chickens from 7 to 28 days post–hatch. The effects of dietary treatments on growth performance, nutrient utilisation, protein (N) and starch digestibility coefficients and digestive dynamics were determined. A preliminary investigation into the effects of two treatments on concentrations of free amino acids and glucose in the portal circulation was conducted. There was significant feed grain by sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> interactions (P =  0. 03 to 0. 005) for parameters of nutrient utilisation (AME, ME:GE ratios, N retention, AMEn). For example, sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> inclusions in sorghum-based diets enhanced AME by 0. 18  MJ (12. 47 versus 12. 29  MJ/kg) but depressed AME by 0. 43  MJ (11. 88 versus 12. 31  MJ/kg) in wheat-based diets. There was a linear relationship between starch:protein disappearance rate ratios in the distal ileum with weight gain (r = − 0. 484; P =  0. 0012) indicating that condensed ratios (or absorption of more protein relative to starch) advantaged growth performance. Concentrations of free amino acids in the portal circulation or the post-enteral availability of certain amino acids, including the branched-chain amino acids, methionine, phenylalanine and threonine, were significantly correlated to FCR. For example, threonine concentrations were negatively correlated to FCR (r = − 0. 773; P =  0. 005).

The chemical evaluations included carbonation volume, pH, soluble solids, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide, acidity, ascorbic acid, polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase activities, colour and turbidity attributes. The microbiological evaluations considered the total aerobic plate count and the enumeration of yeasts and moulds. It was observed that concentrations of 375 mg. L- 1 of potassium sorbate and 75 mg. L- 1 of sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> gave the best quality attributes with respect to minor changes in acidity and colour of the coconut water, providing that the raw material had low microbiological contamination...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of Ascorbic acid in Australian {{native plants}} Abstract: Ascorbic acid {{is one of}} the {{compounds}} found in a number of commercially important native plants fruits e. g. Kakadu plum, wild lime and bush tomato. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine ascorbic acid in these native plant fruits. Ascorbic acid degradation of both standards and plant extracts was observed during HPLC sequence runs. These losses were considerable even though factors such as light, temperature and water activity, which accelerate the loss of ascorbic acid, were eliminated. Several concentrations of sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> were added to both standards and plant extracts to evaluate the effect on the rate of ascorbic acid degradation. A concentration of 500 µg/mL was the most effective but did not eliminate the problem. To correct for any loss still occurring, the rate constant k for ascorbic acid degradation was calculated and used to extrapolate back to the original ascorbic acid concentration. The k value was also found to vary for the different plants studied. For example the k value without added sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> for Kakadu plum, wild lime and Kakadu plum intermediate raw material were 0. 00532, 0. 02710 and 0. 04429 respectively. With the addition of 500 µg/mL sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> the k value decreased to 0. 00005, 0. 00915 and 0. 00586 respectively...|$|E
40|$|Addition of {{chemicals}} during {{the extraction of}} cassava starch for enhancing the settling rate, whiteness and compactness of the settled starch is an accepted commercial practice. The effect of addition of selected chemicals such as acids (sulphuric and hydrochloric acids), bleaching and oxidising agents (sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> and sodium hypochlorite) and alum during settling on the thermal and pasting properties of the cassava starch was examined. Treatment with sulphuric acid produced a noticeable increase in all DSC gelatinisation parameters, viz. onset gelatinisation temperature (T-o), temperature at peak minimum (T-p) and end temperature (T-e), with increasing concentration of acid, while only a marginal shift could be obtained even at higher concentration of hydrochloric acid. However, no major effect resulted from treatment with sodium <b>metabisulphite,</b> sodium hypochlorite and alum. The gelatinisation enthalpy was hardly affected by the treatments. An exception was hydrochloric acid, which brought about a perceptible decrease in enthalpy at higher concentrations indicating that starch crystallinity is influenced to a small extent by hydrochloric acid. Pasting characteristics studied using a Rapid Visco Analyser showed that sulphuric acid, even at the lowest concentration (5 mM), considerably affected the structural characteristics of cassava starch, while hydrochloric acid induced similar effect only at higher concentrations. Alum reduced the paste viscosity while the bleaching agents (sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> and sodium hypochlorite) were not so effective in modifying the starch viscosity characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} various pre-drying {{treatments}} {{on the quality}} of dried carrots was evaluated by assessing the values of moisture, ash, protein, fibre, sugars and col- our. The pre-drying treatments under investigation were dipping, either in ascorbic acid or sodium <b>metabisulphite</b> at different concentrations and pre-treatment times, as well as blanching. The experimental data was analysed using neural networks, so that relevant patterns in the data were found and conclusions drawn about each variable. The results showed that the type of pre-drying treatment (chemical or physical) had variable impact on the nutri- tional composition of the dried carrots but not on the colour parameters, which were found to be mostly unaffected by the pre-treatment procedure. Pre-treatment with chemical agents such as ascorbic acid or <b>metabisulphite</b> seem to have the least impact on the parameters studied. The results of the analysis by artificial neural networks confirmed these findings. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
