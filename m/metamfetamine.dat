40|$|Background Proper {{assessment}} of the harms caused by the misuse of drugs can inform policy makers in health, policing, and social care. We aimed to apply multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) modelling {{to a range of}} drug harms in the UK. Method Members of the Independent Scientifi c Committee on Drugs, including two invited specialists, met in a 1 -day interactive workshop to score 20 drugs on 16 criteria: nine related to the harms that a drug produces in the individual and seven to the harms to others. Drugs were scored out of 100 points, and the criteria were weighted to indicate their relative importance. Findings MCDA modelling showed that heroin, crack cocaine, and <b>metamfetamine</b> were the most harmful drugs to individuals (part scores 34, 37, and 32, respectively), whereas alcohol, heroin, and crack cocaine were the most harmful to others (46, 21, and 17, respectively). Overall, alcohol was the most harmful drug (overall harm score 72), with heroin (55) and crack cocaine (54) in second and third places. Interpretation These fi ndings lend support to previous work assessing drug harms, and show how the improved scoring and weighting approach of MCDA increases the diff erentiation between the most and least harmful drugs. However, the fi ndings correlate poorly with present UK drug classifi cation, which is not based simply on considerations of harm. Funding Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (UK) ...|$|E
40|$|My final {{research}} {{deals with}} drug problem in drivers {{under the influence}} of drugs or psychotropic substances. This problematics I summary to the thesis called "The issue of drugs in traffic". The topics of drug or narcotic psychotropic substances (further OPL) in the body of drivers is up to date. The proportion of these drivers in constantly increasing in road traffic. This also increases the risk that this driver poses. The tesis is devided in two basic parts. Theoretical part contains an introduction to the issue from basic concept to the investigation methods. In practical part I present clinical and forensis toxicology laboratory tests from the hospital in České Budějovice, a. s., specifically I am interested in examinations by drivers requested by the Police of the Czech republic. Main topics of the research are drivers captured by the police on the basis of positive screening test (on - road) and by individuals OPL groups in the period 2014 - 2016. 1630 people were required to have an examination for 2197 OPL groups in this time period in laboratory of clinical and forensic toxicology in the hospital in České Budějovice. Positive result for OPL was found in 1450 people. By the way this research founded that in this time period numbers of required examinations by Police ČR rised. Mostly the drives had positive tests for cannabinoids, the share of positive <b>metamfetamine</b> (pervitin) drivers increased. This research can be use for a police training of procedures, implementation, negotiation and planning of roadside checks on drivers under influence of OPL...|$|E
