He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a <b>moorish</b> <b>idol.</b> The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish would be placed in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Moorish</b> <b>idol</b> (Zanclus cornutus), is {{a marine}} fish species, the sole extant {{representative}} of the family Zanclidae (from the Greek ζαγκίος, zagkios, [...] "oblique") in order Perciformes. A common inhabitant of tropical to subtropical reefs and lagoons, the <b>Moorish</b> <b>idol</b> is notable for its wide distribution throughout the Indo-Pacific. A number of butterflyfishes (genus Heniochus) closely resemble the <b>Moorish</b> <b>idol.</b> It is closely related to, if not a direct descendant of, the extinct Eozanclus brevirostris, from the Middle Eocene of Monte Bolca.|$|E

50|$|Often seen alone, <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols</b> also form pairs or {{occasionally}} small schools, {{especially as}} juveniles. They are diurnal fish, {{sticking to the}} bottom of the reef at night, adopting a drab coloration. Like butterfly fish, they mate for life. Adult males display aggression toward one another.|$|R
50|$|<b>Moorish</b> <b>idols</b> are pelagic spawners; that is, they release {{eggs and}} sperm {{in the water}} column, leaving fertilized eggs to drift away with the currents. The range of these fish may be {{explained}} by the unusually long larval stage. The fish reach a length of 7.5 cm before becoming free-swimming juveniles.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{denizens of}} shallow waters, <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols</b> prefer flat reefs. This fish {{may be found}} at depths from 3 to 180 m, in both murky and clear conditions.

50|$|The {{surrounding}} reefs {{are home}} to parrotfish, angelfish, trumpetfish, <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols,</b> and rainbow wrasse, while many other species pass nearby including sharks, rays, turtles, dolphins, and even whales. Birds include brown pelicans, great blue herons, snowy egrets, turkey vultures, and hummingbirds. A large sea lion colony resides on Los Islotes, off the north tip of the islands; snorkeling with the females and young is a highlight of many tours.|$|R
50|$|From its {{southern}} {{end to the}} sloping channel, the marine fauna seen are scalloped hammerheads, manta rays, big-eye jacks, bonito, yellowfin tuna, dolphins, big schooling of species of pelagic fish, and also whale sharks of up to 45 ft in length. The whale sharks are found from early July. Other marine fauna include <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols,</b> Galapagos sharks, eagle rays, green turtles, and Hawksbill turtles, silkie and white tipped reef sharks, barracuda and black jack sharks. Many birds are endemic and the species commonly noted is the sooty tern (Sterna fuscata), which breeds on Darwin Island.|$|R
5000|$|Over 1000 {{species of}} marine life inhabit the reef with many {{considered}} as endangered. Animal species found include manta rays, lionfish, sea turtles, clownfish, and sharks.

These [...] "walls" [...] are also habitats for many colonies of fish. Giant trevally (jacks), hammerhead sharks, barracudas, manta rays, palm-sized <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols,</b> napoleon wrasse, parrotfish, and moray eels live in the sanctuary. There also have been reported sightings of whale sharks and tiger sharks. Tubbataha is even home to cetaceans and the hawksbill sea turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) which are critically endangered species.|$|R

50|$|Heniochus is a genus of {{butterflyfishes}} {{native to}} the Indo-Pacific. Though very similar in appearance to the <b>Moorish</b> <b>idol</b> (Zanclus cornutus), {{the members of this}} genus are not closely related to it.|$|E
50|$|The {{archipelago}} {{became a}} National Park in 1971. There {{is a wide}} abundance of reef fish, surgeon, <b>Moorish</b> <b>idols,</b> parrots, angel and butterfly fish to name but a few. Sea turtles, game fish and devil rays are regularly seen. Various endangered marine megafaunas, such as whale shark, manta, leatherback turtle, cetaceans including humpback whale, and the dugong. Bazaruto's dugong population counts about 120 individuals, making it the largest of remnant populations in Mozambique. Cetacean biodiversity had been much richer than today before being reduced by human activities including illegal mass hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s, resulting disappearances or rarities of many species such as the southern right whales. All live free in this conservation paradise, proclaimed a national park and recognised as a Gift to the Earth by the WWF. Bazaruto {{is one of two}} largest islands, the other being Benguerra.|$|R

50|$|Molokini crater {{is home to}} {{approximately}} 250 to 260 marine species. Most commonly observed among these are the black triggerfish, yellow tang, <b>Moorish</b> <b>idol,</b> parrotfish, raccoon butterflyfish and bluefin trevally.
