40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a topic {{concerning}} attached clauses to the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan (NMIP). The study aims to identify what implications the clauses might have when added to the NMIP on both a general level and a specific level. The basis {{of this study is}} taken from an insurance slip subject to the rules in NMIP for <b>marine</b> <b>hull</b> <b>insurance.</b> The “slip”, presented by a broker for the insurers, also contained additional clauses. The clauses are first analysed in the light of background law and thereafter {{in the light of the}} NMIP and its commentary. In many cases, certain clauses are attached to the standard contract that either amends or supplements the regulations. The reason for adding such clauses might be due to commercial reasons. The purpose with the clause must either be that it clarifies or simplifies the terms, or; improves the terms of cover for the assured, or; regulates matters connected to administrative issues. The clauses that are attached may in several cases not be a typical standard clause but individually drafted. Thus, there are situations where added clauses raise uncertainties in terms of interpretation and what purpose the clauses serve. Further, the NMIP is an agreed document and when the standard contract is amended it may disturb the balance in the agreed document principle. The work has predominantly been focused on the issues when the added clauses introduces mechanisms for regulating circumstances in a different manner than how such circumstances already are regulated in the NMIP. Especially when so called held covered clauses, which originate from the purpose of softening the regulations under warranties, are attached to the rules concerning alteration of risk under the NMIP. It is concluded that the presented clauses in general adds very little to the insurance policy. In some cases the clauses were considered redundant or not applicable. Attachment of additional clauses to the NMIP shall be limited as they often raise confusion and lead to uncertainties – especially in situations where the added clause introduces mechanisms from other types of regulations and conditions i. e. held covered clauses attached to the rules concerning alteration of risk. However, some clauses do serve a certain purpose. If any of the requirements that the clause either simplifies or improves the terms, or relates to administrative issues not already dealt with in the standard wording of the contract, the clause may be considered meaningful. It is always important to be clear on what the reason for the attachment of the clause is and that the wording is perceivable and makes sense. Attaching a clause should be based upon the balance between the assured’s interest in being adequately insured and the insurer’s interest in not being exposed to any unforeseen risks...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether there}} are {{accident}} vessel damage cost differentials among container, tanker and bulk vessels. Tobit estimates of accident vessel damage cost equations suggest that vessel damage cost differentials exist for container versus bulk and tanker versus bulk vessel accidents, but not for container versus tanker vessel accidents. The vessel damage cost per vessel gross ton of a container (tanker) accident is $ 33. 37 ($ 18. 37) {{less than that of}} a bulk accident, all else held constant. The damage cost differentials are associated with fire/explosion accidents and human and environmental accident causes. The accident vessel damage cost differentials found in this paper may be compared with vessel <b>hull</b> <b>insurance</b> rates for investigating whether the latter reflect the former. Also, such comparisons may reveal whether there is cross-subsidisation among vessel <b>hull</b> <b>insurance</b> payees.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to compare the rules on causation and incidence of loss from a <b>hull</b> <b>insurance</b> perspective in the Nordic countries. As a consequence of there being underlying differences in how these questions are resolved, it therefore results in an interesting comparison. In addition, {{in light of the}} proposal of a common Marine Insurance Plan for the entire Nordic market a comparison is relevant for the same reasons. In the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan the scope of the insurers liability when covered and uncovered perils have contributed to a loss is based on an apportionment principle, cf. § NMIP 2 - 13. This solution is unique in relation to the corresponding rules in the Nordic Countries, which operate with the dominant cause principle. However, the NMIP was used as a prototype to the revision of the Finnish <b>Marine</b> <b>Hull</b> Conditions (FHC) in the year of 2001. As a result, today the FHC has a corresponding rule of apportionment. Nevertheless, an exception is made to the apportionment principle when the loss is attributed to a combination of marine and war perils. In this case the starting point is the dominant cause principle as well. Another question related to causation arises in cases where a loss is caused by a peril that {{can be traced back to}} a previous insurance period. According to the NMIP § 2 - 11 first subparagraph the liability of the insurer is triggered when the interest insured is struck by an insured peril during the insurance period. The starting point is thus a peril has struck principle which is a different point of departure to the damage principle which the remaining Nordic countries operate with. The approach to the question of causation and incidences of loss differ within the Nordic countries. These differences may provide implications both in changing between the insurance conditions and with an implementation of a common Nordic Marine Insurance Plan. The question to be answered is what the differences really are, their impact and which solution would be best suited for the whole common Nordic marine insurance market. Although an all comprehensive comparison between the Nordic rules of marine insurance would be both interesting and relevant at time, the aim of this work will be limited to compare and analyse the selected sections from a <b>hull</b> <b>insurance</b> perspective. Focus is foremost put on a comparison between the relevant Swedish and Norwegian rules...|$|R

The result of the Gap Analysis shows that the gap between customers´ expectations and perceptions of service from the investigated company has been concluded and shows a positive result. The result shows that customers are satisfied with the service received from the company. The dimensions that customers are most satisfied with are Assurance and Tangible. The most important service dimension to customers when signing the <b>Hull</b> and Machinery <b>insurance</b> is Reliability.
