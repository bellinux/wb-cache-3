5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from overdosing on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from overdosing on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E
5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E

25|$|The {{environmental}} justice {{aspect of this}} is that hydraulic fracturing sites {{are more likely to be}} located in places with a higher percentage of minority and low-income people.

25|$|In {{addition}} to pressure, friction, and shear, there are <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> factors of pressure ulcers. Physiological (intrinsic) and non physiological (extrinsic)) {{factors that may}} place a patient at risk include diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral vascular accident and hypotension. Other factors are age of 70 years and older, current smoking history, dry skin, low body mass index, impaired mobility, altered mental status, urinary and fecal incontinence, malnutrition, physical restraints, malignancy, history of pressure ulcers.|$|E
40|$|Despite evident {{heightened}} adolescent risk-taking in real-life situations, not all {{experimental studies}} demonstrate that adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> than {{children and adults}} on risky decision-making tasks. In the current 4 independent meta-analyses, neurodevelopmental imbalance models and fuzzy trace theory were used as conceptual frameworks to examine whether adolescents engage in more risk-taking than children and adults and whether early adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> than children and mid-late adolescents on behavioral risk-taking tasks. Studies with at least 1 of the aforementioned age comparisons met the inclusion criteria. Consistent with imbalance models and fuzzy trace theory, results from a random-effects model showed that adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> (g =. 37) than adults, and early adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> (g =. 15) than mid-late adolescents. However, inconsistent with both perspectives, adolescents and children take equal levels of risk (g = -. 00), and early adolescents and children also take equal levels of risk (g =. 04). Meta-regression analyses revealed that, consistent with imbalance models, (a) adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> than adults on hot tasks with immediate outcome feedback on rewards and losses; however, contrary to imbalance models but consistent with fuzzy trace theory, (b) adolescents take fewer risks than children on tasks with a sure/safe option. Shortcomings related to studies using behavioral risk-taking tasks are discussed. We suggest a hybrid developmental neuroecological model of risk-taking that includes a risk opportunity component to explain why adolescents take <b>more</b> <b>risks</b> than children {{in the real world}} but equal levels of risks as children in the laboratory.

25|$|Truckers in the US smoke {{at twice}} the rate of other working adults; 51% of truckers {{reported}} that they smoked in a 2010 survey. 61% of truckers in the same survey reported having two or <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> factors, which were defined as high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, no physical activity, or sleep deprivation (6 or fewer hours of sleep per 24 hours). Truck drivers also suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, cardiovascular disease, and stress at higher rates.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} rate {{set by the}} central bank indirectly determines the {{interest rate}} customers must pay on their bank loans. This interest rate affects the rate of interest among individuals, investments, and countries. Lending to the poor involves <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> than lending to the rich. As {{a result of the}} larger differences in wealth in different areas of the world, a central bank's ability to set interest rate to make the area prosper will be increasingly compromised, since it places wealthiest regions in conflict with the poorest regions in debt.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing oneself {{to be more}} financially successful than others, and negative events, such as being {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving <b>more</b> <b>risk,</b> such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E

25|$|High risk {{procedures}} {{or medical}} specialties {{are responsible for}} most avoidable adverse events. (Although some mistakes, such as in surgery, are harder to conceal, errors occur in all levels of care. Even though complex procedures entail <b>more</b> <b>risk,</b> adverse outcomes are not usually due to error, but to {{the severity of the}} condition being treated.). However, USP has reported that medication errors {{during the course of a}} surgical procedure are three times more likely to cause harm to a patient than those occurring in other types of hospital care.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{a process}} of {{informed}} consent {{is often used to}} make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A debriefing is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures. Today, most research in social psychology involves no <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.|$|E
25|$|Monoamniotic twins (twins {{that form}} after the {{splitting}} of a fertilised egg {{and share the}} same amniotic fluid sac) are at <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> of complications than twins that have their own sacs. There is also insufficient evidence around whether to deliver the babies early by caesarean section or to wait for labour to start naturally while running checks on the babiesâ€™ wellbeing. The birth {{of this type of}} twins should therefore be decided with the mother and her family and should take into account the need for good neonatal care services.|$|E

25|$|Generally, it {{is thought}} {{advisable}} to hold Risk cards until they can be turned in for maximum reinforcements. This is especially true earlier on in gameplay, because extra armies make a greater difference {{in the beginning of}} the game. Eliminating a weak player who holds a large number of Risk cards is also a good strategy, since players who eliminate their opponents get possession of their opponents' Risk cards. In this case, trading in Risk cards earlier may help acquire the necessary troops. If the conquering player has six or <b>more</b> <b>Risk</b> cards after taking the cards of another player, the cards must be immediately turned in for reinforcements until the player has fewer than five cards and then may continue attacking.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of large current account deficits via financial account surpluses became problematic as investors became <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> averse to emerging market exposure {{as a consequence}} of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5billion IMF-led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio of 48% for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating currency.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{question for the}} NATO mission after 2014 was what level of the Afghan military hierarchy they would advise. It was generally expected that they would advise seven regional Afghan Army corps and several regional Afghan police headquarters. The arrangement would largely insulate the NATO advisers from the battlefield, though officials said advisers might accompany Afghan brigades on major operations. It was unlikely that NATO officers would advise Afghan battalions on the battlefield, because that would require many more advisers than NATO was likely to muster and would entail <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> than most nations seem prepared to assume, though some American experts believed {{it would make the}} Afghan military more effective. Still, NATO special operations advisers would be likely to accompany Afghan Army commandos and police SWAT-type units on the battlefield.|$|E

25|$|The CBO {{projected}} that raising {{the age of}} Medicare eligibility would save $113 billion over 10 years after accounting for the necessary expansion of Medicaid and state health insurance exchange subsidies under health care reform, which are needed {{to help those who}} could not afford insurance purchase it. The Kaiser Family Foundation found that raising the age of eligibility would save the federal government $5.7 billion a year, while raising costs for other payers. According to Kaiser, raising the age would cost $3.7 billion to 65- and 66-year-olds, $2.8 billion to other consumers whose premiums would rise as insurance pools absorbed <b>more</b> <b>risk,</b> $4.5 billion to employers offering insurance, and $0.7 billion to states expanding their Medicaid rolls. Ultimately Kaiser found that the plan would raise total social costs by more than twice the savings to the federal government.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 2008, a New York state judge {{issued a}} {{temporary}} injunction blocking the transaction from going forward while {{the situation was}} sorted out. Citigroup alleged that they had an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia that barred Wachovia from negotiating with other potential buyers. The injunction was overturned {{late in the evening}} on October 5, 2008, by New York state appeals court. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> than the $42billion {{that would have been the}} cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of $60billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 2013 a {{new system}} of {{business}} rates retention began in England. Before April 2013 all business rate income collected by councils formed a single, national pot, which was then distributed by government in the form of formula grant. Through the Local Government Finance Act 2012, and regulations that followed, the Government gave local authorities the power to keep up to half of business rate income and transfer half of it centrally, to central government. The central share is then distributed to councils in the form of Revenue Support Grant. The other half kept by local authorities are then subjected to tariff, levy, top up and safety payments depending on the financial position of the council. According to the government the change gives financial incentives to councils to grow their local economies and increase their income from business rates. At the same time the new scheme has resulted in <b>more</b> <b>risk</b> and uncertainty.|$|E
