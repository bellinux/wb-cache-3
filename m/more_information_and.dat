Rollins posted playlists and commentary on-line; these lists were expanded with <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> published in book form as Fanatic! through 2.13.61 in November 2005. In late 2005, Rollins announced the show's return and began the first episode by playing the show's namesake Buzzcocks song. In 2008, the show was continuing each week despite Rollins's constant touring with new pre-recorded shows between live broadcasts. In 2009 Indie 103.1 went off the air, although it continues to broadcast over the Internet.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, {{while the}} Confederates {{attempted}} to raid New Creek, Averell's force crossed the Potomac at Hancock, Maryland, {{and headed for}} Springfield, West Virginia. He was losing horses due to exhaustion, but at Springfield he received food for his men and horses sent by General Kelley. Around this time he learned about McCausland's unsuccessful raid at New Creek, and that McCausland was moving toward Moorefield. He arrived in Romney around 11:00am on August 6. At that time he sent a battalion of men from the 22nd Pennsylvania Cavalry away from the main road to the Wardensville Road. This battalion, led by Major George T. Work, was instructed to block McCausland's route back to the Shenandoah Valley at Lost River Gap while Averell approached from behind, or approach McCausland from the east if fighting had begun. During the afternoon, Averell gathered <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> devised his plan for a surprise attack.|$|E

The Village Board and Planning Board should both {{be able to}} provide <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> reach out to local and regional business organizations. The zoning process could be improved, since many existing businesses downtown are on conditional uses, and site plan approvals should have a time limit, forcing owners to begin development.

25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E
25|$|In {{a priori}} methods, {{preference}} information is first asked from the DM {{and then a}} solution best satisfying these preferences is found. In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, the decision maker is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by the decision maker is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration. In this way, the DM learns about the feasibility of his/her wishes and can concentrate on solutions that are interesting to him/her. The DM may stop the search whenever he/she wants to. <b>More</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.|$|E

25|$|This {{was then}} {{followed}} by other Warrior Nun Areala mini series some written by Ben Dunn and some not, such as Rituals (1995–1996), Scorpio Rose (1996–1997), and Warrior Nun Areala Vol. 2. Published every two months, they expanded {{the world and}} provided <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> depth concerning the characters. There were also one shots such as crossovers with heroines of other companies such as Glory and Avengelyne. At the time there were other mini-series set in the Warrior Nun Areala universe that were {{not directly related to}} Sister Shannon Masters but instead widened the scope of the fictional world. Focusing on other Nuns of her order from past, present, and future; they include {{but are not limited to}} Crimson Nun (1997), Warrior Nun Frenzy (1998), and Warrior Nun Dei (1997–1999), respectively. There was also an ongoing anthology series, Warrior Nun Black and White that focused on the whole of the Warrior Nun universe.|$|E

500|$|Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games {{noted that}} {{compared}} to 1995, where the pop culture was [...] "fragmented", {{the onset of}} the Internet and social media made it easier to develop questions for the game. At the same time, with <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About You were not. Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work.|$|E
500|$|But {{some time}} later, Calvin Comfort, a [...] "prohibited mailing specialist" [...] for the region, found Jacobson's name in another file, and the {{government}} decided to try again, this time {{as part of an}} operation aimed at purchasers. In May 1986, they sent him mail from another fictitious organization, [...] "Midlands Data Research", which was for those who [...] "believe in the joys of sex and the complete awareness of those lusty and youthful lads and lasses of the neophite [...] age". Jacobson confessed to them that he was [...] "interested in teenage sexuality", asked for <b>more</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> that his name be kept confidential. This led to Jacobson getting mail from the [...] "Heartland Institute for a New Tomorrow" [...] (HINT), [...] "an organization founded to protect and promote sexual freedom and freedom of choice. We believe that arbitrarily imposed legislative sanctions restricting your sexual freedom should be rescinded through the legislative process." [...] Jacobson seemed to sympathize, writing in response that sexual freedom and freedom of the press were under attack by [...] "right-wing fundamentalists".|$|E
500|$|Prime Minister Harper said {{he would}} move forward with his top five {{priorities}} from the campaign. At least four of these would require legislative action: {{the passage of a}} Federal Accountability Act in response to the sponsorship scandal; setting longer mandatory sentences; lowering the Goods & Services Tax to 6% (and eventually to 5%); giving $1,200 for parents per child under the age of 6; and negotiating with the provinces to shorten wait-times (this priority was replaced, post-election, with combating crime by creating more police officers). The child allowance and first GST were in place by July 1, 2006. On December 6, 2006, another issue many expected to arise in the first session of parliament did, in fact, come to the fore, when the government introduced a motion calling [...] "on the government to introduce legislation to restore the traditional definition of marriage without affecting civil unions and while respecting existing same-sex marriages." [...] The next day, the House defeated the motion by a vote of 175 to 123, with six cabinet ministers voting against it, and Harper declared the issue settled. (See Members of the 39th Canadian Parliament and same-sex marriage for <b>more</b> <b>information.)</b> <b>and</b> on January 1, 2008 the second GST reduction came into effect.
