40|$|Technical {{barriers}} {{to the adoption of}} solar and wind energy include (i) intermittent availability, and (ii) high capital cost. One niche market in which these barriers are potentially less significant is circulation and destratification of water bodies. In hot weather when water near the surface becomes warmer and less dense than water at lower levels, natural convection is reduced. Dissolved oxygen then becomes depleted at lower levels by decomposition of organic matter and problems may develop, including unpleasant taste and odour, fish kills, discolouration due to metals in solution, and high phosphorus levels in the water column, which in turn favour toxic algal blooms. Where the organic loading of the water is low, as in potable water supply reservoirs, water out of contact with the atmosphere typically takes some weeks to become deoxygenated. Thus an intermittent power source such as solar or wind may not be a major disadvantage. Mechanical circulators may be designed to mimic natural convection using a small amount of power, thereby saving large sums in treatment which would otherwise be necessary.

Conceptually, the project was simple to formalize and initially received wide industry support. Facilitated by an ‘expert’ in the field and with start-up funding secured, the technical aspects of the initiative were potentially straight forward. Engagement with a community group to initiate a pilot project was also straight forward, entailing a conversation about growing plants on an allotment without a <b>mains</b> water <b>connection</b> and an enthusiasm to use roof runoff from nearby houses.

The dynamics of these tensions are summarised, demonstrating that the interplay between the organisational and technical aspects resulted in difficulties in practice.

This enormous set-up is currently operated by more than 170, 000 public water systems. Sustainability of the water supply system faces several imminent challenges such as: 1) increasing water main breaks, 2) decreasing fresh water resources, 3) untraceable non-revenue water use, and 4) increasing water demands. However, current water supply management practices are not capable of providing fundamental solutions to the issues identified above. Big Data is a new technical concept to collect massive amounts of relevant data from sensors installed to monitor structural condition, usage, and system performance. This Big Data concept can be realized by deploying Internet of Things (IoT) technology throughout the water supply infrastructure and consumers’ usage. This paper presents a schematic development of IoT application for Big Data collection through a myriad of water clients. The scheme consists of downstream and upstream data collection using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies connecting to IoT. Downstream data shall provide water usage and performance data to clients and upstream data is similar to traditional SCADA and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems. Ultimately, all data will be converged to build a Big Data collection system where data mining identifies 1) local and system performances including pressure and flow, 2) non-revenue and illegitimate water consumption, and 3) locations and quantity of water breaks and water losses.

40|$|Natural gas in Victoria is {{the main}} source of energy for {{residential}} heating, cooking, and hot water. Our use of gas has been built on a history of plentiful supply and relatively low and stable prices. However, the construction of export facilities in Queensland will link Australia’s eastern gas market to the international market for the first time, making wholesale gas prices both higher and more volatile. Higher wholesale prices will flow on to higher retail prices – and as the biggest residential users of gas in Australia, Victorians households will be more affected than households in any other state. Many are unprepared for price increases. Our Gas Challenge brings together the most comprehensive and current information about Victorian residential use of gas published at the time of writing. Section 1 introduces the report, and Section 2 provides a brief history of gas in Victoria. Section 3 details the number of Victorian households using gas, what type of gas they use, where they use it, and differences in consumption by tenancy, income, and dwelling type. Section 4 examines how much gas Victorians use, and Section 5 what for. Section  6 explores how much Victorians spend on gas and what concessions are available, while Section 7 looks at gas expansion in regional Victoria. Finally, Section 8 analyses the implications of the information for policy makers and identifies key areas to address. The average Victorian household spends around $ 1, 200 per year on gas, and retail prices are expected to rise by 24 % by 2015. Increases in average gas bills of $ 300 per year may find many unprepared, in particular, low income and vulnerable households, renters, and social housing tenants. The effects will be felt widely: over 90 % of Victorian households have either a <b>mains</b> gas <b>connection</b> or use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or bottled gas. Close to two million households will face higher prices and higher bills, across income levels and regions. Consumers are not sufficiently aware of the rising price trajectory of gas or its implications for them. The Victorian Government needs to address this issue as a priority. The role of gas as a continuing cheap alternative to electricity is in doubt, and both consumers and the Government must revisit their attitudes toward gas. Governments have a role in providing information to consumers to help them make better choices about appliances and gas contracts, encouraging consumers’ uptake of energy efficiency measures, and assisting consumers who are vulnerable or face barriers to taking action (e. g. renters, social housing tenants). Recommended responses include: information and education campaigns; appliance energy and labelling schemes that allow cross-fuel comparisons; research into the relative life cycle costs of electric vs. gas appliances; energy efficiency programs targeting high energy users; re-assessment of current energy schemes and concessions to ensure their appropriateness; and upgrades to housing stock...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} of myoelectrode amplifiers for prosthetic {{control is}} important for safe operation in electrically noisy conditions. Factors affecting susceptibility to interference (impedance, common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and isolation) were studied using a commercial amplifier. INTRODUCTION: Electrical interference can enter the system either directly between the active electrodes as a differential signal, or via the common electrode as a common mode signal. The direct path is susceptible to interference due to the high gain of the amplifier. Shielding and electrode geometry design can help reduce the effects. A notch filter is generally used to reduce greatly the amplifier gain at mains frequency, though harmonics are still passed. Common mode interference is mitigated by the normally very high CMRR of the amplifier; however, common mode signals can also be converted to differential signals through imbalances in electrode impedances (Winter and Webster, 1983; Scott and Lovely, 1986). Common mode interference mainly enters via the power and output leads of a myoelectrode amplifier, so effective isolation should reduce the effect. METHODS: Two Otto Bock 13 E 125 active myoelectrodes {{were used for the}} investigations. Sinusoidal signals of different frequencies were applied in differential and common mode configurations and the output measured. The myoelectrode and measuring equipment were all battery powered to avoid conductive <b>mains</b> interference. <b>Connection</b> to the electrode contacts was through an assembly of spring-loaded platinum contacts, and the myoelectrode was shielded from the external environment in a die-cast box. Measurements were made with different balanced and unbalanced input impedances to represent the skin interface. The measurements were made with the myoelectrode alone and also in combination with an isolation amplifier (Burr-Brown ISO 124), and a d. c. -d. c. converter (Murata MEA 1 D 0505 SC) to provide isolated power. RESULTS: The d. c. input impedance and intrinsic CMRR of the myoelectrode amplifier were extremely high by design (> 40 M? and > 90 dB). The response to differential signals was greatest at 200 Hz to 1 kHz, with a sharp notch at 50 Hz. The CMRR was significantly reduced for a. c. signals if the electrode impedances were unbalanced. As the amplifier gain was non-linear and frequency dependent, a protocol was followed where the imbalance in electrode impedances was adjusted to give the same output as a known differential input. Thus the effect of impedance imbalance could be separated from the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier. The results obtained fitted the Winter-Webster model with input capacitances of 400 pF. The centre earth electrode was found to be strongly coupled to the 0 V lead at a. c. via a capacitance of 1 ?F. Isolating the amplifier improved the rejection of common mode signals introduced via the 0 V lead. There was a 20 dB increase in CMRR with the isolation components used. CONCLUSION: Common mode interference can enter via the leads of a myoelectrode amplifier. Even if the intrinsic CMRR of the amplifier is very high, common mode is converted to an interfering differential signal if the electrode impedances are unbalanced. This is very likely to be the case, due to differences in skin contact. It has been demonstrated that the common mode route can be blocked by an isolating amplifier and dc-dc converter, though at the expense of extra complexity and the need to power these components. Practical implementations may come from developments in low power circuitry for applications such as wireless sensor networks. REFERENCES: Winter B. and Webster J.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{drinking}} water systems, production and distribution included, should be designed in adequate manner to keep functioning in hazardous or emergency situations. As time passes systems loose their ability to fulfil their function and maintenance, corrective and preventive, becomes necessary. Decisions on design {{as well as on}} maintenance are often taken based on previous experiences, as there may be a lot of uncertainties. To cope with decision making under uncertainties risk management is introduced. In {{the first part of this}} report a risk management approach is introduced. This approach is a cyclic process consisting of the following phases: risk analysis, risk evaluation and prioritisation, risk control, and evaluation of risk control measures. Performance and costs are two key concepts in asset management. The level of performance can be divided in the level of delivery of water and the level of customers’ services. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the level of delivery are the main focus in the second part of this report. The term SSM was introduced to make the level of performance of delivery towards customers measurable. SSM is a Dutch term that stands for minutes of insufficient delivery per customer per year. Activities, which could lead to SSM incidents, were registered. These activities were divided into activities, which lead to disruption of supply (in transport, distribution and <b>connection</b> <b>mains),</b> and activities leading to pressure and quality incidents. In a pilot study, of which the results are discussed, it became clear that the average SSM value for 2005 was about 36 : 20 min. After this a case study was conducted looking more in depth at the SSM data of 2 companies who participated in the pilot. The objective of this case study was to look more in depth at the main activities causing SSM and possible ways to reduce SSM. For both companies a list of top 3 causes, as well as suggestions for reducing SSM are included in the conclusions. The general conclusion was that the main causes of SSM were activities leading to disruptions in distribution mains. Recommended was that improved maintenance reducing the occurrence of leakages could decrease SSM. In the last chapter SSM is looked at in the broader perspective of risk management, in which decisions are based upon uncertainties. Something is first said about larger production incidents, such as calamities and disasters. These incidents lead in certain situations to high values of SSM, which hold some ground for including these incidents in the future when talking about the SSM approach.
