40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a global}} problem all over the world. Bioindicator approach is a modern and progressive way how to determinate an amount of damage caused by pollution in nature. Presented paper deals with processing of electron-microscope images of needles pores of Norway spruce. These needles have usually <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>structure</b> of epidermis. But if the tree grows in polluted air the needles start to cover by epicuticular waxes to protect themselves and stoma epidermis incrusts. Level of incrustation can be differentiated into five classes and it can solve {{as an indicator of}} level of air pollution. The goal of the work is a development of automatic algorithm which can recognize the level of stoma changes. There are various accesses leading to a solution of the given problem of texture classification. Two principles discussed in our paper are based on the edge detection and wavelet analysis. By means of these methods, classification criteria were chosen and applied on a library of known samples of stoma texture to generate classification tables. Classification tables were tested on sets of unknown images of stoma in comparison with sensual classification. The best criterion was chosen for processing of the whole set of images taken from the various points in the Czech Republic. 1 Image Processing and Air Pollution Study of needle epidermis texture is useful for air pollution monitoring as the epidermis is the first place of contact of tree with polluted air. For our research, the Norway spruce was chosen because of its large territory of occurrence. Previous studies proved that structure properties of needle epidermis are dependent on degree of air pollution. If the tree grows in a clean air, the epidermis with stomas * has <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>structure.</b> But when a quality of the air became worse, the needle epidermis starts to cover by epicuticular waxes to protect themselves against pollutants.

40|$|In the {{synthesis}} of various colloids, thin and thick films, particles and other materials where bottom-to-top approach is involved, it is ambiguous to understand structure evolution. Atoms of electronic transitions are entitled to evolve structures along with modified ones. When an electron de-excites where prior to that excitation, on getting free from the inherent force of its atom, it configures the force energy called unit photon, that photon on compressing arms converts into a merged photon which can be absorbed by a suitably located atom resulting into excite electron at target. Instead of absorption, when such photon coincides to one resulting by the adjacent atom, it results into coupling construct energy knot between the atoms. Structural maturity at primitive cell to precede certain crystal structure to large size is vital. Evolving structure of binary or ternary composition, the same practice is viable except that of the different attained dynamics and electron-dynamics of atoms. In all sorts of structure evolution while dealing different processes, characteristics photons and field force behaviors regulate the dynamics where atoms of evolving structure deal both input process parameters {{as well as the}} localized ones. Structure of one-dimension and two-dimension emerge in the orientation of attained dynamics of atoms where uni-directional and bi-directional photon couplings take place.

40|$|A {{storm surge}} is the sudden rise of sea {{water over the}} astronomical tides, {{generated}} by an approaching storm. This event poses {{a major threat to}} the Philippine coastal areas, as manifested by Typhoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013. This hydro-meteorological hazard {{is one of the main}} reasons for the high number of casualties due to the typhoon, with 6300 deaths. It became evident that the need to develop a storm surge inundation map is of utmost importance. To develop these maps, the Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST-Project NOAH) simulated historical tropical cyclones that entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility. The Japan Meteorological Agency storm surge model was used to simulate storm surge heights. The frequency distribution of the maximum storm surge heights was calculated using simulation results of tropical cyclones under a specific public storm warning signal (PSWS) that passed through a particular coastal area. This determines the storm surge height corresponding to a given probability of occurrence. The storm surge heights from the model were added to the maximum astronomical tide data from WXTide software. The team then created maps of inundation for a specific PSWS using the probability of exceedance derived from the frequency distribution. Buildings and other structures were assigned a probability of exceedance depending on their occupancy category, i. e., 1 % probability of exceedance for critical facilities, 10 % probability of exceedance for special occupancy structures, and 25 % for standard occupancy and <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>structures.</b> The maps produced show the storm-surge-vulnerable areas in Metro Manila, illustrated by the flood depth of up to 4 m and extent of up to 6. 5 km from the coastline.

These maps can also determine the best areas to build critical structures, or at least determine the level of protection of these structures should they be built in hazard areas. Moreover, these will support the local government units' mandate to raise public awareness, disseminate information about storm surge hazards, and implement appropriate countermeasures for a given PSWS...|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive testing using {{ultrasound}} is {{well established}} as a technique of inspecting <b>miscellaneous</b> <b>structures</b> and components. Ultrasonic waves propagating in an elastic solid are sensitive to both the material and geometrical properties of the solid. Decades of experience have shown {{that it is possible}} to extract these properties from the waves in an efficient and reliable way in a variety of practical measurement settings. Different techniques have been developed over many decades, and ultrasonic devices are now standard tools for conducting inspection in the oil and gas industry, infrastructure, aerospace industry, and many other fields. One technique used to examine the properties of a material is based on the acoustic resonance in solid plates. When waves propagate in a plate with finite thickness, they are reflected multiple times within the plate. At some frequencies, this will create a resonance. The resonance frequencies depend, among other parameters, on the thickness of the plate, hence, measurements of the resonance frequencies is a means of determining the plate thickness. Most ultrasound inspection techniques depend on a liquid coupling between the ultrasound transducers and the solid. This thesis aims to assess the feasibility of using air-coupled ultrasound for thickness measurements of steel plates, by finding the thickness resonances in the plate. To achieve this, theoretical models for the wave propagation in the plate were developed, featuring the relation between resonances found in a real experimental situation, and the thickness and material parameters of the plate. The main contributions are: 1. Experimental verification of through-transmission acoustic measurements on a steel plate in air, showing that it was possible to detect several plate resonances. These resonances were used to estimate the plate thickness, demonstrating that it was possible to distinguish between plate segments differing in thickness by 2 %. 2. Implementation of a theoretical model to elaborate on the observations of the steel plate measurements. The model is based on the angular spectrum method, includ ing the effects of the finite apertures of the transducers; wave propagation in air and elastic waves in the solid plate. The interaction between the plate and the air is handled by plane wave reflection and transmission coefficients. The transducers are described by a plane piston-model. 3. A feasibility study of using a receiver displaced laterally away from the acoustical axis of the transmitter. The scope of the theoretical model was adjusted to include this situation, and then tested experimentally in a through-transmission study on a steel plate in water. The theoretical model was then used to investigate the possibility of conducting pulse-echo measurements on a steel plate in air, using a receiver displaced laterally off the transmitter’s acoustical axis. The purpose of this study was to avoid saturating the receiver from the strong first reflection from the air-steel interface, and detect the echoes from reverberations inside the plate. 4. A systematic, theoretical study of the position of the first resonance peak in the received spectra in the through-transmission setup described above. For certain parameter combinations, the first compressional resonance was found to be as low as 0. 89 times the plate cut-off frequency, i. e. the simple plane wave assumption can result in errors of up to 11 % compared with the cut-off frequency of the S 1 - mode when estimating the plate resonance. A particular focus was on how the down-shift of this resonance depends on the angular spread of the sound field, and how it varies between different material types, especially as a function of the Poisson’s ratio of the material...|$|E
