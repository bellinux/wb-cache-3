500|$|After Marker saw Manson's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes, {{the band}} {{invited her to}} Vig and Marker's Smart Studios to sing {{on a couple of}} songs, but after a [...] "dreadful" [...] first audition, she {{returned}} to Angelfish. Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time, where she began to work on the then-skeletal [...] "Queer", [...] "Vow" [...] and [...] "Stupid Girl". Working on the lyrics, [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] became an [...] "anthem for a girl who won't settle for less than what she wants". Later she added, [...] " [...] really about squandering potential, [...] our version of Madonna's 'Express Yourself', but a little more subversive". Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend's foolish behaviour: [...] "A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society. It's just that women have a different set of problems from men... make the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> potential." [...] Manson added that [...] "Stupid Girl" [...] was [...] "a song of reproach {{to a lot of people}} we know", both male and female, and that [...] "we could have called it 'Stupid Guy,' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{some time}} Mahal thought of {{pursuing}} farming over music. He {{had developed a}} passion for farming that nearly rivaled his love of music—coming {{to work on a}} farm first at age 16. It was a dairy farm in Palmer, Massachusetts, not far from Springfield. By age nineteen he had become farm foreman, getting up a bit after 4:00a.m. and running the place. [...] "I milked anywhere between thirty-five and seventy cows a day. I clipped udders. I grew corn. I grew Tennessee redtop clover. Alfalfa." [...] Mahal believes in growing one's own food, saying, [...] "You have a whole generation of kids who think everything comes out of a box and a can, and they don't know you can grow <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> food." [...] Because of his personal support of the family farm, Mahal regularly performs at Farm Aid concerts.|$|E

[...] The producer Cameron Mackintosh {{did not like}} [...] "that there was {{no change in the}} characters from beginning to end.... In the London production ... the characters come to understand each other." [...] Sondheim [...] "did not think the London script was as good as the original." [...] However, he thought that it was [...] "wonderful" [...] that, {{at the end of the}} first act, [...] "the principal characters recognized their younger selves and were able to acknowledge them throughout the last thirty minutes of the piece." [...] Sondheim wrote four new songs: [...] "Country House" [...] (replacing [...] "The Road You Didn't Take"), [...] "Loveland" [...] (replacing the song of the same title), [...] "Ah, But Underneath" [...] (replacing [...] "The Story of Lucy and Jessie", for the non-dancer Diana Rigg), and [...] "Make the <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Music" [...] (replacing [...] "Live, Laugh, Love").|$|E

2500|$|Crowe {{returned}} to Australia at age 21, intending {{to apply to}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [...] "I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA", Crowe has recalled. [...] "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've been doing it for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" [...] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of The Rocky Horror Show. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of Blood Brothers, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom in 1989.|$|E
