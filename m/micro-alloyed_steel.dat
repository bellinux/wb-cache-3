The presence of impurities in fuel ethanol has resulted into certain downsides regarding material compatibility. This work is focused on an investigation of the influence of sodium chloride (NaCl) as an impurity in the electrochemical degradation of <b>micro-alloyed</b> <b>steel</b> (MAS) when exposed to E 20 simulated fuel grade ethanol (SFGE) environment. Immersion and electrochemical tests were carried out using NaCl concentrations ranging from 0 to 64  mg/L. Highest corrosion rates were obtained with 64  mg/L NaCl and lowest rates were observed in the zero chloride tests. Chloride was also seen to cause pitting corrosion on MAS. The results of potentiodynamic polarization tests on MAS compared well with mass loss corrosion rates. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test confirms the significance of the results at 99 % confidence, and further showed that there is significant difference between the chloride concentrations.
