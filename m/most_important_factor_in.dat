5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The single <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of}} the most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial self-sufficiency, but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} conservatism, in 1963 Brabham {{was the first}} Formula One team to use a wind tunnel to hone their designs to reduce drag and stop the cars lifting off the ground at speed. The practice only became the norm in the early 1980s, and is possibly the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the design of modern cars. Towards {{the end of the}} 1960s, teams began to exploit aerodynamic downforce to push the cars' tyres down harder on the track and enable them to maintain faster speeds through high-speed corners. At the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix, Brabham were the first, alongside Ferrari, to introduce full width rear wings to this effect.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks were the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

25|$|Analysts {{have also}} looked at how {{uncertainty}} over climate sensitivity affects economic estimates of climate change impacts. Hope (2005), for example, found that uncertainty over the climate sensitivity was the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining the social cost of carbon (an economic measure of climate change impacts).|$|E
25|$|In Europe the {{overwhelming}} importance of combustion conditions on dioxin formation {{has been established}} by numerous researchers. The single <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> forming dioxin-like compounds is {{the temperature of the}} combustion gases. Oxygen concentration also plays a major role on dioxin formation, but not the chlorine content.|$|E

25|$|In medicine, {{compliance}} (also adherence, capacitance) {{describes the}} degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both the patient and the health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> improving compliance, although the high cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.|$|E
25|$|An {{essential}} oil extracted from eucalyptus leaves contains compounds that are powerful natural disinfectants {{and can be}} toxic in large quantities. Several marsupial herbivores, notably koalas and some possums, are relatively tolerant of it. The close correlation of these oils with other more potent toxins called formylated phloroglucinol compounds (euglobals, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals) allows koalas and other marsupial species to make food choices based on {{the smell of the}} leaves. For koalas, these compounds are the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> leaf choice.|$|E

25|$|Various theologians have {{assorted}} opinions {{as to why}} {{the apostles}} wrote the Codes in the first place, and then why they were directed to a variety of recipients in several New Testament passages. Some believe that the intent of the Codes is not universal throughout the passages in which they appear. They believe it necessary to determine the specific function of a Code within a specific New Testament passage. Timothy Gombis posits that the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining the purpose of the Code is to consider the literary context in which it appears.|$|E
25|$|Amyntas {{had another}} wife, a fellow kinswoman named Gygaea, who had three children. At {{some point during}} her husband’s reign, Eurydice became the {{dominant}} wife. Still it cannot be determined whether this development was immediate or gradual, linked with her family and relations, her higher status, the ages of her sons {{or a combination of}} these factors. Nevertheless, for the first time events {{in the life of a}} royal woman were also central to the political arena of Macedonia in that period and Eurydice was, however, the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the change.|$|E
25|$|Since about 2010, {{researchers}} such as Eppig, Hassel, and MacKenzie {{have found}} a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children. They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it {{is by far the}} <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining population IQ. However, they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition and regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} {{growth of}} Canada's population {{is complex and}} has been influenced in many different ways, such as indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Being a new world country, Canada has been predisposed {{to be a very}} open society with regards to immigration, which has been the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> its historical population growth. Canadians comprise about 0.5% of the world's total population, The 2016 Canadian census counted a total population of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.|$|E
25|$|Television in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, {{with the}} {{founding}} of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand. Since then television has grown in the country, creating large public networks such as Globo, SBT, Record and Bandeirantes. Today it is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> popular culture of Brazilian society, indicated by research showing {{that as much as}} 67% of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast. Digital Television, using the SBTVD standard (based on the Japanese standard ISDB-T), was adopted 29 June 2006 and launched on 2 November 2007. In May 2010, Brazil launched TV Brasil Internacional, an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Mauss is {{recognized}} as one of the first authors interested in the study of gift economies. His main concern centered on individuals' need to provide gifts and the obligations to reciprocate them. He identified human obligation to give, receive, and reciprocate as the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the creation and maintenance of social ties. Reciprocation was mainly produced by the insertion of the giver's identity in the object that was given. The object maintained this essence (referred to as hau or mana by Mauss) of the giver which needed to return to him/her through reciprocation in the form of a counter-gift (another object, services, person, agreements, etc.).|$|E

25|$|Quality of nesting habitat {{surrounding}} the lek is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> population success. Adequacy of cover {{is critical for}} nesting. Too little can exist: where 13% was the average total crown cover on Idaho range, nests were located where average cover was 17%. No hens nested in the most arid, open areas with less than 10% total shrub cover. Too much also can occur: average shrub cover at 87 nest sites was 18.4%, and in more dense cover, greater sage-grouse did not nest where total shrub cover was greater than 25%. In Utah, no nests occurred where threetip sagebrush cover exceeded 35%.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of these findings is that they contradicted both the traditional pedagogic advice of limiting or avoiding bodily contact {{in an attempt to}} avoid spoiling children, and the insistence of the predominant behaviorist school of psychology that emotions were negligible. Feeding was thought to be the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> the formation of a mother–child bond. Harlow concluded, however, that nursing strengthened the mother–child bond because of the intimate body contact that it provided. He described his experiments as a study of love. He also believed that contact comfort could be provided by either mother or father. Though widely accepted now, this idea was revolutionary at the time in provoking thoughts and values concerning the studies of love.|$|E
25|$|According to {{economist}} David Foot of the University of Toronto, {{the level}} of a woman's education is the <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> determining whether she will reproduce: the higher her level of education, the less likely she is to bear children (or if she does, the fewer children she is likely to have). Overall, researchers have observed childless couples to be more educated, and it is perhaps because of this that {{they are more likely to}} be employed in professional and management occupations, more likely for both spouses to earn relatively high incomes, and to live in urban areas. They are also less likely to be religious, subscribe to traditional gender roles, or subscribe to conventional roles.|$|E
