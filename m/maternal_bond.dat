25|$|Debuting on June 29, 1994, Models Inc. was {{produced}} by Spelling Television and created by Charles Pratt, Jr. and Frank South. The series followed the lives of Hillary {{and several of the}} disparate, ambitious models in the titular agency—women whom Hillary sometimes felt a <b>maternal</b> <b>bond</b> toward. Also present was Hillary's son David (Brian Gaskill), the loyal, valiant, and occasionally hot-headed vice president of the company. At the beginning of the first episode, actors Grant Show and Daphne Zuniga briefly appeared as their Melrose Place characters, seeing off a young model named Sarah Owens (Cassidy Rae) as she headed to the agency.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that fetal memory may begin within the second trimester after conception. Substantial evidence for fetal memories has been found at around 30 weeks after conception. Fetal memory is important for parental recognition, and facilitates the bond between child and parents. One of the most important types of memory is that which stores information contributing to the <b>maternal</b> <b>bond</b> between infant and mother. This form of memory is important for a type of development known as attachment. Fetal memory is thus critical to the survival of the fetus both prenatally (in the womb) and after birth as an infant.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} social anxiety disorder (SAD) and perceived <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> styles among young women during pregnancy and 30 months after childbirth. Methods: A cohort of young women {{from the city of}} Pelotas, Brazil was followed up from pregnancy to 30 months postpartum. The Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus was used to assess SAD and the Parental Bonding Instrument was administered to measure <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> styles. Poisson regression with robust variance was used for multivariable analysis. Results: After adjusting for potential confounding factors, SAD prevalence was 6. 39 times higher among young women who perceived their mothers as neglectful (prevalence ratio [PR] 6. 39; 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI] 1. 2 - 32. 0), and 5. 57 times higher in women who perceived their mothers as affectionless controlling (PR = 5. 57; 95 %CI 1. 5 - 19. 7) when compared with those who received optimal care. Conclusion: <b>Maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> style may have an influence on the development of SAD. Therefore, support and early prevention strategies should be offered to the family...|$|R

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her.

[...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the <b>maternal</b> <b>bond,</b> as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story.

40|$|The {{notion of}} an innate {{capacity}} for imitation, arguably signified by neonatal imitation, {{has been the subject}} of passionate debate for the last 35 years. Although it is widely accepted that neonates match tongue protrusion (TP) gestures, disagreement persists regarding the mechanism and function of neonatal imitation. Given that neonatal imitation has been proposed to be a primitive mechanism that evolved to elicit and maintain early interactions to serve interpersonal and communicative functions, we argue that imitative exchanges between newborns and caregivers foster a strengthened bond and sense of parental efficacy. Using archived imitation footage collected at one week of age, Experiment 1 retrospectively explored the relationship between neonatal imitation and the early <b>maternal</b> <b>bonds</b> and feelings of efficacy (N = 29). Experiment 2 investigated this relationship concurrently, measuring the development of paternal, as well as <b>maternal,</b> <b>bonding</b> and efficacy (N = 13). Although no evidence for TP imitation at a group level was found in either experiment, some infants showed evidence of neonatal imitation and we analysed the data on this premise. There was no relationship between imitative TP and <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> and efficacy in either experiment, and no association between TP imitation and paternal bonding or efficacy in Experiment 2. Fundamental limitations of the study are addressed and the implications are discussed, highlighting recommendations for future research...|$|R

40|$|Background Mother-infant bonding {{provides}} {{the foundation for}} secure attachment through the lifespan and organizes many facets of infant social-emotional development, including later parenting. Aims To describe <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> to offspring across the pregnancy and postnatal periods, and to examine {{a broad range of}} sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors of the maternal-offspring bond. Methods Data were drawn from a sample of 372 pregnant women participating in an Australian population-based longitudinal study of postnatal health and development. Participants completed <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> questionnaires at each trimester and 8 weeks postnatal. Data were collected on a range of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. Results Bonding increased significantly through pregnancy, in quality and intensity. Regression analyses indicated that stronger antenatal bonding at all time points (trimesters 1 through 3) predicted stronger postnatal <b>bonding.</b> Older <b>maternal</b> age, birth mother being born in a non-English speaking country, mother not working full time, being a first-time mother, breast-feeding problems, and baby's crying behavior all predicted poorer bonding at 8 weeks postpartum. Conclusion These novel findings have important implications for pregnant women and their infant offspring, and for health care professionals working in perinatal services. Importantly, interventions to strengthen maternal-fetal bonding would be beneficial during pregnancy to enhance postnatal bonding and infant health outcomes. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Parental bonding {{has been}} implicated in smoking behavior, {{and the quality of}} <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> (MB) has been {{associated}} with poor mental health and substance use. However, {{little is known about the}} association of MB and the smoking of the offspring. METHODS: In our study, 129 smokers and 610 non-smoker medical students completed the parental bonding instrument, which measures MB along two dimensions: care and overprotection. Four categories can be created by high and low scores on care and overprotection: optimal parenting (OP; high care/low overprotection); affectionless control (ALC; low care/high overprotection); affectionate constraint (AC; high care/high overprotection), and neglectful parenting (NP; low care/low overprotection). Nicotine dependence was assessed by the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Test, exhaled CO level, and daily cigarette consumption (CPD). RESULTS: Higher CPD was significantly associated with lower overprotection (p = 0. 016) and higher care (p = 0. 023) scores. The odds for being a smoker were significantly higher in the neglectful <b>maternal</b> <b>bonding</b> style compared to the other rearing styles (p = 0. 022). Besides, smokers showed significantly higher care and lower overprotection scores with the Mann-Whitney U-test than non-smokers, although these associations did not remain significant in multiple regression models. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that focusing on early life relationship between patient and mother can be important in psychotherapeutic interventions for smoking.
