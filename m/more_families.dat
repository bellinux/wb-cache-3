5|$|After renovations were {{finished}} in 2005, {{the number of}} two- and three-bedroom units was increased dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted <b>more</b> <b>families</b> to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices they pay.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{people moved}} out of the {{surrounding}} Manhattan Valley neighborhood. Consequently, the Master Apartments' museum and cultural center closed by 1971, their holdings dispersed elsewhere, although the building's auditorium was still used for cultural events. After Louis's death in 1979, the building was bought by real estate investor Sol Goldman, who converted it to a housing co-operative over the next decade. Further renovations, which were completed in 2005, resulted in many of the one-bedroom studios being combined into two- and three-bedroom units. These renovations attracted <b>more</b> <b>families</b> and made the building more luxurious by both quality-of-life and purchase-price measures. The Master Apartments was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.|$|E
5|$|In November 1907 six <b>more</b> <b>families</b> {{consisting}} of 27 individuals from Mingulay squatted on Sandray, {{which has a}} sheltered beach. Meanwhile, {{the plight of the}} Vatersay raiders had been raised at Westminster. Despite considerable public sympathy they were eventually sentenced to two months in prison. Shortly thereafter the Congested Districts Board purchased the entire island of Vatersay with the aim of providing new crofts. By the next summer there were 14 Mingulay families living there. Only six families remained on Mingulay itself, and all of them planned to leave.|$|E

From 2008 to 2009, the large deficit increase was also driven by spending on stimulus and bailout programs.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for 6.5% of Costa Rica's GDP and 14% of the workforce. Costa Rica irrigates around 21% of its {{land under cultivation}} relying primarily on surface water. The irrigation sector is managed by The National Irrigation and Drainage Service (SENARA). Two striving irrigation districts of note that are different in size, and means of execution are: 1) Arenal-Tempisque Irrigation District (DRAT) which is a much larger district than the latter and grows staple crops; 2) and the Irrigation and Drainage of Small Areas (PARD) is smaller but benefits <b>more</b> <b>families</b> than DRAT and focuses on higher value crops.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{research}} into military brats has been conducted on the long-term effects on adults who grew up during the Cold War and also during the Vietnam and Korean wars. As the Cold War came to an end, {{the role of the}} United States Armed Forces changed. The U.S. military realized that there was distinct correlation between the quality of life and retention and operational effectiveness. To this end, the military started to change the living standards that most Cold War brats grew up with. The demographics of the military changed. The modern military has a larger proportion of married military members. Since base housing is designed for fewer families, <b>more</b> <b>families</b> are forced to live off-base.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Estreito represents 29.6% the municipality's population, although this has varied considerably {{within the last}} 50 years: this includes the loss of many people from the de-annexation of Jardim da Serra, as well as emigration and population shifts within the island. Regardless, of the five parishes that make-up Câmara de Lobos, Estreito had the second largest birth rate (16.9%), along with {{a high percentage of}} youth 0–14 years of age (25.7% or 2630). This was attributed by the local parish government with the settling of <b>more</b> <b>families</b> in the region, with young children or by young adults. Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE) records indicate approximately 2715 families in 2001, mostly composed of large families with many children, similarly reflected in 3217 family homes established in the parish.|$|E

25|$|The Plantation of Ulster was a mixed {{success for}} the English. By the 1630s, there were 20,000 adult male English and Scottish {{settlers}} in Ulster, which meant that the total settler population could have been as high as 80,000 to 150,000. They formed local majorities {{of the population in}} the Finn and Foyle valleys (around modern Derry and east Donegal), north Armagh and east Tyrone. Planters had achieved substantial settlement on unofficially planted lands in north Down, led by James Hamilton and Hugh Montgomery, and in south Antrim under Sir Randall MacDonnell. The settler population increased rapidly, as just under half of the migrants were women – a very high ratio compared, for instance, to contemporary Spanish settlement in Latin America or English settlement in Virginia. New England attracted <b>more</b> <b>families,</b> but still was predominately male in its early years.|$|E
25|$|Four years later, the Mission {{property}} was auctioned off under questionable circumstances for $710 worth of tallow and hides (equivalent to $15,000 in 2004 dollars) to Englishman John (Don Juan) Forster (Governor Pío Pico's brother-in-law, whose family {{would take up}} residence in the friars' quarters for the next twenty years) and his partner James McKinley. <b>More</b> <b>families</b> would subsequently take up residence in other portions of the Mission buildings. José María Zalvidea left San Juan Capistrano on or about November 25, 1842, when Mission San Luis Rey de Francia's Ibarra died, leaving the Mission without a resident priest {{for the first time}} (Zalvidea had been the Mission's sole priest ever since the death of Josef Barona in 1831.) The first secular priest to take charge of the mission, Reverend José Maria Rosáles, arrived on October 8, 1843; Vicente Pascual Oliva, the last resident missionary, died on January 2, 1848.|$|E
25|$|Geographic and {{environmental}} causes can {{also play a}} significant role in contributing to Burkina Faso's issue of food insecurity. As the country is situated in the Sahel region, Burkina Faso experiences some of the most radical climatic variation in the world, ranging from severe flooding to extreme drought. The unpredictable climatic shock that Burkina Faso citizens often face results in strong difficulties in being able to rely on and accumulate wealth through agricultural means. Burkina Faso's climate also renders its crops vulnerable to insect attacks, including attacks from locusts and crickets, which destroy crops and further inhibit food production. Not only is most of the population of Burkina Faso dependent on agriculture as a source of income, but they also rely on the agricultural sector for food that will directly feed the household. Due to the vulnerability of agriculture, more and <b>more</b> <b>families</b> are having to look for other sources of non-farm income, and oftentimes have to travel outside of their regional zone to find work.|$|E
