40|$|Abstract. Physical <b>modification</b> and {{chemical}} <b>modification</b> {{were used to}} modify fluorgypsum. Effect of physical <b>modification</b> {{and chemical}} <b>modification</b> {{on the performance of}} fluorgypsum was studied, and the mechanism of <b>modification</b> was discussed by testing the phase composition and microstructure of modified fluorgypsum, using XRD and SEM. The results showed that fluorgypsum activity was excited effectively by physical <b>modification</b> and chemical <b>modification.</b> Physical <b>modification</b> decreased CaSO 4 grain size and structure regularity, and increased fluorgypsum specific surface area, and the optimum specific surface area was 4600 - 4900 cm 2 /g. Chemical <b>modification</b> accelerated fluorgypsum hydration and CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O growth, and increased CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O grain size and slenderness ratio. The strength of fluorgypsum was exerted effectively by chemical <b>modification...</b>|$|R

40|$|The use of fillers {{in paper}} {{products}} can provide cost and energy savings, improved paper properties, increased productivities, and specifically desired paper functionalities. There are many {{problems associated with}} the use of fillers, such as unsuitability of calcium carbonate fillers in acid papermaking, negative effects of filler loading on paper strength, sizing, and retention, and tendencies of fillers to cause abrasion and dusting. In order to solve these problems and to make better use of fillers, many methods have been proposed, among which filler <b>modification</b> has been a hot topic. The available technologies of filler <b>modification</b> mainly include <b>modification</b> with inorganic substances, <b>modification</b> with natural polymers or their derivatives, <b>modification</b> with water-soluble synthetic polymers, <b>modification</b> with surfactants, <b>modification</b> with polymer latexes, hydrophobic <b>modification,</b> cationic <b>modification,</b> surface nano-structuring, physical <b>modification</b> by compressing, calcination or grinding, and <b>modification</b> for use in functional papers. The methods of filler <b>modification</b> can provide improved acid tolerant and optical properties of fillers, enhanced fiber-filler bonding, improved filler retention and filler sizabilities, alleviated filler abrasiveness, improved filler dispersability, and functionalization of filled papers. Filler <b>modification</b> has been an indispensable way to accelerate the development of high filler technology in papermaking, which is likely to create additional benefits to papermaking industry in the future...|$|R
