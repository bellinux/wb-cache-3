Following the incident, the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101's future was publicly debated. In {{the first six months}} of 2008, the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50%, well below the target of 80%, partly due to an inadequate <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisation</b> and staff shortages.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research on future manufacturing and the forthcoming fourth industrial revolution (implying extensive digitalisation), {{there is a}} lack of understanding regarding the specific changes that can be expected for <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations.</b> Therefore, developing scenarios for future maintenance is needed to define long-term strategies for the realisation of digitalised manufacturing. This empirical Delphi-based scenario planning study is the first within the maintenance realm, examining a total of 34 projections about potential changes to the internal and external environment of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations,</b> considering both hard (technological) and soft (social) dimensions. The paper describes a probable future of <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> in digitalised manufacturing in the year 2030, based on an extensive three-round Delphi survey with 25 maintenance experts at strategic level from the largest companies within the Swedish manufacturing industry. In particular, the study contributes with development of probable as well as wildcard scenarios for future maintenance. This includes e. g. advancement of data analytics, increased emphasis on education and training, novel principles for maintenance planning with a systems perspective, and stronger environmental legislation and standards. The scenarios may serve as direct input to strategic development in industrial <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> and are expected to substantially improve preparedness to the changes brought by digitalised manufacturing...|$|R
25|$|A second Special Bulletin was {{published}} by the AAIB on 21 December 2015.

40|$|Digitalisation is {{the future}} of the {{manufacturing}} industry, and it will entail production systems that are highly automated, efficient, and flexible. The realisation of such systems will require effective <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> that adopt engineering approaches, e. g. engineering tools and methods. However, little is known about their actual extent of use in industry. Through a survey study in 70 Swedish manufacturing companies, this study shows to what extent engineering tools and methods are used in <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations,</b> as well as to what extent companies have maintenance engineers performing work related to engineering tools and methods. Overall, the results indicate a potential for increasing the use of engineering tools and methods in both the operational and the design and development phase.

40|$|Recent {{research}} at four large manufacturing {{sites in the}} North East of England showed that <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> were failing because they were locked in a cycle of quick fix and mend despite deploying extensive planned maintenance policies. Consequently {{they were unable to}} plan and formulate strategies because they did not have the time. Simple and quick tools were needed to select the best maintenance approach for the machines and the plant. Two possible selection tools were developed. Firstly a truth table was produced based on the key characteristics of each maintenance approach and these mapped against simplified failure mode combinations. This offered a quick and easy selection method for machines, based on failure mode patterns. Secondly, the macro level was addressed using a conceptual model employing a 2 x 2 matrix. This consisted of two axes, the level of machine failures and the level of improvement activity. The resulting framework was used to predict how <b>maintenance</b> <b>organisations</b> would progress from a state of reactive maintenance towards world class. Then informed by the truth table it was possible to select an appropriate maintenance approach which was most suitable for each stage. It is suggested that these two methods offer simple and quick approaches to guide vital maintenance decision making at plants in difficulty. This of course does not preclude the need to develo...|$|R
