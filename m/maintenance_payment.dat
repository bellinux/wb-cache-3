50|$|Financial aid to {{families}} with children {{comes in the form of}} child allowances, child care and maintenance allowances, and maternity benefits. Child allowances dated from the 1930s, and they were one of the oldest parts of the welfare system. The law in force in the late 1980s was the Child Allowance Act of 1948, which arranged for payments to parents for all children under the age of sixteen and resident in Finland, regardless of the wealth or nationality of the parents. Child-care allowances had been paid since the 1970s to those parents who stayed at home to care for small children or who had engaged someone else to do so. A child maintenance allowance is paid when a court-ordered <b>maintenance</b> <b>payment</b> for a child of divorced parents was not being paid. A maternity benefit, based on legislation of the 1930s, was paid for each pregnancy. It came either as a grant or as a much more valuable set of materials, the maternity package, needed to tend a child. It was withheld if the mother did not visit a clinic by the fifth month of pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} {{time and money}} spent by various states investigating mounting financial problems in workers' compensation in recent years, {{we still do not}} know very much about the causes of the problems. An important reason for this has been that the debate in Australia has suffered from a number of misconceptions and lack of analytical rigour. This article outlines how some basic economics can provide a framework for analysing many issues in the workers' compensation debate. In doing so the analysis casts doubt on a number of conventional wisdoms, particularly the belief that employers pay for workers' compensation and the assumption that current levels of government involvement in worker disability insurance arrangements are justified. In addition, data from New South Wales are presented that suggest the main reason for increased costs is higher income <b>maintenance</b> <b>payment</b> per claim. As with overseas experience, higher benefit levels appear to give workers more incentive to stay away from work and make claims for injuries whose severity is harder to measure.

40|$|Application Service Providing (ASP) is a {{novel and}} {{promising}} approach for the distribution of software. Changing the philosophy from software as a material good (e. g. CD-ROM) to {{software as a service}} can result in a number of benefits for the software vendor (reduced time to customer, development of new markets etc.) and the end user (concentration on usage rather than installation and <b>maintenance,</b> <b>payment</b> per use, reduced total cost of ownership etc.). In the engineering domain, however, we find several ancillary conditions that inhibit an ASP boom just as in other areas such as customer relationship management. The tight integration of various applications (CAD, CAE, PDM) in the design process and the importance of high-end graphical presentation and interaction are just two of the important requirements that must be taken into account. The first part of the paper examines technological, economic and psychological factors that influence the ASP decision, as well as presenting the actual market situation and looking at the future of engineering ASP. In the second half, we present a technical concept that can overcome various problems that arise when using today’s ASP technology. We also provide a roadmap for further research in this area and identify promising technologies for deployment, communication and integration. ...|$|E
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that the current child maintenance system in the Netherlands suffers from inadequacies. An important indication {{is the fact that}} many Dutch parents resort to the courts in order to resolve their differences concerning the child <b>maintenance</b> <b>payment.</b> Another indication relates to the high number of parents with care who apply to the National Maintenance Collection Agency (LBIO) to enforce the child <b>maintenance</b> <b>payment</b> by the liable parent. In addition to this, Dutch municipalities are dealing with considerable numbers of recovery claims each month. The central question of this research is the following: Do the Norwegian and Swedish child maintenance systems provide models that can be transposed into Dutch legislation? The reason for comparing the Dutch child maintenance system with the Norwegian and Swedish systems is that the social structure of these Nordic countries shares essential features with that of the Netherlands, and because both Norway and Sweden have a progressive child maintenance system. The main conclusion is that parts of the Scandinavian systems can be transposed into Dutch legislation, concerning the duty and the right to child maintenance, the determination of child maintenance and the enforcement of the amount. The following recommendations may be formulated for the Dutch child maintenance system based on the research conclusions drawn. A maintenance obligation ought to be developed for a known donor in case this has not been acquired by a consenting partner, {{as is the case in}} Norway and Sweden. In addition The Dutch legislator should adopt the example of the Norwegian and Swedish child maintenance systems by providing children beyond the age of eighteen with a conditional right to maintenance. Any child receiving secondary or higher education should be considered to be in need. The Dutch government should establish formal guidelines for assessing child maintenance, for example by issuing a governmental decree. Furthermore, assessing the required amount of child maintenance should be straightforward, depending on a limited number of factors, and it should be based on the needs of children, on the one hand, and the financial capacity of parents on the other. Fixed amounts should thereby be set as standards to guarantee legal certainty. In order to calculate the amount of child maintenance the Dutch government should develop an easy-to-use digital program, and this should be made generally available. When child maintenance can be assessed along formal guidelines and fixed amounts, the assessment may take place by the LBIO in addition to the courts, and it is expected that this will reduce the number of lawsuits. The provision that renders contracts drawn up by a notary public concerning the amount of child support enforceable by law should be executed. In addition, the collection of child maintenance by the LBIO on the basis of a mutual agreement without a writ of execution should be made possible...|$|E
