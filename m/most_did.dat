5|$|Three {{months after}} the conquest of Granada, in 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered all Jews in Spain to be {{expelled}} or converted; this {{marked the beginning of}} intolerant policies. In 1497, Spain's western neighbor Portugal expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations, as arranged by Spain's cardinal Cisneros in exchange for a royal marriage contract. Unlike the Jews, Portuguese Muslims were allowed to relocate overland to Spain, and <b>most</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1809, Martín de Álzaga rallied most peninsular battalions to Plaza de Mayo and {{attempted}} a mutiny against Liniers. A few criollos, such as Mariano Moreno, laid their hopes for independence in this attempt, but <b>most</b> <b>did</b> not. The battalions still faithful to Liniers – the Regiment of Patricians, the other criollo battalions, {{and the remaining}} peninsular ones – conquered the Plaza and ordered the mutinying forces to withdraw. Castelli supported Liniers, accusing Álzaga of independentism. Though Castelli was himself an independentist, and had also sought to remove Liniers, he opposed Álzaga for other reasons: Álzaga was hoping to maintaining the social dominance of the peninsulares over the criollos once the viceroy, who opposed his interests, was deposed. Álzaga was defeated, {{and the power of}} the criollos was increased: Sentenach and Álzaga were banished to Carmen de Patagones and the Spanish militias who attempted the coup were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The British cavalry {{became aware}} of the ponies in 1804, during the Peninsular War, and used them as pack animals during the conflict; <b>most</b> <b>did</b> not return to Ireland. The famine of 1845–1852 furthered their decline, as farmers who {{previously}} utilised them died or emigrated. In addition, Spanish donkeys were brought to the island to replace the ponies, and when peat declined as a fuel source, pack animals were no longer needed. In the 1850s, farms began to be consolidated, and more machinery and large draft horses were employed, further reducing the number of ponies needed. Consequently, the ponies were left to run feral, mostly ignored and sometimes shot at by locals.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, <b>most</b> <b>did,</b> and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{graduated}} from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in 1858 with a bachelor's degree, and studied {{for two years}} at the Western Theological seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary). In 1861, he was appointed professor of mathematics at Western College (now Leander Clark College), a United Brethren-affiliated college in Shueyville, Iowa, and taught there for one year. The United Brethren, a pietist church that arose first among Pennsylvania Germans during the Great Awakening, {{was one of the}} earliest churches in the United States to embrace abolitionism. By Thompson's time, they had also joined the fight for the prohibition of alcohol, though <b>most</b> <b>did</b> so from within the Republican Party and did not join the small single-issue Prohibition Party.|$|E
5|$|Dutch records {{suggest that}} at least 453 civilians died during the battle, either {{as a result of}} Allied bombing on the first day or during the {{subsequent}} fighting. After the battle, the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and <b>most</b> <b>did</b> not return until after the war. The Dutch homes were then systematically looted, with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany. The Germans continued to fight Allied forces on the plains between Arnhem and Nijmegen, and the bridge that the 1st Airborne had fought so hard for was eventually destroyed by the Allies to deny German forces its use. On 7 October, it was bombed and destroyed by Martin B-26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group, USAAF. The buildings of Arnhem were heavily shelled by the Allies {{over the next few months}} and suffered further when the city was eventually liberated in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although <b>most</b> <b>did</b> not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On the inner circle a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all the inner circle trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E

5|$|The sources {{record no}} major Byzantine {{external}} campaigns for 932, as the Empire was preoccupied with two revolts in the Opsician Theme. In 933, Kourkouas renewed the attack against Melitene. Mu'nis al-Muzaffar sent forces {{to assist the}} beleaguered city, but in the resulting skirmishes, the Byzantines prevailed and took many prisoners and the Arab army returned home without relieving the city. In early 934, {{at the head of}} 50,000men, Kourkouas again crossed the frontier and marched toward Melitene. The other Muslim states offered no help, preoccupied as they were with the turmoil following Caliph al-Qahir's deposition. Kourkouas again took Samosata and besieged Melitene. Many of the city's inhabitants had abandoned it at the news of Kourkouas's approach and hunger eventually compelled the rest to surrender on 19 May 934. Wary of the city's previous rebellions, Kourkouas only allowed those inhabitants to remain who were Christians or agreed to convert to Christianity. <b>Most</b> <b>did</b> so, and he ordered the remainder expelled. Melitene was fully incorporated into the empire, and most of its fertile land was transformed into an imperial estate (kouratoreia). This was an unusual move, implemented by Romanos I to prevent the powerful Anatolian landed aristocracy from taking control of the province. It also served to increase direct imperial presence and control on the crucial new borderlands.|$|E
5|$|Officials {{recommended}} the citizens on Smith Island to evacuate {{on the day}} prior to the hurricane making landfall, the only evacuations for the Eastern shore of Maryland. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in Calvert, St. Mary's, and Charles counties, and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in Howard County. Officials recommended residents in flood areas of Baltimore County to evacuate, and some {{in the city of}} Baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding. Evacuation rates were low throughout the Maryland coastline, with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore. The primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane. Between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived, with similar numbers expressing concern about being able {{to return to their homes}} if they evacuated. Of those who left, most went to the house of a friend or family member, with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county. <b>Most</b> <b>did</b> not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall. In most areas, the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast, with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal. The most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees, inadequate signage, flooded roads, or stalled cars. In all, 3,080people evacuated their homes in preparation for Hurricane Isabel. Boats, trucks, and school buses helped more than 1,000people evacuate the Inner Harbor of Baltimore, as well.|$|E
