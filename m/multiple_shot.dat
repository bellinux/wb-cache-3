50|$|Multi-shot {{exposes the}} sensor {{to the image}} in a {{sequence}} of three or more openings of the lens aperture. There are several methods of application of the multi-shot technique. The most common originally was to use a single image sensor with three filters passed {{in front of the}} sensor in sequence to obtain the additive color information. Another <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> method is called Microscanning. This method uses a single sensor chip with a Bayer filter and physically moved the sensor on the focus plane of the lens to construct a higher resolution image than the native resolution of the chip. A third version combined the two methods without a Bayer filter on the chip.|$|E
5000|$|The Lonesome West {{features}} the persistently arguing brothers Coleman and Valene, whose father has just {{died in a}} shotgun 'accident.' Valene is only interested in his religious ornaments, and drinking poteen. Coleman is only interested in eating, and attends funerals to collect free sausage rolls and vol au vents. Valene goes out to help drag the body of Garda Thomas Hanlon (character in [...] "A Skull in Connemara") out of the lake with Father Welsh. Hanlon had just killed himself. Coleman pretends to follow, delaying to tie his shoelace, {{despite the fact that}} he was wearing loafers. While alone in the house, he destroys all of Valene's plastic figurines, by placing them in Valene's new stove.Only Father Welsh, the alcoholic parish priest, attempts to fix their relationship, but his advice mostly goes unheard.It is revealed later in the play that Coleman had shot his father because he insulted his (Coleman's) new haircut. Valene agreed to provide a false alibi for Coleman, stating that their father's death was accidental. In exchange, he demanded Coleman's share of the inheritance money. Neither of the brothers show any grief or remorse at their father's death. The two brothers fight over everything and anything. Valene attacks Coleman over eating his crisps, and they fight over whose turn it is to read the magazine, and who left the top off Valene's pen. Father Welsh, depressed because of the hatred between the brothers, and with a low self-esteem, writes a letter begging the brothers to get along, asserting that he will stake his soul on it. Father Welsh then proceeds to drown himself in the lake. This act is significant, as there has already been a lengthy discussion about suicide in the play. The characters believe that damnation follows suicide for the victims. When Coleman and Valene read his letter, they attempt to reconcile themselves, and a [...] "confessions" [...] scene ensues, in which the brothers take turns to admit the wrongs that they had secretly done to each other in the past, and to forgive each other's [...] "sins." [...] Coleman loses his temper when Valene admits to shoving a pencil down the throat of a Coleman's old girlfriend, causing her to then fall in love with the doctor that removed it. In a fit of rage, Coleman proceeds to smash Valene's new collection of ceramic religious figurines, and destroy his stove with <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> gun blasts. After Coleman calms down, Valene says [...] "Try and top that one for yourself". Coleman does, however, deliver an even more terrible confession. He reveals that he cut the ears of Valene's dog two years previously, presenting the evidence of severed dog's ears in a brown paper bag. With this, Valene flies into a rage, and a major fight scene ensues. It becomes clear that the two brothers can never have a good relationship. They agree that fighting is actually good for them, and that Father Welsh's soul can rot in hell, for all they care. Who even asked him to bet it on them in the first place? ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> noise process and its integral. We analyse these two {{processes}} systematically for their theoretical distributions, {{based on the}} piecewise deterministic Markov process theory developed by Davis [1] and the martingale methodology used by Dassios and Jang [2]. The analytic expressions of the Laplace transforms of these two processes are presented. We also obtain the multivariate probability generating function {{for the number of}} jumps, for which we use a multivariate Cox process. To derive these, we assume that the Cox processes jumps, intensity jumps and primary event jumps are independent of each other. Using the Laplace transform of the integral of <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> noise process, we obtain the tail of multivariate distributions of the first jump times of the Cox processes, i. e. the multivariate survival functions. Their numerical calculations and other relevant joint distributions’ numerical values are also presented. 12 page(s...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is shown}} that {{superimposed}} <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> of linearly polarized 800 -nm, 100 -fs laser pulses at lower fluence than the single-pulse ablation threshold produce periodic nanostructures with almost constant periods of 150 nm and 400 nm on silicon surface immersed in water. The nanostructure formation and its characteristic properties observed are illustrated {{well with the}} excitation of surface plasmon polaritons in the newly created surface layer. Pump and probe measurements of surface reflectivity during the ultrafast interaction demonstrate that <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> of low-fluence fs pulses are crucial to the accumulation of non-thermal bonding structure change and subsequent ablation for the periodic nanostructure formation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Shot peening is {{a complex}} cold working process used to improve the fatigue life of {{metallic}} parts. This investigation {{is devoted to the}} modeling and simulation of the residual stress field resulting from the shot peening process, in which the finite element method was employed using a rate sensitive material. The history of energies during explicit dynamic analysis was discussed and the solution time for explicit analysis was analyzed. For the single shot impact model, the effect of shot velocity, shot size, incident angle was studied. In addition, the effect of repeated impacts on the residual stress within the target plate was studied. Furthermore, the <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> impacts of shot peening process were accomplished and the effect of peening coverage was investigated based on different shot models...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} study of surface laser damage performed on a nonlinear optical crystal, urea L-malic acid, using 7  ns laser pulses at 10  Hz repetition rate from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at wavelengths of 532 and 1064  nm is reported. The single shot and <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> surface laser damage threshold values are determined to be 26. 64 ± 0. 19 and 20. 60 ± 0. 36  GW[*]cm− 2 at 1064  nm and 18. 44 ± 0. 31 and 7. 52 ± 0. 22  GW[*]cm− 2 at 532  nm laser radiation, respectively. The laser damage anisotropy {{is consistent with the}} Vickers mechanical hardness measurement performed along three crystallographic directions.

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{proposed}} {{for reducing the}} artifacts produced in diffusion-weighted imaging. When data are acquired using <b>multiple</b> <b>shot</b> echo planar acquisitions, conventional reconstruction methods produce artifactual images {{as a consequence of}} diffusion weighting and small amounts of bulk motion of the subject. If the amount of motion can be determined, it is possible to correct the data before reconstruction, which removes the artifact. A method for estimating the motion from the acquired data has been developed and evaluated. This method assumes that ghost image effects will be minimized when motion has been correctly compensated. By considering the amount of signal in the background of the image, appropriate corrections to the data can be made, and the accuracy of the motion compensation may be estimated. This technique has been evaluated by computer simulation, and its performance has been demonstrated in a phantom and humans with both two- and four-shot echo planar acquisitions and using both "mosaic" and "interleaved" sampling schemes...|$|E
40|$|Modeling sound {{propagation}} {{is an essential}} tool to assess the risk of air-gun shots on marine mammals. Based on a 2. 5 D finite-difference code a new full waveform modeling approach will be presented, which determines both SELs of single shots and cumulative SELs of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots</b> fired along a seismic line. Point source approximations of air-gun clusters typically deployed by R/V Polarstern in polar regions are used as sound sources. Marine mammals are simulated as static receivers. Applications to deep and shallow water models including constant and depth-dependent sound velocity profiles show dipole-like directivities in case of single shots and tubular cumulative SEL fields beneath the seismic line in case of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots.</b> Compared to a semi-infinite model the incorporation of sea floor reflections enhances the seismically induced noise close to the sea surface. Refraction due to sound velocity gradients and sound channeling in near-surface ducts are evident, but affect only low to moderate levels. Hence, exposure zone radii derived for different critical hearing thresholds are almost independent of the sound velocity structure. With decreasing thresholds radii increase according to a spherical spreading law in case of single shots and according to a cylindrical spreading law in case of <b>multiple</b> <b>shots...</b>|$|R
