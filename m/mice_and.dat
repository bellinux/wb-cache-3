5|$|Black-shouldered kites live almost {{exclusively}} on <b>mice,</b> <b>and</b> have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but <b>mice</b> <b>and</b> other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|E

[URL] The species cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies infliximab, bevacizumab, and an anti-VEGF-B antibody, 2 H 10, {{in humans}} and rodents was determined. METHODS: The binding of infliximab to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat TNF-α, of bevacizumab to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-A, {{and of the}} 2 H 10 antibody to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-B was evaluated by ELISA. The sequence of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat TNF-α and VEGF-A at the binding sites for infliximab and bevacizumab were compared. RESULTS: Infliximab bound to human TNF-α, but no binding to mouse or rat TNF-α was detected between 10 pg/mL and 10 μg/ml. Sequence comparison of the binding site revealed four changes in <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> five in rat TNF-α compared with human. Bevacizumab bound strongly to human VEGF-A, but showed 5 -log weaker binding to both <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-A. There was a single amino acid substitution in <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-A at the bevacizumab binding site. The 2 H 10 antibody displayed a similar binding profile to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-B. CONCLUSIONS: The species cross-reactivity of monoclonal antibodies should be determined prior to their use in preclinical animal models. The 2 H 10 antibody binds to human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat VEGF-B making it suitable for testing in rodent models of human diseas...|$|R

40|$|The {{interactions}} of mammalian sperm with the zona pellucida of eggs, living or fixed with glutaraldehyde. {{have been investigated}} in three rodent species. Qualitative observations of sperm-egg interactions in both homologous and heterologous mixtures of guinea pig, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> hamster gametes revealed that 1) sperm initially attach in a loose reversible manner to homologous eggs and subsequently, stable irreversible binding is observed; 2) <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> hamster sperm attach and bind to both <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> hamster eggs with similar affinities; and 3) guinea pig sperm attach and bind only to homologous eggs, and attachment or binding to heterologous eggs is not ob-served. Quantitative assessment of sperm binding to <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> hamster eggs gave similar results. When the kinetics of <b>mouse,</b> hamster, <b>and</b> guinea pig sperm binding to eggs was measured using a 100 -fold variation in sperm concentrations, <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> hamster sperm showed nonspecific binding, whereas guinea pig sperm did not bind.

40|$|Mammalian carboxylesterase (CES or Ces) genes encode {{enzymes that}} {{participate}} in xenobiotic, drug, and lipid metabolism {{in the body}} and are members of at least five gene families. Tandem duplications have added more genes for some families, particularly for <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat genomes, which has caused confusion in naming rodent Ces genes. This article describes a new nomenclature system for human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat carboxylesterase genes that identifies homolog gene families and allocates a unique name for each gene. The guidelines of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat gene nomenclature committees were followed and "CES" (human) <b>and</b> "Ces" (<b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat) root symbols were used followed by the family number (e. g., human CES 1). Where multiple genes were identified for a family or where a clash occurred with an existing gene name, a letter was added (e. g., human CES 4 A; <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat Ces 1 a) that reflected gene relatedness among rodent species (e. g., <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat Ces 1 a). Pseudogenes were named by adding "P" and a number to the human gene name (e. g., human CES 1 P 1) or by using a new letter followed by ps for <b>mouse</b> <b>and</b> rat Ces pseudogenes (e. g., Ces 2 d-ps). Gene transcript isoforms were named by adding the GenBank accession ID to the gene symbol (e. g., human CES 1 _AB 119995 or mouse Ces 1 e_BC 019208). This nomenclature improves our understanding of human, <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> rat CES/Ces gene families and facilitates research into the structure, function, and evolution of these gene families. It also serves as a model for naming CES genes from other mammalian species. Full Tex...|$|R

These devices present two HID endpoints to the system and use a microcontroller to perform bidirectional data translation between the two standards.|$|E

Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, <b>mice,</b> <b>and</b> bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field.
