5|$|In {{developing}} the opera, Bryars and Morrison decided {{to flesh out}} some of the roles, including Ox, Ygène and Aunt Hermance. They also added a second pair of lovers. At one point, the composer considered giving the title role to American rock-singer Tom Waits, who had recorded one of the versions of Bryars's Jesus' Blood Never Failed <b>Me</b> <b>Yet.</b> Bryars was looking for a means of making Ox sound distinct {{from the rest of the}} cast but in the end decided to make it a tenor role. The opera was dedicated to Bryars's mother.|$|E
25|$|Eno {{started the}} Obscure Records label in Britain in 1975 to release works by lesser-known composers. The {{first group of}} three {{releases}} included his own composition, Discreet Music, and the now-famous The Sinking of the Titanic (1969) and Jesus' Blood Never Failed <b>Me</b> <b>Yet</b> (1971) by Gavin Bryars. The second side of Discreet Music consisted of several versions of Pachelbel's Canon, the composition which Eno had previously chosen to precede Roxy Music's appearances on stage, to which various algorithmic transformations have been applied, rendering it almost unrecognisable. Side one consisted of a tape loop system for generating music from relatively sparse input. These tapes had previously been used as backgrounds {{in some of his}} collaborations with Fripp, most notably on Evening Star. Only ten albums were released on Obscure, including works by John Adams, Michael Nyman, and John Cage. At this time Eno was also affiliating with artists in the Fluxus movement.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1847 Josephine visited her brother in County Laois, Ireland. It was {{at the height of}} the Great Famine and the first time she had come into contact with {{widespread}} suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that [...] "As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around <b>me,</b> <b>yet</b> it printed itself upon my brain and memory." ...|$|E

500|$|After Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude, Lethem {{decided that}} [...] "t {{was time to}} leave Brooklyn in a {{literary}} sense anyway... I really needed to defy all that stuff about place and memory." [...] In 2007, he returned as a novelist to California, where some of his earlier fiction had been set, with You Don't Love <b>Me</b> <b>Yet,</b> a novel about an upstart rock band. The novel revolves around a woman in the band, Lucinda, who answers phones for her friend's complaint line and uses some of a caller's words as lyrics. [...] According to Lethem, the book was inspired by the years he spent as the lead singer in an upstart California band in the late 1980s and early 1990s, during what he called [...] "the unformed posturing phase of life". [...] The novel received mixed reviews.|$|E
500|$|... "Harry Patch (In Memory Of)" [...] has no {{standard}} rock instrumentation, {{and instead}} comprises Yorke's vocals and an orchestral string arrangement composed by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood. Strings introduce the song {{with a series}} of repeated arpeggiated notes, which continue as Yorke's singing begins. There is a bridge described as a [...] "grim, delicately furious peak" [...] halfway through the song. Pitchfork writer Mark Richardson compared the track to Gavin Bryars' 1971 composition Jesus' Blood Never Failed <b>Me</b> <b>Yet</b> and Samuel Barber's 1936 Adagio for Strings. Critics from Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, and The Daily Telegraph drew comparisons to Greenwood's score to the film There Will Be Blood; however, Jim Fusilli of The Wall Street Journal believed that the two works [...] " [...] no resemblance". Andrea Rice of American Songwriter wrote that the song's style was far removed from [...] "anything emblematic of Radiohead".|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{temple of}} Aphrodite was so rich that it {{employed}} {{more than a}} thousand hetairas, whom both men and women had given to the goddess. Many people visited the town on account of them, and thus these hetairas contributed to the riches of the town: for the ship captains frivolously spent their money there, hence the saying: 'The voyage to Corinth is not for every man'. (The story goes of a hetaira being reproached by a woman for not loving her job and not touching wool, and answering her: 'However you may behold <b>me,</b> <b>yet</b> in this short time I have already taken down three pieces'.)" ...|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} fight, Henderson stated that [...] "I hit him hard, but I got that last blow in just to {{shut him up}} a little bit." [...] After UFC {{president}} Dana White said Henderson had made the comment in jest, Henderson clarified by stating, [...] "When you're {{in the heat of}} the moment, the ref hadn't stopped <b>me</b> <b>yet,</b> who knows what's going to happen, if he's going to recover. I really only hit him twice, once on my feet, once on the ground. I didn't keep going. I didn't go after him after the ref tried to stop me, it was nothing like that. It was a reaction of mine to keep going until I was stopped—and you know, it did feel good though." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} capture, Oswald {{encountered}} reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, [...] "I didn't shoot anybody" [...] and, [...] "They've taken me in {{because of the}} fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" [...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?" [...] and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, [...] "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to <b>me</b> <b>yet.</b> The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." [...] As he was led from the room the question was called out, [...] "What did you do in Russia?" [...] and, [...] "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, [...] "A policeman hit me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Richard Owen {{had been}} the first to respond to the {{complimentary}} copies, courteously claiming that he had long believed that [...] "existing influences" [...] were responsible for the [...] "ordained" [...] birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him, and told Lyell that [...] "Under garb of great civility, he was inclined to be most bitter & sneering against <b>me.</b> <b>Yet</b> I infer from several expressions, that at bottom he goes immense way with us." [...] Owen was furious at being included among those defending immutability of species, and in effect said that the book offered the best explanation [...] "ever published of the manner of formation of species", though he did not agree with it in all respects. He still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialise man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in [...] "Creative Power".|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, Levitt filed a {{petition}} in the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking {{to block the}} seating of new appointee, Senator Hugo Black. [...] Levitt argued that as Black's predecessor on the Court, Justice Willis Van Devanter, had only retired, and not resigned (a new law had permitted retirement), there was no vacancy, and as that the retirement law had increased the emoluments of the office, Black was ineligible under the Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution. [...] In the decision, Ex parte Levitt, the Court found that Levitt's standing, as a citizen {{and member of the}} Supreme Court Bar, was not sufficient to allow him to challenge the seating of Black. [...] When he heard of the decision, Levitt quoted from the Book of Job: [...] "Though He slay <b>me,</b> <b>yet</b> will I trust in Him; but I will maintain my own ways before Him." [...] In 1956, Leavitt wrote to Justice Black that although he opposed the nomination he admired Black and was grateful to Black for his [...] "continuous defense and elucidation of our civil rights." ...|$|E
