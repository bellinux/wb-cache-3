50|$|A large {{proportion}} of viral pathogens that have emerged recently in humans are considered to have originated from various animal species. This is shown by several recent epidemics such as, avian flu, Ebola, <b>monkey</b> <b>pox,</b> and Hanta viruses. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} some diseases can potentially be re-introduced to human populations through animal hosts after they have been eradicated in humans. There is a risk of this phenomenon occurring with morbilliviruses as they can readily cross species barriers. CST can also {{have a significant effect on}} produce industries. Genotype VI-Avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (GVI-PMV1) is a virus that arose through cross-species transmission events from Galliformes (i.e. chicken) to Columbiformes, and has become prevalent in the poultry industry. CST of rabies virus variants between many different species populations is a major wildlife management concern. Introduction of these variants into non-reservoir animals increases the risk of human exposures and threatens current advances toward rabies control.|$|E
40|$|Using newer vaccine {{platforms}} {{which have}} been effective against malaria in rodent models, we tested five immunization regimens against Plasmodium knowlesi in rhesus monkeys. All vaccines included the same four P. knowlesi antigens: the preerythrocytic antigens CSP, SSP 2, and erythrocytic antigens AMA 1, MSP 1. We used four vaccine platforms for prime or boost vaccinations: plasmids (DNA), alphavirus replicons (VRP), attenuated adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad), or attenuated poxvirus (Pox). These four platforms combined to produce five different prime/boost vaccine regimens: Pox alone, VRP/Pox, VRP/Ad, Ad/Pox, and DNA/Pox. Five rhesus monkeys were immunized with each regimen, and five Control monkeys received a mock vaccination. The time to complete vaccinations was 420 days. All monkeys were challenged twice with 100 P. knowlesi sporozoites given IV. The first challenge was given 12 days after the last vaccination, and the monkeys receiving the DNA/ Pox vaccine were the best protected, with 3 / 5 monkeys sterilely protected and 1 / 5 monkeys that self-cured its parasitemia. There was no protection in <b>monkeys</b> that received <b>Pox</b> malaria vaccine alone without previous priming. The second sporozoite challenge was given 4 months after the first. All 4 monkeys that were protected in the first challenge developed malaria in the second challenge. DNA, VRP and Ad 5 vaccines all primed monkeys for strong immune responses after the Po...|$|R
40|$|<b>Monkey</b> <b>pox</b> {{virus was}} {{mechanically}} disrupted by low temperature and high pressure into soluble and insoluble fractions. Soluble fractions elicited virus-neutralizing antibodies (1 : 20 to 1 : 160) in rabbits, whereas the insoluble (in saline) fractions did not (less than 1 : 5). No infectious virus was detected after the disruption procedure. Rhesus monkeys immunized with the soluble fraction elicited virus-neutralizing (1 : 1, 200), complement-fixing (1 : 16), and hemagglutinating-inhibiting (1 : 80 to 1 : 160) antibody titers and were completely protected against <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> virus-induced disease.

40|$|A microelectrophoretic {{technique}} {{was used to}} study the behaviour {{of a number of}} different pox virus preparations from chick embryos. The viruses were suspended in buffered media made molar to sucrose to reduce Brownian movement. The mobility/pH curves obtained were consistent with the view that in allpreparations the virus surface was protein or lipo-protein. Cowpox, vaccinia nd neurovaccinia viruses gave similar esults with an iso-electric point close to 4. The white variant of cowpox virus differed from the parent strain with an iso-electric point at approx. 2. 8. Rabbit pox virus had the lowest iso-electric point at approx. 2 " 3. Variola, alastrim and <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> viruses all had iso-electric points of approx. 3 " 4 but at greater pH than this <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> showed somewhat higher mobility than the other two viruses...|$|E

The CV- 1 line is a useful and sensitive cell culture for measuring concentrations of RPV in blood and tissues of infected rabbits. Viremia was detected between the 2 nd and 4 th days after parenteral infection. By the 6 th and 7 th days, the concentration of RPV in various tissues ranged from 105 - 3 to 108 - 5 TCID 50 /g.

40|$|With commendable due {{diligence}} to the ever-changing field of infectious diseases, Drs. Nelson and Williams (1) have updated {{the first edition}} of their book (2) to reflect new developments such as bioterrorism, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the epidemiology of several other infections such as West Nile virus and <b>monkey</b> <b>pox.</b> Indeed, they have accomplished an almost impossible task: a far-reaching re-view of infectious disease epidemiology including state-of-the-art chapters on methodological issues, pathogenesis, and comprehensive reviews of virtually all known infectious diseases. Overall, the book is an excellent synthesis. Although not a significant drawback, the book suffers a bit from organizational challenges.

40|$|Virus infections pose {{significant}} {{global health}} challenges, especially {{in view of}} the fact that the emergence of resistant viral strains and the adverse side effects associated with prolonged use continue to slow down the application of effective antiviral therapies. This makes imperative the need for the development of safe and potent alternatives to conventional antiviral drugs. In the present scenario, nanoscale materials have emerged as novel antiviral agents for the possibilities offered by their unique chemical and physical properties. Silver nanoparticles have mainly been studied for their antimicrobial potential against bacteria, but have also proven to be active against several types of viruses including human imunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> virus. The use of metal nanoparticles provides an interesting opportunity for novel antiviral therapies. Since metals may attack a broad range of targets in the virus there is a lower possibility to develop resistance as compared to conventional antivirals. The present review focuses on the development of methods for the production of silver nanoparticles and on their use as antiviral therapeutics against pathogenic viruses...|$|E
40|$|More than 200 of the {{documented}} zoonoses {{represent a}} high proportion of the infectious diseases that cause cases of morbidity and mortality and almost 75 % are emerging infections. Immigration and tourism are human activities that are included in the broader field of human migration and travel. Travel plays {{a significant role in the}} emergence and spread of disease. The migration of humans has provided the route of spread for infectious diseases and zoonoses (for example, plague, yellow fever, <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> and severe acute respiratory syndrome). Tourism constitutes a small fraction of overall movements of humans but a point worthy of note is the number of international travellers has increased by more than 1 300 % over the last 50 years. In addition, over 80 million people, mostly from developing countries, are legal or illegal immigrants. The consequences of travel extend beyond the traveller to the population visited and the ecosystem. Tourism and immigration may constitute an interface for mixing different genetic and ecological profiles, as well as cultural and social aspects, which is of particular interest in regard to zoonoses. Primary prevention, epidemiological surveillance and health education in the framework of intersectoral and international collaboration remain the cornerstone for response to and control of zoonoses in the context of tourism and immigration...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{top-down}} bottom-up proteomics {{combined with}} on-line digestion has great potential {{to improve the}} characterization of protein isoforms in biological systems and is amendable to high throughput proteomics experi-ments. Bottom-up proteomics ultimately provides the peptide sequences derived from the tandem MS analyses of peptides after the proteome has been digested. Top-down proteomics conversely entails the MS analyses of intact proteins for more effective characterization of ge-netic variations and/or post-translational modifications. Herein, we describe recent efforts toward efficient inte-gration of bottom-up and top-down LC-MS-based pro-teomics strategies. Since most proteomics separations utilize acidic conditions, we exploited the compatibility of pepsin (where the optimal digestion conditions are at low pH) for integration into bottom-up and top-down pro-teomics work flows. Pressure-enhanced pepsin diges-tions were successfully performed and characterized with several standard proteins in either an off-line mode using a Barocycler or an on-line mode using a modified high pressure LC system {{referred to as a}} fast on-line digestion system (FOLDS). FOLDS was tested using pepsin and a whole microbial proteome, and the results were com-pared against traditional trypsin digestions on the same platform. Additionally, FOLDS was integrated with a Re-Play configuration to demonstrate an ultrarapid inte-grated bottom-up top-down proteomics strategy using a standard mixture of proteins and a <b>monkey</b> <b>pox</b> viru...|$|E
40|$|Viral {{encephalitis}} is {{the inflammation}} of the brain {{as a result of}} viral infection. Viral encephalitis has gained worldwide importance in recent times due to the continued emergence of neurotropic viruses such as West Nile, <b>Monkey</b> <b>pox,</b> Japanese Encephalitis and Chandipura viruses in both the developed and developing countries [1, 2]. The most common viral encephalitis in India is caused by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Rabies virus (RV) and Chandipura virus (CHPV). Unlike global reach of JEV and RV, CHPV encephalitis is endemic to India [3, 4, 5]. Although, CHPV was isolated in 1965 during an outbreak of Dengue and Chikungunya viruses [6, 7], it gained much attention only when it was directly associated with human infections {{for the first time in}} 2003 in Andhra Pradesh [3]. Since then, repeated outbreaks are being reported almost every year with high mortality rate from different parts of central India, the most recent one being in July, 2012. The virus has marked features of high fatality rate, rapid pathogenesis leading to deaths within 48 - 72 hours and characteristic ability to affect only children between the age of 9 months to 15 years [3, 4]. CHPV is an arbovirus belonging to the genus Vesiculovirus and family Rhabdoviridae [6]. It is closely related to Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), the prototype virus of the genus...|$|E
