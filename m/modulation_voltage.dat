5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to record I-V curves in the manner {{described}} above. In constant-spacing scanning tunneling spectroscopy (CS-STS), the tip stops scanning at the desired location to obtain an I-V curve. The tip-sample spacing is adjusted to reach the desired initial current, which may be different from the initial current setpoint, at a specified tip-sample bias. A sample-and-hold amplifier freezes the z piezo feedback signal, which holds the tip-sample spacing constant by preventing the feedback system from changing the bias applied to the z piezo. The tip-sample bias is swept through the specified values, and the tunneling current is recorded. Either numerical differentiation of I(V) or lock-in detection as described above for modulation techniques can be used to find [...] If lock-in detection is used, then an A.C. <b>modulation</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied to the D.C. tip-sample bias during the bias sweep and the A.C. component of the current in-phase with the <b>modulation</b> <b>voltage</b> is recorded.|$|E

Space between first and second pulses was determined by channel 1, between second and third pulses by channel 2, and so forth. The system made 200 samplings per second of 24 pulses. Information was transmitted via high-power frequency modulation. Ground receiving stations translated pulse spacings back into voltages which were applied to a bank of string galvanometers to make an approximately continuous record of each channel on a moving roll of film.

5000|$|By using {{modulation}} techniques, {{a constant}} current topograph and the spatially resolved [...] can be acquired simultaneously. A small, high frequency sinusoidal <b>modulation</b> <b>voltage</b> is superimposed on the D.C. tip-sample bias. The A.C. {{component of the}} tunneling current is recorded using a lock-in amplifier, and the component in-phase with the tip-sample bias modulation gives [...] directly. The amplitude of the modulation Vm {{has to be kept}} smaller than the spacing of the characteristic spectral features. The broadening caused by the modulation amplitude is 2 eVm {{and it has to be}} added to the thermal broadening of 3.2 kBT. In practice, the modulation frequency is chosen slightly higher than the bandwidth of the STM feedback system. This choice prevents the feedback control from compensating for the modulation by changing the tip-sample spacing and minimizes the displacement current 90° out-of-phase with the applied bias modulation. Such effects arise from the capacitance between the tip and the sample, which grows as the modulation frequency increases.|$|E
