That {{the metal}} of the magnet itself might be {{substituted}} for the <b>moving</b> <b>cylinder,</b> disc, or wire, seemed an inevitable consequence, and yet one which would exhibit the effects of magneto-electric induction in a striking form. A cylinder magnet had therefore a little hole made in the centre of each end to receive a drop of mercury, and was then floated pole upwards in the same metal contained in a narrow jar. One wire from the galvanometer dipped into the mercury of the jar, and the other into the drop contained in the hole at the upper extremity of the axis. The magnet was then revolved by a piece of string passed round it, and the galvanometer-needle immediately indicated a powerful current of electricity. On reversing the order of rotation, the electrical current was reversed. The direction of the electricity {{was the same as}} if the copper cylinder (219.) or a copper wire had revolved round the fixed magnet {{in the same direction as}} that which the magnet itself had followed.

The numerical method and its implementation is validated with benchmark test cases of the flow past an isolated cylinder in both the stationary and flexibly mounted configurations. The {{study examines}} a parametric space spanning 6 center-to-center spacing configurations in the range 1. 5 D- 4 D and 13 equispaced reduced velocities in the range 3. 0 - 9. 0. The simulations are performed in two-dimensional space and the Reynolds number is held at 100. The response characteristics of the <b>moving</b> <b>cylinder</b> are classified into regimes based on the shape of the response curve and the variation of the r. m. s. lift coefficient. It is shown that the <b>moving</b> <b>cylinder</b> influences the lift and drag force characteristics on the stationary cylinder and the frequency composition in the wake. A detailed look at the frequencies and the relative strengths of the frequencies indicates a diminishing influence of the <b>moving</b> <b>cylinder</b> on the stationary cylinder, both with increasing separation and smaller amplitudes. By examining the wake patterns and monitoring the frequencies in the wake of each cylinder, the interference level is qualified and explained to be the basis of the different families of response. by Dilip Joy Thekkoodan.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{behaviour}} in shear of a viscoelastic fluid model (Johnson-Segalman fluid plus a Newtonian contribution) which exhibits a constitutive instability {{with respect to}} shear banding. Because there is a range of stress values at which shear bands can coexist, {{it is not clear}} which value of the stress is attained at a given, nominal shear rate, nor whether a selection of some particular value for the stress throughout the unstable range of shear rates exists or not. In this paper, at least for the specific fluid considered, we show that (i) a phase-separated flow actually occurs, and (ii) a selection mechanism for the stress in the shear-banded regime does exist. To obtain these clear-cut results, we used the Couette concentric cylinder geometry, where a ‘seed’ for the phase separation is automatically provided by the curvature: the portion of the material which is near to the inner (<b>moving)</b> <b>cylinder</b> is more strongly sheared than any other portion, and can induce the formation of a high shear rate band. At steady state, the existence of a selection mechanism for the stress implies that the ‘volume fraction’ of the high shear rate phase (not its shear rate) increases by increasing the velocity of the <b>moving</b> <b>cylinder.</b> These and other features of our computed solutions resemble experimental observations.
