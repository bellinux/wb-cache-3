[...] A <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator,</b> driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, valves, guides {{and other parts of}} the running gear.

50|$|Midland Railway {{locomotives}} were {{notorious for}} their short axle-box bearings, which were prone to overheating. This design feature was perpetuated in the LMS 4F. The problem was eventually solved with the fitting of <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{automatic}} lubricator, is {{a device}} fitted to a steam engine to supply lubricating {{oil to the}} cylinders and, sometimes, the bearings and axle box mountings as well. [...] There are various types of automatic lubricator, which include various designs of displacement, hydrostatic and <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Wakefield mechanical-feed {{lubricator}} {{was arranged}} {{on the right-hand}} side running board and was operated through a lever and crank, actuated from the crosshead. <b>Mechanical</b> <b>lubricators</b> had the advantage that the rate of oil-feed was always proportional to the speed of the engine. This type of oil feed was later superseded for the sight-feed lubricator.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Modern {{locomotive}} lubricators. The centre item is a <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator</b> for the cylinders, {{operated by}} the connecting lever seen below it (or by the hand wheel, for priming). The smaller one to the right is a drip-feed lubricator.|$|E
50|$|The Wakefield <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator</b> {{was mounted}} further {{back on the}} 502. These {{locomotives}} were also fitted with Ross pop safety valves as built. The 1913 batch had lever safety valves changed to Ross pop type after first major overhaul after 10 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames and the 6 in diameter trick-ported piston valves, designed for inside admission, were actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Each engine unit {{was equipped with}} an independent Wakefield <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator</b> to supply oil to the valves and pistons.|$|E
50|$|On steam locomotives, access {{would be}} {{impossible}} during running, so in some cases centralised <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators</b> were used. These devices comprised a large oil tank with a multiple-outlet pump which fed the engine's bearings through a pipe system. Lubrication of the engine's internal valves was done by adding oil to the steam supply, using a displacement lubricator.|$|R
50|$|Toy {{steam engines}} will {{commonly}} have fewer features (such as <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators</b> or governors), and operate at lower pressures, while model steam engines will place {{more emphasis on}} similarity to life-sized engines. Manufacturers such as Wilesco sell both simple toy engines for beginners (e.g. the D3) and more intricate model engines that {{are meant to be}} used to drive things like workshops or boats.|$|R
50|$|Other visible {{differences}} are larger <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators</b> and external {{drive from the}} valve spindle, a vacuum ejector exhaust muffler {{just in front of}} the safety valves, pipes conveying exhaust and ejector steam to the ashpan for mixing with the primary air, the secondary air inlets in the firebox sides with spark arresting plates outside them, and the snifting and bypass valves which were removed and blanked off since the modified locomotive drifted in mid-gear with steam supplied from the drifting valve.|$|R
50|$|The Friedmann {{system of}} {{mechanical}} lubricators included the DV & FSA type lubricators. This style of <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator</b> was designed & produced by Alex Friedmann KG of Austria. The DV type were then made under licence {{by in the}} US by the Nathan Manufacturing Co. & the type DV & FSA types in the UK by Davies & Metcalfe Ltd..|$|E
50|$|The Silvertown {{lubricator}} {{was designed}} and developed by the Midland Railway in 1911 and from 1922 was commercially available from Gresham and Craven. This style of <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator</b> {{was used by the}} London, Midland and Scottish Railway and latter by British Rail, {{as well as by the}} various UK private locomotive builders for export overseas. Commonly 2 lubricators were fitted, one for lubricating the cylinders and the second for lubricating the axleboxes.|$|E
50|$|Valve gear {{was of the}} low-maintenance Baker type, with (of course) power reverse. A {{front-end}} throttle was installed, {{with the}} distinctive linkage running along the boiler on the engineer's side. A <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricator,</b> driven from the crosshead on the engineer's side, fed oil to the cylinders, valves, guides {{and other parts of}} the running gear. Many of the locomotives were fitted with a speedometer, which was attached to the engineer’s side frontmost leading axle.|$|E
500|$|The {{fast-moving}} {{and unpredictable}} Bulleid steam reverser {{was replaced with}} a screw-link version, whilst the <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators</b> were moved to the footplates along the boiler sides. [...] Sanding was also added to the leading driving axle, whilst rearward application was incorporated to the middle driving axle. [...] The first 'modified' locomotive {{to be released from}} Eastleigh was 35018 British India Line in 1956. The final example, 35028 Clan Line, was completed in 1960. The success of the modification programme for the Merchant Navy class was also to influence the design of the future modification of 60 'Light Pacifics'.|$|R
5000|$|They had plate frames, steel Belpaire fireboxes {{and were}} superheated, with four safety valves set at [...] Their piston valves were {{actuated}} by Walschaerts valve gear, controlled by steam reversing gear. As delivered, they had 45+1/2 in diameter coupled wheels which were later retyred to 46 in diameter. The two water tanks had a combined capacity of 4600 imp gal. They had a water-filling tube {{hole on the}} front tank only since {{the front and rear}} tanks were connected by leveling pipes in accordance with the usual Garratt practice. The locomotives were delivered with <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators,</b> but these were later removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had valves {{to allow}} the steam supply to either engine unit to be shut off, if necessary. Exhaust steam from the cylinders of each engine unit was led to the smokebox by separate pipes. The ball joints which gave flexibility to the steam and exhaust pipes were located immediately under and concentric with the pivot centres and were served by forced lubrication from Wakefield <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators.</b> Two 8 ft lubricators, one on each engine unit, supplied one feed to each cylinder and each steam chest, two to the ball joints and two to the tail-end extensions of the piston rods. The oil pipes which fed the steam chests and cylinders were fitted with anti-carbonisers. The locomotive was fitted with two Gresham and Craven no. 12 self-acting feedwater injectors and had steam sanding gear, applied {{to the front and}} rear of both engine units.|$|R
50|$|While 1308 is a {{very modern}} locomotive, with roller bearings, <b>mechanical</b> <b>lubricators,</b> stoker, and superheater, {{it was the last}} of a series of 2-6-6-2s that the C&O began in 1911. A very similar design, the USRA 2-6-6-2 was chosen by the United States Railroad Administration as one of its {{standard}} designs thirty years earlier during World War I. The advantage of the design was that it could be used on the relatively light, tightly curved, branch lines in West Virginia and Kentucky coal country, and that's where it worked for its seven year working life, making the two-hour run from Peach Creek, near Logan, West Virginia to the Ohio River at Russell, Kentucky with an occasional trip to Hinton, West Virginia. Its use in heavy mountain railroading is emphasized by its two cross compound air compressors mounted on the smokebox door to supply enough air for frequent heavy braking.|$|R

50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the big end bearings from inside. The end main bearings and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a <b>mechanical</b> automatic <b>lubricator.</b> This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R
