One involved adjustments using a fixed sequence of ascending or descending amounts, the other used a bisection algorithm {{in which the}} changes in amounts varied {{as a function of}} the subjects' choices. Two magnitudes of delayed outcomes were used: $ 1, 000 and $ 10, 000. A within subject design was used to compare indifference curves and discounting measures across the two adjusting procedures.

Tests are available to include multiple siblings, unaffected offspring, and to adjust for environmental covariates. We explore a susceptibility residual <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for covariates. Results Through simulation, we show that environmental adjustments that down-weight persons who are "destined" to be affected decrease the power to detect genetic association. We used the residual adjusted method on the Framingham Heart Study offspring data, provided for Genetic Analysis Workshop 13, and got mixed results. Conclusion When the genetic effect and environmental effects are independent, a susceptibility residual <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> for environmental covariates reduces the power of the association test.
