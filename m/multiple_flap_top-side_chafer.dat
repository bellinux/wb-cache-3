A relaxed static stability is employed {{in conjunction with}} the maneuvering flaps to optimize transonic performance and minimize supersonic trim drag. Control for subaerodynamic flight is obtained by gimballing the nozzles in combination with wing tip jets.

40|$|In {{the current}} work, the {{application}} and advantages of <b>multiple</b> active trailing-edge <b>flaps</b> for helicopter vibration control in forward flight are investigated. Small active flaps {{of this type}} can be actuated using smart materials. A comprehensive aeroelastic analysis is used to model a helicopter with <b>multiple</b> trailing-edge <b>flaps.</b> The objective function containing the hub vibratory loads and flap control effort is minimized by an optimal controller. The control effort is differentially weighted for different flaps, such that all trailing-edge flaps are exploited to their full authority and limited to ± 2 degrees peak deflection. Numerical results are obtained for one, two and three flaps and their optimal locations identified. A reduction of 76 % in the hub vibration level is achieved at an advance ratio (nondimensional forward speed) of 0. 3 using three flaps. For the four-bladed, soft-inplane, hingeless rotor considered in this work, {{it is observed that}} the extent of hub vibration reduction {{is directly related to the}} effect of trailing-edge flap motion on the contribution of the second flapwise bending mode to blade motion. It is also shown that <b>multiple</b> <b>flaps</b> can effectively modify the participation of second flapwise bending mode at a much lower control power than is needed with single and dual <b>flap</b> configurations. Furthermore, <b>multiple</b> <b>flaps</b> are shown to allow redundancy in operation and are considerably more effective than single flaps in low speed transition flight regimes because of their capability in distributing the airloads...|$|R

40|$|Background Free-flap {{surgery and}} skin {{grafting}} {{can be used}} to reconstruct large facial defects that may result after skin cancer removal by Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). However, these two methods may produce low postsurgical patient satisfaction with aesthetics, and free-flap surgery may produce an undue burden for the majority of skin cancer patients, who are of advanced age. Hence, the authors examined outcomes of large facial defect reconstruction using <b>multiple</b> <b>flaps.</b> Methods Among patients undergoing MMS for skin cancer at Pusan National University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2015, we evaluated 7 patients (2 males, 5 females; average age, 73. 14 years) treated for large facial defects from basal cell carcinoma. Based on operative and follow-up records, we investigated the number and type of flaps used, postsurgical complications, and patients’ post-surgical satisfaction. Results Two and 3 types of flaps were used for 5 and 2 patients, respectively. Most frequently used were nasolabial flaps (7 times in 6 patients) and forehead flaps (once in each of 4 patients). The average follow-up period was 14 months, with no complications—including necrosis, hematoma, or wound dehiscence—observed. Post-surgical satisfaction averaged 4. 4 out of a maximum of 5 points. Conclusions Reconstruction using two or more flaps for large facial defects after skin cancer removal using MMS produced satisfactory outcomes while preventing aesthetic problems.

We find that for heavier flags, greater confinement increases {{the size of the}} region of instability. For lighter flags, confinement has little influence. We then compute the stability boundaries analytically for an infinite flag, and find similar results. For the finite flag we also consider the effect of channel walls on the large-amplitude periodic flapping dynamics. We find that <b>multiple</b> <b>flapping</b> states are possible but rare at a given set of parameters, when periodic flapping occurs. As the channel walls approach the flag, its flapping amplitude decreases roughly in proportion to the near-wall distance, for both symmetric and asymmetric channels. Meanwhile, its dominant flapping frequency and mean number of deflection extrema (or "wavenumber") increase in a nearly stepwise fashion. That is, they remain nearly unchanged over a wide range of channel spacing, but when the channel spacing is decreased below a certain value, they undergo sharp increases corresponding to a higher flapping mode.

40|$|In current wing design, <b>multiple</b> <b>flaps</b> are {{incorporated}} into the trailing edge to allow mixing {{of high and low}} pressure sides to reduce flow separation. These flaps reduce the efficiency by adding weight and complexity to the aircraft. A single hinged flap would reduce these inefficiencies but is more susceptible to flow separation. Active flow control is a means by which the fluid flow over a body is deliberately altered and can be altered such that it becomes less likely to separate from the object. By energizing the flow, the degree of separation of the flow can be controlled, and this inherently controls lift. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators are a form of active flow control. These actuators are created by asymmetrically aligning two electrodes and adding a dielectric layer between the electrodes. When the electrodes are electrically connected, ionized air (plasma) travels from the exposed electrode towards the covered electrode.

In addition to traditional manufacturing techniques, MAVs have utilized techniques and machines that have gained significant interest and investment over the past decade, namely in additive manufacturing. This dissertation discusses the techniques used to manufacture and build a 30 gram-force (gf) model which approaches the lower limit allowed by current commercial off-the-shelf items. The vehicle utilizes a novel mechanism that minimizes traditional kinematic issues associated with four bar mechanisms for flapping wing vehicles. A kinematic reasoning for large amplitude flapping is demonstrated namely, by lowering the cycle averaged angular acceleration of the wings. The vehicle is tested for control authority and lift of the mechanism using three servo drives for wing manipulation. The study then discusses the wing design, manufacturing techniques and limitations involved with the wings for a FWMAV. A set of 17 different wings are tested for lift reaching lifts of 38 gf using the aforementioned vehicle design.

Wind tunnel tests were conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) on a NACA 3415 airfoil model with a flap including a trim tab. Measurements were taken for two configurations: a baseline fixed tab case where tab deflection was zero and a tabbed case where <b>multiple</b> <b>flap</b> and tab angle combinations were tested. Hinge moment measurements were taken for both the flap and tab for comparison between the two cases. In addition; lift, drag and moment measurements along with surface pressures were acquired to aid in the analysis of the concept and provide flow diagnostics. The data were compared to computational results which compared well with the exception of flap and tab deflection cases where large regions of unsteady separated flow were present. All data were taken at a Reynolds number of 1. 8 million and Mach number of 0. 18. To analyze the power-savings capability of a tab-assisted flap, several studies were conducted: a generalized tab performance study evaluating hinge moment reduction and a quasidynamic study using the static data to calculate work savings for two simulated flap deflections. The generalized tab performance study revealed large hinge moment reductions for each of the flap deflections when using the tab to actuate the flap. These reductions came at the cost of increased drag, reduced lift and loss of flap effectiveness. The quasi-dynamic study produced significantly large work savings for both simulated flap deflection schedules. Even though this study ignored the effect on lift and drag, as well as the unsteady aerodynamics and control surface inertia, it suggests the large power-savings potential of a tab-assisted flap. A flow visualization analysis was performed to further assess the loss of flap effectiveness observed in the tab performance calculations as well as the non-linear behavior in the lift, drag and hinge moment data.

Thirty-three (73. 3 %) patients were treated more than 6 hours after injury and 6 patients underwent revascularization after 24 hours; all had good collateral circulation without distal pulses or evidence of ischemic neurological deficit. The mean ischemic time in 39 patients who underwent revascularization within 24 hours was 13. 2 hours. Delayed amputation was performed in 5 patients (11. 1 %). Of the 6 patients who underwent delayed revascularization, one patient had early amputation, one -had delayed amputation following infection and <b>multiple</b> <b>flap</b> procedures {{while the rest of the}} patients’ limbs survived.

50|$|Perforator flap {{surgery is}} a {{technique}} used in reconstructive surgery where skin and/or subcutaneous fat are removed from a distant or adjacent {{part of the body}} to reconstruct the excised part. The vessels that supply blood to the flap are isolated perforator(s) derived from a deep vascular system through the underlying muscle or intermuscular septa. Some perforators can have a mixed septal and intramuscular course before reaching the skin. The name of the particular flap is retrieved from its perforator and not from the underlying muscle. If there is a potential to harvest <b>multiple</b> perforator <b>flaps</b> from one vessel, the name of each flap is based on its anatomical region or muscle. For example, a perforator that only traverses through the septum to supply the underlying skin is called a septal perforator. Whereas a flap that is vascularised by a perforator traversing only through muscle to supply the underlying skin is called a muscle perforator. According to the distinct origin of their vascular supply, perforators can be classified into direct and indirect perforators. Direct perforators only pierce the deep fascia, they don't traverse any other structural tissue. Indirect perforators first run through other structures before piercing the deep fascia.|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASEA recurrent malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) of the anterior abdominal wall was excised leaving a large defect. The POSSG was used for reconstruction. A large dual mesh was placed to close the defect in the abdominal wall by suturing it to the remnant rim of abdominal muscles. The omental pedicle was brought through a keyhole in the mesh, spread out over the mesh, sutured and covered by split skin grafts. The final graft take was 90 percent. DISCUSSIONThe POSSG {{can be used to}} reconstruct any size of anterior abdominal wall defects due to the malleable nature of omentum. Its prerequisite however is a dual mesh like PROCEED. The POSSG helps keep the more complex musculofasciocutaneous flaps as lifeboats. It can be used singly where <b>multiple</b> musculofasciocutaneous <b>flaps</b> would otherwise have been required. It can be used in patients with poor prognosis of underlying malignancy.

Ex-perimentally, angioscopy was used to {{study the effects of}} the 5 F "Kensey" catheter in "normal " porcine coro-nary arteries (NPCA) and postmor-tem human coronary arteries (PMHCA). In NPCA, the catheter keeps a coaxial position. Intimal flaps (IFs) were seen in 21 / 23 NPCAs. They occurred with all cam rotation speeds and were usually single and small (less than 25 % of lumen). Perfora-tions in patent arteries were rare (1 / 23). However, when the catheter was forced against the wall by passing through a narrowing of 5 F diameter (made by a band ligature), perfora-tions were more common at higher cam speeds. The epicardium re-mained intact in two thirds of perfo-rations. Angioscopy visualized perforations in only 10 % of cases (1 / 10),the common sign being that of large and <b>multiple</b> intimal <b>flaps,</b> which were often obstructive (5 / 10). In PMHCAs, angioscopy was more sensitive than angiography in detect-ing atheromatous lesions. The au-thors were able to give a better assessment of the effect of dynamic angioplasty on treated lesions, includ-ing the demonstration of intimal flaps that were not visible on angiography. In vivo, they have performed percuta-neous angioscopy before and after dy-namic angioplasty using 8 French Kensey catheters. Angioscopy re-vealed features that were not shown angiographically...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to develop an engineering method for predicting the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of wing-flap configurations with upper surface blown (USB) high lift devices. Potential flow models of the lifting surfaces and the jet wakes are combined to calculate the induced interference of the engine wakes on the wing and flaps. The wing may have an arbitrary planform with camber and twist and <b>multiple</b> trailing edge <b>flaps.</b> The jet wake model has a rectangular cross section over its entire length and it is positioned such that the wake is tangent to the upper surfaces of the wing and flaps. Comparisons of measured and predicted pressure distributions, spanload distributions, and total lift and pitching-moment coefficients on swept and unswept USB configurations are presented {{for a wide range of}} thrust coefficients and flap deflection angles...|$|R
