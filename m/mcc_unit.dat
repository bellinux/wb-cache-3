50|$|With {{the end of}} World War II, {{the program}} ended. The Corps was {{reactivated}} in 1950 {{in response to the}} reestablishment of the draft continuing in parallel with the draft with its end in 1972 in the US. In other countries with mandatory military service or a draft, their similar program still operates. The MCC was officially reactivated in 1950 with an officer's training camp in a former Civilian Conservation Corps camp (now Mountain Park) near Beulah, Colorado. The MCC program took on a different feel during this decade. Uniforms were standardized and all officers were required to train at national camps so that every <b>MCC</b> <b>unit</b> across the nation operated under the same guidelines and instruction. Leadership was centralized under Everett Dick, who as MCC commander held the rank of colonel and beginning in 1954 was also associate secretary of the War Service Commission.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMetamorphic Core Complexes (MCC) {{constitute}} remarkable features within wide rifts. Based on analogue and numerical modelling, MCC {{dynamics and}} structural development are mainly controlled by first geothermal gradient, second the compositional layering, {{and after the}} strain rate and partial melting. In the Late Mesozoic, continental extension occurred in East Asia leading {{to the development of}} MCC, magmatism and extensional sedimentary basins. Based on an integrated study (i. e. structural and finite strain analysis, petrofabrics, Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) and U/Pb on zircon dating), this paper aims at constraining the tectonic evolution and deformation mechanisms in the South Liaodong Peninsula (NE China). The Gudaoling massif is identified as a "migmatitic" MCC developed from Upper Jurassic (ca. 157 - 154 Ma) to Early Cretaceous (ca. 128 - 113 Ma). Intrusion of the Yinmawanshan synkinematic pluton (Early Cretaceous) to the south of the dome marks out the final stages of shearing along the Gudaoling detachment zone and of exhumation of the MCC into the upper crust. The Gudaoling MCC and the Yinmawanshan pluton stay in line with the coeval South Liaodong MCC, to the south, all making a ~ 140 x 30 km wide extensional band formed during a regional E-W to NW-SE crustal stretching. The area shows a bi-phased development with a "slow" and a "fast" stage which correspond to (1) crustal necking and (2) dome amplification/exhumation stages according to published thermo-mechanical modelling results. Finally, the Gudaoling <b>MCC</b> lower <b>unit</b> almost exclusively displays migmatites and anatectic granitoids of Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, respectively. Occurrence of partial melting during earlier stages of extension seems controlling the initiation of MCC (as a soft anomaly within lower crust). In East Asia, a regional-scale thermal event, during Jurassic-Cretaceous times, may have significantly reduced the bulk lithosphere strength and locally induced partial melting, emphasizing pervasive deformations and development of a wide rift system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{outcomes}} of a pilot project, which aimed to build a community across the on-shore / offshore divide amongst Murdoch students. The overall goal was to assist offshore students to develop their critical thinking skills by giving them a space to dialogue with peers. The design {{of the project was}} informed by the work at Harvard's Project Zero on 'Making Thinking Visible'. The construction of the blogs was part of a group assessment for a 4 -point credit bearing unit, TLC 277 From University to Workplace run in a face-to-face mode on the Murdoch campus by Dr Julia Hobson. The off-shore were students enrolled through SMa in a final year <b>unit,</b> <b>MCC</b> 307 Campaign Management run by Senior Lecturer, Kate Fitch and were required to make three comments onto a blog to gain 5 % of their overall grade. The project involved training and support from the Library's Emerging Technologies Specialist, Kathryn Greenhill.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the technical feasibility, economic viability, and potential impacts of installing and operating a wind power station and/or small hydroelectric generation plants on the Makah reservation. The long-term objective is to supply all or a portion of Tribe's electricity from local, renewable energy sources in order to reduce costs, provide local employment, and reduce power outages. An additional objective was for the Tribe to gain an understanding of the requirements, costs, and benefits of developing and operating such plants on the reservation. The Makah Indian Reservation, with a total land area of forty-seven square miles, is located on the northwestern tip of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State. Four major watersheds drain the main Reservation areas and the average rainfall is over one hundred inches per year. The reservation's west side borders the Pacific Ocean, but mostly consists of rugged mountainous terrain between 500 and 1, 900 feet in elevation. Approximately 1, 200 tribal members live on the Reservation and there is an additional non-Indian residential population of about 300. Electric power is provided by the Clallam County PUD. The annual usage on the reservation is approximately 16, 700 mWh. Project Work Wind Energy [...] Two anemometer suites of equipment were installed on the reservation and operated for a more than a year. An off-site reference station was identified and used to project long-term wind resource characteristics at the two stations. Transmission resources were identified and analyzed. A preliminary financial analysis of a hypothetical wind power station was prepared and used to gauge the economic viability of installation of a multi-megawatt wind power station. Small Hydroelectric [...] Two potential sites for micro/small-hydro were identified by analysis of previous water resource studies, topographical maps, and conversations with knowledgeable Makah personnel. Field trips were conducted to collect preliminary site data. A report was prepared by Alaska Power & Telephone (Larry Coupe) including preliminary layouts, capacities, potential environmental issues, and projected costs. Findings and Conclusions Wind Energy The average wind resources measured at both sites were marginal, with annual average wind speeds of 13. 6 - 14. 0 mph at a 65 -meter hub height, and wind shears of 0. 08 - 0. 13. Using GE 1. 5 MW wind turbines with a hub height of 65 meters, yields a net capacity factor of approximately 0. 19. The cost-of-energy for a commercial project is estimated at approximately 9. 6 cents per kWh using current costs for capital and equipment prices. Economic viability for a commercial wind power station would require a subsidy of 40 - 50 % of the project capital cost, loans provided at approximately 2 % rate of interest, or a combination of grants and loans at substantially below market rates. Recommendations: Because the cost-of-energy from wind power is decreasing, and because there may be small pockets of higher winds on the reservation, our recommendation is to: (1) Leave one of the two anemometer towers, preferably the 50 -meter southern <b>unit</b> <b>MCC,</b> in place and continue to collect data from this site. This site would serve as an excellent reference anemometer for the Olympic Peninsula, and, (2) If funds permit, relocate the northern tower (MCB) to a promising small site closer to the transmission line with the hope of finding a more energetic site that is easier to develop. Small Hydroelectric There are a very limited number of sites on the reservation that have potential for economical hydroelectric development, even in conjunction with water supply development. Two sites emerged as the most promising and were evaluated: (1) One utilizing four creeks draining {{the north side of the}} Cape Flattery peninsula (Cape Creeks), and (2) One on the Waatch River to the south of Neah Bay. The Cape Creeks site would be a combination water supply and 512 kW power generation facility and would cost a approximately $ 11, 100, 000. Annual power generation would be approximately 1, 300, 000 kWh and the plant would have a cost-of-energy of approximately 65 cents per kWh, substantially above market rates. The Waatch site would also be a combination water supply and power generation facility. It would have a rated capacity of 935 kW and would cost approximately $ 16, 400, 000. Annual power generation would be approximately 3, 260, 000 kWh and the plant would have a cost-of-energy of approximately 38 cents per kWh, also substantially above market rates. Recommendation: Stand-alone hydroelectric development is not commercially viable. The Tribal Council should not pursue development of hydroelectric facilities on the Makah Reservation unless they are an adjunct to a water supply development, and the water supply systems absorbs almost all the capital cost of the project...|$|R
