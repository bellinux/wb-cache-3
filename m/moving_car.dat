5|$|Gale force {{winds and}} heavy {{rainfall}} {{were reported in}} the lower Florida Keys; Key West reported 6.25inches (160mm) during a 24-hour period, with the maximum reported winds at a land station being 70mph (115km/h) in the Dry Tortugas. Moderate rainfall was reported throughout southern Florida and the eastern Florida Keys, as well, peaking at 16.47inches (418mm) at Tavernier. Alberto spawned three tornadoes and a waterspout in the Florida Keys, one of which at Stock Island which damaged several boats. One of the three tornadoes picked up a <b>moving</b> <b>car</b> and lightly injured the driver. Another knocked down two telephone poles on the Overseas Highway, which resulted in an hour traffic delay. Damage from the tornadoes totaled $275,000 (1982USD, $620,000 2010USD).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the <b>moving</b> <b>car</b> of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a woman on a nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E

5|$|Paul, {{a member}} of his old unit, {{contacts}} him and reveals he is suffering similar terrifying experiences but is immediately killed when his car explodes. Jacob is dragged away from the wreckage by a bespectacled man. Commiserating after the funeral, the members of Jacob's old platoon confess that they have all been experiencing similarly horrifying hallucinations. Believing that they are suffering the effects of a military experiment performed on them without their knowledge or consent, the men hire a lawyer to investigate but he backs out of the case after reading military files documenting that the soldiers were never in combat and were discharged for psychological reasons. Jacob’s comrades soon apprehensively back down – Jacob angrily suspects they have been threatened into doing so. Jacob himself is later thrown into a car with intimidating men in suits who warn him against further investigation. He jumps from the <b>moving</b> <b>car</b> and is injured. He is taken to a hospital where he is restrained on a stretcher and wheeled down corridors full of grotesquely deformed patients before doctors, wielding barbaric metal instruments, inform him he is dead.|$|E

Immediately after take-off the aircraft was suspected to have suffered a major power loss in its right engine and crashed into a field just {{to the south of}} the airport. It slid along the field and through a fence onto Dyce Drive, a main road into the airport, where it hit a <b>moving</b> <b>car</b> and then came to rest. The two crew and driver of the car survived the accident, with only one crewmember sustaining minor injuries.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the jamming transition on short-range correlation functions in the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model of single-lane traffic. At high densities the structure of the time-dependent correlation functions is double peaked. One peak corresponds to <b>moving</b> <b>cars,</b> the other to blocked cars. The emergence of the latter peak as well as the occurrence of short-range anticorrelations behind the propagating peak is related to the jamming transition. At even higher densities the peak corresponding to <b>moving</b> <b>cars</b> disappears which is an indication of a superjamming transition...|$|R
25|$|Since 1962 {{no fewer}} than 121 planes have crashed {{at or near the}} airport, killing a total of 19. Most {{noteworthy}} of these was on September 25, 2004 when a 1985 Stout Bushmaster 2000 (a spinoff of a Ford Tri-Motor) crashed during an airport exhibition. The plane's rudder locked to a left position during the takeoff roll, causing the plane to veer left off the runway. The pilot was able to get the plane airborne before rolling into a crowd of spectators; the plane then narrowly missed the airport's control tower, rolled hard left and crashed onto a busy thoroughfare. In all, four were injured: the 2-person flight crew and two in a <b>moving</b> <b>car.</b> The cause of the accident was due to failure of the flight crew to remove a gust lock—improvised from a nylon cargo strap—from the plane's empennage before flight.|$|E
25|$|The Doppler {{effect is}} used in some types of radar, to measure the {{velocity}} of detected objects. A radar beam is fired at a moving target — e.g. a motor car, as police use radar to detect speeding motorists — as it approaches or recedes from the radar source. Each successive radar wave has to travel farther to reach the car, before being reflected and re-detected near the source. As each wave has to move farther, the gap between each wave increases, increasing the wavelength. In some situations, the radar beam is fired at the <b>moving</b> <b>car</b> as it approaches, in which case each successive wave travels a lesser distance, decreasing the wavelength. In either situation, calculations from the Doppler effect accurately determine the car's velocity. Moreover, the proximity fuze, developed during World War II, relies upon Doppler radar to detonate explosives at the correct time, height, distance, etc.|$|E
