5|$|In 1955, several {{customers}} {{asked if}} Phillips could make demo discs, so {{he bought a}} 1/4inch tape recorder (replaced in 1963 with a Vortexion portable), an MSS (Marguerite Sound Studios - after the owner's wife) disc cutting machine, an amplifier, a 4-track mixer, three microphones (a Reslo, an HMV ribbon <b>microphone,</b> <b>and</b> an AKG), and three pairs of headphones for £400, while {{on a trip to}} London to visit his son Frank, who was there for a sound recording course at EMI Electronics.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a double}} system, that is, {{the sound was}} on a {{different}} piece of film from the picture.... In essence, the sound was captured by a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> translated into light waves via a light valve, a thin ribbon of sensitive metal over a tiny slit. The sound reaching this ribbon would be converted into light by the shivering of the diaphragm, focusing the resulting light waves through the slit, {{where it would be}} photographed {{on the side of the}} film, on a strip about a tenth of an inch wide.|$|E

5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: he tapped a long spring against a contact <b>microphone,</b> <b>and</b> combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E
5|$|The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a {{standard}} match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunners on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a Leap of Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{is home to}} two {{pioneers in}} {{undergraduate}} campus radio broadcasting, WKCR-FM and CTV. WKCR, the student run radio station that broadcasts to the Tri-State area, {{claims to be the}} oldest FM radio station in the world, owing to the university's affiliation with Major Edwin Armstrong. The station went operational on July 18, 1939, from a 400-foot antenna tower in Alpine, New Jersey, broadcasting the very first FM transmission in the world. Initially, WKCR wasn't a radio station, but an organization concerned with the technology of radio communications. As membership grew, however, the nascent club turned its efforts to broadcasting. Armstrong helped the students in their early efforts, donating a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> turntables when they designed their first makeshift studio in a dorm room. The station has its studios {{on the second floor of}} Alfred Lerner Hall on the Morningside campus with its main transmitter tower at 4 Times Square in Midtown Manhattan. Columbia Television (CTV) is the nation's second oldest Student television station and home of CTV News, a weekly live news program produced by undergraduate students.|$|E

5|$|Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) asks Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) to {{accompany}} him to the Six Sigmas Retreat in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, following his Bush administration and CEO debacles. There, Jack meets with the Six Sigmas, six men who each embody a core feature of Six Sigma: teamwork, insight, brutality, male enhancement, hand-shake-fulness and play-hard. They disapprove of Liz's antics during the team building exercises and demand that Jack distance himself from her {{if he wants to}} succeed, which he does. Before his dinner speech, Jack psyches himself up in the men's room, completely forgetting that he is wearing a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> that everyone can hear him. Liz quickly takes the stage to draw attention away from Jack's embarrassment and finally ends up ripping her blouse open and dancing in front of everyone. She succeeds, and is banned from the retreat forever.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB <b>Microphone</b> <b>and</b> the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS (NDS) {{features}} a touch screen and built-in <b>microphone,</b> <b>and</b> supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards. Additionally, the {{revised version of}} the NDS, the Nintendo DSi, features two built in cameras, the ability to download games from the DSi store, and a web browser. The PlayStation Portable (PSP) released later the same year on December 12, 2004, followed a different pattern. It became the first handheld video game console to use an optical disc format, Universal Media Disc (UMD), as its primary storage media. Sony also gave the PSP robust multi-media capability, connectivity with the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2 (only on some games), other PSPs, as well as Internet connectivity. The Nintendo DS likewise had connectivity to the internet through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and Nintendo DS Browser, as well as wireless connectivity to other DS systems and Wii consoles. Despite high sales numbers for both consoles, PlayStation Portable sales have consistently lagged behind those of the Nintendo DS; nevertheless, the PlayStation Portable has {{the distinction of being}} the best-selling non-Nintendo handheld gaming system.|$|E

5|$|Experience during {{operations}} later led to {{the development}} of specialised armoured equipment by Australian industry for use in jungle operations in the South West Pacific Area. A range of modifications were subsequently developed for the Matilda, including the fitting of wire mesh screens or metal tracking over the engine and air louvres to protect it against magnetic mines, an armoured shield on top of the hull to protect the turret ring, a <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> headset attached to the rear to act as a telephone for infantry co-operation, waterproofing equipment for deep wading, a tank dozer, a flamethrowing tank called the Matlida Frog, and one capable of firing a salvo of naval mortar bombs, known as the Matilda Hedgehog. The Frog was capable of projecting a flame , while the Hedgehog was designed to fire multiple projectiles at concrete blockhouses. Used in combat in the final year of the war in support of Australian infantry at Balipapan, the Frog proved a successful adaptation. Trials were also undertaken to fit air conditioning to the Matildas to improve the endurance of crews in tropical conditions. Limited modifications were also undertaken on the M3 Grant medium tanks, including the fitting of a small number of dozer variants and trials to waterproof the vehicles for wading.|$|E

5|$|On June 29, 2007, CMLL's annual Gran Alternativa tournament {{took place}} at Arena Mexico. Guerrero teamed up with Euforia, but the team was {{defeated}} by Místico and his partner La Sombra. After the loss Guerrero publicly asked Dr. Wagner, Jr. to join him for a challenge to Místico and Negro Casas for the CMLL Tag Team Championship. The match was held on July 13, 2007 at Arena Mexico and saw Guerrero and Wagner win the championship. A week later Guerrero and Wagner lost the titles back to Místico and Casas, making the team the shortest reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions ever. The loss caused the two fighting in mutual accusations of betrayal, which in turn led to a feud between the two wrestlers. On July 27, at Arena Mexico, Dr. Wagner, Jr. and Místico held a mano a mano match which was decided by a treacherous intervention by Guerrero, who climbed into the ring, attacked Wagner from behind and caused him to lose the match, then the aftermath, Guerrero ripped off Wagner's mask. On August 3, 2007, Guerrero teamed up with Atlantis and Sangre Azteca against Dr. Wagner Jr., Alex Koslov and Volador Jr. at Arena México after the match Guerrero took the <b>microphone</b> <b>and</b> challenged Wagner for a mask versus mask match but no match ever came of it as Dr. Wagner, Jr. left CMLL shortly after.

5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to go before the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a <b>microphone,</b> <b>and</b> combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E
