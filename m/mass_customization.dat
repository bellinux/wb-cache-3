40|$|AbstractDue to {{the rapid}} change in {{customer}} demands and needs, manufacturers are increasingly shifting from mass productions to <b>mass</b> <b>customizations.</b> Product platform strategy, {{which is one of}} the enablers of <b>mass</b> <b>customizations,</b> has been implemented by many companies in order to offer a wide range of products that belong to a family. Recently, a new platform approach was developed where an optimal platform is formed for a product family and is customized for different variants by adding, removing, and/ or substituting platform components to form product variants as orders are received. In this paper, the effect of product platform design and customers’ demand on the production cost is investigated using Discrete-Event Simulation (FlexSim). The product platform and the product platform scalability concepts are examined and compared. The findings of this research demonstrate that effective platform implementation has a direct effect on the overall production costs as well as improving customer satisfactions by offering the desired level of customized products...|$|R

However, these effects were expected to occur primarily under the combination of high manager support for implementation of career customization and, based on lifespan theory, older workers, since customization fulfills their increased heterogeneous career preferences. A three-wave longitudinal study largely showed support for the study hypotheses; the relation between MCC use and work engagement and subsequent career success was stronger for older workers who received support for MCC, while the relation between MCC use and commitment was negative for older workers who received low support. The study shows the benefits of career customization in organizations by showing the conditions under which these benefits will manifest...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the current}} {{building}} sector slowdown in Italy, timber housing industry market is growing. But its {{growth has been}} limited mainly by {{the high costs of}} ad-hoc full-customized buildings and the lack of customer appreciation for mass-produced buildings. In order to satisfy the current demand for affordable customized housing, building industry should focus on solutions based on the combination of personalized and mass-produced parts. In this way, clients would have the chance to personalize crucial parts, and building industry can limit costs by the mass-production of the others. This combination between <b>mass</b> production and <b>customization</b> involves artefact flexibility and robustness with regard to the designer’s viewpoint. These requirements are set in the conceptual design phase, but in this stage architect’s decision making is not adequately supported. Since Axiomatic Design (AD) is able to support the analysis of designs with respect to the specified requirements, AD is applied to the review of prefabricated housing archetypes and current timber construction systems. This study shows the effectiveness of applying AD to prefabricated building design: crucial design decisions that affect the specified requirements are identified; inputs limiting their fulfilment in the timber building prefabrication are highlighted, and recommendations for developing adequate systems are provided...|$|R
40|$|Software {{product line}} (SPL) {{engineering}} has become common practice for <b>mass</b> production and <b>customization</b> of software. A software product line comprises {{a family of}} software systems which share a managed core set of artifacts. There are also a set of well-defined variabilities between the products of a product line. The main idea in SPL engineering is to enable systematic reuse in different phases of software development to reduce cost and time to release. Model-Based Testing (MBT) is a technique that is widely used for checking the quality of software systems. In MBT, test cases are generated from an abstract model, which captures the desired behavior of the system. Then, the test cases are executed against a real implementation {{of the system and}} the compliance of the implementation to the specification is checked by comparing the observed outputs with the ones prescribed by the model. Software product lines have been applied in many domains in which sys- tems are mission critical and MBT is one of the techniques that is widely used for quality assurance of such systems. As the number of products can be potentially large in an SPL, using conventional approaches for MBT of the products of an SPL individually and as single systems can be very costly and time consuming. Hence, several approaches have been proposed in order to enable systematic reuse in different phases of the MBT process. An efficient modeling technique is the first step towards an efficient MBT technique for SPLs. There have been several formalisms proposed for modeling SPLs. In this thesis, we conduct a study on such modeling techniques, focusing on three fundamental formalisms, namely featured transition systems, modal transition systems, and product line calculus of communicating systems. We compare the expressive power and the succinctness of these formalisms. Furthermore, we investigate adapting existing MBT methods for efficient testing of SPLs. As a part of this line of our research, we adapt the test case generation algorithm of one of the well-known black-box testing approaches, namely, Harmonized State Identification (HSI) method by exploiting the idea of delta-oriented programming. We apply the adapted test case generation algorithm to a case study taken from industry and the results show up to 50  percent reduction of time in test case generation by using the delta-oriented HSI method. In line with our research on investigating existing MBT techniques, we compare the relative efficiency and effectiveness of the test case generation algorithms of the well-known Input-Output Conformance (ioco) testing approach and the complete ioco which is another testing technique used for input output transition systems that guarantees fault coverage. The comparison is done using three case studies taken from the automotive and railway domains. The obtained results show that complete ioco is more efficient in detecting deep faults (i. e., the faults reached through longer traces) in large state spaces while ioco is more efficient in detecting shallow faults (i. e., the faults reached through shorter traces) in small state spaces...|$|R
