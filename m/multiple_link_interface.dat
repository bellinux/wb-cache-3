40|$|This project {{consists}} {{of developing a}} mobile application for my customer Bestcarparks. The mobile application will consist of <b>multiple</b> <b>linked</b> <b>interfaces</b> allowing Bestcarparks customers to book parking on the go from their Apple iPhone smartphones. The application will allow users to securely pay for their booking from their mobile device. The development of this application is very important as the customers of Bestcarparks will {{have the option of}} booking parking on the go while they can see the live spaces available in each car park. The security importance is significantly high in this project as the application will be accepting user sensitive information such as passwords. It is important to make sure the application is secure this is done through user sessions, server side validation and secure user passwords. The database is secured and the password are encrypted using PHP password_default encryption. Real time car parking availability will be displayed to the user to ensure customers are aware of the congestion in a car park and the number of free spaces. Users will have the possibility to edit bookings that have not expired, allowing them to change the date, location and vehicle registration number. Users can add, edit and delete saved vehicles at any time using the app. These details are then grabbed when making a booking and everything is automated to make it quick and easy when making a booking. The application will show users the available parking locations with a summary of prices and a live google map of the location. None of the booking services, user details will not be available until the user logs in or registers an account. Payments shall be virtually processed through the Stripe Payment system...|$|R

40|$|Survivability is an {{important}} design consideration for high-speed backbone networks and gains even more significance {{in the context of}} delay-sensitive applications that require bandwidth guarantees. Spare capacity allocation is a primary component of survivability design.

However, these algorithms do not address the problem of simultaneous <b>multiple</b> <b>link</b> failures in such networks. This paper provides a formal definition for the <b>multiple</b> <b>link</b> failure problem, explores various approaches to handling <b>multiple</b> <b>link</b> failure and presents an algorithm to solve a sub-problem: i. e. to determine which <b>multiple</b> <b>link</b> failures the survivability design needs to handle. 1...|$|R

25|$|In the HD-SDI and dual <b>link</b> <b>interfaces,</b> {{synchronization}} packets {{must occur}} simultaneously {{in both the}} Y and C datastreams. (Some delay between the two cables in a dual <b>link</b> <b>interface</b> is permissible; equipment which supports dual link is expected to buffer the leading link {{in order to allow}} the other link to catch up). In SD-SDI and enhanced definition interfaces, there is only one datastream, and thus only one synchronization packet at a time. Other than the issue of how many packets appear, their format is the same in all versions of the serial-digital interface.|$|R

A device that has <b>multiple</b> LAPB <b>links</b> will implement MLP as an upper-layer management protocol to allocate frames to the links. MLP sees the <b>multiple</b> LAPB <b>links</b> as a pool of links for transmitting information from higher-layer protocols as frames. Higher-level software {{does not need to be}} aware that <b>multiple</b> <b>links</b> exist. The MLP layer handles distributing frames among the links, and thus gives upper layers full access to the links.|$|R

40|$|A SpaceWire network {{comprises}} SpaceWire links, {{nodes and}} routers. The nodes are the functional units that wish {{to use the}} onboard communication services of the SpaceWire network and are fitted {{with one or more}} SpaceWire interfaces. These units are connected together directly using point-to-point SpaceWire links or indirectly via SpaceWire routers. SpaceWire <b>interfaces,</b> <b>links</b> and routers are the three elements of a SpaceWire network. This paper explains the operation of a SpaceWire router and describes the radiation tolerant SpaceWire router ASIC being developed for ESA. A SpaceWire routing switch is able to connect together many nodes, providing a means of routing packets between the nodes connected to it. A SpaceWire routing switch comprises a number of SpaceWire <b>link</b> <b>interfaces</b> and a routing matrix. The routing matrix enables packets arriving at one <b>link</b> <b>interface</b> to be transferred to and sent out of another <b>link</b> <b>interface</b> on the routing switch The radiation tolerant routing switch currently being developed is fully SpaceWire compliant and has the following facilities: � Eight SpaceWire ports. � Two external parallel ports, each comprising an input FIFO and an output FIFO. � A non-blocking crossbar switch connecting any input port to any output port...|$|R

30|$|The first {{option is}} to {{implement}} the tunnels per service class (see Figure 11 a). If a service class is supported by <b>multiple</b> wireless <b>links,</b> the tunnel {{needs to be able}} to transparently span <b>multiple</b> <b>links,</b> which requires a multi-path protocol to simultaneously send data over <b>multiple</b> <b>links,</b> e.g., Multi-Path TCP (MP-TCP) [65] or MMP-SCTP (Mobile Multi-Path Stream Control Transmission Protocol) [66]. This option does not require to implement any scheduling over the different links, as the tunneling protocol takes care of this. However, this also results in some significant drawbacks. Firstly, packets that belong to the same data traffic flow could be spread over <b>multiple</b> <b>links,</b> increasing the incurred jitter for this data traffic flow. Secondly, paths of different tunnels can run over the same link, which leads to contending congestion mechanisms over this link, resulting in a suboptimal usage of the link capacity.|$|R
