40|$|In {{the field}} of modern {{large-scale}} telescope, primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> system technology faces the difficulties of theoretically uniform output force request and bias compensation. Therefore, a novel position control system combining hydraulic system with servo motor system is introduced. The novel system ensures uniform output force on supporting points without complicating the mechanical structure. The structures of both primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> system and novel position system are described. Then, the mathematical model of novel position control system is derived for controller selection. A proportional–derivative controller is adopted for simulations and experiments of step response and triangle path tracking. The results show that proportional–derivative controller guarantees the system with micrometer-level positioning ability. A modified proportional–derivative controller is utilized to promote system behavior with faster response overshoot. The novel position control system is then applied on primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> system. Coupling effect is observed among actuator partitions, and relocation of virtual pivot supporting point is chosen as the decoupling measurement. The position keeping ability of the primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> system is verified by rotating the mirror cell at a considerably high rate. The experiment {{results show that the}} decoupled system performs better with smaller bias and shorter recovery time...|$|R

5000|$|PLate OPtimizer, or PLOP is a CAD program used by amateur {{telescope}} {{makers to}} design primary <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cells for reflecting telescopes. It {{was developed by}} telescope maker David Lewis, first described in 1999, and used to simplify calculations needed {{in the design of}} <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cells. [...] It was based on Toshimi Taki's 1993 program PLATE, with a simplified user interface, thus giving it wide acceptance among makers of large Dobsonian style amateur telescopes, with good support of mirrors as thin as two inches for a diameter of thirty inches.|$|E
50|$|Site {{excavation}} {{began in}} earnest March 8, 2011, and the site had been leveled {{by the end of}} 2011. Also during that time, the design continued to evolve, with significant improvements to the <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> system, stray-light baffles, wind screen, and calibration screen.|$|E
50|$|Some {{designs for}} large telescopes use whippletrees {{to support the}} optical elements. The tree {{provides}} for distributed mechanical support, thereby reduces localised mechanical deflections, which in turn reduces optical distortion. Unlike the applications described above, which are two-dimensional, the whippletrees in telescope <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cells are three-dimensional designs, since the tree has to support multiple points over an area.|$|E
50|$|The NOT was {{the first}} major {{telescope}} facility designed to use active optics to correct the shape of a thin, lightweight primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supported</b> on actuators.

50|$|In astronomy, a <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cell - more {{commonly}} mirror cell - is {{a component of}} a reflecting telescope that supports the mirror in place to hold optical alignment, allow collimation adjustment, and protect it from falling out. The common usage of the word denotes the cell that holds the primary mirror (M1), however technically {{it could also be}} used to denote the support assembly (usually called a spider or strut) for the secondary mirror (M2) or other mirrors.|$|E
50|$|Astronomical {{observatories}} {{require a}} much heavier {{and more complex}} <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cell. One notable example of the structure needed for such telescopes is the dual cell for the M1 mirrors of the 8.4 meter Large Binocular Telescope at Mount Graham International Observatory. This is a multiple beam and truss system which in turn supports a temperature maintenance and air flow system, six position actuators and the 160 pneumatic actuators which work its active optics system. This results in a huge assembly structure weighing about 28 tons without its mirrors. Such a mirror cell requires multiple mathematical steps of finite element analysis of its deformation under static and moving loading.|$|E
50|$|Early designs {{included}} a segmented primary mirror with {{a diameter of}} 42 metres and an area of about 1,300 m2, with a secondary mirror with a diameter of 5.9 m. However, in 2011 a proposal was put forward to reduce its size by 13% to 978 m2, for a 39.3 m diameter primary mirror and a 4.2 m diameter secondary mirror. It reduced projected costs from 1.275 billion to 1.055 billion euros and should allow the telescope to be finished sooner. The smaller secondary is a particularly important change; 4.2 m places it within the capabilities of multiple manufacturers, and the lighter mirror unit avoids the need for high-strength materials in the secondary <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> spider.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{material}} {{has been widely}} applied in space vehicle structures due to its light weight and designed stiffness modulus. Some special mechanical properties that cannot be changed in general metal materials, such as low CTE (coefficient of thermal expansion) and directional material stiffness can be artificially adjusted in composite materials to meet the userâs requirements. Space-qualified Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composite materials are applied In the FORMOSAT- 5 Remote Sensing (RSI) structure because of its light weight and low CTE characteristics. The RSI structural elements include the primary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> plate, secondary <b>mirror</b> <b>supporting</b> ring, and supporting frame. These elements are designed, manufactured, and verified using composite materials to meet specifications. The structure manufacturing process, detailed material properties, and CFRP structural element validation methods are introduced in this paper...|$|R

50|$|A {{segmented}} mirror is {{an array of}} smaller mirrors designed to act as segments of a single large curved mirror. The segments can be either spherical or asymmetric (if {{they are part of}} a larger parabolic reflector). They are used as objectives for large reflecting telescopes. To function, all the mirror segments have to be polished to a precise shape and actively aligned by a computer-controlled active optics system using actuators built into the <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cell. The concept and necessary technologies were initially developed under the leadership of Dr. Jerry Nelson at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and University of California during the 1980s, and have since spread worldwide to the point that essentially all future large optical telescopes plan to use {{segmented mirror}}s.|$|E

50|$|The Hale's 200-inch mirror {{was near}} the {{technological}} limit of a primary mirror made of a single rigid piece of glass. Using a monolithic mirror {{much larger than the}} 5-meter Hale or 6-meter BTA-6 is prohibitively expensive due to the cost of both the mirror, and the massive structure needed to support it. A mirror beyond that size would also sag slightly under its own weight as the telescope is rotated to different positions, changing the precision shape of the surface, which must be accurate to within 2 millionths of an inch (50 nm). Modern telescopes over 9 meters use a different mirror design to solve this problem, with either a single thin flexible mirror or a cluster of smaller segmented mirrors, whose shape is continuously adjusted by a computer-controlled active optics system using actuators built into the <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> cell.|$|E

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{is roughly}} cylindrical in shape, and has four major components. At the fore {{of the spacecraft}} is the <b>Mirror</b> <b>Support</b> Platform, which supports the X-ray telescope assemblies and grating systems, the Optical Monitor, and two star trackers. Surrounding this component is the Service Module, which carries various spacecraft support systems: computer and electric busses, consumables (such as fuel and coolant), solar arrays, the Telescope Sun Shield, and two S-band antennas. Behind these units is the Telescope Tube, a 6.8 m long, hollow carbon fibre structure which provides exact spacing between the mirrors and their detection equipment. This section also hosts outgassing equipment on its exterior, which helps remove any contaminants from {{the interior of the}} satellite. At the aft end of spacecraft is the Focal Plane Assembly, which supports the Focal Plane Platform (carrying the cameras and spectrometers) and the data-handling, power distribution, and radiator assemblies.|$|E
5000|$|The Effelsberg radio {{telescope}} is {{operated by the}} Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, the radio astronomy institute of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It was constructed from 1968 to 1971 and inaugurated on 1 August 1972. A major technical difficulty in building a {{radio telescope}} of 100 m diameter was {{how to deal with}} the deformation of the mirror due to gravity when it is rotated to point in a different direction. The mirror must have a precise parabolic shape to focus the radio waves, but a conventionally-designed dish of this size would [...] "sag" [...] slightly when rotated so the mirror loses its parabolic shape. The Effelsberg telescope uses a novel computer-designed <b>mirror</b> <b>support</b> structure which deforms in such a way that the deformed mirror will always take a parabolic shape. The focus will move during such deformation, and the feed antenna suspended in front of the mirror is moved slightly by the computer control system as the telescope is rotated to keep it at the focus. Tests after completion of the telescope showed that the intended accuracy of the mirror surface of 1 mm had not only been met, but exceeded significantly.|$|E
