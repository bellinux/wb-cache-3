5|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Love's later <b>musical</b> <b>work</b> is more lyrically introspective. Celebrity Skin and America's Sweetheart are lyrically {{centered}} on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. Nobody's Daughter was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, {{with the majority of}} its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.|$|E

40|$|This paper argues {{against the}} {{view in the}} {{ontology}} of <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> that the relation between <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> and performances {{of them is the}} relation between a type and its tokens. I claim that this cannot do justice to the fact that <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> are essentially meaningful, in the sense of essentially being there to be understood. The type-token view risks treating <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> as found objects, and it cannot accommodate the fact that the relation between <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> and performances must be intentional if <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> are essentially meaningful...|$|R
40|$|The ontological {{status of}} <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> is a {{controversial}} topic {{among those in}} the field. This paper aims to argue for a nominalist and non-reductive approach to <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> that differentiates <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> from the sound structures commonly equated with them. The difference between sound structures and <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> is heavily emphasized and I conclude that <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> have emergent attributes sound structures do not. These attributes being creatability, fine individuation, and the inclusion of performance means. After establishing this I begin to build an argument for a nonreductive approach to <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> by rejecting the extreme view held by compositional nihilists. Once I establish that <b>musical</b> <b>works</b> are entities in our ontology I argue against them being abstract. I end by defending the nominalist approach...|$|R

5|$|For most of {{his career}} Harrison was obliged to earn a living by {{conducting}} and other <b>musical</b> <b>work,</b> to the detriment of his composing. In early 1913 he was engaged as a répétiteur at Covent Garden, where he had the opportunity of observing Arthur Nikisch prepare Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} film's release, Prokofiev {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra to create an orchestral suite from his Kijé film music—probably the first instance of a film score being adapted into a significant <b>musical</b> <b>work.</b> The guiding light behind the invitation was Boris Gusman, the {{assistant director of the}} Bolshoi Theatre and a leading film critic. Gusman was a strong supporter of Prokofiev's ambition to rehabilitate himself in the Soviet Union, and had negotiated with the Moscow orchestra for a series of concerts that would showcase the returned composer's talent.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} less {{critique}} of Bray’s <b>musical</b> <b>work,</b> but Victor Fell Yellin tried to recreate what he felt was the score's melodic expressiveness and sonorous grandeur in his 1978 recording of it. In the liner notes, {{he points out that}} the music does not critically compare with the great musical masters of its time, but its success is derived from its charm. While it lacks modulation, it contains well-turned melodic and rhythmic phrases, and syncopations that add to its American style.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of his debut album Brown Sugar (1995), D'Angelo went into a four and a half year absence from the music scene and {{releasing}} solo work. His debut album presented a musical fusion of traditional soul and R influences with hip hop vocal and production elements, serving as fundamental elements for the neo soul sound. With its single-oriented success, Brown Sugar earned considerable sales success and defied the contemporary, producer-driven sound of the time, while earning popularity among mature R audiences and the growing hip hop generation. Prior to its release, neo soul itself was undefined by a major artist or <b>musical</b> <b>work,</b> and was developing during the early 1990s through the work of artists such as Tony! Toni! Toné!, Me'Shell NdegéOcello, and Omar. The album also earned D'Angelo recognition for producing a commercial breakthrough for the genre and giving notice to other neo soul artists, including Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, and Maxwell.|$|E

25|$|Because Sinfonia {{directly}} {{quotes from}} other musical sources {{as far back}} as the late baroque era (Bach) and as recent as a few years before the 1968 premiere of the piece, it is arguable that Sinfonia uses the widest array of techniques ever employed in a single <b>musical</b> <b>work.</b> Even the latest musical technique to evolve by that time, sound mass from the early sixties (originated by such composers as Krzysztof Penderecki and György Ligeti), is used several times throughout the third movement.|$|E
