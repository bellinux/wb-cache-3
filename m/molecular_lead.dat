40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the detailed characterization of multilayer analyzers {{which can be}} effectively applied to their design, optimization and application for absolute x-ray spectrometry. An accurate analytical model has been developed that is based upon a simple modification of the dynamical Darwin-Prins theory to extend its application to finite multilayer systems. Its equivalence to the optical E &M solution of the Fresnel equations at each interface is demonstrated by detailed calculation comparisons for the reflectivity of a multilayer throughout the angular range of incidence of 0 to 90 °. A special spectrograph and experimental method is described for the measurement of the absolute reflectivity characteristics of the multilayer. The experimental measurements at three photon energies in the 100 - 2000 eV region are fit by the analytical modified Darwin-Prins equation (MDP) for I (6), generating a detailed characterization of two "state of the art " multilayers, a sputtered tungsten- carbon of 2 d 70 A and a <b>molecular</b> <b>lead</b> stearate of 2 d. 100 A.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the well mapped molecular orchestration of circadian timekeeping in terrestrial organisms, the mechanisms that direct tidal and lunar rhythms in marine species are entirely unknown. Using a combination of biochemical and molecular approaches we have identified a series of metabolic markers of the tidal clock of the intertidal isopod Eurydice pulchra. Specifically, we show that the overoxidation of peroxiredoxin (PRX), a conserved marker of circadian timekeeping in terrestrial eukaryotes [1], follows a circatidal (approximately 12. 4 hours) pattern in E. pulchra, in register with the tidal pattern of swimming. In parallel, we show that mitochondrially encoded genes are expressed with a circatidal rhythm.

40|$|AbstractPerformance demands {{placed upon}} lead acid {{batteries}} have outgrown the technology's ability to deliver. These demands, typically leading to Negative Active Material (NAM) failure, include: short, high-current surges; prolonged, minimal, overvoltage charging; repeated, Ah deficit charging; and frequent deep discharges. Research shows these failure mechanisms are attenuated by inclusion of carbon allotropes into the NAM. Addition of significant quantities of carbon, however, produces detrimental changes in paste rheology, leading to lowered industrial throughput.
