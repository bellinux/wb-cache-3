There {{is a single}} style and a three lobed stigma or three stigmata more or less {{elongated}} along the style. There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (<b>megagametophyte)</b> varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria). Embryo sacs in which {{three of the four}} megaspores fuse to form a triploid nucleus, are referred to as Fritillaria-type, a characteristic shared by all the core Liliales.|$|E
25|$|Inside the ovary/ovaries are {{one or more}} ovules {{where the}} <b>megagametophyte</b> {{contains}} the egg cell. After double fertilization, these ovules will become seeds. The ovules are fertilized {{in a process that}} starts with pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the <b>megagametophyte.</b> Within the <b>megagametophyte</b> one of the two sperm unites with the egg, forming a zygote, and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the endosperm mother cell, which completes the double fertilization process.

50|$|The female gametophyte, the <b>megagametophyte,</b> that {{participates in}} double {{fertilization}} in angiosperms {{is sometimes called}} the embryo sac.

The <b>megagametophyte,</b> which is usually haploid, originates from the (usually diploid) megaspore mother cell, also called the megasporocyte. The next sequence of events varies, depending on the particular species, but in most species, the following events occur. The megasporocyte undergoes a meiotic cell division, producing four haploid megaspores. Only one of the four resulting megaspores survives. This megaspore undergoes three rounds of mitotic division, resulting in seven cells with eight haploid nuclei (the central cell has two nuclei, called the polar nuclei). The lower end of the embryo sac consists of the haploid egg cell positioned in the middle of two other haploid cells, called synergids. The synergids function in the attraction and guidance of the pollen tube to the <b>megagametophyte</b> through the micropyle. At the upper end of the <b>megagametophyte</b> are three antipodal cells.|$|E

40|$|Stable oil {{bodies were}} {{purified}} from mature lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) pollen. Immunodetection {{revealed that a}} major protein of 18 kDa was exclusively present in pollen oil bodies. Sequence analysis as well as immunological non-cross recognition suggests that this pollen oleosin represents a distinct class in comparison with oleosins found in seed oil bodies and tapetum. Similar to oleosin, a putative caleosin was specifically detected in pollen oil bodies. Sequence alignment of seed and pollen caleosins as well as promoter analysis of rice oleosin and caleosin genes suggested that caleosins in pollen oil bodes represented a distinct class compared with those in seed oil bodies. In pollen cells observed under electron microscopy, oil bodies were presumably surrounded by tubular membrane structures, and encapsulated in the vacuoles after germination. It seems that pollen oil bodies are mobilized via a different route {{in contrast with the}} glyoxysomal mobilization of seed oil bodies after germination. Furthermore, stable oil bodies were isolated from mature cycad (Cycas revoluta) <b>megagametophytes.</b> Immunological cross-recognition revealed that cycad oil bodies contained a major protein of 27 kDa, tentatively identified as caleosin, while oleosin, the well-known structural protein, was apparently absent. Stable artificial oil bodies were successfully constituted with triacylglycerol, phospholipid and the recombinant fusion protein containing the cycad caleosin. Therefore, the results suggested that stable oil bodies in cycad <b>megagametophytes</b> are mainly sheltered by a unique structural protein caleosin.

Immunological cross-recognition revealed that cycad oil bodies contained a major protein of 27 kDa, tentatively identified as caleosin, while oleosin, the well-known structural protein, was apparently absent. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that the putative cycad caleosin possessed a tryptic fragment of 15 residues matching {{to that of a}} theoretical moss caleosin. A complete cDNA fragment encoding this putative caleosin was obtained by PCR cloning using a primer designed according to the tryptic peptide and another one designed according to a highly conservative region among diverse caleosins. The identification of this clone was subsequently confirmed by immunodetection and MALDI-MS analyses of its recombinant fusion protein over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the native form from cycad oil bodies. Stable artificial oil bodies were successfully constituted with triacylglycerol, phospholipid and the recombinant fusion protein containing the cycad caleosin.

40|$|Background: Characterization of the {{expression}} {{and function of}} genes regulating embryo development in conifers is interesting from an evolutionary point of view. However, our knowledge about the regulation of embryo development in conifers is limited. During early embryo development in Pinus species the proembyo goes through a cleavage process, named cleavage polyembryony, giving rise to four embryos. One of these embryos develops to a dominant embryo, which will develop further into a mature, cotyledonary embryo, while the other embryos, the subordinate embryos, are degraded. The main goal of this study has been to identify processes that might be important for regulating the cleavage process and {{for the development of}} a dominant embryo. Results: RNA samples from embryos and <b>megagametophytes</b> at four early developmental stages during seed development in Pinus sylvestris were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. A total of 6. 6 million raw reads was generated, resulting in 121, 938 transcripts, out of which 36. 106 contained ORFs. 18, 638 transcripts were differentially expressed (DETs) in embryos and <b>megagametophytes.</b> GO enrichment analysis of transcripts up-regulated in embryos showed enrichment for different cellular processes, while those up-regulated in <b>megagametophytes</b> were enriched for accumulation of storage material and responses to stress. The highest number of DETs was detected during the initiation of the cleavage process. Transcripts related to embryogenic competence, cell wall modifications, cell division pattern, axis specification and response to hormones and stress were highly abundant and differentially expressed during early embryo development. The abundance of representative DETs was confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses. Conclusion: Based on the processes identified in the GO enrichment analyses and {{the expression}} of the selected transcripts we suggest that (i) processes related to embryogenic competence and cell wall loosening are involved in activating the cleavage process; (ii) apical-basal polarization is strictly regulated in dominant embryos but not in the subordinate embryos; (iii) the transition from the morphogenic phase to the maturation phase is not completed in subordinate embryos. This is the first genome-wide transcript expression profiling of the earliest stages during embryo development in a Pinus species. Our results can serve as a framework for future studies to reveal the functions of identified genes...|$|R
