The {{goal was to}} introgress an allele with a large negative effect on fibre diameter into a Merino flock possessing medium average fibre diameter. The influence of two factors was explored: the strategy used to select animals from the purebred and backcross line for backcrossing purposes {{and the use of}} selection on background markers to accelerate the return to the purebred line's genome. The results were compared to introgression based on EBVs only. Introgression using EBVs only produced almost the same response in the dollar index as marker-based introgression methods. However, this study did not account for some of the costs associated with implementing the programmes, including the costs of phenotyping and genotyping. Given that the cost of measuring fibre diameter is low, it was concluded that introgression on EBVs only would be the preferred method since the marginal profit of <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> would not be large enough to cover the additional cost of genotyping. In <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression,</b> reciprocal crossing of male and female selection candidates from the backcross and the purebred line was the most advantageous strategy from a practical and profit point of view. Selection for background markers was less profitable in this study than recovering the donor genome by selection on phenotype. </p...|$|E

We used a backcross strategy that consisted of selecting two lines, each carrying two of the donor QTL alleles through the backcross (BC) phase. At the fourth BC generation, single-carrier animals were selected for the production of homozygous animal in the intercross phase. The QTL regions (QTLR) were located on chromosomes MMU 1, MMU 5, and MMU 17. Groups of mice with different genotypes and the parental lines were subjected to a challenge with Trypanosoma congolense. The results show that trypanotolerance QTL was successfully moved into the recipient background genotype, yielding a longer survival time. The mean estimated survival time was 57. 9, 49. 5, and 46. 8 days for groups of mice carrying the donor QTL on MMU 1, MMU 5, and MMU 17 on A/J background. The mean estimated survival time was 29. 7 days for the susceptible A/J line and 68. 8 days for the resistant C 57 BL/ 6 line. The estimated QTLR effects are close to 30 % smaller than those in the original mapping population which was likely caused by the difference in the background on which the effects of QTLR are tested.

Although it has been recognized that smallholders could benefit from genetic improvement strategies (breeding programmes), the challenges associated with establishing genetic improvement strategies for smallholder systems are considerable, resulting in limited successes to date. This paper considers the potential role of marker-based selection to genetic improvement strategies for smallholder production systems, taking into account the socio-economic, infrastructural and institutional issues. The paper stresses that no genetic improvement strategy, with or without the use of markers, is likely to succeed unless a systems approach is applied and other system constraints are met. The marker-based selection technologies discussed in this paper include marker- and gene-assisted selection, <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> and genomic selection. The issues addressed include the priorities of marker-based selection against other genetic improvement strategies, the potential benefits of these technologies to smallholder producers, and conditions under which marker-based selection will most likely succeed in smallholder production systems.

Fixed effects of sex, parity and season of birth as well as age as a covariate, were fitted in a linear model to the phenotypic data and subsequently analysed using QTL Express by generating an F-statistic through permutation tests at chromosome-wide significance thresholds over 10, 000 iterations at 1 cM intervals. Highly significant (P< 0. 01) segregating QTL for body measurements were detected on BTA 2 for hip width (1 cM) and chest depth (8 cM) in Sire Family 1 and pin bone width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3. Other significant QTL (P< 0. 05) detected were withers height (3 cM), hip height (4 cM), body length (4 cM), shoulder width (6 cM), lumbar width (3 cM), thurl width (3 cM) and canon circumference (2 cM) in Sire Family 1, shoulder width (16 cM) in Sire Family 3 and thurl width (24 cM), pin bone width (19 cM), heart girth (26 cM) and abdominal width (69 cM) in Sire Family 4.

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of natural textile fibers. Most worldwide and domestic cotton fiber production is based on cultivars of G. hirsutum L., an allotetraploid. Genetic improvement of cotton remains constrained by alarmingly low levels of genetic diversity, inadequate genomic tools for genetic analysis and manipulation, {{and the difficulty of}} effectively harnessing the vastly greater genetic diversity harbored by other Gossypium species. Development of large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for use in intraspecific and interspecific populations will allow for cotton germplasm diversity characterization, high-throughput genotyping, <b>marker-assisted</b> breeding, germplasm <b>introgression</b> of advantageous traits from wild species, and high-density genetic mapping. My research has been focused on utilizing next generation sequencing data for intraspecific and interspecific SNP marker development, validation, and creation of high-throughput genotyping methods to advance cotton research. I used transcriptome sequencing to develop and map the first gene-associated SNPs for five species, G. barbadense (Pima cotton), G. tomentosum, G. mustelinum, G. armourianum, and G. longicalyx. A total of 62, 832 non-redundant SNPs were developed. These can be utilized for interspecific germplasm introgression into cultivated G. hirsutum, as well as for subsequent genetic analysis and manipulation. To create SNP-based resources for integrated physical mapping, I used BAC-end sequences (BESs) and resequecing data for 12 G. hirsutum lines, a Pima line and G. longicalyx to derive 132, 262 intraspecific and 693, 769 interspecific SNPs located in BESs. These SNP data sets were used to help build the first high-throughput genotyping array for cotton, the CottonSNP 63 K, which now provides a standardized platform for global cotton research. I applied the array to two F 2 populations and produced the first two high-density SNP maps for cotton, one intraspecific and one interspecific. By resequencing two interspecific F 1 hypo-aneuploids, I also demonstrated that the chromosome-wide changes in SNP genotypes enable highly effective mass-localization of BACs to individual cotton chromosomes.

40|$|Tsetse-transmitted {{trypanosomosis}} poses severe constraints to livestock {{productivity in}} sub-Saharan Africa, affecting {{large areas of}} the continent that hold the greatest potential for agricultural development. Greater exploitation of the genetic resistance to trypanosomosis (trypananotolerance) that is displayed by some breeds of indigenous West African cattle (e. g. N'Dama) is accepted as an important sustainable component for controlling the disease. It is envisaged that within-breed and crossbreeding genetic improvement of indigenous trypanotolerant breeds would be facilitated by the mapping of the chromosomal regions (quantitative trait loci, QTL) controlling trypanotolerance, followed by <b>marker-assisted</b> selection, or <b>introgression</b> of these regions, using their closely linked genetic markers. However, this prospect has been hampered by the absence of practical reliable markers for resistance due to the scarcity of genetic markers on cattle maps. Following a genome-wide scan in an F 2 cross between trypanotolerant N'Dama from The Gambia and trypanosusceptible Kenya Boran, a QTL controlling parasitaemia was mapped to a 30 cM region on bovine chromosome 7 (Bta 7). As a means of achieving higher marker density in this QTL region, and to facilitate the identification of the candidate genes mediating trypanotolerance, a combination of chromosome-microdissection, comparative, radiation hybrid (RH) and physical mapping techniques, were exploited to isolate and order new markers in the QTL region. A high-resolution 12, 000 rad Bta 7 RH map consisting of 55 markers was constructed in this study. The map includes: 41 coding genes, 29 of which are novel previously unmapped genes; 4 sequence tagged sites (STS) from microdissection; and 10 microsatellites from published linkage maps. This marker density substantially exceeds that on all available published bovine maps for this region and therefore represents a significant contribution to the global bovine genome mapping effort. Additionally, 12 BAC clones representing a defined sequence-ready pool of chromosome-specific DNA resource material were isolated using STS from chromosome microdissection. Comparative mapping analysis confirmed that the cattle Bta 7 QTL is in a region of conserved synteny relative to two human chromosomes (Hsa 19 and Hsa 5) and five mouse chromosomes (Mmu 8, Mmu 9, Mmu 11, Mmu 17 and Mmu 18). The linear order of genes within homology segments is generally conserved (particularly between cattle and humans), with few exceptions where gene order is conserved, but the conserved syntenic segments were inverted in orientation. A previously unknown small region of homology between the Bta 7 trypanotolerance QTL and the murine Tir 1 trypanotolerance QTL region on chromosome 17 (Mmu 17) is also revealed. The size of this region is approximately 342 kb as estimated from the construction of a BAC contig. One of the BAC clones in this region of homology (RP 42 - 102 G 22) defines a novel evolutionary breakpoint of conserved synteny between the bovine and the mouse genomes. At least nine novel candidate genes, the majority of which are implicated in innate immunity, were identified within the 95 % confidence interval of the Bta 7 QTL region. These genes have been implicated in: relaying information about infection to transcription factors which up-regulate the transcription of genes involved in innate immune responses (ECSIT and MAP 2 K 7); regulation of gene expression and RNA processing (ELAVL 1, EIF 3 S 4 and HNRPM 4); B-cell proliferation (particularly memory B-cells) and immunoglobulin secretion (8 D 6 Antigen/LOC 51293); leukocyte migration (SCYA 25); haematopoiesis (HSPC 240); and free radical mediated destruction of phagocytosed parasites (ACP 5). Amongst these genes, HNRPM 4, 8 D 6 Antigen and HSPC 240 are located in the region homology between the trypanotolerance QTL on Bta 7 and the Tir 1 QTL on Mmu 17. In addition, a cluster of cytokine genes, plausibly involved in humoral and acquired immune responses was also mapped to the distal portion of the QTL region.

The model assumes a Poisson distribution for litter size, and is similar to that used in stochastic versions of population dynamics models. Certain biological parameters must be specified as well as parameters {{under the control of the}} breeder. These methods can be utilized in designing an experiment to determine the number of founder animals required, given the number of animals required at the completion of the backcross process and vice versa. Consideration is given to minimizing the total amount of genotyping over the entire experiment, by varying the number of times each backcrossed male is used. In addition, an outline is given for an adaptive design that allows for changes in male usage to be made during the experiment...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation consists of 6 chapters: general introduction; Estimating recombination in an advanced intercross population of mice (paper submitted for publication); A model for population growth of laboratory animals subjected to marker-assisted introgression: how many animals do we need? (published in Heredity (1999) 82, 16 - 24); Strategies to optimize <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> of multiple unlinked QTL (quantitative trait loci) (published in Mammalian Genome (2000) 11, 145 - 150); Trypanotolerance QTL introgression in mice: experimental results; general discussion. It was shown how {{the size of}} a breeding experiment increases with the number and size of the QTL region to introgress. Biological factors to be considered when estimating the required size of an introgression experiment are also highlighted. The experiment in mice showed that QTL introgression is feasible and successful, and that the background genotype is an important factor to be considered when analysing the results of such an experiment. The general discussion focuses on the introgression of trypanotolerance genes in cattle with an emphasis on Sub-Saharan zones in Africa...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> programmes, expressed as genetic lag {{relative to a}} commercial population under continuous selection, was investigated using analytical methods. A genetic model was assumed for which the genetic variance in the introgression population was {{a function of the}} within-breed genetic variance and the initial breed difference. It was found that most of the genetic lag occurs in the latter stages of an introgression programme, when males and females which are heterozygous for the allele to be introgressed are mated to produce homozygous individuals. Reducing genetic lag through selection on genomic proportion by using genetic markers throughout the genome, i. e. by selecting heterozygous individuals which resemble the recipient (commercial) population most, was effective if the initial breed difference was very large (e. g. 20 within-breed phenotypic standard deviations). In that case, selection solely on genetic markers could be practised to speed up genome recovery of the commercial line. If the initial breed difference is small, phenotypic or best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) selection is superior in reducing genetic lag under the assumed genetic model...|$|E
30|$|Rice {{genomics}} has enhanced {{our understanding}} of the genetic control of agronomic traits and provided tools for crop improvement. Most agronomic traits are controlled by multiple genes and show complex, quantitative inheritance. Therefore, efforts have been concentrated on identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with beneficial traits. QTL alleles with economic value have been tagged by DNA markers and introduced into elite cultivars by marker-assisted selection (MAS). The complete sequence of the rice genome (IRGSP 2005) has supported sophisticated procedures to facilitate genetic analysis of traits of interest, and several genes for agronomic traits have been cloned (Yamamoto et al. 2009). These studies have contributed to our understanding both of the genetic control of several important traits and of the molecular mechanisms of trait expression. Additionally, recent advances in genomics technology have enabled large-scale sequencing and genotyping in rice and other organisms. These innovations have opened up possibilities for genomics-assisted breeding, a new paradigm of selection strategy in plant breeding. This paper introduces recent progress in the genetic dissection of complex traits, <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> of agronomic traits, and whole-genome selection strategies that accelerate the genomics-assisted breeding of rice.|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> {{currently}} {{represents the}} most widely spread application of DNA markers {{as an aid to}} selection in plant breeding. New barley germplasm should be supplemented by genes that facilitate growth and development under stressful conditions. The homology search against known genes is a fundamental approach to identify genes among the generated sequences. This procedure can be utilized for SNP search in genes of predicted function of interest and associated gene ontology (GO). Results: Backcross breeding enhanced by marker selection may become a powerful method to transfer one or a few genes controlling a specific trait. In the study, the integrated approach of combining phenotypic selection with marker assisted backcross breeding for introgression of LTP 2 gene, in the background of semi-dwarf spring barley cultivar, was employed. This study discusses the efficiency of molecular marker application in backcrossing targeted on the selected gene. Conclusions: BC 6 lines developed in this study can serve as a unique and adequate plant material to dissect the role of LTP 2 gene. Due to its role in lipid transfer, the LTP 2 may be crucial in lipidome modification in response to abiotic stress...|$|E
40|$|The gene pools for {{breeding}} cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Africa currently contain only {{a fraction}} of the existing genetic variation found in Latin America where the crop originates. Our research aimed to broaden the genetic base in Africa by introducing Latin American (LA) germplasm. The first set of introductions comprised sexual seeds that led to the evaluation of 20, 032 seedlings in Nigeria between 1990 and 1994. A second set comprised in vitro cultures, where the dominant CMD 2 gene for cassava mosaic disease (CMD) resistance was introgressed into LA germplasm through marker-assisted selection (MAS). Through MAS 156 genotypes were preselected for the gene and evaluated in Nigeria between 2004 and 2006. Initial results from the first set of introductions indicated that LA germplasm was highly susceptible to CMD, minimizing its usefulness in African cassava-breeding programs. In the second set of introductions from LA, introgression of the CMD 2 gene resulted in high CMD resistance under African field conditions. Now at advanced stages in the African breeding program, 14 genotypes combining CMD resistance and high yield are being evaluated. <b>Marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> of CMD resistance into LA germplasm has improved the potential value of LA germplasm for Africa and enhanced the prospect of elite LA genotypes being released as improved varieties in Africa.

40|$|To {{optimize}} {{designs to}} implement <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> programs aiming to introgress three unlinked quantitative trait loci (QTL), {{the present paper}} studies different alternatives versus a traditional backcross or intercross phase. Four alternative backcross strategies {{appear to be more}} advantageous by having 50 percent less genotyping load than a traditional backcross strategy tracking all three QTL at a time through a single line. A multiplication phase following the selection of homozygous animals at the three QTL as an intercross alternative allows doubling of the number of homozygous animals in a mouse model compared with the first intercross generation. Within the same model, a second intercross alternative with individuals carrying all three QTL at the first intercross results in a 12 -fold {{increase in the number of}} homozygous, animals obtained in the first intercross generation. The same ranges of decrease are observed in the number of animals to be genotyped and the number of genotypings when targeting a fixed number of homozygous animals. An option with two lines each carrying two QTL through the backcross phase and coupled with the second intercross alternative appears to be the best introgression alternative. This option requires 76 percent fewer genotypings. 68 percent fewer animals to be genotyped and costs 75 percent less than an option in which all three QTL are introgressed through a single line...|$|E
40|$|Rust {{is one of}} the most-damaging {{eucalypt}} {{diseases in}} Brazil and is considered a potential threat to eucalypt plantations worldwide. To determine the mode of inheritance of esistance in the Eucalyptus grandis—Puccinia psidii pathosystem, ten full-sib families, generated from crosses between susceptible and resistant trees, were inoculated with a single-pustule isolate of the pathogen and rust severity was scored. The observed segregation ratios in segregating families suggested major gene control of rust resistance, although clearly incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity and minor genes are also involved in the global rust-resistance response. To identify markers linked to the resistance locus, screening of RAPD polymorphisms was conducted using bulked segregant analysis in a large full-sib family. A linkage group was built around the Ppr 1 gene (P. psidii resistance gene 1) encompassing six RAPD markers, with a genetic window spanning 5 cM with the two mostclosely linked flanking markers. Besides these two flanking markers, RAPD marker AT 9 / 917 co-segregated with Ppr 1 without a single recombinant in 994 meioses. This tightly linked marker should prove useful for <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> and will provide an initial lead for a positional cloning effort of this resistance allele. This is the first report of a disease resistance gene identified in Eucalyptus, {{and one of the few}} examples of the involvement of a major gene in a non-coevolved pathosystem...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Hordeum chilense, {{a native}} South American diploid wild barley, is a {{potential}} source of useful genes for cereal breeding. The use of this wild species to increase genetic variation in cereals will be greatly facilitated by marker-assisted selection. Different economically feasible approaches have been undertaken for this wild species with limited direct agricultural use {{in a search for}} suitable and cost-effective markers. The availability of Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) derived microsatellites or simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, commonly called as EST-SSRs, for barley (Hordeum vulgare) represents a promising source {{to increase the number of}} genetic markers available for the H. chilense genome. Results All of the 82 barley EST-derived SSR primer pairs tested for transferability to H. chilense amplified products of correct size from this species. Of these 82 barley EST-SSRs, 21 (26 %) showed polymorphism among H. chilense lines. Identified polymorphic markers were used to test the transferability and polymorphism in other Poaceae family species with the aim of establishing H. chilense phylogenetic relationships. Triticum aestivum - H. chilense addition lines allowed us to determine the chromosomal localizations of EST-SSR markers and confirm conservation of the linkage group. Conclusion From the present study a set of 21 polymorphic EST-SSR markers have been identified to be useful for diversity analysis of H. chilense, related wild barleys like H. murinum, and for wheat <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> breeding. Across-genera transferability of the barley EST-SSR markers has allowed phylogenetic inference within the Triticeae complex. </p...|$|E
40|$|A <b>marker-assisted</b> <b>introgression</b> (MAI) {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} transfer trypanotolerance quantitative trait loci (QTL) from a donor mouse strain, C 57 BL/ 6, into a recipient mouse strain, A/J. The objective {{was to assess the}} effect of three previously identified chromosomal regions on mouse chromosomes 1 (MMU 1), 5 (MMU 5) and 17 (MMU 17) in different genetic backgrounds on the survival pattern following infection with Trypanosoma congolense. An exploratory data analysis revealed a biphasic pattern of time to death, with highly distinct early and late mortality phases. In this paper, we present survival analysis methods that account for the biphasic mortality pattern and results of reanalyzing the data from the MAI experiment. The analysis with a Weibull mixture model confirmed the biphasic pattern of time to death. Mortality phase, an unobserved variable, appears to be an important factor influencing survival time and is modeled as a binary outcome variable using logistic regression analysis. Accounting for this biphasic pattern in the analysis reveals that a previously observed sex effect on average survival is rather an effect on proportion of mice in the two mortality phases. The C 57 BL/ 6 (donor) QTL alleles on MMU 1 and MMU 17 act dominantly in the late mortality phase while the A/J (recipient) QTL allele on MMU 17 acts dominantly in the early mortality phase. From this study, we found clear evidence for a biphasic survival pattern and provided models for its analysis. These models can also be used when studying defense mechanisms against other pathogens. Finally, these approaches provide further information on the nature of gene action...|$|E
40|$|The mode of gene action {{governing}} {{resistance to}} plume moth (Exelastis atomosa Walsingham 1886) derived from pigeon-pea (Cajanus scarabaeoides (L.)

The progenies of F 2 population and F 3 families derived from an interspecific cross C. cajan (L.) Huth ('ICP- 26 ') x C. scarabaeoides (accession ICPW- 94) revealed monogenic gene action for resistance to plume moth, and the dominant control by single locus or cluster of tightly linked alleles. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) of 116 F 2 progenies by using 143 parental polymorphic RAPD primers could identify a fragment OPA 09 (910) associated with plume moth resistance in coupling phase of linkage. Further single plant analysis of the 116 F 2 mapping population revealed OPA 09 (910) was linked to PPMi locus conferring host resistance to plume moth with recombination fraction (rf) value of 0. 125 (12. 7 cM of Kosambi function). The resistance specific fragment OPA 09 (910) was cloned, sequenced and converted into a sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker, SCOPA 09 (942), which was also closely associated (10. 3 cM) with the locus PPMl with rf value 0. 102. BLAST analysis with pigeon-pea genome sequence also confirmed its occurrence in CcLG 02 (Scafseq. LG_V 5. 0 fa) and contig 01597 (AFSP 01. fsa 1).
