40|$|The {{aim of this}} Research {{to develop}} ball can use with various parts of body, utilize to develop {{multilateral}} motion of student football school in Kepanjen, Malang East Java. As for problemof this research to develop multilateral motion of student football school needed ball can use with various parts of body. Research use research and development method, with subject 40 student football school, 9 up to 12 year [...] Research place in football school of Satria Muda and Pesat Kepanjen. Technique intake of data use skill test and survey use enquette, here in after data processed use Descriptive Statistical Technique. Product Research is ball can use with various parts of body, withthe following specification, a) ball materials is, colagen polypinil (PVC), bladder of butyl, carcas of natural rubber, <b>mixture</b> <b>yarn</b> of carcas of polyester, (b) making of ball, made to use machine (c) ball size measure, radian of ball 65 - 67 cm, weight 200 - 220 gram, air pressure 0. 35 - 0, 40 atm, and (d) ball colour blue, white, and black to combination, logo of Ministry National Youth and Sport Republic of Indonesia, Proteam football company and Gandu Volleyball...|$|E
40|$|People are {{increasingly}} choosing non-standard textile {{products that are}} of different features. Among these, there is a relatively rarely used knits made with dog hair. Accordingly, plain jersey fabric knits made from condensed yarns for the thesis research has been made. Yarns have contained Lithuanian’s most popular German blackface sheep wool and dogs (Yorkshire, Spaniel, Poodle, Shih Tzu) hair. Also, for comparison, knits made with poodle hair and PA multifilament yarns has been produced. The literature review has outlined that typical wowen fabric and knits functional properties such as thermal conductivity, air and water permeability are analyzed quite often. However, aberrant protein fibre knits are designed and analyzed more rarely. For this reason, functional properties research that regards to knits made with dog hair will evaluate the following features- thermal properties, knits fiber compositions, dependencies between knits structual parameters and functional properties. The thesis work has analyzed knits made from different dog breeds hair and different <b>mixture</b> <b>yarns.</b> The experimental results, such as structual indicators, air pearmeability, thermal conductivity indicators and thermal exhange processes were determined and evaluated. Overall, analysis has been made for 19 knits with different percentage compositions. The yarn composition influence was determined on investigated knits characteristics and knits thermal characteristics of the comparative analysis were produced. It was established {{that there is a}} relationship between analyzed knits thickness and air permeability. The thermal conductivity indicators remain stable after increasing dog hair percentage in <b>yarn</b> <b>mixtures.</b> It was also found that knits made with Spaniel dog hair have lower thermal conductivity. Knits made with Yorkshire and Spaniel hair have the best properties of thermal resistance. It was concluded, that knits thermal properties improves after adding 15 – 35 % other kind of protein fibers in to the <b>yarn</b> <b>mixtures...</b>|$|R
40|$|A project {{aimed at}} the 3 D {{simulation}} of textile yarns from technical specifications was begun in 1993 and attracted support from both industry and research councils to enable {{the formation of a}} multi-national team of researchers to come together in the UK. Considerable progress has been made particularly in the simulation of knitting yarn and plain knit fabric. In recent times the team has tackled the problem of simulating <b>mixture</b> coloured <b>yarns</b> sometimes called melange. This has necessitated a more complicated model of yarn structure based on queuing theory which is outlined {{at the end of the}} paper. References are provided for readers who wish to learn more of the various theories and models that have been used throughout the course of this project...|$|R
50|$|To {{showcase}} African {{history and}} culture, Ms. Chamblin created unique crocheted wall hangings, including a rendition of King Tut in a <b>mixture</b> of brown <b>yarns</b> and gold metallic yarn, a door size hanging of Queen Nefertiti's bust, the Egyptian Pyramids at Giza, African adinkra symbols and other African centered items including beaded wooden jewelry and crocheted pendants. These afrocentric creations were {{featured in a}} monthlong exhibit in the main showcase windows at the Wyandanch Public Library, Long Island, New York in 1992. Ms. Chamblin's first published works (swan and robin crocheted wall hangings) appeared in Family Circle Fashions and Crafts magazine in 1986.|$|R
