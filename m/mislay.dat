He instructed Mrs. Petty, however, on no account to destroy or <b>mislay</b> any journal, but to keep them in a pile in his study. This she did, for though her first impulse was to light the kitchen fire with the five of them every morning, deliberate reflection convinced her that twenty journals read at one sitting would produce on him a more soporific effect than if he came down to a mere five.|$|E

I find it at last--the place where is of little consequence; but this trick must be amended.|$|E

The way they talk you'd suppose that a glass had no business on a table. If I broke it, then it was always, 'Clumsy little devil! ought to have his dinner in the nursery.'

6000|$|Elaine Youghal sat {{at lunch}} in the Speise Saal of one of Vienna's costlier hotels. The double-headed eagle, with its [...] "K.u.K." [...] legend, {{everywhere}} met the eye and announced the imperial favour in which the establishment basked. Some several square yards of yellow bunting, charged {{with the image of}} another double-headed eagle, floating from the highest flag-staff above the building, betrayed to the initiated the fact that a Russian Grand Duke was concealed somewhere on the premises. Unannounced by heraldic symbolism but unconcealable by reason of nature's own blazonry, were several citizens and citizenesses of the great republic of the Western world. One or two Cobdenite members of the British Parliament engaged in the useful task of proving that the cost of living in Vienna was on an exorbitant scale, flitted with restrained importance through a land whose fatness they had come to spy out; every fancied over-charge in their bills was welcome as providing another nail in the coffin of their fiscal opponents. It is the glory of democracies that they may be misled but never driven. Here and there, like brave deeds in a dust-patterned world, flashed and glittered the sumptuous uniforms of representatives of the Austrian military caste. Also in evidence, at discreet intervals, were stray units of the Semetic tribe that nineteen centuries of European neglect had been unable to <b>mislay.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is 1814, {{it is the}} 16th of March, Shelley {{has written}} his letter, {{he has been in}} the Boinville paradise a month, his deserted wife is in her husbandless home. Mischief had been wrought. It is the biographer who concedes this. We greatly need some light on Harriet's side of the case now; we need to know how she enjoyed the month, but {{there is no way to}} inform ourselves; there seems to be a strange absence of {{documents}} and letters and diaries on that side. Shelley kept a diary, the approaching Mary Godwin kept a diary, her father kept one, her half-sister by marriage, adoption, and the dispensation of God kept one, and the entire tribe and all its friends wrote and received letters, and the letters were kept and are producible when this biography needs them; but there are only three or four scraps of Harriet's writing, and no diary. Harriet wrote plenty of letters to her husband--nobody knows where they are, I suppose; she wrote plenty of letters to other people--apparently they have disappeared, too. Peacock says she wrote good letters, but apparently interested people had sagacity enough to <b>mislay</b> them in time. After all her industry she went down into her grave and lies silent there--silent, when she has so much need to speak. We can only wonder at this mystery, not account for it.|$|E
60|$|Sebastopol is {{probably}} the worst battered town in Russia or any where else. But {{we ought to be}} pleased with it, nevertheless, for we have been in no country yet where we have been so kindly received, and where we felt that to be Americans was a sufficient visa for our passports. The moment the anchor was down, the Governor of the town immediately dispatched an officer on board to inquire if he could be of any assistance to us, and to invite us to make ourselves at home in Sebastopol! If you know Russia, you know that this was a wild stretch of hospitality. They are usually so suspicious of strangers that they worry them excessively with the delays and aggravations incident to a complicated passport system. Had we come from any other country we could not have had permission to enter Sebastopol and leave again under three days--but as it was, we were at liberty to go and come when and where we pleased. Every body in Constantinople warned us {{to be very careful about}} our passports, see that they were strictly 'en regle', and never to <b>mislay</b> them for a moment: and they told us of numerous instances of Englishmen and others who were delayed days, weeks, and even months, in Sebastopol, on account of trifling informalities in their passports, and for which they were not to blame. I had lost my passport, and was traveling under my room-mate's, who stayed behind in Constantinople to await our return. To read the description of him in that passport and then look at me, any man could see that I was no more like him than I am like Hercules. So I went into the harbor of Sebastopol with fear and trembling--full of a vague, horrible apprehension that I was going to be found out and hanged. But all that time my true passport had been floating gallantly overhead--and behold it was only our flag. They never asked us for any other.|$|E

If she gives him away he is sure to come back, like the clever dog that is sent in a hamper {{to the other end of}} the kingdom, and three days afterwards is found gasping on the doorstep.

60|$|In the tea-room, and {{hovering}} {{round the}} card-tables, were {{a vast number}} of queer old ladies, and decrepit old gentlemen, discussing all the small talk and scandal of the day, with a relish and gusto which sufficiently bespoke the intensity of the pleasure they derived from the occupation. Mingled with these groups, were three or four match-making mammas, appearing to be wholly absorbed by the conversation in which they were taking part, but failing not {{from time to time to}} cast an anxious sidelong glance upon their daughters, who, remembering the maternal injunction to make the best use of their youth, had already commenced incipient flirtations in the <b>mislaying</b> scarves, putting on gloves, setting down cups, and so forth; slight matters apparently, but which may be turned to surprisingly good account by expert practitioners.|$|R

This is the last word of positive science. The dead do not come back. This is incontrovertible. The dead are dead, and that is the end of it, and of them. And yet I have had experiences here--here, in this very room, at this very desk, that--But wait. Let me put it down in black and white, in words simple and unmistakable. Let me ask some questions.

60|$|Had your father, young folks, {{possessed the}} commonest share of prudence, {{not only would}} this chapter of his history never have been written, but you yourselves would never have {{appeared}} in the world to plague him in a hundred ways to shout and laugh in the passages when he wants to be quiet at his books; to wake him when he is dozing after dinner, as a healthy country gentleman should: to <b>mislay</b> his spectacles for him, and steal away his newspaper when he wants to read it; to ruin him with tailors' bills, mantua-makers' bills, tutors' bills, as you all of you do: to break his rest of nights when you have the impudence to fall ill, and when he would sleep undisturbed but that your silly mother will never be quiet for half an hour; and when Joan can't sleep, what use, pray, is there in Darby putting on his nightcap? Every trifling ailment that any one of you has had, has scared her so that I protest I have never been tranquil; and, were I not the most long-suffering creature in the world, would have liked to be rid of the whole pack of you. And now, forsooth, that you have grown out of childhood, long petticoats, chicken-pox, small-pox, whooping-cough, scarlet fever, and the other delectable accidents of puerile life, what must that unconscionable woman propose but to arrange the south rooms as a nursery for possible grandchildren, and set up the Captain with a wife, and make him marry early because we did! He is too fond, she says, of Brookes's and Goosetree's when he is in London. She has the perversity to hint that, though an entree to Carlton House may be very pleasant, 'tis very dangerous for a young gentleman: and she would have Miles live away from temptation, and sow his wild oats, and marry, as we did. Marry! my dear creature, we had no business to marry at all! By the laws of common prudence and duty, I ought to have backed out of my little engagement with Miss Theo (who would have married somebody else), and taken a rich wife. Your Uncle John was a parson and couldn't fight, poor Charley was a boy at school, and your grandfather was too old a man to call me to account with sword and pistol. I repeat there never was a more foolish match in the world than ours, and our relations were perfectly right in being angry with us. What are relations made for, indeed, but to be angry and find fault? When Hester marries, do you mind, Master George, to quarrel with her if she does not take a husband of your selecting. When George has got his living, after being senior wrangler and fellow of his college, Miss Hester, do you toss up your little nose at the young lady he shall fancy. As for you, my little Theo, I can't part with your. You must not quit your old father; for he likes you to play Haydn to him, and peel his walnuts after dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... 8. I dined to-day in the City. This {{morning a}} scoundrel dog, {{one of the}} Queen's music, a German, whom I had never seen, got access {{to me in my}} chamber by Patrick's folly, and gravely desired me to get an {{employment}} in the Customs for a friend of his, who would be very grateful; and likewise to forward a project of his own, for raising ten thousand pounds a year upon operas: I used him civiller than he deserved; but it vexed me to the pluck.(23) He was told I had a mighty interest with Lord Treasurer, and one word of mine, etc. Well; I got home early on purpose to answer MD's letter, N.26; for this goes to-morrow.--Well; I never saw such a letter in all my life; so saucy, so journalish, so sanguine, so pretending, so everything. I satisfied all your fears in my last: all is gone well, as you say; yet you are an impudent slut to be so positive; you will swagger so upon your sagacity that we shall never have done. Pray don't <b>mislay</b> your reply; I would certainly print it, if I had it here: how long is it? I suppose half a sheet: was the answer written in Ireland? Yes, yes, you shall have a letter when you come from Ballygall. I need not tell you again who's out and who's in: we can never get out the Duchess of Somerset.--So, they say Presto writ the Conduct, etc. Do they like it? I don't care whether they do or no; but the resolutions printed t'other day in the Votes are almost quotations from it, and would never have passed if that book had not been written. I will not meddle with the Spectator, let him fair-sex it to the world's end. My disorder is over, but blood was not from the p-les.--Well, Madam Dingley, the frost; why, we had a great frost, but I forget how long ago; it lasted above a week or ten days: I believe about six weeks ago; but it did not break so soon with us, I think, as December 29; yet I think it was about that time, on second thoughts. MD can have no letter from Presto, says you; and yet four days before you own you had my thirty-seventh, unreasonable sluts! The Bishop of Gloucester is not dead,(24) and I am as likely to succeed the Duke of Marlborough as him if he were; there's enough for that now. It is not unlikely that the Duke of Shrewsbury will be your Governor; at least I believe the Duke of Ormond will not return.--Well, Stella again: why, really three editions of the Conduct, etc., is very much for Ireland; it is a sign you have some honest among you. Well; I will do Mr. Manley(25) all the service I can; but he will ruin himself. What business had he to engage at all about the City? Can't he wish his cause well, and be quiet, when he finds that stirring will do it no good, and himself a great deal of hurt? I cannot imagine who should open my letter: it must be done at your side.--If I hear of any thoughts of turning out Mr. Manley, I will endeavour to prevent it. I have already had all the gentlemen of Ireland here upon my back often, for defending him. So now I have answered your saucy letter. My humble service to Goody Stoyte and Catherine; I will come soon for my dinner.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examined}} the role of records management in secondary health care delivery system. The {{purpose of the study}} is to appraise the records and archive management in all the recorded information generated in the state hospitals under the secondary health care delivery system, through the process of creation, preparation, disposal distribution, use, storage, retention and disposition of records, determining the validity of documents and its existence in the hospital. A descriptive survey was adopted with simple percentage analysis. 50 respondents were selected from two state hospitals in Osun State Nigeria. 50 copies of questionnaire was administered and 46 copies of questionnaire were returned with a response rate of 92 %. The findings revealed that lack of uniform retention policy, absence of legal authority on disposal records and document, lack of funds to purchase standard filing shelves and cabinets, and lack of attention by the hospital managements was responsible for misfiling, <b>mislaying,</b> overcrowding and reduced storage space in the state hospitals. It was recommended that legal authority should be instituted nationwide to support records retention and disposal schedules and archive documents for effective and efficient record management in secondary health care delivery system in Nigeria. 1...|$|R
