50|$|<b>Monotonic</b> <b>relationships,</b> {{in which}} more of one {{quantity}} would imply more of another, are found pervasively in economic analysis. Milgrom pioneered {{in the development of}} new mathematical methods for understanding <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> in economics. His work on auctions with Robert Weber introduced the concept of affiliation of random variables, to indicate systems of unknown quantities where learning that any one of them is higher than some given level would cause beliefs about others to be higher. His work with John Roberts and Chris Shannon advanced the use of supermodularity as a property of individuals' preferences that can yield general monotonicity results in economic analysis.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We are {{considering}} classification {{problems in the}} following setting. The input data are examples of classification decisions, and the expected output are classification patterns induced from these examples and presented in terms of logical statements “ if [an object satisfies some conditions on attribute values], then [it belongs or not to a particular class]”, called decision rules. We propose to induce decision rules with a syntax involving dominance relation in the condition part. Such rules are typically used for ordinal classification with <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> between conditions and decision. We {{show that they are}} also useful for non-ordinal classification because they provide comprehensible pros and cons arguments for assignment of objects to classes. Moreover, they permit to avoid discretization of numerical attributes. We apply Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) since it can deal with <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> in data. A computational experiment on benchmark data shows that DRSA is competitive to well-known rule induction and classification algorithms...|$|R
50|$|The Spearman {{correlation}} between two variables {{is equal to}} the Pearson {{correlation between}} the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.|$|R
30|$|There are two {{limitations}} of using this correlation: {{it is neither}} robust nor resistant. It is not robust because it only recognizes the linear {{relationship between the two}} variables and {{may not be able to}} recognize even strong nonlinear relationships. This correlation is not resistant because it can be affected by outliers. Indeed, a single outlier can result in a highly inaccurate summary of data. An alternate to the Pearson linear correlation is Spearman rank correlation. This robust and resistant correlation can be calculated by using ranks of the data. This correlation recognizes the strength of the <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> and is not affected by outliers.|$|R
50|$|Familiarity and {{complexity}} both have interesting effects on musical preferences. As seen in {{other types of}} artistic media, an inverted U relationship is apparent when relating subjective complexity on liking music excerpts. Individuals like complexity to a certain degree, then begin to dislike the music when complexity gets too high. Furthermore, {{there is a clear}} positive <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationship</b> between familiarity and liking of music.|$|E

40|$|A home firm signals {{her private}} cost {{information}} by expanding {{in a foreign}} firm's country. Credible signaling to deter counter-entry may occur through a direct investment (but not through exports), and may even entail entering an unprofitable market. While this produces social benefits, uninformative signaling may be welfare-reducing. Hence, we argue that moderate to high location costs may be socially desirable. We also show {{that there are not}} simple <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> between technology/demand conditions and firms' entry modes. Thus, the signaling interpretation of international expansion makes it possible to explain some controversial empirical findings on a theoretical ground.

40|$|Procedures for {{identifying}} patterns in scatterplots generated in Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses are described and illustrated. These procedures attempt to detect increasingly complex patterns in scatterplots and involve {{the identification of}} (i) linear relationships with correlation coefficients, (ii) <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> with rank correlation coefficients, (iii) trends in central tendency as defined by means, medians and the Kruskal-Wallis statistic, (iv) trends in variability as defined by variances and interquartile ranges, and (v) deviations from randomness {{as defined by the}} chi-square statistic. A sequence of example analyses with a large model for two-phase fluid flow illustrates how the individual procedures can differ in the variables that they identify as having effects on particular model outcomes.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two sources}} of consumer skill acquisition, termed here as learning to consume: learning by consuming and consumer socialization process.

Those metrics will be based on the hypothesis that the greater the gap between Work-As-Imagined and Work-As-Done the lower the safety performance, and they correspond to a set of references from academic literature, challenges in professional practice, depiction of system structure, and consideration of “soft” organizational aspects.

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{models of}} the circumstellar disks of Be stars, and we describe the resulting synthetic H-alpha emission lines and maps of the wavelength-integrated emission flux projected onto the sky. We demonstrate that there are <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> between the emission line equivalent width and {{the ratio of the}} angular half-width at half maximum of the projected disk major axis to the radius of the star. These relationships depend mainly upon the temperatures of the disk and star, the inclination of the disk normal to the line of sight, and the adopted outer boundary for the disk radius. We show that the predicted H-alpha disk radii are consistent with those observed directly through long baseline interferometry of nearby Be stars (especially once allowance is made for disk truncation in binaries and for dilution of the observed H-alpha equivalent width by continuum disk flux in the V-band) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of multicriteria {{decision}} aiding is to {{give the}} decision maker a recommendation concerning a set of objects evaluated from multiple points of view called criteria. Since a rational decision maker acts with respect to his/her value system, in order to recommend the most-preferred decision, one must identify decision maker’s preferences. In this paper, we focus on preference discovery from data concerning some past decisions of the decision maker. We consider the preference model {{in the form of a}} set of “if [...] ., then [...] . ” decision rules discovered from the data by inductive learning. To structure the data prior to induction of rules, we use the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA). DRSA is a methodology for reasoning about data, which handles ordinal evaluations of objects on considered criteria and <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> between these evaluations and the decision.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of dynamic constraints, which allows safe large-signal measurements on arbitrary grids of samples. The method is a generalization of popular sweeps, and alike, {{it is based}} on the <b>monotonic</b> <b>relationships</b> linking some of the input variables with the setup degradation level. However, the knowledge of exact physical mechanisms is not required, which makes dynamic constraints applicable to wide range of experiments. The detailed explanation of the dynamic constraints principles and implementation is provided. Two cases are analyzed depending whether the degradation level is a monotonic function of all the experiment's input variables or only some of them. The method is assessed on 6 × 50 μm GaAs HEMT large-signal measurements with the sparse grid of samples generated with adaptive sampling methods. Thanks to dynamic constraints, none of the samples seriously violated the constraints, even though no a priori knowledge about the device behavior was available. No significant device degradation is observed in the measurements. status: publishe...|$|R
