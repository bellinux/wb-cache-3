40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dissemination}} of the Culture of Safety, a pivotal chain link towards {{the improvement of the}} Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H conditions. The Authors discuss the conditions affecting the work-related accidents and health impairments occurrence, together with the relationship between such criticalities and the dissemination of the Culture of Safety. The Culture of Safety still shows serious shortcomings at all levels, and in particular in situations -typically temporary or <b>mobile</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> and underground activities- characterized by high accident rates all over the world. The Culture of Safety, i. e. "the enduring value and prioritization of worker and public safety by each member of each group and in every level of an organization", gained in the last decades a wide attention in the international literature as a system of organized and systematic knowledge production, i. e. a specific science, for both its importance as a basic asset for prevention, and its typical multidisciplinary characteristics. A challenging and thorough analysis resulted in the proposal of an organic classification of the various aspects of the Culture of Safety into homogeneous sub-categories, precious as a key reading and reference for framing and analyzing in an unbiased approach the OS&H system faults in real cases...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a journal}} article. It was {{published}} in the journal, Safety Science [© Elsevier] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] accidents still occur with distressing frequency, particularly in construction. Industrialized countries have become increasingly aware of this situation and have adopted policies to attempt to deal with this issue. Such policies have {{led to the development of}} new laws and regulations with a view to improving workplace conditions. This paper first analyzes policies regarding accident prevention in the European Union, as initially stipulated in the European Framework Directive 89 / 391 /EEC, and more specifically in Directive 92 / 57 /EEC, on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or <b>mobile</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites,</b> concentrating on prevention through design. Whilst designers previously had some responsibilities for reducing risk under common law provisions in many countries, this directive was the first explicit legislation to enforce particular duties upon them. The adaptation of the provisions in this directive to the national legislation of EU member countries is also studied. The second section of the paper analyzes the incidence rate of workplace accidents in the construction sector in each country from the year when these regulations came into force until the present time. Based on the evolution of these accident rates, the paper postulates the extent to which European policies have contributed to accident prevention in construction. It is now more than a decade since this legislation has been in force which provides a suitable period for a reflective analysis on it is impact...|$|R

The European Directive 92 / 57 /EEC on {{the implementation of}} minimum Safety and Health requirements at temporary or <b>mobile</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> concentrates on the improvement of Risk Assessment and Management {{from the very first}} steps of the design, and introduces coordinators charged of a safe project preparation and of the execution phase supervising. In particular, in the case of highway maintenance yards, the Coordinator for safety and health matters at the project execution stage should manage both routine situations, and situations requiring high expertise and capacity of judgment. In such complex scenarios, Safety inspection activities become a demanding task also in terms of time and resources for both the Company and the National Inspectorate supervisors. The paper discusses an original approach for the optimization of supervision / inspection activities, based on the appropriate use of Fellow Supervisors to support the Coordinator in the routine activities, with the added benefit of an increased presence of "safety people" at the yard. The setup of an appropriate data gathering, recording and mining system, organized in interlinked cards in logical sequence, contributes to the efficiency and thoroughness of the work of the both the Coordinator and the Fellow Supervisors. The results of ex post tests on a real case -input data provided by the Prosecutor Office which proposed the study- can be considered significant...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal Architectural Engineering and Design Management [© Earthscan] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] has been increased efforts in the introduction of Information and Communication technologies (ICT) in construction to support collaboration. However there is still little focus on support for <b>mobile</b> users on <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> It can be argued that it is often on the <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> that ICT tools can offer the greatest benefits as they can enable the timely collection of information and knowledge during the build process. Convergence in networks, the merging of voice, video and data provides increased opportunities for mobile workers, allowing for a greater array of information to be shared to support collaboration on site. This paper looks at convergence, as well as other technologies including mobile computing, speech recognition and the use of multimedia content to support the <b>construction</b> worker on <b>site</b> and ensure a smooth decision making process. The paper describes several construction case studies, including the Heathrow Terminal 5 project, where decision making processes were examined, along with ICT usage. A scenario illustrating the use of advanced ICT on site was developed to gather requirements for a technical solution which could support the decision making process, and ultimately collaboration during construction. Requirements for an ICT support system were defined {{with the use of the}} case studies and scenario analysis, the proposed solution which combines many of the latest advances in ICT in a single system is then presented. It is explained and demonstrated that this could support the decision making process by allowing more information to be accessed and shared from the <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> The use of advanced communication technologies such as convergence and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) can ensure that audio information can be retrieved along with other project data to provide a clearer more fluid decision making process where all relevant project members can easily be up to date with project progress...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{construction}} {{information management}} has greatly benefited from advancesin Information and Communication Technology (ICT) increasing {{the speed of}} information flow, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of information communication, and reducing the cost of information transfer. Current ICT support has been extended to <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> offices. However, <b>construction</b> projects typically {{take place in the}} field where construction personnel have difficulty in gaining access to conventional information systems for their information requirements. The advances in affordable mobile devices, increases in wireless network transfer speeds and enhancements in mobile application performance, give mobile computing a powerful potential to improve on-site construction information management. This research project aims to explore how mobile computing can be implemented to manage information on <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> through the development of a framework. Various research methods and strategies were adopted to achieve the defined aim of this research. These methods include an extensive literature review in both areas of construction information management and mobile computing; case studies that investigate construction information management on construction sites; a web-based survey for the investigation of the existing mechanism for on-site information retrieval and transfer; and a case study of the validation of the framework. Based on the results obtained from the literature review, case studies and the survey,the developed framework identifies the primary factors that influence the implementation of <b>mobile</b> computing in <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> information management, and the inter relationships between those factors. Each of these primary factors is further divided into sub-factors that describe the detailed features of relevant primary factors. In order to explore links between sub-factors, the top-level framework is broken down into different sub-frameworks, each of which presents the specific links between two primary factors. One of the applications for the developed framework is the selection of a mobile computing strategy for managing on-site construction information. The overall selection procedure has three major steps: the definition of on-site information management objectives; the identification of mobile computing strategy; and the selection of appropriate mobile computing technologies. The evaluation and validity of the selection procedure is demonstrated through an illustrative constructions cenario. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
