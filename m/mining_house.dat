An ER24 spokesperson said that miners had reportedly been trapped in 11 mine shafts at a mine in Orkney; however, subsequent inspections revealed that the miners at that location were safe. All 3,300 AngloGold Ashanti miners underground at its Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines near Orkney {{had been brought to}} the surface by 19:30 SAST on 5August, including 34 who had been injured. All 34 miners were treated for minor injuries, including lacerations, contusions and a broken leg, and discharged from hospital on 6August. AngloGold Ashanti management had proceeded with the evacuation after their temporarily interrupted power supply was mostly restored, mine management had contacted the mine crew underground by telephone and mine engineers had ensured that the shaft infrastructure was in working order. AngloGold Ashanti emergency medical staff had treated injured miners, and counsellors had treated some employees for shock. Mining operations at their Great Noligwa and Moab Khotsong mines were subsequently suspended pending safety checks.|$|E

50|$|Langer Heinrich mine in Namibia is Paladin’s {{flagship}} project. Having {{reached its}} initial production of 2.7Mlb U3O8 per annum in 2008, the mine completed its Stage 2 ramp-up to 3.7Mlb per annum in the 2010 financial year. Subsequently, the Company has completed a Stage 3 expansion and began producing at a 5.2Mlb per annum rate. An additional Stage 4 expansion review is currently nearing finalisation {{with the view}} to potentially increasing production up to 10Mlb per annum {{at a later date}} when the economics justify the additional investment required. Substantial technical work has been completed on this project since its discovery in 1973, mainly by Gencor (the original explorer), a large South African <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> that evolved into BHP Billiton. Paladin acquired Langer Heinrich in 2002, and started a BFS in 2004.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{organisational}} strategic drivers of a South African <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> {{with those of}} industries abroad. It furthermore compares the key competencies or capabilities of the <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> {{with those of the}} overseas industries. A Delphi panel participants comprising of nine experts - with a combined experience base of over 130 years - provided the data. The strategic drivers as well as the key competencies of the South African <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> showed marked similarities to industries such as petrochemical, engineering and construction industries abroad. While safety enjoys higher priority in the South African mining environment than in comparable industries abroad, there is room for improvement in the level of prioritisation of projects that takes place within project portfolios. The degree of authorisation given to project teams within the South African <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> to execute the project strategy is lower than that in comparable industries abroad while the level of business focus and business awareness within the South African mining project teams is relatively high. The correlation between strategic drivers and core competencies was weaker than would be expected. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} done over six {{months at the}} {{training}} centre of a large <b>mining</b> <b>house,</b> Gold Fields of South Africa. Four instructors taught English courses to experimental groups using an approach integrating suggestopedic language teaching and thinking skills (called henceforth " the integrated approach"). The same four instructors taught English to control groups using traditional methods. English language skills and thinking skills were measured before and after each course. Qualitative data were gathered from learners, instructors and supervisors. Results clearly showed that black workers with low educational levels can gain an appreciable amount of English in a three-week intensive course. All of the qualitative data {{and one of the}} two qualitative measures support this statement. Further, support was found for greater benefits to the learners of the integrated approach over traditional approaches to language teaching, especially in ability to think and in positive attitudes including self-confidence. The process of the study yielded additional findings and raised further questions of interest to those involved in language teaching and research.

40|$|The authors {{will show}} that using present value ratio {{combined}} with a m 1 n 1 mum hurdle rate for economic decision making can lead to erroneous economic conclusions. Two examples are presented. WHY THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN A recent painful experience between a nameless consultant and an equally nameless <b>mining</b> <b>house</b> prompted this article. The consultant was hired to do an independent evaluation of some multi-million rand investments being considered by the firm. The firm had recently converted from the common tool of net present value (NPV) and discounted cash flow rate of return (DCFROR) to present value ratio (PVR) combined with a minimum hurdle rate that must be satisfied by the project. The fact that such a combination can lead to absolutely erroneous economic conclusions {{is well known in}} the academic literature of economic eval~ation, (see for example [1)). The fact being well known seems, however, to have little relevance to either what is still being taught or what is being done by companies doing economic evaluation.
