40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the influence of multiple (up to 10 times) injection moulding of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) on some properties of the obtained moulded pieces. Design/methodology/approach: The investigated samples were obtained during the industrial injection moulding. There were determined the sample mechanical properties (by a tensile test), <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> temperatures of phase transitions (by differential scanning calorimetry, DSC), temperatures of thermal degradation (by thermogravimetric analysis, TGA), as well as storage modulus and damping coefficient (both by dynamic mechanical analysis, DMA). Findings: After the first injection mouldings, minor decreases (ca. 2. 0 %) in the tensile strength were observed. After the next injection mouldings, this quantity did not change much. The <b>melt</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> increased along with the number of injection mouldings. The glass transition temperatures (from DSC) of butadiene and acrylonitrile styrene fractions don’t vary with the number of injection mouldings and are ca. 61 and + 104 ºC, respectively.
