25|$|<b>Main</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>pipe</b> {{pressure}} {{can also be}} used to supply air for auxiliary systems such as pneumatic door operators or air suspension. Nearly all passenger trains (all in the UK and USA), and many freights, now have the two-pipe system.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>pipe</b> is kept {{constantly}} pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can {{be charged}} {{independently of the}} brake pipe, this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent backfeeding into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} to loss of brake pressure is the two-pipe system, fitted on most modern passenger stock and many freight wagons. In {{addition to the}} traditional brake pipe, this enhancement adds the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>pipe,</b> which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive's main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive's air compressor output is stored, and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s PKP needed {{locomotives}} {{for passenger}} service. Since the freight service declined, the ET22 {{could be used}} for passenger service. They were fitted with <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>pipes</b> required for the automatic door control of the passenger coaches.|$|R
50|$|Other PCP {{rifles and}} pistols are regulated, i.e. the firing valve {{operates}} within a secondary chamber {{separated from the}} <b>main</b> air <b>reservoir</b> by the regulator body. The regulator maintains the pressure within this secondary chamber at a set pressure (lower than the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir's)</b> until the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir's</b> pressure drops {{to the point where}} it can no longer do so. As a result, shot to shot consistency is maintained for longer than in an unregulated rifle.|$|R

50|$|One {{enhancement}} of the automatic air brake {{is to have}} a second air hose (the main reservoir or main line) along the train to recharge the air reservoirs on each wagon. This air pressure {{can also be used to}} operate loading and unloading doors on wheat wagons and coal and ballast wagons. On passenger coaches, the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>pipe</b> is also used to supply air to operate doors and air suspension.|$|E
5000|$|Each brake {{reservoir}} stores air at {{a pressure}} of 7 bar and is fed via a {{pressure reducing valve}} off the <b>Main</b> <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Pipe.</b> The driver's brake handle passes control voltages down three wires to each EP control valve, which allows air from the brake reservoir to pass into the brake cylinder, thereby activating the disc brake. The presence of the voltage holds the brakes off, providing a Fail Safe system.|$|E

5000|$|The Westinghouse {{air system}} was {{abandoned}} {{in favour of}} a fully electrical system of control, so {{that the need for}} a brake pipe and triple-valves was dispensed with. Instead a single air pipe, now called the <b>Main</b> <b>Reservoir</b> <b>Pipe</b> runs the length of the train. It operates at 10 bar and in addition to feeding each brake cylinder reservoir also provides air for the secondary suspension systems (air bags) and power doors.|$|E

2500|$|The rain {{falling on}} the coast of the {{southern}} regions are the main source of recharge of the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir.</b> There is a free floating layer of the reservoir water on top of sea water up to a distance of 20km south of the Mediterranean Sea. The majority of wells [...] in the coastal plain depend on the water level in the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The coastal water supply comes from water percolating through the [...] coastal sand and water runoff from the south. This low salinity water is used for many purposes.|$|R
50|$|The {{stream bed}} of the Vltava near Lipno was chosen {{because it has a}} slight incline, facilitating the {{construction}} of a reservoir there. The dam is built along the highest-elevated stage of the Vltava River's cascade (roughly 726 metres above sea level), thus enabling large amounts of hydropower out-put. This area is mountainous, and borders the Šumava National Park and Nature Reserve. A smaller reservoir near Vyšší Brod is linked to the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> by an artificial underground waterway. This smaller reservoir, named 'Lipno II', serves to level the water of the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} three {{reservoirs}} that supply Huddersfield. They were built around 1840, although strengthening {{work in the}} 1930s makes them appear newer. One now covered and the lower reservoir looking more like a natural lake that is called a compensation reservoir - 'Compensation' as it {{was set up to}} compensate the mill owner for water lost from natural sources that now went to the <b>main</b> <b>reservoirs</b> to be distributed by the water corporation under 'rates' systems - ironically the mill owner was most likely the owner of the <b>main</b> <b>reservoir</b> too.|$|R
