5|$|Magnus's kingship {{has been}} downplayed in later history {{partly due to}} his short tenure, and because <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{together}} with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus's reign, combined {{with the fact that}} the later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.|$|E

5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E

5|$|Groves did {{not intend}} the Smyth Report {{to be the last}} word on the project. It formed an {{addendum}} to the Manhattan District History, the official history of the project. This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements. It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists, metallurgists, physicists, and administrators who had worked on the project. Since there were no security restrictions, it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project, but was itself classified. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars, except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Pingyuan Province was {{abolished}} and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{merged into}} Henan Province, and Pan Fusheng became the party chief (then called First Secretary) of Henan, succeeding Zhang Xi, and the Political Commissar of the Henan Military District. In September 1956, {{he was elected}} as an alternate member of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.|$|E
5|$|Raetia {{maintained}} its Roman traditions {{longer than the}} rest of Switzerland, but <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> eventually assimilated as well, leaving only a small territory where a Vulgar Latin dialect, Romansh, is spoken to this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} transition to the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Between 17 and 20July 1914 Neptune {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 27July, she was ordered to proceed {{with the rest of the}} Home Fleet to Scapa Flow two days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible German surprise attack. In August 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> briefly based (22October to 3November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; Neptune stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27November and the ship began a refit on 11December.|$|E
5|$|Some 500fragments {{of pottery}} were found {{dating from the}} medieval period. Most of these were parts of jars, jugs or pipkins and {{were found in the}} area of the kitchen range. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} locally, although 13sherds of Stamford Ware, fragments of two jugs from North France, and two small pieces of Saintonge pottery have been identified. Only a few wooden bowls were recovered. Much more pottery was found dating from the post-medieval period and later. Again most of this had been manufactured in England, especially in Staffordshire. Fragments of pottery from abroad included pieces from a Westerwald mug, a jug from Cologne and items of Chinese porcelain. The excavations produced over 4,000sherds of glass, dating from the 12th to the 20thcenturies, but only 16 of these came from the period before the dissolution. A total of 1,170fragments from clay tobacco pipes were found, dating from about 1580 to the early 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{had learned}} that the uranium ores that {{had been taken from}} Belgium in 1944 had been shipped to the Wirtschaftliche Forschungsgesellschaft (WiFO) plant in Staßfurt. The 83rd Infantry Division {{captured}} this on 15 April. As it was in the occupation zone allocated to the Soviet Union at the Yalta Conference, the Alsos Mission, led by Pash and accompanied by Lansdale, Perrin and Air Commodore Sir Charles Hambro, arrived on 17 April to remove anything of interest. Over the following ten days, 260 truckloads of uranium ore, sodium uranate and ferrouranium weighing about 1,000 tons, were taken away by an African-American truck company. The uranium was taken to Hildesheim and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> flown to the United Kingdom by the Royal Air Force; the rest had to be moved to Antwerp by train and loaded onto a ship to England.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E
5|$|Between 17 and 20 July 1914, Hercules {{took part}} in a test {{mobilisation}} and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis.

In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Jellicoe. <b>Most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened.

The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st Battle Squadron cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. Hercules and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.|$|E

5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and {{the daughter of a}} horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E
