50|$|The first Soviet {{communication}} <b>satellite,</b> called <b>Molniya,</b> {{was launched}} in 1965. By November, 1967 the national system of satellite television, called Orbita was deployed. The system consisted of 3 highly elliptical <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites,</b> with Moscow-based ground uplink facilities and about 20 downlink stations, located in cities and towns of remote regions of Siberia and the Far East. Each station had a 12-meter receiving parabolic antenna and transmitters for re-broadcasting TV signals to local householders.|$|R
40|$|Because {{atmospheric}} attenuation is greater for EHF frequencies than lower frequencies, {{it is necessary}} to design EHF satellite constellations so that the minimum elevation angles of the ground station antennas are larger than for satellite communication links using lower frequencies. The need for larger elevation angles reduces the coverage provided by geosynchronous equatorial satellites. This paper examines how the size of the polar regions not receiving adequate EHF coverage varies with the number of equally spaced equatorial satellites. The suitabilities of 24 hour Tundra, 12 hour Molniya, and six hour circular orbits for providing the missing coverage are then examined. The geographical location requirements for ground stations which link these satellites into global communication networks are analyzed. Three standard small satellite launch vehicles (SSLVs) can launch either three 12 hour <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites</b> or six circular orbit <b>satellites.</b> While three <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites</b> complete coverage of the northern hemisphere, six circular orbit satellites complete coverage of the entire globe. Finally, ground station location is shown to be critical for networking Molniya constellations, while circular orbit constellations offer the use of existing defense communication system architecture EHF terminals...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the timekeeping environments of several orbital and aircraft flight scenarios for {{application to the}} next generation architecture of positioning, navigation, timing, and communications. The model for timekeeping and time dissemination is illustrated by clocks onboard the International Space Station, a <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellite,</b> and a geostationary satellite. A mathematical simulator has been formulated to model aircraft flight test and satellite scenarios. In addition, a time transfer simulator integrated into the Formation Flying Testbed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is being developed. Real-time hardware performance parameters, environmental factors, orbital perturbations, and the effects of special and general relativity are modeled in this simulator for the testing and evaluation of timekeeping and time dissemination algorithms...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} work we carried out an {{analysis}} of the spectrophotometric and dynamical characteristics of Molniya and Meridian satellites constellation. Our work falls within the context of space debris Science and in particular the study of space debris {{in order to create a}} starting base for the resolution of the Kessler syndrome problem. We based mainly on spectrophotometric observations made with the Cassini telescope. In this work we focused on four main topics: - The study of rotational instabilities that <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellite</b> develop after they went out of control and their temporal evolution. Were possible we extracted the tumbling period from the light curves. We build then a phenomenological model to reproduce the observed spindown rate of tumbling period. The model is an exponential with characteristic time 28. 44 years. - The study of gravitational instabilities of Molniya type orbit. Solar-lunar perturbations tend to bring the satellite near the atmospheric drag zone causing the re-entry into atmosphere. - The relation that ties the apparent magnitude and the phase angle. We developed four models to explain the observed decreasing trend of magnitude with increasing phase angle. The best-fit model was the spherical lambertian model. Considering the reflecting area equal to RCS, we calculated a lower limit to the albedo, 0. 09 for filter B, 0. 28 I, 0. 15 R and 0. 10 V. - The study of spectral properties and color indexes of Molniya debris. We built color-color diagrams to search for color evolution with age, to understand reflective capacities and to compare the colors of the satellites with material colors. Spectral analysis was carried out calculating the reflectance of Molniya debris and compare it with materials reflectance. Confirming albedo values Molniya satellites present high reflective capacities in band I, that decrases in R, V and B. No trend has been found with age and in general there's disagreement with materials features...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of providing Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts by satellite relay was investigated. Satellite voice broadcast systems are described for three different frequency bands: HF, FHV, and L-band. Geostationary satellite configurations are considered for both frequency bands. A system of subsynchronous, circular satellites with an orbit period of 8 hours {{was developed for}} the HF band. The VHF broadcasts are provided by a system of <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites.</b> The satellite designs are limited in size and weight to the capability of the STS/Centaur launch vehicle combination. At L-band, only four geostationary satellites are needed {{to meet the requirements}} of the complete broadcast schedule. These satellites are comparable in size and weight to current satellites designed for the direct broadcast of video program material...|$|R
50|$|Meridian {{satellites}} are {{the replacement}} for older Soviet <b>molniya</b> <b>satellites,</b> and some authors think some {{functions of the}} parus satellites. It was constructed by ISS Reshetnev and {{is believed to be}} based on the Uragan-M satellite bus, which has also been used for GLONASS navigation satellites. The first Meridian satellite was launched in 2006 and two of the six launched so far have failed - Meridian 2 due a problem with the Fregat upper stage and Meridian 5 due to a problem with the third-stage motor.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{for areas}} {{close to the}} North (and South) Pole, a {{geostationary}} satellite may appear below the horizon. Therefore, <b>Molniya</b> orbit <b>satellites</b> have been launched, mainly in Russia, to alleviate this problem.|$|R

50|$|Orbita (орбита) is a Soviet-Russian {{system of}} {{broadcasting}} and delivering TV signals via satellites. It {{is considered to}} be the first national network of satellite television.The Orbita system is based on communication satellites in highly elliptical Molniya orbits, as well as on many ground downlink TV stations for reception and relaying TV signals to antennas of TV sets of many local areas. The full deployment of the Orbita satellite system took place on 25 October 1967 when ground downlink stations of some cities of Soviet Siberia and the Far East began to receive regular TV programmes from Moscow-based uplink stations via a constellation of <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} orbits are {{currently}} used for meteorological satellites: geostationary orbit and low earth orbit. Neither orbit serves the high latitudes well.

For approximately 8 h of its 12 -h orbit, a <b>satellite</b> in <b>Molniya</b> orbit is synchronized with the earth such that it is nearly geostationary in the high latitudes. A meteorological/oceanographic <b>satellite</b> in <b>Molniya</b> orbit would bring nearly the same frequent imaging capability to the high latitudes which the tropics and mid-latitudes now enjoy. The uses of such a satellite include Arctic forecasting, study of polar lows, high latitude precipitation estimation, Antarctic studies, sea ice monitoring, and ozone measurements...|$|R
50|$|Following the 1980 Olympics some of {{the surplus}} C Band {{capacity}} on the satellites was used to distribute Soviet Television both to relay transmitters within the USSR (where the vast physical size of the country made conventional distribution to remote areas difficult) and to other Eastern Bloc and allied countries for relay to Soviet troops stationed there. Later programming from other Warsaw Pact countries and Cuba were added. Signals from these satellites spread well outside their intended area and were for a time were popular with early domestic satellite television enthusiasts in Western Europe as these {{were among the first}} such signals to be receivable there. In this application Gorizont was (except at high latitudes) the successor to the Orbita system which used non-geostationary <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites.</b> Gorizont represented an improvement in channel capacity and could be picked up on less elaborate receiving systems.|$|R
50|$|Meridian 2 was {{launched}} on a Soyuz-2.1a rocket with a Fregat upper stage, from Site 43/4 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The launch occurred on 21 May 2009, at 21:53 GMT. While the launch was officially announced as successful, the satellite {{was placed in}} a significantly lower orbit than expected, and it was later reported that the upper stage of the Soyuz carrier rocket had shut down five seconds early, and an attempt to compensate for the low orbit resulted in the Fregat running out of fuel during its second burn. Following launch, it was reported to have been given a Kosmos designation; however, such a designation was never assigned. <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites</b> intended for operational use were only assigned Kosmos designations if they were considered to have failed.

40|$|Observing {{artificial}} satellites is {{a relatively}} new and unique branch of astronomy that is very interesting and dynamic. One specific aspect of observing these objects is that although they appear amongst the celestial background, as deep-sky objects do, their apparent locations amongst this background depend on where you are standing on Earth at a given time. This effect is known as parallax. When a satellite is observed at a specific time from a specific location, the satellite's equatorial coordinates can be determined using astrometric means. Its range from the observer, however, is still unknown unless the observer knows the satellite's precise orbit elements or has easy access to a radar station. However, when two or more observers, separated by some distance, observe the same satellite at the same time, their observations can be used to determine the range of the satellite using the satellite's observed trigonometric parallax.

[...] However, {{a large part of}} Soviet central regions were still not covered by transponders of <b>Molniya</b> <b>satellites.</b> By 1976, Soviet engineers developed a relatively simple and inexpensive system of satellite television (especially for Central and Northern Siberia). It included geostationary satellites called Ekran equipped with powerful 300 W UHF transponders, a broadcasting uplink station and various simple receiving stations located in various towns and villages of Siberian region. The typical receiving station, also called Ekran, represented itself as a home-use analog satellite receiver equipped with simple Yagi-Uda antenna. Later, Ekran satellites were replaced by more advanced Ekran-M series satellites. [...] In 1979 Soviet engineers developed Moskva (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signal via satellites. New type of geostationary communication satellites, called Gorizont, were launched. They were equipped by powerful on-board transponders, so the size of receiving parabolic antennas of downlink stations was reduced to 4 and 2.5 meters (in comparison of early 12-meter dishes of standard orbital downlink stations). [...] By 1989 an improved version of Moskva system of satellite television has been called Moskva Global'naya (or Moscow Global). The system included a few geostationary Gorizont and Express type of communication satellites. TV signal from Moscow Global’s satellites could be received in any country of planet except Canada and North-West of the USA. [...] Modern Russian satellite broadcasting services based on powerful geostationary buses such as Gals, Ekspress, USP and Eutelsat which provide a large quantity of free-to-air television channels to millions of householders. Pay-TV is growing in popularity amongst Russian TV viewers.
