60|$|It {{was a pause}} of <b>mutual</b> <b>inspection.</b> For a time naive {{humanity}} swamped {{the conventions}} of warfare altogether; {{the interest of the}} millions below and of the thousands above alike was spectacular. The evening was unexpectedly fine--only a few thin level bands of clouds at seven or eight thousand feet broke its luminous clarity. The wind had dropped; it was an evening infinitely peaceful and still. The heavy concussions of the distant guns and those incidental harmless pyrotechnics {{at the level of the}} clouds seemed to have as little to do with killing and force, terror and submission, as a salute at a naval review. Below, every point of vantage bristled with spectators, the roofs of the towering buildings, the public squares, the active ferry boats, and every favourable street intersection had its crowds: all the river piers were dense with people, the Battery Park was solid black with east-side population, and every position of advantage in Central Park and along Riverside Drive had its peculiar and characteristic assembly from the adjacent streets. The footways of the great bridges over the East River were also closely packed and blocked. Everywhere shopkeepers had left their shops, men their work, and women and children their homes, to come out and see the marvel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{deal with}} the optimal <b>mutual</b> <b>inspection</b> {{policies}} (OMIP) for a manufacturer and its downstream member (buyer) under a quality contract subject to the probability of non-conforming for each unit is transparent between the manufacturer and buyer. A game-theoretic framework is developed for both parties to determine their OMIP. Main difference between this study and related previous works is that in this research the full inspection policy will never be optimal for the manufacturer when a quality contract is considered. Based on this OMIP, we show how the OMIP is incorporated into the determination of optimal production lot size. To achieve an economical production under the defined contract, tradeoffs between manufacturing cost, inventory holding cost and quality related cost must be analyzed. Some properties for the optimal lot size are obtained. Numerical examples are performed to illustrate the optimal production lot size and OMIP...|$|E

40|$|In March 1994, the United States and the Russian Federation {{announced}} {{their intention to}} conduct <b>mutual</b> reciprocal <b>inspections</b> (MRI) to confirm inventories of fissile materials from dismantled nuclear weapons.

This paper discusses progress made toward MRI, stressing measurement technologies and observables, as well as prospects for MRI implementation. An analysis is presented of observables that might be exploited to provide assurance that the material being measured could have come from a dismantled weapon rather than other sources. Instrumentation to exploit these observables will also be discussed, as will joint US/Russian efforts to demonstrate such instrumentation. Progress toward a so-called ``program of cooperation`` between the two countries in protecting each other`s sensitive information will be reviewed. All of these steps are essential components of an eventual comprehensive regime for controlling fissile materials from weapons...|$|R
40|$|The Research Institute of Pulse Techniques, in {{collaboration}} with the Proliferation Prevention and Arms Control Program at LLNL, has constructed a gamma-ray camera for use in arms control agreements such as <b>Mutual</b> Reciprocal <b>Inspections</b> and Warhead Dismantlement Transparency. The camera is designed to have high efficiency (in order to reduce inspection times), moderate resolution (to decrease the intrusiveness of the measurements), and sturdy construction (to allow operation in the types of conditions that might be met during shipment and use at various forward weapons sites). The imaging element consists of a honeycomb or soda-straw lead collimator and a 312 -mm-diameter NaI(Tl) scintillator viewed by an array of phototubes. Software was developed to display two- and three-dimensional views of the data and to analyze shape and peak areas. The first model was tuned for plutonium radiation in the 375 - to 415 -keV energy range. Images from various arrays of point sources were obtained and are presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{process of}} {{confidence}} {{building in the}} MENA region is needed. Transparency in all the safety and non-proliferation issues {{may be the first}} step toward the confidence building process between the concerned parties. The inspection of all the nuclear and the suspicious sites and the full cooperation with the IAEA are essential elements in the transparency process. All the concerned parties have to review their paradigm and to look to the safety concerns and the proliferation threats as a whole in the whole region. The Arab states must stop to focus only on the Israeli nuclear warheads. Israel must understand the Arab concerns about its nuclear program and the 5 + 1 group has also to stop to focus only in the Iranian nuclear program. If the free zone is difficult to establish in the near future in the Middle East, the paradigm review process may lead to create a regional agency able to inspect all the nuclear, chemical and biological facilities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region including Iran and Israel. Any other cooperation project without transparency is not possible and it is a waste of time. This Agency (The Middle East Inspection and Verification Agency: MEIVA) will hire inspectors from the regional states in order to make each inspection as a <b>mutual</b> <b>inspection.</b> The success of the Agency’s inspection and verification mission may lead to open new opportunities to establish peaceful cooperation projects between the MENA countries in all the peaceful scientific and technical areas including nuclear, biological and chemical applications...|$|E

50|$|The PIC (Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention) {{was founded}} in October '70 by the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), under {{the title of the}} Convention for the <b>Mutual</b> Recognition of <b>Inspections</b> in Respect of the Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products. The initial members {{comprised}} the 10 member countries of EFTA at that time. In the early 1990s it was realized that because of an incompatibility between the Convention and European law, it was not possible for new countries to be admitted as members of PIC. European law did not permit individual EU countries that were members of PIC to sign agreements with other countries seeking to join PIC. As a consequence the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme was formed on 2 November 1995. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme is an informal agreement between health authorities instead of a formal treaty between countries. PIC and the PIC Scheme, which operate together in parallel, are jointly referred to as PIC/S. PIC/S became operational in November 1995.|$|R
40|$|The O`Leary-Mikhailov {{agreement}} of March 1994 {{stated that the}} U. S. and the Russian Federation would engage in <b>mutual</b> reciprocal <b>inspections</b> (MRI) of fissile materials removed from dismantled nuclear weapons. It was decided {{to begin with the}} plutonium (Pu) removed from dismantled weapons and held in storage containers. Later discussions between U. S. and Russian technical experts led to the conclusion that, to achieve the O`Leary-Mikhailov objectives, Pu MRI would need to determine that the material in the containers has properties consistent with a nuclear-weapon component. Such a property is a {sup 240 }Pu/{sup 239 }Pu ratio consistent with weapons-grade material. One of the candidate inspection techniques under consideration for Pu MRI is to use a narrow region (630 - 670 keV) of the plutonium gamma-ray spectrum, taken with a high-purity germanium detector, to determine that it is weapons-grade plutonium as well as to estimate the minimum mass necessary to produce the observed gamma-ray intensity. We developed software (the Pu 600 code) for instrument control and analysis especially for this purpose. In November 1994, U. S. and Russian scientists met at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for joint experiments to evaluate candidate Pu MRI inspection techniques. In one of these experiments, gamma-ray intensities were measured from three unclassified weapons-grade plutonium source standards and one reactor-grade standard (21 % {sup 240 }pu). Using our software, we determined the {sup 240 }Pu/{sup 239 }Pu ratio of these standards to accuracies within {+-} 10 %, which is adequate for Pu MRI. The minimum mass estimates varied, as expected, directly with the exposed surface area of the standards...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines president Eisenhower’s ‘Open Skies’ {{policy and}} its links with American defence {{strategy of the}} 1950 s. Based principally on archival sources, especially {{the records of the}} Eisenhower Presidential Library, it will assess the foreign policy issues and domestic pressures that influenced Eisenhower’s desire to implement a system of <b>mutual</b> aerial <b>inspection</b> with the Soviet Union from July 1955. The first chapter will focus on the background to the rise of the military establishment in America after 1945, which Eisenhower later referred to as a military-industrial complex. Chapter Two examines the president’s defence strategy, which became known as the New Look, {{and the ways in which}} this strategy embraced not only a military response towards the perceived threat of Soviet communism but also included non-military measures. Chapter Three focuses on the background to the Geneva summit, at which Open Skies was proposed to the Russians. In particular, it will assess Eisenhower’s efforts to strengthen Western allied unity so that constructive negotiations with the Russians could be undertaken. Chapter Four will focus on Nelson Rockefeller and the Quantico Panel. Think tanks played an influential role in shaping foreign policy during the early Cold War period. Chapters Five and Six examine Eisenhower’s attempts to implement Open Skies with the Soviets after July 1955. In order to confront the growing challenges to the New Look and cuts in defence budgets, Eisenhower needed reliable intelligence on the Soviet Union that would quell exaggerated estimates about Russian military capabilities. The dissertation concludes that Open Skies was neither a transient measure nor an attempt by Eisenhower to achieve a propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. It is argued instead that his desire to implement this initiative was linked to his determination to control the military-industrial complex in America, an interpretation that has not been addressed by historians...|$|R

This database should be managed at SPISE level and should be linked to the national databases for getting regular updates. Actually in Italy there is a public national online database (www. centriprovairroratrici. unito. it) that was realized by the ENAMA working group. Only the sprayers inspected by the test stations listed in this database are recognized all over the country. This national database contains also the results of all the inspections made in the different Italian Regions and therefore provides a support for monitoring the inspection activity at national level. Independently of the software used at local level for managing data of sprayer inspections, some key information have to be necessarily provided in order to identify the sprayer inspected.

In Italy, Authorities responsible of training and upgrading of sprayers inspectors are Regional and Provincial administrations. They make this job in collaboration with research institutes that provide qualified teachers. With the aim to homogenize {{in the whole country}} the activity of training and licensing of sprayers inspectors the rules for training courses and the criteria for releasing licenses have been defined by ENAMA. Training courses shall have a duration of at least 40 hours subdivided between theory (60 % of total time) and practical (40 % of total time). Topics treated during courses are: criteria to apply pesticides, main sprayer types used in agriculture and relative components, test methods and equipment used to carry out the inspections of sprayers in use and to adjust them. The exam to get the inspector license shall consist in: a) filling of a questionnaire with multiple answers (at least 80 % of answers have to be correct); the questions are selected among a database approved by ENAMA Working Group; b) oral test; c) practical exam consisting in the complete inspection of one sprayer.
