2500|$|A {{distinction}} is often {{made between the}} [...] "weak" [...] and the [...] "strong" [...] versions of legal pluralism. The [...] "weak" [...] version does not necessarily question the <b>main</b> <b>assumptions</b> of [...] "legal centralism", but only recognises that within {{the domain of the}} Western state law other legal systems, such as customary or Islamic law, may also have an autonomous (co-)existence. Thus, the [...] "weak" [...] version does not consider other forms of normative ordering as law. As Tamanaha, one of the critics of legal pluralism, puts it: [...] "Normative ordering is, well, normative ordering. Law is something else, something that we isolate out and call law…". The [...] "strong" [...] version, on the other hand, rejects all legal centralist and formalist models of law, as [...] "a myth, an ideal, a claim, an illusion," [...] regarding state law as one among many forms of law or forms of social ordering. It insists that modern law is plural, that it is private as well as public, but most importantly [...] "the national (public official) legal system is often a secondary rather than the primary locus of regulation".|$|E
2500|$|The third {{criticism}} that Hume offers {{is that even}} if the argument did give evidence for a designer; it still gives no evidence for the traditional 'omnipotent', 'benevolent' (all-powerful and all-loving) God of traditional Christian theism. One of the <b>main</b> <b>assumptions</b> of Paley's argument is that 'like effects have like causes'; or that machines (like the watch) and the universe have similar features of design and so both also have the same cause of their existence: they must both have an intelligent designer. However, Hume points out that what Paley does not comprehend is to what extent 'like causes' extend: how similar the creation of a universe is {{to the creation of a}} watch. Instead, Paley moves straight to the conclusion that this designer of the universe is the 'God' he believes in of traditional Christianity. Hume, however takes the idea of 'like causes' and points out some potential absurdities in how far the 'likeness' of these causes could extend to if the argument were taken further as to explain this. One example that he uses is how a machine or a watch is usually designed by a whole team of people rather than just one person. Surely, if we are analogizing the two in this way, it would point to there being a group of gods who created the universe, not just a single being. Another example he uses is that complex machines are usually the result of many years of trial and error with every new machine being an improved version of the last. Also by analogy of the two, would that not hint that the universe could also have been just one of many of God's 'trials' and that there are much better universes out there? However, if that were taken to be true, surely the 'creator' of it all would not be 'all loving' and 'all powerful' if they had to carry out the process of 'trial and error' when creating the universe? ...|$|E

A <b>main</b> <b>assumption</b> that is employed is functional {{dependence of the}} soliton potential, with the conformal factor {{in the first case}}, and with the warping function in the second. The main result in the first case is a partial classification in dimension n≥ 4. In the second case, Kähler quasi-soliton metrics satisfying the above <b>main</b> <b>assumption</b> are shown to be, under an additional genericity hypothesis, necessarily Riemannian products. Another theorem concerns quasi-soliton metrics satisfying the above <b>main</b> <b>assumption,</b> which are also conformally Kähler.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} generalizations of the Perron—Frobenius {{theory to}} the matrix pencil Ax = λBx are discussed, and their relationships are studied. In one generalization, which {{was motivated by}} economics, the <b>main</b> <b>assumption</b> is that (B − A) − 1 A is nonnegative. In the second generalization, the <b>main</b> <b>assumption</b> is that there exists a matrix X ⩾ 0 such that A = BX. The equivalence of these two assumptions when B is nonsingular is considered. For ρ(|B− 1 A|) < 1, a complete characterization, involving a condition on the di-graph of B− 1 A, is proved. It is conjectured that the characterization holds for ρ(B− 1 A) < 1, and partial results are given for this case...|$|R

This means that when the central route is taken (involving high-elaboration thought in which all information is being carefully analyzed), the attitudes formed become more stable and less susceptible to counter-persuasion, whereas when the peripheral route is taken (involving low-elaboration thought based on heuristics and shortcuts to establish an attitude) short-term attitude change is more likely to occur.|$|E

In particular, Communitarians challenge the Liberal assumption that the individual {{can be considered as}} fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.|$|E
