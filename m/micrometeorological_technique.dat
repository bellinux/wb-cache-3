It is widely used for quantifying CO 2 emission rates from natural, urban and agricultural ecosystems, including areas of agricultural carbon sequestration. In geological carbon capture, utilization and sequestration, emerging projects utilize eddy covariance to monitor large areas where CO 2 may escape from the subsurface, to detect and quantify CO 2 leakage, and to improve CO 2 storage efficiency.

40|$|A fast response, sensitive, field-worthy {{trace gas}} {{analyzer}} (TGA), {{based on the}} principle of diode laser absorption spectroscopy has been developed. The TGA is suitable for in situ trace gas flux measurements using <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques,</b> and is capable of achieving total system noise levels of less than 1, 2, or 4 part per billion by volume (ppbv) rms for N₂O, NH₃, and CH₄, respectively, for a 5 -s integration period, and less than 50 pptv for 1 -h averaging periods. This sensitivity is accomplished using a unique approach to digital signal processing and a single-path sample absorption cell, both of which reduce noise due to optical fringes. The instrument is also capable of rapid sampling rates (10 samples/s) sufficient for eddy correlation (EC) measurements when used with the appropriate flow system design. The TGA software and electronics have been designed to interface directly with micrometeorological instrumentation such as sonic anemometers, facilitating the use with the eddy correlation and gradient techniques. The operation, characteristics, and practical aspects of employing the TGA with <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques</b> are reviewed. Gradient flux data for N₂O and CH₄ from field study measurements is from two plots are presented. The results demonstrate the capabilities of the TGA to make sensitive, continuous measurements of trace gas fluxes using <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques,</b> allowing the assessment of the immediate and long-term impact of treatments or perturbations to natural and agricultural systems. 19 page(s...|$|R

When exposed to continuous and constant light for 20 to 48 hours leaves of eleven of seventeen species reduced their photosynthetic rates and closed their stomata during the normally dark period and resumed active gas exchange during the normally light period. Similarly, the rate of whole-forest CO 2 uptake at a predetermined irradiance declined during the late afternoon and early morning and increased {{during the middle of}} the day.

Existing measurement techniques, however, are not capable of resolving sediment-water fluxes of most constituents under in situ flow conditions. We investigated whether relaxed eddy accumulation (REA), a <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique</b> with conditional sampling of turbulent updrafts and downdrafts, {{can be adapted to}} the aquatic environment. We simulated REA fluxes by reanalyzing eddy covariance measurements from a riverine lake. We found that the empirical coefficient that relates mass fluxes to the concentration difference between both REA samples is invariant with scalar and flow and responds as predicted by a joint Gaussian distribution of linearly correlated variables. Simulated REA fluxes differed on average by around 30 % from eddy covariance fluxes (mean absolute error). Assessment of the lower quantification limit suggests that REA can potentially be applied for measuring benthic fluxes of a new range of constituents that cannot be assessed by standard eddy covariance methods...|$|E

Wastes are applied to a soil surface and indigenous soil microorganisms utilize the hydrocarbons in the applied waste as a carbon source for metabolism, thereby biodegrading the applied material. Concerns have been expressed that abiotic losses, such as volatilization, {{play a significant role in}} hydrocarbon reduction within the soil. To assist in better defining atmospheric releases of total hydrocarbons from landfarms treating petroleum hydrocarbons, a flux gradient micrometeorological approach was developed and integrated with a custom-built total hydrocarbon detector, and a novel air sampling system and averaging algorithm.

We propose research at UCI’s San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh {{to better understand the}} ecological controls on wetland carbon, energy and water vapor exchange. We have been using the eddy covariance technique since 1998 to measure the CO 2 exchange (FCO 2) and evapotranspiration (E) between the atmosphere and the San Joaquin Marsh. Eddy covariance is a non-invasive <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique</b> that measures the exchanges of gases and energy between the atmosphere and a few hectare patch of marsh. The marsh’s CO 2 exchange and evapotranspiration fluctuated dramatically from year to year during this period, with particularly high rates of FCO 2 and E during the 2000 and 2003 growing seasons. The interannual shifts in FCO 2 and E occurred despite similar climatic and flooding regimes. The large year-to-year variability at the San Joaquin Marsh apparently reflects an unexpected and previously unreported phenomenon that helps to control marsh biogeochemistry and evapotranspiration. Our research goal is to understand the causes and consequences of this pattern...|$|E

Net flux densities were measured at heights 5 and 10 m above an agricultural field with short corn plants and large amount of exposed bare soil between the rows. Large upward eddy fluxes of NO{sub 2 } were seen, and strong NO emissions from the soil were measured by collaborators using environmental enclosures on the soil surface. Data indicate that about 50 % of the nitrogen emitted from the soil as NO was converted into NO{sub 2 } at 5 m. Rest of the emitted nitrogen may remain as NO flux and be returned back to the vegetation and soil by deposition. Divergence of the NO{sub 2 } and O{sub 3 } fluxes were detected between 5 and 10 m.

Mean particle deposition velocities (Vd) range from 0. 3 mm s- 1 for 0. 1 µm particles {{to more than}} 10 mm s- 1 for 3 µm particles. On average, the measured size-dependence of Vd is almost identical with the prediction by the widely used Slinn model, using the original parameters derived from wind-tunnel studies. Within each size-band Vd increased linearly with the friction velocity (u*). Total particle number fluxes measured with a condensation particle counter are dominated by the high concentration of small particles; therefore, this provides the first estimate of Vd for particles smaller than those that can be sized by optical techniques, for short vegetation. Values of Vd ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 6 mm s- 1 as u* increased from 0. 15 to 0. 55 m s- 1. These deposition rates are one order of magnitude smaller than have been observed for a pine forest stand. The analysis shows that, at least for super-micron particles, the emission fluxes that were frequently observed at the study site need {{to be included in}} the computation of average values.

The technique relies on a single open-path FTIR sensor (OP-FTIR) with motorized aiming to give gas concentrations along vertically separated paths (not necessarily parallel with each other). Emission rates are inferred from the vertical difference in concentration using two alternative methods: flux-gradient and inverse dispersion calculations. Our objective is to assess the capability of the technique in a field study measuring nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ammonia (NH 3) emitted from cattle overwintering areas during the spring thaw. Two field configurations were examined: a slant path configuration in which the OP-FTIR is aimed directly at high and low reflectors {{at the far end}} of the path (average vertical path separation ∼ 1 m), and a periscope configuration where the lower FTIR path was directed closer to ground along the whole path (average path separation ∼ 1. 5 m). Measured emission rates were generally above the detectability threshold of the system and consistent with the scientific literature showing an emission rise during thawing. At one of our sites the pulse of N 2 O emitted during thawing was among the largest reported (9. 9 kg N-N 2 O ha− 1 during April). Of the two alternatives tested for calculating emissions, the inverse dispersion approach is more flexible, but with a computation time that can be prohibitive. With large measurement fetches the flux-gradient approach can be equally good and computationally faster.

40|$|We present eddy {{covariance}} based CO 2 and DMS fluxes and {{gas exchange}} coefficients (piston velocities) measured in situ during a 10 -day cruise in the North Atlantic during summer 2007. Most current parameterizations of air/sea gas exchange utilize a generalized piston velocity, k, which relates the gas flux to the air/sea concentration difference, and incorporates all the physical factors controlling gas transport through {{both sides of}} the air/sea interface. Tracer release studies have shown that k increases with wind speed, though the functional form of the wind speed-dependence has not been well constrained due to averaging of flux estimates over varying environmental conditions, and also likely due to processes affecting gas exchange that are not correlated to wind speed. During the past decade, the <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique</b> eddy covariance (EC) has been used from ships at sea to measure k on short temporal and spatial scales, allowing for measurement {{of a wide range of}} environmental conditions on a single expedition. EC- based studies of CO 2 and DMS in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans have clearly shown wind speed dependency of k; however, a wide range of functional relationships is found among the cruises data sets. These differences may reflect differences in physical forcing of gas exchange in different environments, differing behavior of DMS versus CO 2 due to solubility, or perhaps methodological differences. The simultaneous measurement of gas transfer coefficients of CO 2 and DMS can provide insight into the sensitivity of gas exchange to gas solubility, and the extent to which gas transfer coefficients can be estimated from similarity relationship...|$|E

With a footprint and fetch calculation, the required distance {{from the edge of}} the field in the prevailing wind direction to the EC tower is three times higher under shade than full sun. The shaded agroecosystem reached maximum average carbon fixation rates of 21. 26 ± 2. 469 μmolCO 2. m- 2 s- 1 ( = 0. 05) (61 % higher than under 100 % sunlight) which gives a high carbon sink capacity to the association of coffee plants with shading Pigeon peas (Cajanus cajan L). The average evapotranspiration rate was 2. 33 ± 0. 0102 mm. d- 1 ( = 0. 05) and 2. 08 ± 0. 00732 mm. d- 1 under shade and 100 % sunlight, respectively. The proportion of net radiation that reached the soil was 2 % under shade and 4 % under 100 % sunlight. Likewise, the soil energy loss during the night was lower under shade, indicating less day-night temperature range in the latter agroecosystem.

For a single area emission source, the VRPM technique yielded a somewhat high relative accuracy of 1. 38 ± 0. 28. The bLS technique resulted in a relative accuracy close to unity, 0. 98 ± 0. 24.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of carbon (C) {{taken up by}} the tree canopy for respiration and production of tree organs with different construction and maintenance costs, life span and decomposition rate, crucially affects the residence time of C in forests and their C cycling rate. The carbon-use efficiency, or ratio between net primary production (NPP) and gross primary production (GPP), represents a convenient way to analyse the C allocation at the stand level. In this study, we extend the current knowledge on the NPP-GPP ratio in forests by assessing the temporal variability of the NPP-GPP ratio at interannual (for 8 years) and seasonal (for 1 year) scales for a young temperate beech stand, reporting dynamics for both leaves and woody organs, in particular stems. NPP was determined with biometric methods/litter traps, whereas the GPP was estimated via the eddy covariance <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique.</b> The interannual variability of the proportion of C allocated to leaf NPP, wood NPP and leaf plus wood NPP (on average 11 % yr− 1 , 29 % yr− 1 and 39 % yr− 1 , respectively) was significant among years with up to 12 % yr− 1 variation in NPP-GPP ratio. Studies focusing on the comparison of NPP-GPP ratio among forests and models using fixed allocation schemes should take into account the possibility of such relevant interannual variability. Multiple linear regressions indicated that the NPP-GPP ratio of leaves and wood significantly correlated with environmental conditions. Previous year drought and air temperature explained about half of the NPP-GPP variability of leaves and wood, respectively, whereas the NPP-GPP ratio was not decreased by severe drought, with large NPP-GPP ratio on 2003 due mainly to low GPP. During the period between early May and mid June, the majority of GPP was allocated to leaf and stem NPP, whereas these sinks were of little importance later on. Improved estimation of seasonal GPP and of the contribution of previous-year reserves to stem growth, as well as reduction of data uncertainty, will be of relevance to increase the accuracy of the seasonal assessment of the NPP-GPP ratio in forests...|$|E
40|$|A {{model to}} {{describe}} the cloud dispersion of gas denser than air is presented here. The dispersion of heavy gas is basically governed by the gravity but, when the density contrast (gas vs air) is not important the dispersion {{is controlled by the}} wind and atmospheric turbulence (so-called “passive dispersion”). DisGas is a model for dense gases which are dispersed under passive conditions, based on the full solution of the advection-diffusion equations for the gas concentration (Sankaranarayanan et al., 1998). The wind field can be assumed with a horizontally uniform profile calculated in accord to the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory or it can be estimated by the so-called DIAGNO, a Diagnostic Wind Model (DWM) developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency, the latter option requiring topographic data, average wind and atmospheric stability information within the computational domain. The model is able to forecast gas dispersion over large and complex terrain. Following the study of Costa et al., (2005), we present here an application of DisGas on the gas dispersion from the crater of Solfatara (Campi Flegrei) which releases a large quantity of CO 2 into the surrounding densely-inhabited areas. For the simulated cases, the soil CO 2 flow rate was assumed to be about 800 ton/day, such as the average of twelve different surveys carried out in the period 1998 to 2008 (Chiodini et al., 2010). Local atmospheric dynamics (3 -components of the wind, friction velocity, Monin-Obukhov length) were derived by a two-year period of observations with <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique</b> inside the Solfatara crater. Our main finding showed that the urban area of Naples is affected by the CO 2 buildup above the normal air CO 2 content for this “natural” contribution, particularly in the no windy nocturnal situation. Estimated values show the absence of any risk to the population safety at the present emission rate but suggest that volcanic CO 2 contributes towards deteriorating and warming the urban air of Naples. DisGas model is able to simulate the dispersion of a heavy warm gas accounting for obstacles, topographic effects, variation of atmospheric conditions and wind direction. So, a possible application is the cloud dispersion of pollutant and/or greenhouse gases emitted by industrial chimney over urban or suburban environmental...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Civil Engineering, Washington State UniversityCropping {{systems can}} be net sources or net sinks of {{greenhouse}} gases (GHGs) depending on climate and management. Agriculture can be a sink for carbon dioxide (CO 2) if climate and management conditions are conducive for the build-up of soil organic matter. At the same time, agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which is both a GHG and an ozone depleting substance. The work presented in this dissertation investigates the dynamics of CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes over terrestrial systems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) using measurements and modeling. The first study used the eddy covariance micrometeorological method to monitor fluxes of CO 2 for two years at two agricultural sites representing the low- and high-end of the regional precipitation gradient. Combining the measured net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 with information on carbon (C) export during harvest, we found that both sites were net carbon sinks. The high-rainfall site had a two-year C balance of 202 ± 60 g C m- 2, and the low-rainfall site had a C balance of 444 ± 34 g C m- 2. The second study used the flux gradient <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>technique</b> and automated static chambers to measure N 2 O emissions over one year at two agricultural sites, one under no-tillage management (CAF-NT) and one that had conventional tillage (CAF-CT). The chamber results indicated total annual emissions of 2. 7 ± 1. 6 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 and 4. 4 ± 3. 2 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 from CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively, while the flux gradient results indicated that CAF-NT and CAF-CT had total annual emissions of 2. 1 ± 0. 4 and 1. 7 ± 0. 3 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1, respectively. The third study investigates coupling the GHG processes in the Community Land Model (CLM) with a PNW regional air quality model. Results from two exploratory model runs are presented, which indicate that using CLM can strengthen monitoring and improve emission inventories in the PNW.

40|$|Significant {{advances}} {{have been made}} in quantifying air-sea fluxes of radiatively important gases, and in measuring the factors controlling their exchange, in part, by the SOLAS community because of their great interest and expertise. A notable exception to this is exchange at high winds, where flux measurements for different gases made using different methods and spatio-temporal scales provide contradictory results. This session will summarize recent field results obtained from noble gas anomalies in the intermediate and deep ocean, measurements made during cyclones, gas mass balances in surface oceans, and <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques.</b> Intended outcome, action or product following the discussion session The outcome of the session will be an assessment of which results can be explained within a conventional theoretical framework and which require rethinking of traditional explanations of gas fluxes and their forcing mechanisms. Recommendations will be made by the group as to priority studies to resolve differences between seemingly contradictory datasets.

40|$|Although {{not widely}} used in horticultural research, <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques</b> are very useful tools to study energy, water vapour and carbon dioxide fluxes above vegetation. Compared to the more common, cuvette-based methods, a {{distinctive}} feature of these techniques {{is that they do}} not alter plant microenvironment at all. Thus, they are suitable for long-term monitoring of vegetation-atmosphere interactions, without affecting the radiation regime, ventilation, temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide experienced by the plants. Additionally, they provide a quantitative measurement of key physiological processes, that is intrinsically properly scaled to the plot, averaging single leaves and plants into a common canopy flux. These techniques, developed over a long timespan, rely on solid physical basis, directly related to the conservation laws. However, they are still technically demanding, requiring special attention during maintenance and data processing. The most critical point, however, is related to the necessary features of the experimental plot, which must be homogeneous, large, and flat. There requirements may make their application difficult, especially in the context of orchards. Nonetheless, they could provide essential information on biogeochemical fluxes pertaining to managed vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric aerosol {{particles}} have major impacts on human health, {{direct and indirect}} negative forcing of the Earth's radiation budget, atmospheric chemistry {{as well as on}} long-range transport and deposition of pollutants, especially in remote areas. Owing to their physical properties and small number concentrations, the measurement of the surface/atmosphere exchange of {{aerosol particles}}, especially of the larger particles (Dp > 0. 3 p. m), is very challenging. Our understanding of sources and sinks of aerosols, their deposition rates and deposition footprints is therefore still limited. Emissions are usually predicted using emission inventories that are based on activities and emission factors (. e. g. Salway et al., 1997). These emissions are used in atmospheric transport and deposition models and their uncertainties propagate into the quantification of deposition and concentration fields. We here present the first direct measurements of size-segregated particle fluxes above a city representative for a scale of several (100 m) 2. In this study the emission or deposition was measured directly with <b>micrometeorological</b> <b>techniques</b> and the controlling parameters were derived by footprint analysis as well as through comparison with meteorological parameters (e. g. wind speed and direction), traffic densities, potential precursor gas concentrations and PMIo concentrations at street leve...|$|R
