50|$|On June 22, 1960, at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Boulder, Colorado, Harvey Lance {{presented}} a paper titled “The Nation’s Electronic Standards Program: Where Do We Stand?” suggesting {{the need for}} an organization of standards laboratories to promote cooperative efforts for solving the common problems faced by <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> laboratories. The next morning a committee was formed to “investigate the possible organization, scope, and objectives appropriate for an organization of standards laboratories”. September 15, 1961, the National Conference of Standards Laboratories (NCSL) was formally established with NBS as its sponsor. Primarily due to the growth and acquired ability of NCSL to run its own affairs, NBS (currently known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST) ended its sponsorship role in July 1986. The two agencies maintain a close and collaborative relationship.|$|E
5000|$|His {{graduate}} {{work at the}} University of Chicago connected him with notable educators Charles Judd and W. W. Charters, whose ideas influenced Tyler’s later work in curriculum development and evaluation. Tyler’s first appointment was at the University of North Carolina in 1927, where he worked with state teachers to improve curricula. Later in 1927, Tyler joined the faculty at Ohio State University, where he refined his innovative approach to testing while working with Charters, who {{was the director of}} the university's Bureau of Educational Research. Tyler helped Ohio State University faculty to improve their teaching and increase student retention. He is credited with coining the term, [...] "evaluation," [...] for aligning <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> with educational objectives. Because his concept of evaluation consisted of gathering comprehensive evidence of learning rather than just paper and pencil tests, Tyler might even be viewed as an early proponent of portfolio assessment.|$|E

5000|$|During the {{economic}} crisis {{at the end of}} the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, the automotive industry was under high pressure to cut costs and to optimize their internal processes. One area identified for cost savings was the <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> area for vehicle development. The equipment used there had been mostly purpose-built solutions, with widely incompatible interfaces and data formats, which severely impeded interconnectivity and exchange of data. The directors of development from Audi, BMW, Daimler-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen agreed to cooperate in this area and founded in 1991 the [...] "Arbeitskreis zur Standardisierung von Automatisierungs- und Messsystemen" [...] (ASAM, Eng., working group for the standardization of automation and measuring systems). Unlike earlier standardization efforts, where standards were created by OEMs and unilaterally imposed on suppliers, ASAM had the goal right from the beginning to include suppliers in the standard development process as equal partners. This measure brought in their technological know-how and ensured that the standards are feasible and result in cost-effective products.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{the impact}} of the <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> {{infrastructure}} on economic performance and trade is theoretically and even politically widely accepted. However, there are no empirical studies on this issue. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to elucidate {{the impact of}} innovation capacity and technical standards as one important part of the <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> infrastructure on international trade flows and competitiveness. In order to focus on the direct causlity between innnovative technology and <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> standards and the respective market, the empirical analysis concentrates on the trade of <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> products of a country witha top position in <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> technology. In its empirical analysis of Switzerland's trade flows with Germany, France and the UK, the paper follows the approach of the pionneering paper of Swann et al. (EconomicJournal 106 (19996) 1297), who integrated for the first time technical standards as a technology indicator in the estimation of UK trade performance. The trade flows in <b>measurement</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> products from 1980 until 1995 are explained by both indicator for innovative capcity and for the degree of standardisation. The first indicator is based on the patent applications at the European patent office. The later uses the stocks of technical standards in the countries differented by their regional scope. Four different trade equations are analysed, besides an export and an import function, the trade balance and the intra-industry trade. The results clearly show that both Switzerland's innovative capacity and its stocks of standards are able to explain its export performance in the three countries. Secondly, especially the stocks of international standards in Switzerland have a positive impact on imports into Switzerland from the three countries, confirming their positive role for fostering trae in general. Thirdly, Switherland's export surplus concerning the three trade partners is positively affected by the stock on international standards in Switzerland, which seem to be an important factor for international competitiveness. Finally, the results of the intra-industry model underline the common view of the general trade-fostering effect of even national standards in the case of the trade with the three countries...|$|E
