The two go back and forth until Chitra admits that she is looking for him, which prompts Arjuna to say that he will no longer hold to his vows of chastity. Chitra finds that rather than make her happy, hearing this makes her extremely unhappy since he is not falling for her true self and tells him not to offer his heart to an illusion.|$|R

In the early 1930s, the Canadian Alex Foster designed a towing device powered by an automobile engine. Tow ropes and bars could be dangerous, and many skiers found them unpleasant - especially on longer or steeper runs. Curran's chairlift raised skiers {{off the ground}} allowing them to rest and gain an enjoyable view of mountains, ski-runs, and resorts. “People were <b>marveling</b> <b>over</b> how well <b>the</b> chairlifts worked,” and it [...] "hit the sweet spot of cost and comfort," [...] said Kirby Gilbert, a ski historian.

To do so, we use a sample of 83 Application Specific Integrated Circuit firms <b>over</b> <b>the</b> period 1986 – 2005. We find that working with partners that are technologically similar improves innovative and market performance early on in <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> life cycle. Working with partners that are technologically dissimilar improves innovative and market performance later on in <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> life cycle. These results indicate that innovating firms have to change their partnership from technologically similar towards technologically dissimilar <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} knitted {{garments}} is an activity shared by knitwear designers (who are almost all young and female) and knitting machine technicians (who are almost all male and usually older). The process involves programming knitting machines using CAD systems, which {{are designed for}} and used by the technicians. The designers get much less training {{and access to the}} CAD systems than they want. This paper examines why this is, and what would be involved in creating a situation where the designers are empowered <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> of knitwear design. It concludes that the limitations of <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> cause this situation, which is reinforced by economic and attitudinal factors...|$|R
