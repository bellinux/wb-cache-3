5|$|Pressure {{from land}} {{development}} and an encroaching human population reduced {{the range and}} the number of the Kaimanawa horses, and in 1979 it was found that only about 174 horses remained. Starting in 1981, the Kaimanawa population, range size, and herd movements began to be officially measured, and a protected area was formed for the breed in the Waiouru <b>Military</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Area.</b> Legislative protection was similar to the kiwi and other native species. There was a rapid increase in the herd size following the protection of the breed, and 1,576 horses were known to exist in the area by 1994. There is also a small population of horses on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island, which is mostly unmanaged by the New Zealand government. In 2008, the Kaimanawa herds were the focus of a novel called Kaimanawa Princess, by Dianne Haworth.|$|E

Second, military activities create very heterogeneous habitat mosaic. This allows coexistence of many species with different ecological requirements. However, biota of <b>military</b> <b>training</b> <b>areas</b> is currently endangered due to abandonment by armed forces caused by downsizing national troops.

[...] However, President Eisenhower halted the operation a week before it occurred following two Oval Office meetings with senior military and civilian officials. [...] From the outset, the AEC opposed the operation. [...] AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss 'questioned the possible adverse public reaction'" [...] if the operation went ahead. Nonetheless, the Army prepared to have a Nike-Hercules battery at Eglin Air Force Base's Santa Rosa Island launch two missiles over the Gulf, each with different version of the W-31 nuclear charge, at a formation of three obsolete Air Force F-80 fighters converted into drones. [...] In the same exercise, the Air Force intended to have interceptors fire Genies at other unmanned aircraft. [...] Both the Army and Air Force were {{to make use of}} airspace ' horizontal distance from the nearest populated area' which had been a <b>military</b> <b>training</b> <b>area</b> for years and was routinely used to test Air Force weapons (albeit never nuclear arms). [...] On June 27, 1958, Lewis Strauss, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and others discussed the Eglin operation with President Eisenhower. [...] Strauss emphasized his belief that what he considered unnecessary tests of production nuclear arms might imperil future test activities he thought which were central to the AEC's mission. [...] Dulles and his deputy, Christian Herter, expressed concern that neighboring nations might react poorly to the operation. [...] Eisenhower decided that if the governments of Cuba or Mexico objected, 'the matter would have to be reconsidered.' [...] A month later, as test preparations proceeded, another White House meeting was convened. [...] Dulles reported to Eisenhower that 'consultations' with Cuba and Mexico led him 'to recommend strongly' that the nuclear operation be moved to the Pacific. [...] The president then 'approved transfer or cancellation' of the operation but requested 'some study of some combination of activities to accomplish the same objectives.' [...] While {{the military}} moved to continue the operation in Florida with conventional rounds, Public Health Service officials contacted their state-level counterparts, informed them of the nuclear test halt, expressed appreciation for 'complete cooperation,' and asked them to 'forget our activities in the area.' [...] The request was heeded. [...] There {{is no evidence that the}} 1958 test arrangements became known at the time." ...|$|E
