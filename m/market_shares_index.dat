Both significance and role of meat in providing the food security has been substantiated. An analysis of the dynamics and structure (both geographical and commodity) of production volumes, consumption, exports and imports of meat has been conducted. The major producers, consumers, exporters and importers of meat {{in the context of}} globalization have been identified. The country-based features, patterns of consumption and imports of meat have been characterized. On the basis of calculated five indicators of concentration (coefficient of concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, coefficient of relative concentration, dispersion of logarithms of <b>market</b> <b>shares,</b> <b>index</b> of the maximum share) the features of competition in the global market of producers and consumers of meat have been determined...|$|E

This paper develops an alternative spatial model, based upon the construction of orthopedic hospital service areas (HSA O s), and introduces indices {{for the analysis of}} patient streams in order to identify areas, irrespective of canton, with diverse characteristics, importance, needs, or demands. Methods HSA O s were constructed using orthopedic discharge data. Patient streams between the HSA O s were analysed by calculating three indices: the localization index (% local residents discharged locally), the netindex (the ratio of discharges of nonlocal incoming residents to outgoing local residents), and the <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>index</b> (% of local resident discharges of all discharges in local hospitals). Results The 85 orthopedic HSA O s show a median localization index of 60. 8 %, a <b>market</b> <b>share</b> <b>index</b> of 75. 1 %, and 30 % of HSA O s have a positive netindex. Insurance class of bed, admission type, and patient age are partially but significantly associated with those indicators.

Canned tuna is Ghana’s most important non-traditional export commodity in terms of foreign exchange earnings. The main focus of this thesis is to analyze the performance of Ghanaian canned tuna export to the EU - 27 market. Performance is {{measured in terms of}} Ghana’s competitiveness relative to the performance of other exporting countries; namely, Cote d’ Ivoire, Ecuador, Madagascar and Thailand. The competing countries are all leading exporters of canned tuna and were chosen to reflect regional balance and different trading and tariff systems in the EU market.

To infer competitiveness from the changes in export value over time, a first- level Constant <b>Market</b> <b>Share</b> (CMS) analysis was used to decompose the changes in export value into a structural effect, competitive effect and second-order effect. To augment this technique, an empirical analysis on the determinants of the Ghana’s canned tuna export was conducted using the Armington trade model by OLS regression on monthly data from January 1999 – December 2009, with quantity <b>market</b> <b>share</b> as the dependent variable. The results of the indices of specialization, shows that, Ghana has comparative advantage in the export of canned tuna to the EU - 27 throughout the study period. In terms of competitiveness, Ghana’s <b>market</b> <b>share</b> value has declined over the study period. Judging by the operational definition of competitiveness, Ghana has been less competitive. The CMS decomposition of changes in export values indicates that the changes in export value of Ghana can be attributed to structural effect (growth of the market) mainly. The results of the regression analysis indicate that, price ratio, the level of specialization and trade policy effect have statistically significant effect on the quantity <b>market</b> <b>share</b> of Ghana...|$|R
