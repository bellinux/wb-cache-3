500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the reasons I did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E
2500|$|An example {{sentence}} {{used in some}} Dutch {{language courses}} and textbooks is [...] "Ik kan mijn pen niet vinden omdat het veel te donker is", which translates into English word for word as [...] "I can <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> not find because it far too dark is", but in standard English word order would be written [...] "I cannot find <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> because it is far too dark". If the sentence is split into a main and subclause and the verbs highlighted, the logic behind the word order can be seen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1957, Maria Pia de Bragança wrote Mémoires d'une infante vivante (Memoirs of a Living Infanta) {{published}} in Paris by Del Duca. This work, written in French and published {{under the name}} [...] "Maria Pia de Saxe-Cobourg Bragance", is an autobiography. It marks the first attempt of Maria Pia to receive widespread public recognition for her claim {{that she was the}} bastard daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal. In the book, however, Maria Pia makes no claim to any dynastic rights. The book closes with the sentence, [...] "I claim no sceptre but <b>my</b> <b>pen,</b> no crown but that bequeathed by my father and mother: my dignity." [...] Instead, Maria Pia de Bragança suggests that the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne should be Princess Isabelle d’Orléans, eldest child of Henri, comte de Paris.|$|E

Perkins described the situation on Haiti in his official letters to the Admiral.

2500|$|Zinaida {{started writing}} poetry {{at the age}} of seven. By the time she met Dmitry Merezhkovsky in 1888, she was already a {{published}} poet. [...] "By the year 1880 I was writing verses, being a great believer in 'inspiration', and making it a point never to take <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> away from paper. People around me saw these poems as a sign of my being 'spoiled', but I never tried to conceal them and, of course, I wasn't spoiled at all, what with my religious upbringing," [...] she wrote in 1902 in a letter to Valery Bryusov. A good-looking girl, Zinaida attracted a lot of attention in Borzhomi, but Merezhkovsky, a well-educated introvert, impressed her first and foremost as a perfect kindred spirit. Once he proposed, she accepted him without hesitation, and never came to regret what might have seemed a hasty decision.|$|E
2500|$|When Dulness chooses her new king, she {{settles on}} Bays, who {{is seen in}} his study {{surveying}} his own works: [...] "Nonsense precipitate, like running Lead,/ That slip'd thro' Cracks and Zig-zags of the Head" [...] (I 123–4) and [...] "Next, o'er his Books his eyes began to roll,/ In pleasing memory of all he stole" [...] (B I 127–8). [...] The base of Cibber's pile of sacrificed books is several commonplace books, which are the basis of all his own productions. Although Cibber confesses [...] "Some Daemon stole <b>my</b> <b>pen...</b> And once betray'd me into common sense," [...] he prays to Dulness for inspiration, insisting that [...] "Else all my Prose and Verse were much the same;/ This, prose on stilts; that, poetry fall'n lame" [...] (I 187–90). The accidental common sense was The Careless Husband. [...] When Cibber casts about for new professions, he, unlike Theobald in 1732, decides, [...] "Hold-to the Minister I more incline;/ To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine" [...] (I 213–4). The [...] "minister" [...] is Robert Walpole, an extremely unpopular Whig leader, and the [...] "queen" [...] is both Dulness and Queen Caroline of Hanover, who was a Tory enemy for her reconciliation of George II with Walpole. When the new king is about to burn his books in despair, Pope heightens the religious imagery, for Cibber says to his books, [...] "Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets;/ While all your smutty sisters walk the streets" [...] (I 229–30), and it is better that they be burned than that they be wrapped in [...] "Oranges, to pelt your Sire" [...] (I 236).

2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain.

2500|$|James Melville {{studied at}} Montrose in 1569 {{under the tutelage}} of Mr Andrew Milne. Melville rehearsed Calvin's Catechisms and read Virgil's Georgics amongst other works. He used these words to {{describe}} his years of instruction: [...] " [...] The maister of the scholl, was a lerned, honest, kynd man, whom also for thankfulness I name, Mr. Andro Miln. I never got a stroke of his hand; howbeit, I committed twa stupid faults, as it were with fire and sword :—Having the candle in my hand, on a winter night, before six o'clock, in the school, sitting in the class, bairnly and negligently playing with the bent, with which the floor was strewed, it kindled, so that we had much ado to put it out with our feet. The other was being molested by a condisciple, who cut the strings of <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> and ink-horn with his pen-knife I aiming with my pen-knife to his legs to fley him he feared, and lifting now a leg and now the other, rushed on his leg upon my knife, and struck himself a deep wound in the shin of the leg, which waa a quarter of a year in curing. In the time of the trying of the matter, he saw me so humble, so feared, so grieved, yield so many tears, and by fasting and mourning at the school all day, that he said he could not find in his heart to punish me farther. But my righteous God let me not slip that fault, but gave me a warning, and remembrance what it was to be denied with blood, although negligently; for within a short space, after I had caused a cutler, newly come to the town, to polish and sharp the same pen-knife, and had bought a pennyworth of apples, and cutting and eating the same in the links, as I put the slice in my mouth, I began to lope up upon a little sand brae, having the pen.knife in my right hand, I fell, and struck myself, missing my belly, an inch deep in the inward side of the left knee, even to the bean, whereby the equity of God's judgment, and my conscience struck me so, that I was the more wary of knives all my days." ...|$|E
60|$|And, dipping <b>my</b> <b>pen</b> in the ink-horn, I {{began to}} write.

In a few moments it was done, and I tossed the pen aside. I took up the sandbox.|$|E
60|$|I {{have had}} three {{different}} servants since my trouble came upon me, {{and not one}} has seen him. Is the verdict of their senses right? And is that of mine wrong?
