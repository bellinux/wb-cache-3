5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and {{among those who have}} had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{debate whether}} Smilodon was social. One study of African predators found that social predators like lions and spotted hyenas respond {{more to the}} {{distress}} calls of prey than solitary species. Since S.fatalis fossils are common at the La Brea Tar Pits, and were likely attracted by the distress calls of stuck prey, this could mean that this species was social as well. One critical study claims that the study neglects other factors, such as body mass (heavier animals are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck than lighter ones), intelligence (some social animals, like the American lion, may have avoided the tar because they were better able to recognize the hazard), lack of visual and olfactory lures, the type of audio lure, {{and the length of}} the distress calls (the actual distress calls of the trapped prey animals would have lasted longer than the calls used in the study). The author of that study ponders what predators would have responded if the recordings were played in India, where the otherwise solitary tigers are known to aggregate around a single carcass. The authors of the original study responded that though effects of the calls in the tar pits and the playback experiments would not be identical, this would not be enough to overturn their conclusions. In addition, they stated that weight and intelligence would not likely affect the results as lighter carnivores are far more numerous than heavy herbivores and the social (and seemingly intelligent) dire wolf is also found in the pits.|$|E

40|$|In the {{literature}} on youth well-being and outcomes, the concept of future planning has become critically important. Future planning is not only necessary to avert risks in an increasingly individualized society but is also central to a society where tradition wanes and choices proliferate. This thesis examines the factors associated with the plans of Year 8 students for the year after they leave school. Using survey data from young people who participated in wave 1 of a large (N= 6, 536) longitudinal dataset in Queensland, Australia, this study explores a wide-range of plan choices. The majority of previous research on young people’s plans focuses on students who intend to go to university and considers all students with plans other than university as a homogenous group. This thesis expands on previous research, by examining a plurality of plan choices, including plans to: get a job; participate in Vocational and Educational Training (VET); take a gap year; or, join the armed forces as well as university. Young people who had ‘other’ plans or who reported they ‘don’t know’ what they planned to do were also included as separate groups. A multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the seven plan categories in the dependent variable. The results suggest significant variation in the individual factors related to the plans young people have. Overall, students who were of higher socioeconomic backgrounds, female and not born in Australia were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> plan to attend university. Furthermore, students who planned to go to university and students who planned to take a gap year had similar socioeconomic backgrounds. However, students of higher socioeconomic background who reported that school was important to them, or reported a higher intelligence were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> plan to go to university than take a gap year. Interestingly, {{the results suggest that}} young people who reported that they ‘don’t know’ what they planned to do had many similar characteristics to young people who plan to take a gap year (e. g., gender, self-reported intelligence). Students with lower socioeconomic backgrounds were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job or participate in VET programs. However, boys were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> plan to participate in VET and girls were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a job.

25|$|Rheumatic fever {{may occur}} {{following}} an {{infection of the}} throat by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. If the infection is untreated rheumatic fever can occur in up to three percent of people. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the production of antibodies against a person's own tissues. Due to their genetics, some people are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the disease when exposed to the bacteria than others. Other risk factors include malnutrition and poverty. Diagnosis of RF is often based {{on the presence of}} signs and symptoms in combination with evidence of a recent streptococcal infection.|$|E

It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover. Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems. Some types of HPV can cause genital warts, penile cancer, or anal cancer. MSM and men with compromised immune systems are more likely than other men to develop anal cancer.

25|$|The {{feedback}} from social situations affect a crayfish's {{ability to perform}} a tail flip. Serotonin levels are affected by social status. High levels are associated with aggressive behavior {{and a reduction in}} the frequency of tail flips performed. This is because the excitability of the LGI is decreased. Aggressive dominant males have a moderate reduction in tail flips while the subordinates have a much lower occurrence of tail flips. This presents a paradox since this means that subordinates are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> killed. However, it was found that subordinates are more likely to use non-giant-mediated escape, indicating that the reduction in tail flips and enhancement of non giant escape is adaptive.|$|E

25|$|Second-impact {{syndrome}} disproportionately affects teenagers. All documented cases {{occurred in}} people younger than 20 except in boxing.

25|$|The {{baseball}} behaves {{differently in}} those stadiums with artificial turf as well. Artificial surfaces are harder and more uniform than grass, {{and the ball}} tends to roll farther and straighter, and to bounce truer and more highly on these fields. Teams built to play {{the majority of their}} games on this field tend to place a higher premium on defence (since it is <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an infield out) and speed (since {{it is more important to}} be able to beat out a throw) than on power hitting. The altitude of the stadium (most notably Coors Field) can also impact the distance a batted ball travels and the amount of ball movement a pitcher can generate with his deliveries, although recently balls have begun being placed in humidors at high-altitude parks to negate these effects. The amount of moisture in the dirt on the basepaths can also affect the behaviour of ground balls and the ease with which players may steal bases; some teams are known to alter the amount of watering done to the dirt depending on the skills of the home and visiting team. The amount of foul territory is also an important variable, since foul pop-ups that would be outs in some parks (e.g. the Oakland Coliseum) may end up in the stands in other parks, thereby allowing the batter to remain at the plate (e.g. Fenway Park and Coors Field). On the whole, though, these variations do not produce effects as great as variations in cricket pitches, with one arguable exception being Coors Field.|$|E
25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene are far <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

Such beliefs may hold important implications for the content and targeting of health promotion campaigns. METHODS. A survey of smokers and ex-smokers was conducted in western Sydney, Australia. Six hypotheses were tested. RESULTS. The principal findings were (1) that 27. 9 % of smokers and 42. 1 % of ex-smokers agreed that smokers were <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than non-smokers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> five smoking-related diseases; (2) that for 11 of 14 beliefs tested, more smokers than ex-smokers agreed to a statistically significant degree; (3) that the median number of such beliefs agreed to by smokers was five, compared with three for ex-smokers; (4) that for only 5 of 14 beliefs was agreement expressed by more precontemplative smokers than smokers contemplating or taking action to quit; (5) that more than one in four smokers, despite agreeing that smokers are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than non-smokers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> five diseases, nonetheless maintain a set of self-exempting beliefs. CONCLUSIONS. Fewer smokers than ex-smokers accept that smoking causes disease, and smokers also maintain more self-exempting beliefs. Becoming an ex-smoker appears to involve shedding such beliefs in addition to accepting information about the diseases caused by smoking...|$|R
