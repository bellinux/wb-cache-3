40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{induction}} machine speed control is considered. Most previous works considered the machine <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic</b> to be linear and the flux reference to be constant. Specifically, the constant flux reference is chosen in the elbow {{zone of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Doing so, the machine operation mode is not optimal in presence of small loads. In the present work, a new speed control strategy is developed that accounts for the saturation feature of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic</b> making possible the generation of optimal flux references. Flux optimality guarantees satisfactory machine performances (efficiency, power factor, maximal torque, [...] .). The obtained flux reference {{turns out to be}} a function of the machine state variables. Then, a speed controller is designed using the backstepping technique. The originality of the presented control design is twofold: (i) the <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic</b> nonlinearity makes the machine model highly nonlinear, (ii) the flux reference signal is state-dependent. The performances of the developed control strategy are formally analysed and their supremacy with respect to the standard control solution is illustrated through a simulation study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{controlling}} induction machine speed {{has generally been}} dealt with using standard models i. e. those {{based on the assumption}} that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic</b> is linear. In coherence with this assumption, most control strategies involved rotor flux regulation around a fixed nominal value. As a matter of fact, optimal performance operation (e. g. maximal efficiency, maximal torque, unitary power factor [...] .) are not achievable using constant flux reference especially when facing wide range load variations. But, control strategies involving wide range flux reference variations can not be obtained without accounting for the nonlinearity of the machine <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic.</b> In the present work, we propose a new speed control strategy based on a new machine model that accounts for the <b>magnetic</b> <b>characteristic</b> hysteresis and saturation. A speed controller is designed using a nonlinear design technique.
