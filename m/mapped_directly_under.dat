50|$|An attractor's {{basin of}} {{attraction}} is {{the region of}} the phase space, over which iterations are defined, such that any point (any initial condition) in that region will eventually be iterated into the attractor. For a stable linear system, every point in the phase space is in the basin of attraction. However, in nonlinear systems, some points may <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> or asymptotically to infinity, while other points may lie in a different basin of attraction and map asymptotically into a different attractor; other initial conditions may be in or <b>map</b> <b>directly</b> into a non-attracting point or cycle.|$|R
