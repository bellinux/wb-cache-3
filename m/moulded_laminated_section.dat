A new chronology based on varve counts, 14 C-datings and heavy metal history has been established, covering the last 9400 years. Based on multiple varve counting on two core sequences, the easily countable <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> spans about 7850 varve years (modelled age range c. 9430 to 1630 cal. BP). Not all of the record is of the same quality but approximately 69 % of the varves sequence is classified to be of high quality and only c. 5 % of low quality. The new chronology suggests dates generally c. 260 years older than previously assumed for the <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> of the record. The implications for the vegetation and land-use history of the region as well as revised datings for pollen stratigraphical events are discussed.

Such sensors, certainly for cyclic loading conditions with high amplitudes, are not available. Pseudoelastic shape memory alloys are used to realise high performance strain sensors with high elasticity. These sensors can be elastically strained up to 80, 000 µm/m. In cyclic loading conditions strain levels or amplitudes of about 20, 000 µm/m are possible. The high elasticity stems from the stress-induced phase transformation of the SMA. This phase transformation involves a comparably strong specific electrical resistivity change together with long elastic strain variations.

The MLVOPs were manufactured separately with three different veneer arrangements namely S 100 % (each ply came from the superior part), SS-CI (surface superior and core inferior) and S-I (alternate superior and inferior parts). The veneers {{were divided into two}} groups. One group of veneers was bonded with urea formaldehyde (UF) resin to MLVOPs and the other was bonded with phenol formaldehyde (PF). The veneers were pressed at a temperature of 110 ºC for 20 min. The pressures applied to press the veneers to MLVOPs were 1500 psi, 2000 psi and 2500 psi.

40|$|Conformal cooling {{channels}} {{follow the}} cavity shape and {{can provide a}} better cooling performance in injection <b>moulds.</b> <b>Laminated</b> tooling {{is one of the}} techniques for manufacturing injection moulds with conformal cooling systems. A laminated tool is made by stacking metal sheets of varying thicknesses from which pre–calculated profiles have been cut. The stacked sheets result in a jagged die surface that has to be finished before use. Although larger number of small thickness sheets result in small irregularities that can be finished easily, it increases the cost of profile cutting process. Therefore, one of the issues in laminated tooling is determination of sheet thicknesses so that the laminated die can be made optimally. In this paper, an optimization method is presented to find the best size of the various laminas based on CAD model surface geometry such that the surface jaggedness and the number of slice is reduced at the same time. The final mould is fabricated based on suggested optimization method. It is then tested to show the improvement in cooling performance as compared to the same die with conventional cooling channels.

40|$|Thick <b>laminate</b> <b>sections</b> can {{be found}} from the tip to the root in most common wind turbine blade designs. Obtaining {{accurate}} and reliable design data for thick laminates is subject of investigations. Due to the poor thermal conductivity properties of composites and the material self-heating that occurs during the fatigue loading, high temperature gradients may appear through the laminate thickness. In the case of thick laminates in high loads regimes, the centre section temperature might exceed the material operational range, leading to premature failures. In the present work a method to forecast the self-heating of thick laminates in fatigue loading is presented. The mechanical loading is related with the laminate self-heating, via the cyclic energy strain and the energy loss ratio. Based on this internal volumetric heat load a thermal model is built and solved the get the temperature distribution in the transient state. Based on experimental measurements of the energy loss factor for 10 mm coupons, the method is described and the resulting predictions are compared with experimental surface temperature measurements on 10 and 30 mm UD thick laminate specimens.

40|$|In recent years, the {{compression}} moulding of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, in the University of Nottingham, {{a number of}} studies have been carried out, trying to correlate moulding parameters with mechanical properties and microstructural void content. However, some aspects of commingled composites have received less coverage so far and are therefore dealt with in this paper. These concern the effect of the processing conditions of these materials on interlaminar shear strength and impact properties and the influence of the synergy between processing, microstructure and properties on the impact performance of commingled composite structures. With this aim, flat plaques of E-glass/polypropylene commingled composites with a different fibre architecture (two-and three-dimensional) were non-isothermally compression moulded under various moulding conditions and then tested. The test programme included falling weight impact tests with a staircase procedure, Charpy impact tests and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) tests. To evaluate the consolidation of the laminates, void content measurement using optical microscopy was related to ILSS and impact test results. In particular, the specific issues arising in <b>moulding</b> <b>laminates</b> with added three-dimensional fibres were studied. These include correct placement of the tow, sufficient preheating of thick laminates and nesting of the layers during moulding.

The methods of segregating veneers quality were defined. The superior veneers were obtained by peeling the billets until their diameters left approximately 12 inches, meanwhile the inferior veneers were obtained by further peeling the same billets used for obtaining superior veneers until their diameters left 4 inches. The mean densities for superior veneer as well as inferior veneer were about 478. 8 kg/m 3 and 385. 1 kg/m 3 respectively.   The mean moisture content of both superior and inferior veneers was approximately 11 %. The veneers were arranged with 5 layers into three types of moulded shapes of furniture components namely i) 100 % S ii) alternate S and I and iii) surface S & core I.

Freeze-cores were analysed from three lakes in southeastern Baffln Island: Upper Soper Lake, Ogac Lake and Winton Bay Lake. The sediment record in each lake consists of massive sediments overlain by an organic-rich, finely <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> which continues to the surface. The laminae in Ogac Lake were studied in detail and consist of two types. The light layers are composed almost entirely of intact diatom frustules, primarily Chaetoceros spp. The darker layers are dominated by clay and silt-sized terrigenous mineral grains, including abundant quartz and feldspars. These couplets are probably deposited {{as the result of}} diatom blooms in the late spring/summer growing season followed by settling of grains introduced by summer runoff. Sedimentation rates based on 21 ~ dates agree well with rates based on laminae counts in both Ogac and Winton Bay Lakes, indicating that the laminae couplets are annually deposited varves. Our experience suggests that shallow-silled tidewater lakes with varved sediments may be relatively common along the coast of Batiin Island.

At a centennial scale coccolith assemblages indicate low primary production in the basin from 35 to 11. 5 ka B. P., whereas the Holocene is characterized by high-productivity conditions. This pattern demonstrates {{the influence of the}} glacial-interglacial cycles on productivity and, by inference, on the nutrient supply by the upwelling cell off Point of Conception. On a shorter scale, laminations associated with Dansgaard-Oeschger events appear to be due to an injection of poorly oxygenated waters in the deepest part of the basin rather than anoxia due to high primary production. A seasonal sampling in seven <b>laminated</b> <b>sections</b> (spanning from 20 to 220 years) extracted from Holocene, Bølling-Allerød, and Dansgaard-Oeschger event 3 indicates El Niño probably existed continuously during the last 28 ka.

Composite materials {{in the form of}} plate or plate-like structures are widely used in wind turbine blades and ship building due to its high specific strength and stiffness. For high thermal applications, Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are used in preference to laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal field. The pre-twisted cantilever plates have major use in turbine blades, fan blades, compressor blades, chopper blades, marine propellers and chiefly in gas turbines. These structures are often subjected to thermal environments, and hence FGMs are a good alternative to metal plates. The present work deals with the study of buckling analysis of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates. The analysis is done by using ANSYS, and the results are validated using ABAQUS.

Extrapolating this chronology dated the <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> of the core, between 723 and 881 mm, to {{the first half of the}} 18 th century and this section was selected for detailed study. The thicknesses of the laminae were measured using reflecting and polarizing microscopes whilst geochemistry was determined by an electron probe. The thickness of the dark layers was found to be positively correlated with titanium concentrations, and negatively correlated with aluminium and potassium concentrations. The thickness of the light layers was found to be negatively correlated with the concentrations of titanium. It is concluded that the dark layers were deposited from the Fushui River, a tributary of the Yangtze River, under periods of normal flow whilst the light layers were mainly deposited from the Yangtze River itself during flood periods. Documentary evidence for floods occurring in the lake catchment corresponded with thick laminations of high titanium concentration. Further, two of the three thickest, light laminations with low titanium concentrations were found to be synchronous with recorded flood dates of the main Yangtze River in its Middle Reaches, but one was synchronous with a local drought. These data suggest that the lake sediment provides an archive of the relative water levels of the Yangtze and Wanghu including floods of both the main Yangtze River and the local hydrological regime. <br/...|$|R

Gravity cores collected from within the OMZ north of 24 °N did not contain laminated surface sediments even though bottom water oxygen (BWO) concentrations were close to 5 µmol/kg. However, many of the cores collected south of 24 °N did contain millimeter- to centimeter-scale, brown to black laminations in Holocene and older sediments but not in sediments deposited during the Last Glacial Maximum. In addition to the dark laminations, Holocene sediments in Soledad Basin, silled at 290 m, also contain white coccolith laminae that probably represent individual blooms. Two open margin cores from 430 and 700 m depth that were selected for detailed radiocarbon dating show distinct transitions from bioturbated glacial sediment to laminated Holocene sediment occurring at 12. 9 and 11. 5 ka, respectively. The transition is delayed and more gradual (11. 3 - 10. 0 ka) in another dated core from Soledad Basin. The observations indicate that bottom-water oxygen concentrations dropped below a threshold for the preservation of laminations at different times or that a synchronous hydrographic change left an asynchronous sedimentary imprint due to local factors.

40|$|The use of fibre-reinforced {{polymer matrix}} {{composite}} materials {{is growing at}} a faster rate than GDP in many countries. An improved understanding of their processing and mechanical behaviour would extend the potential applications of these materials. For unidirectional composites, it is predicted that localised absence of fibres is related to longitudinal compression failure. The use of woven reinforcements permits more effective manufacture than for unidirectional fibres. It has been demonstrated experimentally that compression strengths of woven composites are reduced when fibres are clustered. Summerscales predicted that clustering of fibres would increase the permeability of the reinforcement and hence expedite the processing of these materials. Commercial fabrics are available which employ this concept using flow-enhancing bound tows. The net effect of clustering fibres is to enhance processability whilst reducing the mechanical properties. The effects reported above were qualitative correlations. Gross differences in the appearance of <b>laminate</b> <b>sections</b> are apparent for different weave styles. For the quantification of subtle changes in fabric architecture, the use of automated image analysis is essential. Griffm used Voronoi tessellation to measure the microstructures of composites made using flow-enhancing tows. The data was presented as histograms with no single parameter to quantify microstructure. This thesis describes the use of automated image analysis for the measurement of the microstructures of woven fibre-reinforced composites, and pioneers the use of fractal dimensions as a single parameter for their quantification.

Although several analytical models and design approaches exist in literature, various aspects complicate their real out-of-plane response, especially in presence of 2 (or more) layer <b>laminated</b> glass <b>sections.</b> In the paper, analytical, numerical and experimental predictions for the elastic critical loads of several PVB and SG laminated glass beams subjected to well-defined temperature and load-time conditions are compared. At the same time, the accuracy of existing analytical formulations for the prediction of their typical load-lateral displacement path is checked with large series of test predictions...|$|R

40|$|The use and {{applications}} of composites are expanding these days. Due to light weight,high specific strength and stiffness,composite materials are being widely {{used as a}} part of wind turbine blades and ship building. For high temperature applications,Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are preferred over laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal field. Chopper blades, turbine cutting blades,marine propellers,compressor blades, fan shape blades,and mostly gas turbines use pre-twisted cantilever plates. Often they are subjected to thermal environments,and thus FGMs are a decent option to metal plates. Composite structures with cut-outs are usually employed in engineering structures. In structural components cut-outs are provided sometimes to lighten the structure and for proper ventilation. Cut-outs in aircraft components (for example,fuselage,ribs and wing spar) are required for inspection,access,fuel lines and electric lines or to minimize the general weight of the aircraft. Study of buckling of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates with and without holes and with varying applied in-plane loads is dealt in the present work. The analysis is carried out by using ANSYS. An element having six degrees of freedom per node SHELL- 281 is used. The FGM plate is assumed to be a <b>laminated</b> <b>section</b> containing a number of layers with a steady variation of the material property through the thickness,where each layer is taken as isotropic. Material properties in each layer are determined using power law. Results obtained from convergence studies, carried out by using 12 number of layers and 12 by 12 mesh, are found to be quite accurate. Buckling behavior of cantilever twisted FGM plates with and without cut-outs and for different non-uniform applied in-plane loads are studied for the effect of various parameters like material gradient index,aspect ratio, side to thickness ratio, diameter of cut-outs and twist angle...|$|R
