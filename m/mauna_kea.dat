5|$|Lava {{flows from}} <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> {{overlapped}} in complex layers {{with those of}} its neighbors during its growth. Most prominently, <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> is built upon older flows from Kohala to the northwest, and intersects the base of Mauna Loa to the south. The original eruptive fissures (rift zones) in the flanks of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> were buried by its post-shield volcanism. Hilo Ridge, a prominent underwater rift zone structure east of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> was once {{believed to be a}} part of the volcano; however, it is now understood to be a rift zone of Kohala that has been affected by younger <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> flows.|$|E
5|$|The Saddle Road, {{named for}} its {{crossing}} of the saddle-shaped plateau between <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> and Mauna Loa, was completed in 1943, and eased travel to <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> considerably.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> in {{tropical}} Hawaii. There {{is evidence of}} past subglacial eruptive activity on the volcano {{in the form of}} a subglacial deposit on its summit. The eruptions originated about 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, when the summit of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> was covered in ice.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Of these five volcanoes, <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey has {{assessed}} the extinct Kohala as a low-risk area. The volcano is in zone 9 (bottom risk), while {{the border of}} the volcano with <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> is zone 8 (second lowest), as <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> has not produced lava flows for 4,500 years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> Ice Age Reserve on the {{southern}} summit flank of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> was established in 1981. The reserve is a region of sparsely vegetated cinder deposits and lava rock, including areas of aeolian desert and Lake Waiau. This ecosystem is a likely haven for the threatened uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis) and also {{the center of a}} study on wēkiu bugs (Nysius wekiuicola).|$|E
5|$|<b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> {{coastline}} {{is dominated}} by the Hamakua Coast, an area of rugged terrain created by frequent slumps and landslides on the volcano's flank. The area includes several recreation parks including Kalopa State Recreation Area, Wailuku River State Park and Akaka Falls State Park.|$|R
5|$|Contact with Americans and Europeans in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of clinical trials {{have focused on}} applications in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, particularly the detection and characterisation of pre-cancerous lesions. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea’s</b> Cellvizio has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance and a European CE Mark {{for use in the}} GI and pulmonary tracts. Research studies have suggested a large range of potential applications, including in the urinary tract, head and neck, ovaries, and lungs. Commonly used fluorescent stains include topically applied acriflavine, and intravenously administered fluorescein sodium.|$|R

5|$|<b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> {{has been}} the site of {{extensive}} archaeological research since the 1980s. Approximately 27percent of the Science Reserve had been surveyed by 2000, identifying 76shrines, 4adze manufacturing workshops, 3other markers, 1positively identified burial site, and 4possible burial sites. By 2009, {{the total number of}} identified sites had risen to 223, and archaeological research on the volcano's upper flanks is ongoing. It has been suggested that the shrines, which are arranged around the volcano's summit along what may be an ancient snow line, are markers for the transition to the sacred part of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea.</b> Despite many references to burial around <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> in Hawaiian oral history, few sites have been confirmed. The lack of shrines or other artifacts on the many cinder cones dotting the volcano may be because they were reserved for burial.|$|E
5|$|Plant species {{found at}} this {{elevation}} include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage {{reduced to a}} population of just 50 plants, <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> silversword {{was thought to be}} restricted to the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.|$|E
500|$|The Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge {{is a major}} koa {{forest reserve}} on <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> {{windward}} slope. It was established in 1985, covering [...] of ecosystem remnant. Eight endangered bird species, twelve endangered plants, and the endangered Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) have been observed in the area, in addition to many other rare biota. The reserve has been {{the site of an}} extensive replanting campaign since 1989. Parts of the reserve show the effect of agriculture on the native ecosystem, as much of the land in {{the upper part of the}} reserve is abandoned farmland.|$|R

50|$|With conservationists {{demanding}} {{protection of}} <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> ecosystem, plans {{were made to}} fence off 25% of the forests from foreign influence, and leave the remaining 75% under the same regulations. This plan was met by extreme opposition from conservationists, who questioned the effectiveness of such a plan as well as where {{the money for the}} fence, an expensive project, would be found. While the land was partitioned as planned, no money was allocated for the building of the fence. During these wranglings, the federal Endangered Species Act was passed. The National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal laws of conservation.|$|R
5|$|The last {{eruption}} of <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> was about 4,600 years ago (about 2600 BCE); {{because of this}} inactivity, <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> is assigned a United States Geological Survey hazard listing of 7 for its summit and 8 for its lower flanks, out of the lowest possible hazard rating of 9 (which {{is given to the}} extinct volcano Kohala). Twenty percent of the volcano's summit has seen lava flows in the past 10,000 years, and its flanks have seen virtually no lava flows during that time.|$|E
5|$|There {{are over}} 3,000 {{registered}} hunters on Hawaii island, and hunting, for both recreation and sustenance, {{is a common}} activity on <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea.</b> A public hunting program is used to control the numbers of introduced animals including pigs, sheep, goats, turkey, pheasants, and quail. The <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> State Recreation Area functions as a base camp for the sport. Birdwatching is also common at lower levels on the mountain. A popular site is Kīpuka Pu'u Huluhulu, a kīpuka on Mauna Kea's flank that formed when lava flows isolated the forest on a hill.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{accounts}} of foreigners visiting Hawaii {{before the arrival}} of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with Europe and America had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.|$|E
40|$|<b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> NASA IRTF {{has been}} used to obtain 21 - and 32 -cm radiometric {{measurements}} of Uranus and Neptune; brightness temperatures of 54. 1 + or - 0. 3 K for Uranus and 58. 1 + or 0. 3 K for Neptune were obtained by calibrating the 21 -cm data against Alpha Boo. A calibration of the 32 -cm data against Callisto and Ganymede yielded respective temperatures of 51. 8 + or - 1. 5 K and 55. 6 + or - 1. 2 K. The general decrease of brightness temperatures with wavelength from 20 to 30 microns is confirmed. The two planets are noted to appear as bodies sufficiently different to depart from the hypothesis of smooth planetary bulk property variation as a function of heliocentric distance...|$|R
5|$|This early era was {{followed}} by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century. Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long-term welfare of the environment. These ahupuaa generally {{took the form of}} long strips of land oriented from the mountain summits to the coast. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> summit was encompassed in the ahupuaa of Kaohe, with part of its eastern slope reaching into the nearby Humuula. Principal sources of nutrition for Hawaiians living on the slopes of the volcano came from the māmane–naio forest of its upper slopes, which provided them with vegetation and bird life. Bird species hunted included the uau (Pterodroma sandwichensis), nēnē (Branta sandvicensis), and palila (Loxioides bailleui). The lower koa–ōhia forest gave the natives wood for canoes and ornate bird feathers for decoration.|$|R
5|$|A band of ranch land on <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui. With the collapse of the sugar industry in the 1990s, much of this land lies fallow but portions are used for cattle grazing, small-scale farming and the cultivation of eucalyptus for wood pulp.|$|R
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} concerning Kepler-9c's mass were refined by follow-up observations {{made by the}} Keck 1 Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory at <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> Hawaii. Keck {{was able}} to confirm that Kepler-9c and Kepler-9b were planets that were slightly smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} for Kepler-9b's mass were refined by the W. M. Keck Observatory at <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> Hawaii. In doing so, scientists found that Kepler-9b is {{the larger of}} the two gas planets discovered in the Kepler-9 system, although in mass it is smaller than planet Saturn.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b's initial {{discovery}} by Kepler was re-examined {{by scientists}} at the W.M. Keck Observatory at <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> Hawaii; the McDonald Observatory in west Texas; the Palomar and Lick Observatories in California; the MMT, WIYN, and Whipple Observatories in Arizona; and the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands.|$|E
5000|$|The TMT {{project is}} a {{response}} to a recommendation in 2000 from the US National Academy of Sciences that a thirty-meter telescope be the top priority and be built within the decade. Urgency in construction is due to the competitive nature of science with the European-Extremely Large Telescope also under construction. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea's</b> summit is the most sacred of all the mountains in Hawaii to many, but not all, Native Hawaiian people. Hawaiian cultural practitioners cite impacts to indigenous cultural practice, while recreational users have argued that construction harms the scenic view plane. Some environmentalists are concerned that irreparable ecological damage may be done by construction, although this has been disputed by other environmental advocates. All three groups are represented among the petitioners opposing the TMT. According to the State of Hawaii law HAR 13-5-30, the eight key criteria must be met before construction be allowed on conservation lands in Hawaii. Among other criteria, the development may not [...] "cause substantial adverse impact to existing natural resources within the surrounding area, community, or region,” and the [...] "existing physical and environmental aspects of the land must be preserved or improved upon." ...|$|R
500|$|Menzies made a third {{attempt to}} summit Mauna Loa in February 1794. This time the {{botanist}} consulted King Kamehameha I for advice {{and learned that}} he could take canoes {{to the south and}} follow the ʻAinapō Trail, not knowing of its existence beforehand. Significantly better prepared, Menzies, Lieutenant Joseph Baker and Midshipman George McKenzie of the Discovery, and a servant (most likely Jonathan Ewins, listed on the ship's muster as [...] "Botanist's L't") reached the summit, which Menzies estimated to be [...] high {{with the aid of a}} barometer (consistent with a modern value of [...] ). He was surprised to find heavy snow and morning temperatures of , and was unable to compare the heights of <b>Mauna</b> Loa and <b>Kea</b> but correctly supposed the latter to be taller based on its larger snow cap. The feat of summitting Mauna Loa was not to be repeated for forty years.|$|R
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|In Hawaiian mythology, {{the peaks}} of the island of Hawaii are sacred. An ancient law allowed only {{high-ranking}} aliʻi to visit its peak. Ancient Hawaiians living {{on the slopes of}} <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> relied on its extensive forests for food, and quarried the dense volcano-glacial basalts on its flanks for tool production. When Europeans arrived in the late 18th century, settlers introduced cattle, sheep and game animals, many of which became feral and began to damage the mountain's ecological balance. <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> can be ecologically divided into three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a Sophora chrysophylla–Myoporum sandwicense (or māmane–naio) forest on its flanks, and an Acacia koa–Metrosideros polymorpha (or koa–ōhia) forest, now mostly cleared by the former sugar industry, at its base. In recent years, concern over the vulnerability of the native species has led to court cases that have forced the Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources to eradicate all feral species on the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E
5|$|In pre-contact times, natives {{traveling}} up <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> {{were probably}} guided more by landscape than by existing trails, as {{no evidence of}} the latter has been found. It is possible that natural ridges and water sources were followed instead. Individuals likely took trips up Mauna Kea's slopes to visit family-maintained shrines near its summit, and traditions related to ascending the mountain exist to this day. However, very few natives actually reached the summit, because of the strict kapu placed on it.|$|E
5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, {{to give them the}} strength of the mountain. Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores, where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Settlement {{expanded}} inland to the Mauna Loa – <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea</b> region in the 12th and early 13th centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that these regions were used for hunting, collecting stone material, and possibly for spiritual reasons or for astronomical or navigational observations. The mountain's plentiful forest provided plants and animals for food and raw materials for shelter. Flightless birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source.|$|E
5|$|The highest forested zone on the volcano, at an {{elevation}} of , is dominated by māmane (Sophora chrysophylla) and naio (Myoporum sandwicense), both endemic tree species, and is thus known as māmane–naio forest. Māmane seeds and naio fruit are the chief foods of the birds in this zone, especially the palila (Loxioides bailleui). The palila was formerly found {{on the slopes of}} <b>Mauna</b> <b>Kea,</b> Mauna Loa, and Hualālai, but is now confined to the slopes of Mauna Kea—only 10% of its former range—and has been declared critically endangered.|$|E
