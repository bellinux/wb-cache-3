40|$|Tyrosine {{phosphorylation}} {{has been}} implicated in growth-cone guidance through genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological studies. Adapter proteins containing src homology 2 (SH 2) domains and src homology 3 (SH 3) domains provide a means of linking guidance signaling through phosphotyrosine to downstream effectors regulating growth-cone motility. The Drosophila adapter, Dreadlocks (Dock), the homolog of mammalian Nck containing three N-terminal SH 3 domains and <b>a</b> single <b>SH</b> 2 domain, is highly specialized for growth-cone guidance. In this paper, we demonstrate that Dock can couple signals in either <b>an</b> <b>SH</b> 2 -dependent or <b>an</b> <b>SH</b> 2 -independent fashion in photoreceptor (R cell) growth cones, and that Dock displays different domain requirements in different neurons...|$|R
40|$|Recessive {{mutations}} of MYO 15 A encoding unconventional myosin XVA {{are associated}} with sensorineural deafness in both humans (DFNB 3) and the shaker 2 phenotype in mice, which are deaf and exhibit circling behavior due to a vestibular abnormality.

Theoretically, <b>an</b> omnidirectional <b>SH</b> 0 transducer phased array {{system can be}} used to inspect defects in a large plate in the similar manner to the phased array transducers used in medical B-scan ultrasonics.

Each PZT element can produce face-shear deformation under applied voltage, resulting in circumferential shear deformation in the OSH-PT and omnidirectional SH waves in the hosting plate. Both finite element simulations and experiments were conducted to examine the performance of the proposed OSH-PT. Experimental testing shows that the OSH-PT exhibits good omnidirectional properties, on matter it is used as <b>a</b> <b>SH</b> wave transmitter or <b>a</b> <b>SH</b> wave receiver.

40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} thiol {{cross-linking}} and {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) to resolve structural transitions of myosin's light chain domain (LCD) and catalytic domain (CD) {{that are associated with}} force generation. Spin labels were incorporated into the LCD of muscle fibers by exchanging spin-labeled regulatory light chain for endogenous regulatory light chain, with full retention of function. To trap myosin in a structural state analogous to the elusive posthydrolysis ternary complex A. M′. D. P, we used pPDM to cross-link SH 1 (Cys 707) to SH 2 (Cys 697) on the CD. LCD orientation and dynamics were measured in three biochemical states: relaxation (<b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> T), <b>SH</b> 1 -SH 2 cross-linked (A. M′. D. P analog), and rigor (<b>A.</b> <b>M.</b> D). EPR showed that the LCD of cross-linked fibers has an orientational distribution intermediate between relaxation and rigor, and saturation transfer EPR revealed slow rotational dynamics indistinguishable from that of rigor. Similar results were obtained for the CD using a bifunctional spin label to cross-link SH 1 -SH 2, but the CD was more disordered than the LCD. We conclude that SH 1 -SH 2 cross-linking traps a state in which both the CD and LCD are intermediate between relaxation (highly disordered and microsecond dynamics) and rigor (highly ordered and rigid), supporting the hypothesis that the cross-linked state is an A. M′D. P analog on the force generation pathway...|$|R
