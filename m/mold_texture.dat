This article will introduce 3 D laser processing technology to the mold industry, based on the laser etching principle on the metal surface, etch processing {{can be made in}} the mold surface. Through theoretical derivation from the 3 D laser scanning optical system, the 3 D laser scanning hardware system is structured to apply in the mold cavity texturing, the control algorithm has been studied, and finally in the developed laser-etch machine the texturing experimental is performed on the injection molds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasingly micro {{technology}} {{becomes more}} important {{in order to develop}} new products with high added value. These new technologies known as micro allow us manufacturing precision components; these new micro components should work and take carrying out the functions previously performed by larger parts. Microinjection is one of these new technologies. This has the capacity to produce parts, for different materials both plastic and metal and for some industries and applications. The main objective in this paper is to determine the replicate microtextures capability for plastic injection molds. For our samples, ABS plastic is injected into four aluminum cavities with different laser textures performed in, using different technologies to get them. In order to analyze how <b>mold</b> <b>texture</b> affects parts, optical interferometry technique was selected to measure it. The superficial topography obtained was processed using MountainsMapTM software, {{in order to get the}} replicability of injected parts. It has also been used an electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate the mold textures and injected parts in a photographically way...|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} force {{developed in the}} demolding phase of the micro injection molding process is mainly determined by mold surface finish, which affects the tribological phenomena occurring at the polymer-tool interface. In this work, the effects on the ejection force of two cavity surfaces machined with different technologies (viz. micro milling and micro electro discharge machining), but with similar value of Ra, were investigated. The relations between different surface topography parameters and the ejection force were then analyzed, {{in order to identify}} the parameters that most appropriately describe the friction at the polymer-tool interface. The experimental results showed the strong interactions between the <b>mold</b> surface <b>texture</b> and the micro injection molding process parameters that promote the replication, such as mold temperature and holding pressure. The different machining technologies generated two <b>mold</b> <b>textures</b> that have a similar value of Ra, but their influence on friction can be properly described only using several other surface topography parameters...|$|R

The parts are usually test fitted, then sanded and painted to represent the intended finish or look. Model makers are required to recreate many faux finishes like brick, stone, grass, <b>molded</b> plastic <b>textures,</b> glass, skin and even water.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} ohmic and in-container {{sterilization}} process {{on the safety}} and quality attributes of cannellini beans in liquid was investigated. Each 100 g of the product under examination contained 53 g of beans, previously subjected to soaking in tap water for 12 h and then pre-heated at 70 °C, and 43 g of sodium chloride solution (1 g/ 100 ml). The solid-liquid mixture was sterilized at 121 °C for 10, 15 and 20 min in either autoclave or in a 15 kW batch ohmic system. The parameters measured immediately before and after thermal treatments were: total microbial count, yeasts and <b>molds,</b> <b>texture</b> (hardness and split degree), and chemical composition (moisture, ash, fat, proteins and carbohydrates). The experimental results have shown that, regardless the thermal method and treatment conditions the initial microbial spoilage was reduced up to below the detection limit of the method (< 10 cfu/ml). When compared to the beans sterilized by conventional treatment, the samples treated by the ohmic method appeared of attractive appearance, with interesting firmness properties and a lower split degree. The analyses of the chemical composition revealed a higher proteins concentration in sample processed by ohmic heating than those treated by conventional method...|$|R
50|$|Mold etching In the 1920s a mold-etch {{process was}} invented, in which art was etched {{directly}} into the mold, so that each cast piece emerged from the <b>mold</b> with the <b>texture</b> already {{on the surface of}} the glass. This reduced manufacturing costs and, combined with a wider use of colored glass, led to cheap glassware in the 1930s, which later became known as Depression glass.|$|R
50|$|So-called {{blue cheese}} {{is created by}} inoculating a cheese with Penicillium roqueforti or Penicillium glaucum. This is done while the cheese {{is still in the}} form of loosely pressed curds, and may be further {{enhanced}} by piercing a ripening block of cheese with skewers in an atmosphere in which the mold is prevalent. The mold grows within the cheese as it ages. These cheeses have distinct blue veins, which gives them their name and, often, assertive flavors. The molds range from pale green to dark blue, and may be accompanied by white and crusty brown <b>molds.</b> Their <b>texture</b> can be soft or firm. Some of the most renowned cheeses are of this type, each with its own distinctive color, flavor, texture and aroma. They include Roquefort, Gorgonzola and Stilton.|$|R
40|$|Rosella calyxes (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) have {{antioxidant}} activity. To be {{more practical}} and efficient in its use, it was formulated into hard molded lozenges. This study was aimed to formulate hard molded lozenges of rosella calyxes {{with the addition}} of a combination of corn syrup and mannitol and to evaluate the physical quality of the lozenges. The combination of corn syrup and mannitol are prepared in ratio of 1 : 4, 1 : 5, 1 : 6, and 1 : 7. The physical properties evaluation of the hard molded lozenges included organoleptic, texture (hardness and stickiness), moisture content, ash content, and the number of reducing sugar. The hardness of the lozenges in each formula were 1302. 1 gf, 1523. 9 gf, 2033. 2 gf, and 3038. 1 gf, respectively. The adhesiveness of the lozenges in each formula were - 198. 3 gf, - 138. 7 gf, - 121. 2 gf, and - 73. 9 gf, respectively. It can be concluded that the addition of combination of corn syrup and mannitol increased the hardness and decreased the adhesiveness of preparation.

40|$|Off bottom {{oyster culture}} is clearly {{superior}} to any bottom oed techniques, however it sufferes from {{the lack of}} a satisfactory cultch material. The recent practice by a large scale commercial Dyster aquafarm of using hand punched scallop shells strung on a 1 / 8 " nylon cord has resulted in estimated losses of 25 - 30 % due to 3 hell fracture and cord breakage. Drilling was investigated as a possible means of increasing useful shell processing and decreasing post-stringing losses. Based on laboratory experiments, a 1 / 8 " steel drill bit operated at 1328 rpm was found to be more efficient than either 1 / 4 " or 7 / 8 " drill bits operated at any speed. A net processing time of 20 shells per ninute with a processing loss of 6. 3 % was possible using the 1 / 8 " bit and drilling the shells one at a time. Group processing was considered, increasing successful output to 25. 7 shells per minute with a processing loss of 18. 9 %. A polypropylene-crushed scallop shell composite was also con-sidered as a possible cultch and tests were made for abrasion and spat fall attraction. Abrasion was found to be of little importance, Spat fall was concluded to be a function of time after <b>molding</b> and surface <b>texture.</b> A commercially acceptable set was obtained in the laboratory by soaking the cultch in a 10 % solution of fresh oyster shell liquor for three hours prior to 24 hour exposure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCounterfeit {{integrated}} circuits {{become a big}} challenge for the whole electronic industry. The use of electronic counterfeits can cause reduced performance of circuits, {{or failure of the}} whole system. New efficient approaches of counterfeit device detection are always required. Since the electromagnetic emission level of integrated devices depends on various circuit parameters like technology, manufacturing and aging, the electromagnetic emission measurement could be an approach to detect the counterfeit. In this article, the principles of the methodology are explained and two case studies are presented, where three ways of analysis of data are discussed. 1. Introduction An electronic counterfeit is a device whose material, performances, or characteristics are knowingly misrepresented by the vendor, supplier, distributor, or manufacturer [1]. In recent years, there are a growing number of reported incidents related to counterfeit {{integrated circuits}} (ICs) [2] with the huge increase of global semiconductor market. The use of electronic counterfeits can cause reduced performance of circuits, such as instability of clock frequency, operating life decrease, a lower storage memory space, or failure of the whole system. The Alliance for Gray Market and Counterfeit Abatement estimates that nearly 10 percent of technological products sold in the global market are counterfeit, which represents about 100 billion dollar loss for the electronics companies every year [3]. Three major techniques exist to produce counterfeit circuits: remarking components as a higher grade and more expensive chip, re-packaging old devices up to non-qualified components, and duplicating counterfeits through inferior parts or materials [4]. The struggle against this problem relies in a better management of the supply chain and the market [5], the development of advanced authentication methods (e. g. watermarking [6]) and serialization technologies (e. g. 2 -D bar code [4]). Besides, industry always looks for non-destructive, rapid and cheap method to detect the electric counterfeit. At present, a large number of detection techniques exist and are already used by industry and detection laboratories: visual inspection of the appearance of component (<b>texture,</b> <b>mold</b> mark, pitch form…) in order to detect raw counterfeit devices, decapsulation to verify the die layout, material analysis methods, like fluorescent X-ray or C-mode scanning acoustic microscope for package analysis, and different levels of electrical testing (V/I characteristics, ESD test, operation life test…) [7]...|$|R
