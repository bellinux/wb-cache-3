He also gained <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> {{as a leader of}} a regional militia during the civil war fought between the transition from Sui to Tang. Su was a general with <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> in Central Asia, and was familiar with the culture of the steppes. He had been in contact with military leaders from the region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655. The Turkic general Ashina Zhong, second cousin of Ashina She'er, was another commander in attendance.|$|E

5|$|At Kruger's {{suggestion}} Joubert {{was elected}} Commandant-General of the restored republic, {{though he had}} little <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> and protested he was not suited to the position.

The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in that they both had past <b>military</b> <b>experience.</b> Their positive relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to {{the view}} here popularized by Cassius Dio, however, Nerva had in fact little choice with regard to his successor. Faced with a major crisis, he desperately needed {{the support of a}} man who could restore his damaged reputation. The only {{candidate}} with sufficient <b>military</b> <b>experience,</b> consular ancestry, and connections was Trajan. Likewise, Edward Gibbon's assertion that Nerva hereby established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good Emperors has found little support among modern historians.|$|E

During that conflict he participated in the battle of Kaniów on 14 April 1596, and in the siege of the Cossack tabor near Lubny. In 1599, he was appointed the Elder (starost) of Samogitia.|$|E

5|$|Kagame and Rwigyema {{joined the}} NRA {{primarily}} to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They {{also had a}} long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> {{would enable them to}} fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the Luwero Triangle, fought the Ugandan army for the next five years, even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d'état and the start of peace talks.|$|E
40|$|The wars in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF) have engendered {{a growing}} {{population}} of US female veterans, with women now comprising 15 % of active US duty military personnel. Women {{serving in the}} military come under direct fire and experience combat-related injuries and trauma, and are also often subject to in-service sexual assaults and sexual harassment. However, little is known regarding how women veterans cope with these combat and <b>military</b> sexual trauma <b>experiences</b> once they return from deployment. To better understand their experiences, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nineteen OEF/OIF women veterans between January-November 2009. Women veterans identified stressful <b>military</b> <b>experiences</b> and post-deployment reintegration problems as major stressors. Stressful <b>military</b> <b>experiences</b> included combat <b>experiences,</b> <b>military</b> sexual trauma, and separation from family. Women had varying abilities to address and manage stressors, and employed various cognitive and behavioral coping resources and processes to manage their stress...|$|R

5|$|Lilly {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} {{commanding}} officer of his battery from August 1862 until the winter of 1863, when his three-year enlistment expired. His only prior <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> had been in a Lafayette, Indiana, militia unit. Several of his artillerymen considered him too young and intemperate to command; however, despite his initial inexperience, Lilly became a competent artillery officer. His battery was instrumental in several important battles, including the Battle of Hoover's Gap in June 1863 and in the Second Battle of Chattanooga and the Battle of Chickamauga in September 1863.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and technical manuals, and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|Morton asked Harrison if {{he could}} help recruit a regiment, {{although}} he would not ask him to serve. Harrison recruited throughout northern Indiana to raise a regiment. Morton offered him the command, but Harrison declined, as he had no <b>military</b> <b>experience.</b> He was initially commissioned as a captain and company commander on July 22, 1862. Governor Morton commissioned Harrison as a colonel on August 7, 1862, and the newly formed 70th Indiana was mustered into Federal service on August 12, 1862. Once mustered, the regiment left Indiana to join the Union Army at Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|Many {{programs}} handle {{aspects of}} their individual programs differently from other States.

5|$|Orphaned {{at the age}} of seven, Wiśniowiecki {{was raised}} by his uncle, Konstanty Wiśniowiecki, whose branch of the family were Roman Catholics. Jeremi {{attended}} a Jesuit college in Lwów and later, in 1629, he traveled to Italy, where he briefly attended the University of Bologna. He also acquired some <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> in the Netherlands. The upbringing by his uncle and the trips abroad polonized him, and turned him from a provincial Ruthenian princeling into one of the youngest magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|The three {{infantry}} classes {{may have}} retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, {{but at least}} officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men would serve in the first line, older men with some <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> would serve in the second line, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience would serve in the third line.|$|E
5|$|When Kentucky's {{neutrality}} was breached in September 1861, Hawes fled to Virginia {{to escape}} imprisonment by Federal authorities. While there, he enlisted as a brigade commissary under Confederate general Humphrey Marshall {{and was given}} the rank of major. Though his ability to obtain supplies for Marshall's brigade was commendable given the difficult conditions, his age (64) and lack of <b>military</b> <b>experience</b> lessened his value to Marshall's unit, and his predilection for jumping {{the chain of command}} and communicating directly with Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin put him at odds with Marshall personally.|$|E
50|$|The <b>military</b> <b>experiences</b> of {{the crusades}} also had their effects in Europe; for example, European castles became massive stone {{structures}} {{as they were}} in the east, rather than smaller wooden buildings as they had typically been in the past.|$|R
30|$|Problematic alcohol uses among {{military}} personnel such as psychological impairment and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) were also noted following combat <b>military</b> <b>experiences.</b> Marines and Navy branches of military services {{were more likely}} to report heavy alcohol drinks (Schumm & Charad, n.d.).|$|R
