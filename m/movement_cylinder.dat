40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to study the}} roles of lateral cylinder oscillations and a uniform cross-flow in the vortex formation and wake modes of an oscillating circular cylinder. A circular cylinder is given lateral oscillations of varying amplitudes (between 0. 28 and 1. 42 cylinder-diameters) in a slow uniform flow stream (Reynolds number= 284) to produce the 2 S, 2 P and P+S wake modes. Detailed flow information is obtained with time-resolved particle-image velocimetry and the phase-locked averaging techniques. In the 2 S and 2 P mode, the flow speeds relative to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>movement</b> are less than the uniform flow velocity and {{it is found that}} initial formation of a vortex is caused by shear-layer separation of the uniform flow on the cylinder. Subsequent development of the shear-layer vortices is affected by the lateral <b>cylinder</b> <b>movement.</b> At small <b>cylinder</b> oscillation amplitudes, vortices are shed in synchronization with the <b>cylinder</b> <b>movement,</b> resulting in the 2 S mode. The 2 P mode occurs at larger cylinder oscillation amplitudes at which each shear-layer vortex is found to undergo intense stretching and eventual bifurcation into two separate vortices. The P+S mode occurs when the cylinder moving speeds are, for most of the time, higher than the speed of the uniform flow. These situations are found at fast and large-amplitude cylinder oscillations in which the flow relative to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>movement</b> takes over the uniform flow in governing the initial vortex formation. The formation stages of vortices from the cylinder are found to bear close resemblance to those of a vortex street pattern of a cylinder oscillating in an otherwise quiescent fluid at Keulegan-Carpenter numbers around 16. Vortices in the inclined vortex street pattern so formed are then convected downstream by the uniform flow as the vortex pairs in the 2 P mode. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Hydrogen {{can not be used}} directly in a diesel engine due to its autoignition temperature higher than that of diesel fuel. One alternative method is to use hydrogen in enrichment or induction. To investigate the combustion characteristics of this dual fuel engine, a single cylinder diesel research engine was converted to utilize hydrogen as fuel.

At each load step the flow rate of hydrogen was varied. Fuel consumption, injector needle lift <b>movement,</b> and <b>cylinder</b> pressure were measured. Introducing hydrogen to the combustion chamber reduced the diesel fuel consumption. Indicated efficiency slightly increases with hydrogen enrichment at 15 Nm load.
