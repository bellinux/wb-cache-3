The first weekday service departs at 05:20 from Tweedbank with the last service leaving Edinburgh at 23:54. Departure times from Edinburgh are usually at 24 and 54 minutes past the hour, while from Tweedbank trains depart at 28 and 58 minutes past the hour; individual timings may vary by a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> The trains starting close to on the hour do not call at Stow except in the peaks and evenings; the Sunday service stops at Stow. Most services operate between Edinburgh and Tweedbank {{except for a few}} morning peak services that continue to Glenrothes with Thornton via the Fife Circle Line and a few evening peak services that originate at Glenrothes with Thornton.|$|E

25|$|The {{first time}} the U.S. Coast Guard found one {{containing}} drugs, authorities dubbed it Bigfoot because they had heard rumors that such things existed, but none had actually been seen. In late 2006 a Bigfoot was seized 145km southwest of Costa Rica carrying several metric tonnes of cocaine. In 2006, US officials say they detected three; in 2008, they were spotting an average of ten per month, but {{only one out of}} ten was intercepted. Few were seized, as their crews scuttle them upon interception and they sink within a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> By 2009, the U.S.A. detected as many as 60 narco submarine related events, and it was calculated that they were moving as much as 330 metric tonnes of cocaine per year.|$|E

25|$|The sundew genus (Drosera) {{consists}} of over 100 species of active flypapers whose mucilage glands are borne {{at the end}} of long tentacles, which frequently grow fast enough in response to prey (thigmotropism) to aid the trapping process. The tentacles of D. burmanii can bend 180° in a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Sundews are extremely cosmopolitan and are found on all the continents except the Antarctic mainland. They are most diverse in Australia, the home to the large subgroup of pygmy sundews such as D. pygmaea and to a number of tuberous sundews such as D. peltata, which form tubers that aestivate during the dry summer months. These species are so dependent on insect sources of nitrogen that they generally lack the enzyme nitrate reductase, which most plants require to assimilate soil-borne nitrate into organic forms.|$|E
25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched after a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) {{is a sign that}} the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a high fire hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Chelsea {{equalised}} twelve {{minutes before}} the end, after a flowing move, from which Osgood scored with a diving header from a Charlie Cooke cross. Jackie Charlton should have been marking Osgood but had 'lost' him whilst chasing Hutchinson to exact retribution for a deadleg administered in the Chelsea penalty area a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> earlier. In scoring, Osgood became the last player to date to have scored in every round of the FA Cup. With the game ending 1–1, the final once again went into extra time. One minute before the first period of extra time was to end, Chelsea's Hutchinson sent in a long throw-in that missed almost every player in the penalty area but came off Charlton's head towards the far post, before being put into the unguarded net by Webb to give Chelsea the lead {{for the first time}} in the two games. They kept the lead until the end, securing their first FA Cup win.|$|E

Reviewing the season premiere, Mark McGuire of The Times Union wrote: [...] "...the first <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of the resurrected Family Guy {{ranks among the}} funniest 60 seconds I've seen so far this season." [...] The Pitt News reviewer John Nigro felt that the show had not lost its steam while it was on hiatus, and was surprised that the show had been canceled because of its [...] "wildly extravagant shock factor". Nigro cited [...] "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do", [...] "Petarded" [...] and [...] "Perfect Castaway" [...] as the season's best episodes. In 2007, BBC Three named the episode [...] "PTV" [...] "The Best Episode...So Far". The episode has also been praised by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, who called it [...] "Family Guys most rebellious outing yet". The Boston Globe critic Matthew Gilbert felt Family Guys fourth season was as [...] "crankily irreverent as ever".|$|E

[...] Bevil interviewed several park guests; comments included [...] "I thought it [...] was really cool" [...] and [...] "it's beautiful", and some described it as better than the attractions it replaced. Barbara Nefer of Examiner.com said that guests would love Puck, the ride's central character. She preferred the wild version of the ride, describing it as [...] "actually still very family friendly" [...] and saying that the exhibit was a [...] "huge highlight" [...] of the attraction. Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider agreed that {{the highlight of the}} attraction was the penguin exhibit. Niles described the dispatch procedure as crucial to the ride: [...] "if SeaWorld can dispatch a quartet of ride vehicles every <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> as designed, fans will find this a fun ride". In a later article Niles highlighted some guests' criticisms of the ride, describing it as [...] "lacking an engaging story and not delivering enough on-ride views of the attraction's stars -- SeaWorld's penguins". However, he argues that SeaWorld's promotions were too photorealistic creating [...] "expectations for an experience that the ride did not deliver, perhaps setting up many of those visitors for disappointment".|$|E

The billows move slowly, and can be characterized {{using a variety of}} methods from the ground, or by examining the GPS signals themselves. By broadcasting this information to GPS receivers every <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> this source of error can be significantly reduced.|$|E

Previously, when the show's final hour aired on ESPN2, a segment titled ESPN Dos Minutos would air, where Stugotz and Mike Ryan would review the show, but Dos Minutos ended when ESPNU re-gained the final hour of the show. Because of a difference in commercial lengths between the TV simulcast and radio show, the TV simulcast typically airs flashback moments or highlights from the local hour at the return from commercials.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prohibition}} of stunning {{and the treatment}} of the slaughtered animal expressed in shechita law limits the extent to which Jewish slaughterhouses can industrialize their procedures. The most industrialized attempt at a kosher slaughterhouse, Agriprocessors of Postville, Iowa, became the center of controversy in 2004, after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a gruesome undercover video of cattle struggling to their feet with their tracheas and esophagi ripped out after shechita. Some of the cattle actually got up and stood for a <b>minute</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> after being dumped from the rotating pen. Dr. Temple Grandin, told Mason City, Iowa's Globe Gazette, [...] "I thought it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. … I've seen kosher slaughter really done right, so the problem here is not kosher slaughter. The problem here is a plant that is doing everything wrong they can do wrong." [...] While Agriprocessors has been criticized by both secular and Jewish organizations for both its human and animal rights violations, the Jewish Orthodox Union (OU) made note {{to point out that the}} kashrut of a product is not contingent upon [...] "the conditions in which it is produced. [...] The OU's condonation of Agriprocessors as a possibly inhumane, yet appropriately glatt kosher company has led to discussion as to whether or not industrialized agriculture has undermined the place of halakha (Jewish law) in shechita as well as whether or not halakha has any place at all in Jewish ritual slaughter.|$|E
