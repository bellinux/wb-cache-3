60|$|There was {{a certain}} truth in Holsten's {{assertion}} that the law was 'hundreds of years old.' It was, in relation to current thought and widely accepted ideas, an archaic thing. While almost all the <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of life had been changing rapidly and were now changing still more rapidly, the law-courts and the legislatures of the world were struggling desperately to meet modern demands with devices and procedures, conceptions of rights and property and authority and obligation that dated from the rude compromises of relatively barbaric times. The horse-hair wigs and antic dresses of the British judges, their musty courts and overbearing manners, were indeed only the outward and visible intimations of profounder anachronisms. The legal and political organisation of the earth in the middle twentieth century was indeed everywhere like a complicated garment, outworn yet strong, that now fettered the governing body that once it had protected.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not recall}} that I gave my play an hour's {{consecutive}} work {{at any time}} after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things to do. There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever way I tried I came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet of this substance beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, and all the <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of war, and from that to shipping, locomotion, building, every conceivable form of human industry. The chance that had brought me into the very birth-chamber of this new time--it was an epoch, no less--was one of those chances that come once in a thousand years. The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded. Among other things I saw in it my redemption as a business man. I saw a parent company, and daughter companies, applications to right of us, applications to left, rings and trusts, privileges, and concessions spreading and spreading, until one vast, stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the world.|$|E

6000|$|Wellington used to {{say that}} too much was made of it, and that one would imagine that the British Army had never fought a battle before. It was a {{characteristic}} speech, but it must be admitted that the British Army never had, as a matter of fact, for many centuries fought a battle which was finally decisive of a great European war. There lies the perennial interest of the incident, that it was the last act of that long-drawn drama, and that to the very fall of the curtain no man could tell how the play would end--"the nearest run thing that ever you saw"--that was the victor's description. It is a singular thing that during those twenty-five years of incessant fighting the <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of warfare made so little progress. So far as I know, there was no great change in either between 1789 and 1805. The breech-loader, heavy artillery, the ironclad, all great advances in the art of war, have been invented in time of peace. There are some improvements so obvious, {{and at the same time}} so valuable, that it is extraordinary that they were not adopted. Signalling, for example, whether by heliograph or by flag-waving, would have made an immense difference in the Napoleonic campaigns. The principle of the semaphore was well known, and Belgium, with its numerous windmills, would seem to be furnished with natural semaphores. Yet in the four days during which the campaign of Waterloo was fought, the whole scheme of military operations on both sides was again and again imperilled, and finally in the case of the French brought to utter ruin by lack of that intelligence which could so easily have been conveyed. June 18th was at intervals a sunshiny day--a four-inch glass mirror would have put Napoleon in communication with Gruchy, and the whole history of Europe might have been altered. Wellington himself suffered dreadfully from defective information which might have been easily supplied. The unexpected presence of the French army was first discovered at four in the morning of June 15. It was of enormous importance to get the news rapidly to Wellington at Brussels that he might instantly concentrate his scattered forces on the best line of resistance--yet, through the folly of sending only a single messenger, this vital information did not reach him until three in the afternoon, the distance being thirty miles. Again, when Blucher was defeated at Ligny on the 16th, it was of enormous importance that Wellington should know at once the line of his retreat so as to prevent the French from driving a wedge between them. The single Prussian officer who was despatched with this information was wounded, and never reached his destination, and it was only next day that Wellington learned the Prussian plans. On what tiny things does History depend! ...|$|E

50|$|The textual {{evidence}} for similar <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> of construction as tabla comes from Sanskrit texts. The earliest discussion of tabla-like musical instrument building methods, including paste-patches, {{are found in}} the Hindu text Natyashastra. The Natyashastra also discusses how to play these drums. The South Indian text Silappatikaram, likely composed in the early centuries of 1st millennium CE, describes thirty types of drums along with many stringed and other instruments, but none of those drums are named tabla.|$|E

Little by little he began therefore todevelop and test new groups of exercises, first of all what he called [...] "Free Exercises," [...] or those which require either no apparatus at all, or only such as can be carried in the hands. They were intended to secure ready control and graceful carriage of the body under ordinary conditions, while the pupil was standing or walking on the usual supporting surface, and differed in this particular from the forms commonly practised on the old Turnplatz.|$|E
50|$|Exhibitions {{variously}} showed work {{by artists}} based in Africa; by artists using aesthetics typical to African traditions; by African artists {{living in the}} West but including aesthetics and topics related to their “roots”; traditional artworks related to customary practices such as rituals; and urban African art that reflects the modern experience of cultural pluralism and hybridity. Modernity as a colonial and postcolonial experience appears as an intrinsic and significant attribute in most conceptions of contemporary African art. Scholars and curators therefore have proposed {{a wide range of}} taxonomies that tried firstly to define what is African about this art, and secondly, the range of genres it covers. Diverse attempts to define particular genres of contemporary African art however mirrored the fascination of art scholars and curators for the appropriation of cultural elements assumed ‘Western’ into ‘African’ modes of expression and traditions. One example is Marshall W. Mount who proposed four categories: first, “survivals of traditional styles” which show continuities in traditional working <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b> such as bronze casting or wood carving; secondly, art inspired by Christian missions; thirdly souvenir art in the sense of tourist or airport art as defined later by Jules-Rossette; and finally, an emerging art requiring “techniques that were unknown or rare in traditional African art”. Valentin Y. Mudimbe in turn proposes to think of three currents rather than categories, namely a “tradition-inspired” one, a “modernist” trend, and “a popular art” whereby Mount’s categories would be situated somewhere “between the tradition-inspired and the modernist trend”. Similar to other categorizations, this proposal considers the education of the artists as well as the envisaged clientele/patrons as important factors for the respective “currents”. In the exhibition catalogue of Africa Explores (1991), curator Susan Vogel distinguished between “traditional art”, “new functional art”, “urban art”, “international art”, and “extinct art”. Rejecting these categories, collector André Magnin proposed to group similar works into sections named “territory”, “frontier” and “world” in his survey book Contemporary African Art, thus placing them into “imaginary maps”. However, this approach was also criticized by Dele Jegede with convincing arguments against its ethnocentric perspective. Amongst other, he pointed to the hubris of attempts to talk about art of a whole continent, but also to the common reflex to exclude Northern Africa in such considerations and to follow a global rather than “particularistic focus on the study of the art of the continent” that would provide more specific and deeper bodies of knowledge. In the 1990 exhibition Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition, the Studio Museum in Harlem tried to take the perspective of the presented artists and distinguished between African artists who refuse outside influences; African artists who adopt modes of Western art; and African artists who fuse both strategies.|$|E
