5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the <b>mustering</b> of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by <b>mustering</b> an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by <b>mustering</b> overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E

5|$|<b>Mustering</b> is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results {{in one of two}} major outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E
5|$|Options for {{population}} control include fertility control, ground and helicopter shooting, and <b>mustering</b> and trapping. None {{of the methods}} provide complete freedom from suffering for the horses, {{and the cost of}} each is very high. The costs include those that are economic, such as research, equipment purchases, and labour expenditures, as well as moral concerns over the welfare of the horses. As a result, more effective and efficient means of control have been called for.|$|E

5|$|Around 04:00 on June 25, the KPA's 5th Division {{began its}} first {{attacks on the}} ROK 10th Regiment's forward positions.

At this point, the ROK 8th Division, under heavy attack from the front and aware of attacks in the rear, urgently requested reinforcements.

5|$|By 1314, Robert the Bruce had recaptured {{most of the}} castles in Scotland {{once held}} by Edward, pushing raiding parties into {{northern}} England as far as Carlisle. In response, Edward planned a major military campaign {{with the support of}} Lancaster and the barons, <b>mustering</b> a large army between 15,000 and 20,000 strong. Meanwhile, Robert had besieged Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland; its English commander had stated that unless Edward arrived by 24 June, he would surrender. News of this reached the King in late May, and he decided to speed up his march north from Berwick to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly spearmen, prepared to prevent Edward's forces from reaching Stirling.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, Troglita fled to Iunci (modern Bordj Younga, 9km {{south of}} Mahares), where he began {{regrouping}} the survivors. The losses were so {{high and the}} army's morale so low, however, that he was soon forced to withdraw further north to the fortress of Laribus (the modern village of Lorbeus, near Le Kef), where he started <b>mustering</b> his army. Learning of the battle, Antalas immediately rose up again and joined the Tripolitanian tribes, while the Byzantines' allies, Cutzinas and Isfidaias, were quarreling among themselves. Throughout the remainder of 547, the Moors were free to raid across Africa, even reaching the vicinity of Carthage itself.|$|E

5|$|In August 1591, Maximilian of Habsburg, {{who still}} claimed Poland and Lithuania, sent his envoy to Andrew seeking Transylvanian support against Sigismund III.

In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule.

The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.|$|E

5|$|Active {{military}} service was a long-held dream for Pierce, who had admired his father's and brothers' service in his youth, particularly {{his older brother}} Benjamin's, {{as well as that}} of John McNeil Jr., husband of Pierce's older half-sister Elizabeth. As a legislator, he was a passionate advocate for volunteer militias. As a militia officer himself, he had experience <b>mustering</b> and drilling bodies of troops. When Congress declared war against Mexico in May 1846, Pierce immediately volunteered to join, although no New England regiment yet existed. His hope to fight in the Mexican-American War was one reason he refused an offer to become Polk's Attorney General. General Zachary Taylor's advance slowed in northern Mexico, and General Winfield Scott proposed capturing the port of Vera Cruz and driving overland to Mexico City. Congress passed a bill authorizing the creation of ten regiments, and Pierce was appointed colonel and commander of the 9th Infantry Regiment in February 1847, with Truman B. Ransom as lieutenant colonel and second-in-command.|$|E

Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.|$|E
