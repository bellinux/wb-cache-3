5000|$|The monitor hypothesis. This {{states that}} {{language}} {{knowledge that is}} consciously learned can only be used to <b>monitor</b> <b>output,</b> not to generate new language. Monitoring output requires learners {{to be focused on}} the rule and to have time to apply it.|$|E
50|$|The high {{resolution}} graphics and memory option board allowed an extra 128 KB of RAM {{to be added}} and included a TTL RGB <b>monitor</b> <b>output.</b> The option board could also be fitted with an IEEE-488 interface and an AMD 9511 or 9512 floating point coprocessor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} graphics cards {{have been}} reported as capable of supporting GeoWalls. Geowall.org says that [...] "on the most general level the graphics card needs to have two <b>monitor</b> <b>outputs</b> to provide output to left and right projector".|$|R

Later PAL versions have the 6502C processor.|$|E
50|$|As sending <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> {{through the}} network is {{bandwidth}} intensive, cards like MegaRAC use built-in video compression (versions of VNC are often used in implementing this).Devices like Dell DRAC also have a slot for a memory card where an administrator may keep server-related information independently from the main hard drive.|$|E
50|$|For a long time, editing xorg.conf was {{necessary}} for advanced input devices and multiple <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> to work correctly. In modern systems this is seldom necessary due to input hotplugging and the XRandR extension integrated into new X.org releases. Some devices still require manual editing, notably components utilizing proprietary drivers may require explicit configuration, in order for Xorg to load them.|$|E
40|$|Various {{examples}} {{are related to}} smart membranes for monitoring membrane based process such as, e. g., membrane distillation processes. In one example, a membrane, includes a porous surface and a plurality of sensors (e. g., temperature, flow and/or impedance sensors) mounted on the porous surface. In another example, a membrane distillation (MD) process includes the membrane. Processing circuitry can be configured to <b>monitor</b> <b>outputs</b> of the plurality of sensors. The <b>monitored</b> <b>outputs</b> {{can be used to}} determine membrane degradation, membrane fouling, or to provide an indication of membrane replacement or cleaning. The sensors can also provide temperatures or temperature differentials across the porous surface, which can be used to improve modeling or control the MD process...|$|R

50|$|A special {{board for}} {{converting}} Commodore 64 video signals to standard VGA <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> is also currently under development. Also a board {{to convert the}} Commodore 128's 80 column RGBI CGA-compatible video signal to VGA format was developed in late 2011. The board, named the C128 Video DAC, had a limited production run and was {{used in conjunction with}} the more widespread GBS-8220 board.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{feature is}} that the SiS 30x core supports two independent overlay surfaces, one for each output. This means {{that it is possible}} to view videos on both the primary monitor (e.g. the built in screen on a notebook) and on a TV-Out or secondary <b>monitor</b> <b>output.</b> Most other graphics cards only have one overlay surface or in some cases will clone the same overlay.|$|E

40|$|A failure {{detector}} which detects {{the failure of}} a dc to ac inverter is disclosed. The inverter under failureless conditions is characterized by a known linear relationship of its input and output voltages and by a known linear relationship of its input and output currents. The detector includes circuitry which is responsive to the detector's input and output voltages and which provides a failure-indicating signal only when the <b>monitored</b> <b>output</b> voltage is less by a selected factor, than the expected output voltage for the monitored input voltage, based on the known voltages' relationship. Similarly, the detector includes circuitry which is responsive to the input and output currents and provides a failure-indicating signal only when the input current exceeds by a selected factor the expected input current for the <b>monitored</b> <b>output</b> current based on the known currents' relationship...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s - 1990s, {{overhead}} projectors {{were used as}} part of a classroom computer display/projection system. A liquid-crystal panel mounted in a plastic frame was placed on top of the overhead projector and connected to the video output of the computer, often splitting off the normal <b>monitor</b> <b>output.</b> A cooling fan in the frame of the LCD panel would blow cooling air across the LCD to prevent overheating that would fog the image.|$|E
50|$|Monitor {{calibration}} on {{a computer}} is done preferably with a colorimeter and software that supports it. In most cases, a monitor profile created by the calibration software (whether it relies on a hardware device or on user input) includes both an accurate description of <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> and instructions to the video card to change the colors it displays. Video card lookup table (LUT) adjustments are usually required to help the display reach the white point and gamma desired by the user.|$|E
25|$|Monitoring {{of kidney}} function, by serial serum {{creatinine}} measurements and <b>monitoring</b> of urine <b>output,</b> is routinely performed.

40|$|In {{order to}} study photomultiplier's {{short-term}} gain stability at high counting rate, we constructed an LED pulsed light source and its <b>output</b> <b>monitor</b> system. For the monitor system, we employed a photon counting method using a photomultiplier as a monitor photon detector.

The optional data I/O accommodated, through HiPPi & HSDL I/Os, various formats and speeds from lower resolutions through 2048x1556, {{depending on the}} I/O. When using the Data mode, an analog RGBHV <b>monitoring</b> <b>output</b> allowed viewing of the otherwise invisible Data signals.|$|R
50|$|The Matrox G200 {{graphics}} processor {{had been a}} successful product, competing with the various 2D & 3D combination cards available in 1998. Matrox took the technology developed from the G200 project, refined it, and basically doubled it up to form the G400 processor. The new chip featured several new and innovative additions, such as multiple <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> support, an all-around 32-bit rendering pipeline with high performance, further improved 2D and video acceleration, and a new 3D feature known as Environment Mapped Bump Mapping.|$|E
50|$|Another {{connector}} extension {{was included}} for graphics cards. This extension {{was used for}} analog output from the video card, which was then routed through the system board to the system's own <b>monitor</b> <b>output.</b> The advantage of this was that Micro Channel system boards could have a basic VGA or MCGA graphics system on board, and higher level graphics (XGA or other accelerator cards) could then share the same port. The add-on cards were then able {{to be free of}} 'legacy' VGA modes, making use of the on-board graphics system when needed, and allowing a single system board connector for graphics that could be upgraded.|$|E
50|$|Being a {{non-commercial}} broadcaster, the BBC has {{no need to}} {{play out}} local commercial spots, thus a regional node will typically only output programme material during the local news. Rather than each region having to control or <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> that is being relayed from a central source, the region will {{step back from the}} network, allowing the central source to directly feed its transmitters. The central source is a national feed, which is complete in itself including all continuity, timing, announcement and programme elements. The region interposes to broadcast its element locally, in place of a programme in the national feed, by bringing itself into the network (cold-opt) in preparation {{for the start of the}} regional element (warm-opt).|$|E
40|$|We show, how {{polyglot}} persistence increase Kieker's scalability {{by employing}} separate read-optimized and write-optimized noSQL storage. For this purpose we extended Kieker to store its <b>monitoring</b> <b>output</b> in Apache Cassandra, {{which is a}} write-optimized wide-column noSQL database. For {{the analysis of the}} generated <b>monitoring</b> <b>output</b> we are using ElasticSearch, a read-optimized document store noSQL storage. We are interlinking read-optimized and write-optimized noSQL storage within our Regression Benchmarking Execution Environment (RBEE). To ensure scalability we are employing a container infrastructure. The mentioned noSQL storages and the linker are operating within one single Docker container which scales horizontally. For generating reference values, we instrumented a Java SE application with Kieker's file system writer and measured throughput and method's execution times. Consecutively, we instrumented the same Java SE application with our Apache Cassandra writer and measured throughput and method's execution time. Finally, we compared measurement results of Kieker's file system writer with the measurement results of our Apache Cassandra writer...|$|R

25|$|One {{might say}} {{the second stage}} of the {{amplifier}} is just a voltage follower, transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of R2. That is, the <b>monitored</b> <b>output</b> signal is really the voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view is legitimate, but then the voltage follower stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.|$|R
50|$|Voodoo3 cards render {{internally}} in 32-bit precision color depth. They {{then use}} a post filter within the RAMDAC to change to a 22-bit equivalent output that is close in quality to 32-bit color without 32-bit rendering's hardware demands. While Voodoo3's 16-bit output is superior to TNT2's 16-bit output, it lacks full 32-bit color support. It {{was very difficult to}} capture this 22-bit image because it was processed by the DAC, not by the 16-bit 3D hardware. Screenshot software captures from the framebuffer rather than the <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> and thus does not capture the 22-bit image. This is why many 16-bit quality comparisons between TNT2 and Voodoo3 erroneously regard TNT2 16-bit quality as close to Voodoo3 when in reality Voodoo3 16-bit quality was close to TNT2 32-bit quality. These errors worked in Nvidia's favour.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes cam {{versions}} {{are made by}} projectionists themselves, either for home use or to distribute (with or without profit). This provides several advantages: first, the projection booth window has a central, unobstructed view of the screen. Second, the projectionist can bypass the built-in microphone and link the camcorder directly to the <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> of the audio rack, resulting in a clear, well-separated stereo recording. The projectionist can also alleviate the frame rate conversion problem described above by speeding the projector up from film's traditional 24 fps to 25 fps and then use a standard PAL video camera to record the film picture. However, these advantages come {{at the price of}} higher risk: a projectionist, if caught, will almost certainly be dismissed, and is more likely than the typical audience member to face prosecution.|$|E
5000|$|The Falcon got 14 watts {{out of two}} 6V6 tubes (the same tubes used in the {{comparable}} Fender Deluxe), and had a Jensen 12" [...] speaker. The pre-amp was powered by three 6EU7 tubes, and a 7199 for the reverb circuit. Unlike Fender's later reverb amps (such as the Princeton Reverb), the Falcon had a fairly unusual placement of the reverb circuit: rather than being placed after the pre-amp section and having the wet signal mixed with the dry, the Falcon's reverb circuit taps the signal before the volume and tone control, and mixes it with the dry signal via independent volume controls. In addition, the Falcon had a separate <b>monitor</b> <b>output</b> at line level, to connect the amp to a separate [...] "Regular Amplifier" [...] (the Falcon being {{referred to in the}} brochures as [...] "Reverb Amplifier") and create a stereo effect.|$|E
40|$|Research {{presented}} in this paper shows that while a person is recalling a line diagram he can more readily signal information about that diagram by speaking than by spatially <b>monitored</b> <b>output</b> (e. g., pointing to correct items in a column of symbols). When recalling a sentence, he can more readily signal information about that sentence by spatially <b>monitored</b> <b>output</b> than by speaking. These results suggest that spatial and verbal information is recalled and processed in a modality-specific manner. Recall of verbal information is most readily disrupted by concurrent vocal activity; recall of spatial information is most readily disrupted by concurrent spatially monitored activity. This differential conflict occurs even though the concurrent activity is a recoding of the information that is being recalled. A PEBSON is asked to describe from memory a diagram such as a map or floor plan, he is likely to say that he generated a mental representation of the diagram and then derived his description from that. Even in the absence of vivid mental imagery, there is a clear impression tha...|$|R
