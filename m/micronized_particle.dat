40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to produce cromolyn sodium (CS) {{micrometric}} particles with controlled particle size (PS) and PS distribution (PSD) suitable for aerosol delivery, using a supercritical fluids-based process. CS was micronized using the supercritical assisted atomization (SAA) technique at different solute concentrations in water and different precipitation temperatures. Two techniques were used to measure PS and PSD of produced particles: scanning electron microscopy image analysis and laser scattering analysis. The 2 techniques were compared to provide a complete description of the powder obtained. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis was used to verify the absence of degradation of CS after micronization; differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray analysis were performed to study the effect of operative conditions on the crystalline structure and on the water content of SAA <b>micronized</b> <b>particles.</b> The CS particles obtained were spherical, with a volumetric percentage of particles with a diameter ranging between 1 and 5 µm of 50 % to 66 %.

Several mechanisms for particle dispersion in DPI have been considered; a proposed mechanism to explain the particle dispersion phenomenon is the active site theory.

40|$|Pulmonary {{administration}} of drugs presents several advantages {{in the treatment}} of many diseases. Considering local and systemic delivery, drug inhalation enables a rapid and predictable onset of action and induces fewer side effects than other routes of administration. Three main inhalation systems have been developed for the aerosolization of drugs; namely, nebulizers, pressurized metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). The latter are currently the most convenient alternative as they are breath-actuated and do not require the use of any propellants. The deposition site in the respiratory tract and the efficiency of inhaled aerosols are critically influenced by the aerodynamic diameter, size distribution, shape and density of particles. In the case of DPIs, since <b>micronized</b> <b>particles</b> are generally very cohesive and exhibit poor flow properties, drug particles are usually blended with coarse and fine carrier particles. This increases particle aerodynamic behavior and flow properties of the drugs and ensures accurate dosage of active ingredients. At present, particles with controlled properties are obtained by milling, spray drying or supercritical fluid techniques. Several excipients such as sugars, lipids, amino acids, surfactants, polymers and absorption enhancers have been tested for their efficacy in improving drug pulmonary administration.

The in vitro deposition of the micronized clarithromycin powders was evaluate by means of a Single-Stage Glass Impinger (SSGI; apparatus A, European Pharmacopoeia 8. 0), using a Turbospin® as device for the aersolization. True density measurements were performed by a helium pycnometer (Accupyc II 1340). Solubility measurements of raw and spray-dried drug were carried out at 37 °C in phosphate buffer (0. 05 M, pH 6. 8). Results. Morphology and aerodynamic properties of spray-dried particles were strongly influenced by organic solvent concentration and pH of the liquid feeds processed, both modifying drug solubility. Spherical particles and crystals were obtained at higher pH and lower organic solvent content, while wrinkled particles were obtained at lower pH values. Moreover, thanks to their shape, spray-dried powders from hydro-alcoholic solutions containing clarithromycin in its salt form, showed better aerodynamic properties. Conclusions. The clarithromycin inhalable powders containing the drug in its salt form, showed high water solubility and good aerodynamic properties, thanks to a fine-tuning of the process parameters and liquid feed composition, with no need to add any excipients...|$|R

One of the crucial steps in the therapeutic management of the respiratory disease could be the drug solubilization directly in this site of action. The aim {{of the study was to}} prepare respirable powders of clarithromycin, while improving drug aqueous solubility. With this aim, several batches of <b>micronized</b> <b>particles</b> were prepared by spray drying different feed solutions, varying the solvent composition (water/isopropyl alcohol ratio), the drug concentration and pH of the liquid feeds. Particle size distribution of raw materials and engineered particles was determined using a light-scattering laser granulometer while particle morphology was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. The in vitro deposition of the micronized clarithromycin powders was evaluated by means of a Single-Stage Glass Impinger using the RS 01 model 7 by Plastiape® as device for the aerosolization. Solubility measurements of raw and spray-dried (SD) drug were carried out at 37 °C in phosphate buffer (0. 05 M, pH 6. 8). Results indicate that morphology and aerodynamic properties of SD particles were strongly influenced by organic solvent concentration and pH of the liquid feeds processed, both modifying drug solubility. Spherical particles and crystals were obtained at higher pH and lower organic solvent content, while wrinkled particles with very interesting aerodynamic properties and higher drug solubility were obtained at lower pH values. Thanks to a fine tuning of the process parameters and liquid feed composition, we produced SD powders with good aerodynamic properties, without using any excipients. Furthermore, SD powders of clarithromycin hydrochloric salt showed higher activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth, compared to clarithromycin raw material...|$|R
40|$|In this {{four-year}} proposal, we aim {{to produce}} high value purified micron-nano bioactiveparticles, individually from propolis, rice bran and wine lees by using supercritical fluidscrystallization. Counter-current supercritical fluids extractive distillation and columnchromatography will be previously and subsequently employed to concentrate and isolatefunctional compounds from these raw materials. In the first year, phase equilibria and expansion coefficients of potential solventssolvated with supercritical fluids (carbon dioxide and propane) will be experimentallymeasured at elevated pressures. Then, batch supercritical anti-solvent (SAS) crystallizationswill be adopted to micronize bioactive compounds from propolis. The key controllingparameters of the SAS experiments including expanded temperature, expanded pressure,solvent type, solvent volume, pre-post expansion rate and substrate concentration will beinvestigated by means of analyses of quantification and particle size distribution through anexperimental design. In the second year, {{we aim to}} investigate continuous supercritical fluids crystallizationapplied to produce <b>micronized</b> <b>particles</b> of flavonoids, DHCA, and other active compoundsfrom propolis. In the mean time, isolation and purification of bioactive compounds usingcolumn chromatography {{will be carried out}} to obtain marker type standards having highpurity and high recovery. Afterwards, bioactive tests shall be done to examine thebioavailability of those purified precipitates. In the third and fourth year, production of nano-particles of 訕-oryzanol, phytic acid,inositol, amino acids individually from rice bran and wine lees, will be investigated by usingcontinuous supercritical fluids crystallization, counter-current supercritical fluids extractivedistillation, and packed column chromatography sequentially. Effects on growth inhibitionof cancer cells, anti-oxidation of human serum low density lipoprotein (LDL), anti-inhibitionof tyrosinase activity will be completely tested to examine the bioactivity of these purifiedprecipitates generated by batch and continuous supercritical fluid crystallizations.

40|$|Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are {{commonly}} used to deliver drugs to the lungs. The drug particles used in these DPIs should possess {{a number of key}} properties. These include an aerodynamic particle size 3 ̆c 5 μm and particle crystallinity for long term formulation stability. The conventionally used micronization technique to produce inhalation particles offers limited opportunities to control and optimize the particle characteristics. It is also known to induce crystalline disorder in the particles leading to formulation instability. Hence, this research project investigates and optimizes a solvent/anti-solvent crystallization process capable of directly yielding inhalation particles using albuterol sulfate (AS) as a model drug. Further, the feasibility of the process to produce combination particles of AS and ipratropium bromide monohydrate (IB) in predictable proportions and in a size suitable for inhalation is also investigated. The solvent / anti-solvent systems employed were water / ethyl acetate (EA) and water / isopropanol (IPA). Investigation and optimization of the crystallization variables with the water / EA system revealed that particle crystallinity was significantly influenced by an interaction between the drug solution / anti-solvent ratio (Ra ratio), stirring speed and crystal maturation time. Inducing a temperature difference between the drug solution and anti-solvent (Tdrug solution 3 ̆e Tanti-solvent) resulted in smaller particles being formed at a positive temperature difference of 65 °C. IPA was shown to be the optimum anti-solvent for producing AS particles (IPA-AS) in a size range suitable for inhalation. In vitro aerosol performance of these IPA-AS particles was found to be superior compared to the conventionally used <b>micronized</b> <b>particles</b> when aerosolized from the Novolizer®. The solvent / anti-solvent systems investigated and optimized for combination particles were water / EA, water / IPA, and water / IPA:EA 1 : 10 (w/w). IPA was found to be the optimum anti-solvent for producing combination particles of AS and IB with the smallest size. These combination particles showed uniform co-deposition during in vitro aerosol performance testing from the Novolizer®. Pilot molecular modeling studies in conjunction with the analysis of particle interactions using HINT provided an improved understanding of the possible interactions between AS and IB within a combination particle matrix...|$|R
40|$|The {{solid state}} {{properties}} of pharmaceutical compounds have a decisive impact on dosage form development, stability, and in vivo {{performance of the}} drug. Many pharma-ceutical drugs are problematic per se due to their inappropriate physical and mechanical properties and poor aqueous solubility. The micromeritic properties of drug particles, such as shape and size, are of essential importance for the formulation of solid high [...] dose units (1). The particle size of poorly soluble drugs is always an issue due to its im-pact on dissolution properties. <b>Micronized</b> drug <b>particles</b> (smaller than 10 mm) have a large specific area and provide a way to improve the dissolution rate (2), but high en-ergy input during the micronization process gives rise to increased free surface energy, electrostatic tendencies, and thus poor flowability and/or compressibility of powders and low bulk density (3), which makes them difficult to use in downstream processing in the pharmaceutical industry such as direct tablet-making or capsule-filling processes. In ad-dition, micronized drug substances tend to agglomerate {{and the increase in}} surface area is not always reflected in improved dissolution (4) ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} single-step pharmaceutical particle engineering technique able to produce particles within a well-defined particle size range while controlling macroscopic spherical morphology and mesoscopic surface topography. Methods. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) aerosol droplets were generated by spraying a solution via either an electrohydrodynamic atomizer (EHDA) or an air pressure atomizer. The highly supersaturated droplets were collected in a suitable nonsolvent of the drug and crystallized by ultrasonication. Suspended particles were filtered, and their physicochemical properties characterized. Results. The SAXS processed particles showed a relatively homogeneous particle size distribution between 1 and 5 mum. Particles were nominally crystalline in structure. The chemical structure of the active ingredient did not apparently alter during processing. Controlling the solute concentration of the air pressure atomized solution provided a means of controlling the degree of sphericity and particle-size characteristics. In comparison to <b>micronized</b> paracetamol <b>particles,</b> SAXS-produced particulates were generally more uniform in shape with increased nanometer surface roughness. Conclusions. The SAXS process provides a novel means of producing crystalline particles in a well-defined particle size range. Furthermore, the method offers a range of opportunities in controlling physical properties including surface topography and particle shape...|$|R
40|$|The {{physicochemical}} {{properties of}} different grades of fine excipient lactose were characterised, in addition, to their affect {{on the performance}} of ternary dry powder inhaler (DPI) dosage forms. The fine particle delivery of budesonide increased linearly as the fine content was increased from 0 to 15 % w/w using either milled or <b>micronized</b> fine excipient <b>particles.</b> However, the <b>micronized</b> fines had a significantly greater affect on fine particle delivery than milled lactose. This was related to a change in the fluidization behaviour of the powder bulk as a result of inclusion of the different grades of fine excipient material. These data suggest that the grade of fine excipient particles impacts powder fluidization properties, which ultimately affects the performance of DPI formulations...|$|R
