5|$|The Matsya Purana {{describes}} how Brahma, pleased with a penance performed by Parvati, rewards her by blessing {{her with a}} golden complexion. This renders her <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> Shiva, to whom she later merges as one half of his body.|$|E
5|$|The pine bunting and {{yellowhammer}} are {{so closely}} related that each {{responds to the}} other's song. The male yellowhammer's song is <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> females, and is {{one reason for the}} dominance of that species where the ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no longer}} a {{business}} requirement to remain in Albuquerque so Microsoft wanted to relocate to a larger city that would be <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> new employees. The San Francisco bay area was considered but Allen and Gates decided to return home to Seattle. Microsoft moved to Bellevue, Washington in January 1979.|$|E

5|$|One analyst {{reasoned}} the {{recurrence of}} lesbian chic {{was due to}} the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as an unrealistic image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were {{on the margins of}} the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> newcomers.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5000|$|Average {{faces are}} <b>more</b> <b>attractive,</b> perhaps due <b>to</b> [...] "averaging out of unattractive idiosyncracies".|$|R

50|$|Also, <b>to</b> make {{collecting}} <b>more</b> <b>attractive,</b> and <b>to</b> {{make some}} harder-to-find cards more available, the rarity {{of a number}} of cards (most notably the Sites) had their rarity changed from rare to uncommon, or vice versa.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} of the emperor Hadrian the {{proportion}} of Italians in the legions had fallen to just ten percent and provincial citizens now dominated. This low figure is probably {{a direct result of the}} changing needs of military staffing: a system of fixed border defences (Latin: limes) were established around the Empire's periphery under Hadrian, consolidating Trajan's territorial gains. These called for troops to be stationed permanently in the provinces, a prospect <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> locally raised rather than Italian troops. The higher prestige and pay to be found in the Italian dominated Praetorian Guard must also have played a role. The majority of the troops in the legions at the start of the 3rd centuryAD were from the more Romanised (though non-Italian) provinces, especially Illyria. As the century progressed, more and more barbarians (Latin: barbari) were permitted to settle inside of, and tasked with aiding in the defence of, Rome's borders. As a result, greater numbers of barbarous and semi-barbarous peoples were gradually admitted to the army.|$|E
5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E
50|$|The {{incidence}} of locating music rehearsal spaces in deprived areas, often away from residential areas, is <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> due <b>to</b> affordable property, concentration of cheaper housing for artists {{and areas of}} social, cultural and economic regeneration.|$|R
50|$|The town of Sarnen {{has been}} {{experiencing}} steady {{growth over the}} past years. It has become <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> due <b>to</b> its proximity to Lucerne. Many commuters work in Lucerne and use the motorway or railway service to get to work.|$|R
25|$|A user group, the Friends of Glossop Station, {{are working}} to make the station <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> and <b>to</b> {{encourage}} greater use of public transport. The trains operated on the line are three-car Class 323 electric multiple units built in 1992–1993 by Hunslet TPL.|$|R
5|$|The Miami Hurricanes {{kept pace}} with the Hokies {{throughout}} the regular season, winning every conference game after their loss to Tech. After Miami won its {{final game of the}} season and tied the Hokies for the Big East football championship (the Big East had no tiebreaker at the time), it appeared that Virginia Tech would be passed over for a Bowl Alliance game in favor of the Hurricanes. Miami traditionally had a stronger football team and a wider following on television, making it <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> bowl-game officials. But Miami's bowl hopes evaporated after the NCAA announced Miami would be put under sanctions for recruiting rules violations. One of the sanctions included a ban from bowl games, which Miami elected to take after the 1995 season instead of delaying until 1996. After the sanctions were announced, the only question for the Hokies was whether they would be bound for the Orange Bowl in Miami or the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. That question was resolved on December 3, 1995, when Bowl Alliance officials announced their selection of Virginia Tech and Texas for the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
25|$|The {{revival of}} the Docklands has had major effects in {{run-down}} surrounding areas. Greenwich and Deptford are undergoing large-scale redevelopment, chiefly {{as a result of}} the improved transport links making them <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> commuters.|$|E

25|$|Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the {{alternative}} theory that men exhibiting female traits become <b>more</b> <b>attractive</b> <b>to</b> females {{and are thus}} more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality.|$|E
25|$|The BJP-led NDA {{coalition}} {{government has a}} clear majority in the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) but is weak in the Rajya Sabha (upper house of parliament).
