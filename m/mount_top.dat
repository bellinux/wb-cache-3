Most F2Ts were given a special textured black finish but a very few came in natural titanium finish, including the first F2Ts and the very last F2s ever manufactured. Their serial numbers began with '92', e.g., [...] "F2 9201544.' ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of paper was {{to analyze and}} describe the investigations accomplished in Venezuela {{in the base of}} National Park Canaima in (2007) in the indigenous community of Paraytepuy de Roraima (South America). The methodology studies the book of visitations of Roraima Mount, in the years from 2002 to 2003, 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 2007. In this period it was made the walk to Roraima <b>Mount</b> <b>top</b> in the company of the guides and indigenous loaders Pemón Taurepáng. Approximately 3. 500 people visit Roraima Mount a year. The South American peoples have 45, 70 % of the visitations, European 38, 48 %, American North 5, 12 %, Asian 4, 12 % and Oceanic 1, 03 %. The terrestrial access to Roraima Mount is only accomplished by Venezuela...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{optimization}} technique for optimizing the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics to improve vehicle ride comfort and harshness is developed. The proposed {{optimization technique}} employs a new combined objective function based on ride comfort, harshness, and impact harshness evaluation. A detailed and accurate damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> mathematical model is implemented inside a validated quarter vehicle model {{to provide a}} realistic simulation environment for the optimization study. The ride comfort and harshness of the quarter vehicle are evaluated by analyzing the body acceleration in different frequency ranges. In addition, the <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> deformation is considered as a penalty factor for the system performance. The influence of the ride comfort and harshness weighting parameters of the proposed objective function on the optimal damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics is studied. The dynamic stiffness of the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> is {{used to describe the}} optimum damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> characteristics for different optimization case studies. The proposed optimization routine is able to find the optimum characteristics of the damper <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> which improve the ride comfort and the harshness performances together...|$|R
