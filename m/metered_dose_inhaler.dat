5000|$|Formulation of {{the drug}} for {{inhalation}} purposes has proved challenging because of ciclosporin's poor aqueous solubility. Consequently, aerosol studies have often employed compatible solvents such as propylene glycol or ethanol as the vehicle for administration by nebulizer or have used more complicated aqueous-based formulations involving liposomes [...] or other dispersions.

50|$|A {{metered-dose inhaler}} (MDI) is {{a device that}} {{delivers}} a specific amount of medication to the lungs, {{in the form of}} a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. It is the most commonly used delivery system for treating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. The medication in a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> is most commonly a bronchodilator, corticosteroid or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Other medications less commonly used but also administered by MDI are mast cell stabilizers, such as cromoglicate or nedocromil.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> {{contains}} enough {{medication for}} {{a certain number of}} actuations (or [...] "puffs") which is printed on the canister. Even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. It is important {{to keep track of the}} number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. For this reason, several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator. Several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counter-actuator. Depending on the manufacturer and the product, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription.|$|E
50|$|Aerosol mass {{spectrometry}} has also {{found its way}} into the field of pharmaceutical aerosol analysis, due to its ability to provide real-time measurements of particle size and chemical composition. People who suffer from chronic respiratory disease commonly receive their medication through the use of either pressurized <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> (pMDI) or dry powder inhaler (DPI). In both methods the drug is delivered directly into the lungs by inhalation. In recent years, inhaled products have become available which deliver two types of drug within a single dose. Research has shown that the two drugs inhalers provide an enhanced clinical effect beyond that achieved when the two drugs are administered concurrently from two separate inhalers. It was determined using an AToFMS that the respirable particles in a DPI product and pMDI product were composed of co-associated active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is the reason behind the increased effects of the two drug inhalers.|$|E

5000|$|Marking in OSCEs {{is done by}} the examiner. Occasionally written stations, for example, {{writing a}} {{prescription}} chart, are used and these are marked like written examinations, again usually using a standardized mark sheet. One of the ways an OSCE is made objective is by having a detailed mark scheme and standard set of questions. For example, a station concerning the demonstration to a simulated patient on how to use a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> MDI would award points for specific actions which are performed safely and accurately. The examiner can often vary the marks depending on how well the candidate performed the step. At the end of the mark sheet, the examiner often has a small number of marks that they can use to weight the station depending on performance and if a simulated patient is used, then they are often asked to add marks depending on the candidates approach. At the end, the examiner is often asked to give a [...] "global score". This is usually used as a subjective score based on the candidates overall performance, not taking into account how many marks the candidate scored. The examiner is usually asked to rate the candidate as pass/borderline/fail or sometimes as excellent/good/pass/borderline/fail. This is then used to determine the individual pass mark for the station.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} used nebulizers are jet nebulizers, which are also called [...] "atomizers". Jet nebulizers are connected by tubing to a compressor, that causes compressed air or oxygen to flow at high velocity through a liquid medicine {{to turn it into}} an aerosol, which is then inhaled by the patient. Currently {{there seems to be a}} tendency among physicians to prefer prescription of a pressurized <b>Metered</b> <b>Dose</b> <b>Inhaler</b> (pMDI) for their patients, instead of a jet nebulizer that generates a lot more noise (often 60 dB during use) and is less portable due to a heavier weight. However jet nebulizers are commonly used for patients in hospitals who have difficulty using inhalers, such as in serious cases of respiratory disease, or severe asthma attacks. The main advantage of the jet nebulizer is related to its low operational cost. If the patient needs to inhale medicine on a daily basis the use of a pMDI can be rather expensive. Today several manufacturers have also managed to lower the weight of the jet nebulizer down to 635 g, and thereby started to label it as a portable device. Compared to all the competing inhalers and nebulizers, the noise and heavy weight is however still the biggest draw back of the jet nebulizer. Trade names for jet nebulizers include Maxin.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> is {{difficult}} to use correctly, synchronising actuation with inhalation being the most important problem. A breath actuated pressurised inhaler, designed to help patients with poor inhaler technique, was compared with a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> in terms of aerosol deposition and bronchodilator response. METHODS Radioaerosol deposition and bronchodilator response to 100 micrograms salbutamol were measured in 18 asthmatic patients, who inhaled from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> by their own chosen <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique, from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> by a taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique, and from a breath actuated pressured inhaler (Autohaler). RESULTS In the 10 patients who could coordinate actuation and inhalation of the inhaler on their own deposition of aerosol in the lungs and bronchodilator response were equivalent on the three study days. By contrast, in the eight patients who could not coordinate the mean (SEM) percentage of the dose deposited in the lungs with their own inhaler technique (7. 2 % (3. 4 %] was substantial lower than those attained by the taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> technique (22. 8 % (2. 5 %] and by Autohaler (20. 8 % (1. 7 %]. CONCLUSION Although of little additional benefit to asthmatic patients with good coordination, the Autohaler is potentially a valuable aid to those with poor coordination, and {{should be considered in}} preference to a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> in any patient whose inhaler technique is not known to be satisfactory...|$|E

For analysis, technique scores were rated as 'good' (score 4 out of 4), 'adequate' (score 3 or 4) and 'inadequate' (score 2 or less). Overall, 25 % of patients had inadequate technique. Of all devices, the Turbohaler had the highest proportion of patients with good technique (78 %), and <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> the lowest (45 %). This audit confirms that technique is unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients, regardless of the device used. A simple scoring system promotes consistent testing of technique within a practice...|$|R

40|$|PhDElectrostatics of {{aerosols}} for inhalation is {{a relatively}} new research area. Charge properties of these particles are largely unknown but electrostatic forces have been proposed to potentially influence lung deposition. Investigation on the relationship between formulation and aerosol charging is required to understand the fundamental mechanisms. A modified electrical low pressure impactor was employed to measure the particles generated from <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> and dry powder inhalers. This equipment provides detailed size and charge information of the aerosols. The particles were sized by impaction onto thirteen stages. The net charges in twelve of the size fractions were detected and recorded by sensitive electrometers. The drug deposits were quantified by chemical assay. The aerosol charge profiles of commercial <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> were product-dependent, which was due to differences in the drug, formulation, and valve stem material. The calculated number of elementary charges per drug particle of size â¤ 6. 06 Î¼m ranged from zero to several ten thousands. The high charge levels on particles may have a potential effect on the deposition of the aerosol particles in the lung when inhaled. New plastic spacers marketed for use with <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> were found to possess high surface charges on the internal walls, which was successfully removed by detergent-coating. Detergent-coated spacer had higher drug output than the new ones due to the reduced electrostatic particle deposition inside the spacer. Particles delivered from spacers carried lower inherent charges than those directly from <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers.</b> Those with higher charges might be susceptible to electrostatic forces inside the spacers and were thus retained. The electrostatic low pressure impactor was further modified to disperse two commercial TubuhalerÂ® products at 60 L/min. The DPIs showed drug-specific responses to particle charging at different RHs. The difference in hygroscopicity of the drugs may play a major role. A dual mechanistic charging model was proposed to explain the charging behaviours. The charge levels on drug particles delivered from these inhalers were sufficiently high to potentially affect deposition in the airways when inhaled. Drug-free <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhalers</b> containing HFA- 134 a and 227 produced highly variable charge profiles but on average the puffs were negatively charged, which was thought to be due to the electronegative fluorine atoms in the HFA molecules. The charges of both HFAs shifted towards neutrality or positive polarity with increasing water content. The spiked water might have increased the electrical conductivity and/or decreased the electronegativity of the bulk propellant solution. The number of elementary charges per droplet decreased with decreasing droplet size. This trend was probably due to the redistribution of charges amongst small droplets following electrostatic fission of a bigger droplet when the Raleigh limit was reached...|$|R
40|$|A radiotracer {{technique}} {{has been used}} to assess aerosol delivery from a pressurised <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler,</b> used both with and without a 10 cm cylindrical spacer attachment (Syncroner), which has an open section in its upper surface. The radionuclide technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) was added to sodium cromoglycate in a canister (Intal inhaler; 1 mg/puff); in vitro studies with a multistage liquid impinger showed that the radiolabel acted as a marker for the presence of drug over a wide range of particle sizes. Ten healthy volunteers were studied after they had inhaled from (1) a <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone (slow inhaled flow rate, about 25 l/min); (2) <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> plus spacer (slow flow rate); and (3) <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> plus spacer (fast inhaled flow rate, about 100 l/min). Inhalation was coordinated with firing the spray and was followed by 10 seconds' breath holding. With the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone a mean 11. 0 % (SEM 1. 4 %) of the dose reached the lungs, compared with significantly higher doses for slow (16. 1 % (2. 2 %] and fast (13. 3 % (1. 7 %] inhalations through the spacer. The distribution pattern within the lungs was significantly more peripheral after slow inhalation. Oropharyngeal deposition was halved by the spacer.

After laboratory studies the patients undertook a randomised domiciliary crossover comparison of bronchodilator response to terbutaline given by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with and without a spacer device, during which the severity of asthma was assessed by thrice daily recordings of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and symptom score. Improvement in FEV 1 produced in the laboratory by the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> with spacer device was significantly greater than by <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> alone (p less than 0. 001) and similar to that from the nebuliser in both asthmatic groups throughout a range of terbutaline doses.

DESIGN: Prospective study measuring compliance in the same patients of the Autohaler twice daily with the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> twice daily, as well the Autohaler twice daily with the Autohaler four times daily. SETTING: Primary health care. SUBJECTS: 34 subjects with asthma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients preference and compliance. RESULTS: Patients preferred the Autohaler. The percentage of patients with a negative opinion towards the <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> <b>inhaler</b> was 38 % compared with 12 % towards the Autohaler. The median values of the compliance rate of the Autohaler with twice and four times daily frequency were 90. 8 % (25 - 75 th percentile 61. 6 - 98. 0 %) and 78. 5 % (25 - 75 th percentile 49. 0 %- 91. 2 %), respectively (p < 0. 001).
