Starting {{with the expectation that}} the rhythm of Gregorian chant (and thus the duration of the individual notes) anyway adds to the expressivity of the sacred Latin texts, several word-related variables were studied for their relationship with several neume-related variables, exploring these relationships in a sample of introit chants using such statistical methods as correlational analysis and <b>multiple</b> <b>regression</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
