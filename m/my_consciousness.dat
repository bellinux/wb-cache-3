500|$|Coward was no fan of {{the works}} of Gilbert and Sullivan, but as a {{songwriter}} was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation." [...] His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was [...] "the best of his kind since W. S. Gilbert." ...|$|E
500|$|The American and British musical owes a {{tremendous}} debt to G, who were admired and copied by early musical theatre authors and composers such as Ivan Caryll, Adrian Ross, Lionel Monckton, P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Victor Herbert, and later Jerome Kern, Ira Gershwin, Yip Harburg, Irving Berlin, Ivor Novello, Oscar Hammerstein II, and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Gilbert's lyrics {{served as a}} model for such 20th-century Broadway lyricists as Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, and Lorenz Hart. Noël Coward wrote: [...] "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them, my nurse, Emma, breathed them through her teeth.... My aunts and uncles... sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation...." ...|$|E
2500|$|I like to {{pray and}} I like to meditate. Doing just three minutes of prayer and a minimum of five minutes {{meditation}} twice a day sets the tone—like an arrow so that you're hitting your target. When I pray I always thank Mother Nature for all the beauty in the world; it's about having an attitude of gratitude. And then I pray to Christ to say, 'Thank you for this day and {{my family and my}} health,' and now that I'm older I've added, 'Please illuminate me. Please open my heart chakra. Open my aperture and uplift <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> so that I can be the best version of myself.' ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated <b>my</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt his}} hand, with gentle stress, [...] A moment laid on mine, [...] And wished to mark <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> [...] By some {{responsive}} sign.|$|E
60|$|I stared unwonderingly {{at these}} things for a time, and then there rose upon <b>my</b> <b>consciousness,</b> {{intermingling}} with these, the bristling golden green heads of growing barley.|$|E

60|$|This {{was really}} such a {{confusing}} question that Ada {{looked at me}} in perfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of <b>my</b> own <b>consciousness</b> after what I had been thinking, {{it must have been}} expressed in the colour of my cheeks.|$|R

60|$|At length these broken {{fragments}} of the past were swept away out of <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> and I found myself {{face to face with}} something connected and tangible, not too remote or unfamiliar for understanding. It {{was the beginning of the}} real story.|$|E
60|$|Under the {{influence}} of fever, I lay {{in a state of}} delirium for many days {{in the bottom of the}} canoe; and when <b>my</b> unclouded <b>consciousness</b> was at length restored to me, I found myself lying in a bed, under the hospitable roof of a missionary, the windows of whose house looked out upon the sea.|$|R
5000|$|Kierkegaard {{introduces}} {{the idea of}} the paradox and the leap in Fear and Trembling. He says, [...] "The act of resignation does not require faith, for what I gain is <b>my</b> eternal <b>consciousness.</b> This is a purely philosophical movement that I venture to make when it is demanded and can discipline myself to make, because every time some finitude will take power over me, I starve myself into submission until I make the movement, for <b>my</b> eternal <b>consciousness</b> is <b>my</b> love for God, and for me that is the highest of all. The act of resignation does not require faith, but to get the least little bit more than <b>my</b> eternal <b>consciousness</b> requires faith, for this is the paradox." [...] He explains himself in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, where he writes, [...] "In that book and Trembling I had perceived how the leap, according to the author, as the decision par excellence becomes specifically decisive for what is Christian and for every dogmatic category. This can be achieved neither through Schelling's intellectual intuition nor through what Hegel, flouting Schelling's idea, wants to put in its place, the inverse operation of the method. All Christianity is rooted in paradox, according to Fear and Trembling-yes, it is rooted in fear and trembling (which are specifically the desperate categories of Christianity and the leap)-whether one accepts it (that is, is a believer) or rejects it (for the very reason that it is the paradox)." ...|$|R

6000|$|Ford Obert {{has since}} {{told me that}} when I came back to him there were tears in my eyes, and I didn't know at the moment how much the words with which he met me took for granted <b>my</b> <b>consciousness</b> of them. [...] "He looks a hundred years old!" ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{recovered}} <b>my</b> <b>consciousness,</b> I {{was lying}} on the couch in my own study. My father was supporting me on the pillow; the doctor had his fingers on my pulse; and a policeman was telling them where he had found me, and how he had brought me home.|$|E
60|$|The emptiness! Ah, it {{was from}} that I shrank. I could have faced pain and anxiety and heartbreak undauntedly, but I could not face that terrible, yawning, barren emptiness.

60|$|I {{opened my}} eyes upon a strange and weird landscape. I knew that I was on Mars; not once did I {{question}} either my sanity or my wakefulness.

You do not question the fact; neither did I.|$|R
