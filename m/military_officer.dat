25|$|Like the Soviet army, {{political}} and <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> formed a dual {{chain of command}} within the PVA, and this arrangement could be found as low as the company level.

Unlike other Communist armies of the same period, although the political officers had authority over <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> on combat decisions, the <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> could issue orders without political officers' approval. Similarly, the line between <b>military</b> and political <b>officers</b> were often blurred in PVA, since the political officers often had extensive military experiences while most <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> were senior Party members within a unit.|$|R

40|$|AbstractProblem statement: <b>Military</b> <b>officers</b> educated {{from the}} Norwegian Military Academy are {{expected}} to become leaders in military international operations. Leadership in these contexts will demand {{a high degree of}} intellect and character. However, {{there is a lack of}} systematic research on which specific character strengths that are crucial to possess for <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> to succeed in international operations. Purpose of study: This paper discusses a group of experienced officer's perception of which character strengths are deemed most important for the Norwegian <b>Military</b> Academy's <b>officers</b> to succeed. Method A group of participants consisting of 25 experienced <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> were given a list of 24 character strengths. They were requested to judge each character strength according to its importance for <b>military</b> <b>officers.</b> Findings and results: 12 character strengths were selected as the most important for <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> and their leadership. These were in ranked order: Leadership, integrity, persistence, bravery, open-mindedness, fairness, citizenship, self-regulation, love of learning, social intelligence, perspective and creativity. Conclusions and recommendations: These 12 character strengths were the same 12 identified as important for <b>military</b> <b>officers</b> in another study conducted at the NMA. It was therefore decided that these 12 selected character strengths will function as the basis for the development of an instrument for observing character strengths during military field exercises...|$|R
