MOS exploits today’s flight, ground, and operations capabilities, embraces automation, and balances both risk and cost. With operational efficiency as the primary goal, MOS maintains a strong control process by translating lessons learned into efficiency improvements, thereby enabling the <b>MOS</b> <b>processes,</b> teams, and procedures to rapidly evolve from concept (through thorough validation) into in-flight implementation. Operational teaming, planning, and execution are designed to enable re-use. Mission changes, unforeseen events, and continuous improvement have often times forced us to learn to fly anew.

40|$|Some of the {{challenges}} in developing a mission operations system and operating a mis-sion {{can be traced back}} to the challenge of integrating a mission operations system from its many components and to the challenge of maintaining consistent and accountable in-formation throughout the operations processes. An important contributing factor to both of these challenges is the file-centric nature of today’s systems. In this paper, we provide an overview of these challenges and argue the need to move toward an information-centric mission operations system. We propose an information representation called Timeline as an approach to enable such a move, and we provide an overview of a Timeline-based Mission Operations System architecture. I. From File-Centric to Information-Centric Mission Operations One of {{the challenges}} of mission operations is in maintaining consistent and accountable informationthroughout the process. To maintain consistency, a mission operations system (MOS) must be able to readily compare and analyze the operations information.

5000|$|In 1967 John C. Sarace and {{collaborators}} at Bell Labs {{replaced the}} aluminum gate with an electrode made of vacuum-evaporated amorphous silicon and succeeded in building working self-aligned gate MOS transistors. However, the process, as described, {{was only a}} proof of principle, suitable only for the fabrication of discrete transistors and not for integrated circuits; and was not pursued any further by its investigators. [...] In 1968 the MOS industry was prevalently using aluminum gate transistors with high-threshold voltage and desired to have a low threshold voltage <b>MOS</b> <b>process</b> {{in order to increase}} the speed and reduce the power dissipation of MOS integrated circuits. Low threshold voltage transistors with aluminum gate demanded the use of 100 silicon orientation, which however produced too low a threshold voltage for the parasitic MOS transistors (the MOS transistors created when aluminum over the field oxide would bridge two junctions). To increase the parasitic threshold voltage beyond the supply voltage, it was necessary to increase the N-type doping level in selected regions under the field oxide, and this was initially accomplished {{with the use of a}} so-called channel-stopper mask, and later with ion implantation.|$|E
50|$|The aluminum-gate <b>MOS</b> <b>process</b> technology, {{developed}} in the mid-sixties, started with the definition and doping of the source and drain regions of MOS transistors, followed by the gate mask that defined the thin-oxide region of the transistors. With additional processing steps, an aluminum gate would then be formed over the thin-oxide region completing the device fabrication. Due to the inevitable misalignment of the gate mask {{with respect to the}} source and drain mask, it was necessary to have a fairly large overlap area between the gate region and the source and drain regions, to ensure that the thin-oxide region would bridge the source and drain, even under worst-case misalignment. This requirement resulted in gate-to-source and gate-to-drain parasitic capacitances that were large and variable from wafer to wafer, depending on the misalignment of the gate oxide mask with respect with the source and drain mask. The result was an undesirable spread in the speed of the integrated circuits produced, and a much lower speed than theoretically possible if the parasitic capacitances could be reduced to a minimum. The overlap capacitance with the most adverse consequences on performance was the gate-to-drain parasitic capacitance, Cgd, which, by the well-known Miller effect, augmented the gate-to-source capacitance of the transistor by Cgd multiplied by the gain of the circuit to which that transistor was a part. The impact was a considerable reduction in the switching speed of transistors.|$|E
5000|$|Image sensor {{elements}} with in-pixel amplifiers were described by Noble in 1968, by Chamberlain in 1969, and by Weimer et al. in 1969, {{at a time}} when passive-pixel sensors - that is, pixel sensors without their own amplifiers or active noise cancelling circuitry - were being investigated as a solid-state alternative to vacuum-tube imaging devices. The MOS passive-pixel sensor used just a simple switch in the pixel to read out the photodiode integrated charge. Pixels were arrayed in a two-dimensional structure, with an access enable wire shared by pixels in the same row, and output wire shared by column. At the end of each column was an amplifier. Passive-pixel sensors suffered from many limitations, such as high noise, slow readout, and lack of scalability. The addition of an amplifier to each pixel addressed these problems, and resulted {{in the creation of the}} active-pixel sensor. Noble in 1968 and Chamberlain in 1969 created sensor arrays with active MOS readout amplifiers per pixel, in essentially the modern three-transistor configuration. The CCD was invented in October 1969 at Bell Labs. Because the <b>MOS</b> <b>process</b> was so variable and MOS transistors had characteristics that changed over time (Vth instability), the CCD's charge-domain operation was more manufacturable and quickly eclipsed MOS passive and active pixel sensors. A low-resolution [...] "mostly digital" [...] N-channel MOSFET imager with intra-pixel amplification, for an optical mouse application, was demonstrated in 1981.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1980s, CMOS was still quite slow and used mostly for the 4000 series, Static RAMs, and {{low-power}} ASICs (such as watch and calculator ICs). Advanced processes for depletion-load nMOS, such as Intel's family of scaled HMOS (High density, short channel <b>MOS)</b> <b>processes</b> were therefore used for most microprocessors, certain types of memories, and many support and peripheral ICs. The first nMOS process called HMOS (late 1976) was originally used for Intel's then central static RAM products. Although primarily intended for fast SRAM, it was soon employed also for faster and/or less power hungry versions of the 8085, 8086, and other chips. HMOS was also licensed to other manufacturers, such as Motorola, which used it to manufacture the Motorola 68000 series, for instance. According to Intel, HMOS-II (1979) provided twice the density and four times the speed/power product over other typical contemporary depletion-load nMOS processes. HMOS, HMOS II, HMOS III, and HMOS IV were together used for {{many different kinds of}} processors; the 8085, 8048, 8051, 8086, 80186, 80286, and many others, but also for several generations of the same basic design, see datasheets.|$|R

40|$|As integrated-circuit device {{dimensions}} decrease, {{the importance}} of having new reliable <b>processes</b> for growing <b>MOS</b> gate oxides becomes more and more evident. Short process times and low process temperatures are desirable features in view of tight thermal budget constraints and the need for precise location of dopants. However, conventional thermal oxidation to grow high quality films usually requires relatively long oxidation times and relatively high temperature. Previous research on negative point (anodic) corona-processed SiO 2 films has shown that the thermal budget incurred using the corona process is much lower than in standard thermal oxidation due to the greatly enhanced oxidation rate. Promising results of low-T corona-processed [Special characters omitted. ] 100 Å films have shown that the films had physical characteristics comparable to those obtained in thermal oxidation. This research extends the previous work: (a) thin oxides ([Special characters omitted. ] 200 Å) are processed in order to be potentially more relevant to modern <b>MOS</b> <b>processes,</b> and (b) a more thorough electrical characterization is initiated. Electrical tests show that oxide and interface charges are comparable to thermal oxides. Breakdown characteristics are promising. The boundary between the corona-processed and control regions is found to be severely compromised.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy results show that the negative corona films have a different structure from that of thermal oxide films.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{examination of}} {{the properties of the}} Si(100) -SiO 2 interface measured following rapid thermal processing (RTP) is presented. The interface properties have been examined using high frequency and quasi-static capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis of metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) capacitor structures immediately following either rapid thermal oxidation (RTO) or rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The experimental results reveal a characteristic peak in the CV response measured following dry RTO and RTA (T > 800 degreesC), as the Fermi level at the Si(100) -SiO 2 interface approaches the conduction band edge. Analysis of the QSCV responses reveals a high interface state density across the energy gap following dry RTO and RTA processing, with a characteristic peak density in the range 5. 5 x 10 (12) to 1. 7 x 10 (13) cm(- 2) eV(- 1) located at approximately 0. 85 - 0. 88 eV above the valence band edge. When the background density of states for a hydrogen-passivated interface is subtracted, another peak of lower density (3 x 10 (12) to 7 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) eV(- 1)) is observed at approximately 0. 25 - 0. 33 eV above the valence band edge. The experimental results point to a common interface state defect present after processes involving rapid cooling (10 (1) - 10 (2) degreesC/s) from a temperature of 800 degreesC or above, in a hydrogen free ambient. This work demonstrates that the interface states measured following RTP (T > 800 degreesC) are the net contribution of the P-b 0 /P-b 1 silicon dangling bond defects for the oxidized Si(100) orientation.

40|$|A NAND (serial gating) {{structure}} PLA of the <b>MOS</b> poly-silicon gate <b>process</b> {{has been}} developed for high density and medium fast speed VLSI application. Dynamic clocking is used for minimum power dissipation and elimination of the ratio problem associated with static NAND gate. Ion-implantation for memory cell programming {{and the elimination of}} contact in the memory area drastically reduces the cell size, and reliability is improved. A simple but effective self-timed clocking scheme is employed for better operating margins against process variations; the overhead chip area for the clock generation is sufficiently small. The advantages of allowing metal signal and power lines to cross the PLA memory area is discussed. Some measured data from a 3. 5 μm NMOS Si-gate process with regard to gate height and transistor sizes are also described...|$|R
