Speech recognition engine for EasyCmd is much similar to that for dictation <b>machine.</b> Statistical Knowledge <b>Based</b> <b>Frame</b> Synchronous Search algorithm (SKBFSS) and Word Search Tree (WST) technologies are applied for acoustic decoding. Recognition Score Gap (RSG) is used for rejection. We also describe the techniques of monitoring the system, collecting vocabulary and simulating system operations, which are essential to enhance the desktop with voice commands. 1...|$|R
40|$|Support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on {{positive}} feedback are put {{forward with the}} analysis of both {{advantages and disadvantages of}} current support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on Gaussian kernel function(including support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on K-nearest neighbors) and the essence why support vector machines is capable of describing data sets'distribution characteristics, thus the rigor constraint is overcome that maintains "corresponding parameters ofkernel function support vectors should be equal". The learning algorithm of support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on {{positive feedback}} is given. Simulation experiments of artificialand real data proves that support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback is be obviously superior to current ones in its generation capabilities. Though, only the support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback for pattern recognition is discussed, the idea included in support vector <b>machines</b> <b>based</b> on positive feedback is using kernel functions with different corresponding parameters to construct support vector machines, and is adaptive to other types support vector machines...|$|R
40|$|A method {{with easy}} {{operation}} procedure and simple calibration condition {{is presented in}} this paper to solve the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> calibration problem for cooperative robots. It is carried out through constructing a series of handclasp configurations and recording coordinates of the contact points, respectively, in <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> of each robot. Then the rotation matrix and translation matrix between <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> of cooperative robots can be calculated which is just the calibration result for cooperative robots. Based on typical installation mode for industrial robot, the floor mounted, wall mounted and ceiling mounted, constraints between <b>base</b> <b>frames</b> of these robots are further explored. These constraints are used to improve the calibration results for <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> calibration problem. In order to validate the correctness and effectiveness of our method, experiments on two industrial robots (Motoman VA 1400 and HP 20) are carried {{out at the end of}} the paper. The calibration errors are less than 8 [*]mm in most cases, which satisfies the requirement of positioning accuracy for most industrial process, such as arc welding, transporting, and cutting. These experiment results assert the correctness of our method which can be used effectively to solve the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> calibration problem for cooperative robots in manufacturing process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new tracked {{triangular}} wheel {{structure was}} introduced. A whole tracked triangular wheeled vehicle model {{was built in}} multi-body dynamics simulation software RecurDyn, and its climbing obstacle performance on the dry soil road was simulated. The author put the simulation results as loading conditions of finite element model. Finite element calculation and lightweight design for tracked triangular wheel <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> were completed. The {{results showed that the}} weight of the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> reduced by 69. 8 %, the structure properties of the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> improved, and the lightweight design goal was achieved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Base</b> <b>Frame</b> are the {{traditional}} and most common means for reducing weight of pump. Over past many years, changes {{had to be made}} to pumps and parts of pumps to improve performance. <b>Base</b> <b>Frame,</b> Shaft, bearing are the key components of any single stage or multistage pump. Therefore to obtain better performance of multistage pump, different theoretical cases have been studied by changing length of I-section, by changing size of supporting channel etc. Then these cases have been analyzed for the stresses coming on the components of <b>base</b> <b>frame,</b> shaft etc. of pump by using design formulae / data book and CAD /CAE software’s like HYPERWORKS /ANSYS. The vibrations can be controlled and also life of pump can be increased by <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> optimization and shaft deflection analysis...|$|R
40|$|When a robot is {{required}} to perform specific tasks defined in the world frame, {{there is a need}} for finding the coordinate transformation between the kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> of the robot and the world <b>frame.</b> The kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> used by the robot controller to define and evaluate the kinematics may deviate from the mechanical <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> constructed <b>based</b> on structural features. Besides, by using kinematic modeling rules such as the product of exponentials (POE) formula, the <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> can be arbitrarily located, and does not have to be related to any feature of the mechanical structure. As a result, the kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> cannot be measured directly. This paper proposes to find the kinematic <b>base</b> <b>frame</b> by solving a hand-eye calibration problem using 3 D position measurements only, which avoids the inconvenience and inaccuracy of measuring orientations and thus significantly facilitates practical operations. A closed-form solution and an iterative solution are explicitly formulated and proved effective by simulations. Comprehensive analyses of the impact of key parameters to the accuracy of the solution are also carried out, providing four guidelines to better conduct practical operations. Finally, experiments on a 7 -DOF industrial robot are performed with an optical tracking system to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method using position data only over the method using full pose data...|$|R

40|$|The Shifting Bottleneck (SB) {{heuristic}} {{is among}} the most successful approximation methods for solving the Job Shop problem. It is essentially a <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedure where a series of One Machine Sequencing Problems (OMSPs) are solved. However, such a procedure has been reported to be highly ineffective for the Flow Shop problems (Jain and Meeran 2002). In particular, we show that for the 2 -machine Flow Shop problem, the SB heurisitc will deliver the optimal solution in {{only a small number of}} instances. We examine the reason behind the failure of the <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition method for the Flow Shop. An optimal <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedure is formulated for the 2 -machine Flow Shop, the time complexity of which is worse than that of the celebrated Johnson’s Rule. The contribution of the present study lies in showing that the same <b>machine</b> <b>based</b> decomposition procedures which are so successful in solving complex Job Shops can also be suitably modified to optimally solve the simpler Flow Shops...|$|R
