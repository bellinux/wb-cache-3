50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1938, Dornier issued <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification</b> No. 1323, recognising {{the need for a}} twin-engine bomber or long-range reconnaissance aircraft powered by Daimler-Benz DB 601B engines. In February 1938 the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM - Air Ministry) authorized a testing program.Dornier worked on a version of the Do 17M with the all round vision cockpit of the Do 17Z and a fuselage having a large bomb bay capable of holding a maximum of two 500 kg and ten 50 kg bombs. For reconnaissance an Rb 50/30 movie camera was fitted ahead of the front spar of the wing, and an Rb 20/30 was mounted in the second bomb bay. Jettisonable fuel tanks were carried in the forward bomb bay. For smoke-laying, the aircraft could be fitted with two Type S200 smoke generators. Dornier also envisaged the Do 217 as a naval dive bomber, in which case it was to be fitted with twin floats. In April and May 1938, the Do 217 WV1 and WV2 prototypes were produced.|$|E
5000|$|However the new {{vessel was}} seriously {{overweight}} - {{by more than}} 100 tons - due to both design and Steel Supply, British Steel had installed a new Computerised Gauge Control at its Dalzell Plate production unit, and during the initial production of steel plate after its introduction it tended to produce plates still within the allowed <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification,</b> but {{at or near the}} upper gauge allowed in the tolerance - resulting in the steel tending to be heavier than designed.In late autumn 1988 she was taken out of service for two weeks and sent to Tees Dockyard Ltd in Middlesbrough to be lengthened by 5.4 m (20 ft). The extent of this implant can most easily be observed when climbing the stairs from the car deck to the passenger accommodation. These stairs used to be a single flight, but now have a level section halfway up. The new length of hull made the vessel better both in terms of vehicle capacity (taking it to around 80) but also in that she handled better at sea with her overall speed increased slightly.|$|E

At the beginning of January 1939 the RLM stopped all work on the marine dive bomber version, as its estimated performance was not adequate.On 8 July 1939 Dornier issued a <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification</b> for a glide bomb-deploying version for full maritime use. It was to be equipped with BMW 801 engines. In contrast to the earlier description of the design, the Do 217 E had a new nose and the nose, cockpit rear, and ventral positions carried one MG 15 each. The design was to carry a maximum bomb load of two SC 500 and two SC 250 bombs. It was also possible to carry an aerial mine or torpedo, for which the bomb bay had been substantially extended rearwards in the ventral area of the rear fuselage, nearly 70% longer in proportion than what the earlier Do 17Z had possessed. A [...] "clamshell"-like dive brake was fitted aft of the tail, with rear-hinged single dorsal and ventral [...] "petals" [...] to deploy using a jackscrew during anticipated dive bombing missions. These features increased the design's weight to 10500 kg. Dornier had intended the speed to be in the region of 530 km/h.|$|E

40|$|Collaboration is {{not only}} an issue for {{geographically}} or temporally dispersed engineering teams jointly working on the development of products or manufacturing facilities. It is also an important issue for the operation of production lines. One task that requires close collaboration is the setup of the configuration data for the production line - the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification</b> data. They lay the foundations for automation scenarios on all levels of the automation hierarchy, starting from the single production equipment up to the complete production line.

40|$|Abstract. Flexibility {{is one of}} {{the most}} sought-after {{properties}} in modern manufacturing systems. Despite this interest, flexibility remains poorly understood in theory and poorly utilized in practice. One reason for this is the lack of general agreement on how to define flexibility: over 70 terms (types and measures) can be found in the literature. This paper concerns developing a framework and classification scheme for use in defining and classifying the various terms regarding flexibility found in manufacturing. The framework consists of six attributes: level of <b>manufacturing</b> requirements <b>specification,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> system <b>specification,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> environment <b>specification,</b> flexibility dimension, flexibility measurement approach, and time frame. A six-field hybrid classification scheme is developed based on this framework. The framework serves as a guide for developing new flexibility terms, whereas the classification scheme provides a mechanism for summarizing the important aspects of and assumptions behind a given term. The approach is demonstrated by using the classification scheme to classify over 50 existing flexibility terms. The results indicate that the classification scheme is an effective tool to aid in understanding different flexibility terms and how they compare to one another. At the same time, the difficulty of the classification exercise indicates the need for a suitable framework when defining such terms.

40|$|Baxter Dade Division is a U. S. {{manufacturer}} of diagnostic healthcare equipment and supplies. As {{a result of}} the introduction of a new series of technology products, sales revenue and production volumes have grown considerably in recent years. The problem facing this organization was that existing <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification</b> documentation systems could not keep pace with recent production volume increases. The resultant system inefficiencies manifested themselves in delays in the implementation of instruction revisions, inconsistencies in specifications between distributed plant facilities, and {{a significant increase in the}} cost of clerical staff to administer documentation processing. To address these problems, this work focused on the definition, design, and selection of an automated documentation system with a central library of production specifications accessible to all plants via an interactive computer inquiry methodology. To solve these problems a computer based Electronic Documentation System was proposed to expedite the processing of manufacturing specifications. Specific tasks included the development of an Electronic Documentation System requirements definition, a conceptual design of a software application that satisfied these requirements, a review of market available systems, and a final recommendation to senior management of a cost effective and efficient system solution to the documentation issues.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} digital image {{restoration}} algorithm for phase-coded imaging systems. In order {{to extend the}} depth-of-field (Dof), an imaging system equipped with a properly designed phase-coded lens can achieve an approximately constant point spread function (PSF) {{for a wide range}} of depths. In general, a phase-coded imaging system produces blurred intermediate images and requires subsequent restoration processing to generate clear images. For low-computational consumer applications, the kernel size of the restoration filter is a major concern. To fit for practical applications, a pyramid-based restoration algorithm is proposed in which we decompose the intermediate image into the form of Laplacian pyramid and perform restoration over each level individually. This approach provides the flexibility in filter design to maintain <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification.</b> On the other hand, image noise may seriously degrade the performance of the restored images.

The value of the limiting N factor N LIM required for the transition prediction has been derived from an analysis of flight tests with a natural laminar flow engine nacelle previously flight tested on the same aircraft at the same flight and engine operating conditions. In contrast to the flight trials with the natural laminar flow nacelle, for the HLF nacelle flight tests there existed an additional receptivity component due to the waviness of the forebody surface of the manufactured HLF nacelle fan cowl as result of the aerodynamic surface quality not complying with the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>specification.</b> For the validation of the transition prediction, results obtained using the infrared thermography as well as the external surface temperature distribution on the HLF nacelle fan cowl have been drawn upon.
