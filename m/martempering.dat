50|$|Salt baths {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of heat {{treatment}} processes including neutral hardening, liquid carburising, liquid nitriding, austempering, <b>martempering</b> and tempering.|$|E
50|$|<b>Martempering</b> is used {{to produce}} {{martensite}} without developing the high stresses that usually accompany its formation. The casting is quenched from above the transformation range in a salt, oil, or lead bath: held in the bath at a temperature slightly above the range at which martensite forms only until the casting has reached the bath temperature; and then cooled to room temperature.In <b>Martempering</b> steel is heated to above the critical range {{to make it all}} austenite. The drawback of this process is that the large section cannot be heat treated by this process ^4.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>martempering</b> process, austenitized {{metal part}} is {{immersed}} in a bath at a temperature just above the martensite start temperature (Ms). By using interrupted quenching, the cooling is stopped at a point above the martensite transformation region to ensure sufficient time for the center to cool to the same temperature as the surface. The metal part is then removed from the bath and cooled in air to room temperature to permit the austenite to transform to martensite. <b>Martempering</b> is a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component can be controlled.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Martempering</b> is {{also known}} as stepped {{quenching}} or interrupted quenching. In this process, steel is heated above the upper critical point and then quenched in a salt bath kept at a temperature of 150-300° C. The workpiece is held at this temperature above (Ms) until the temperature becomes uniform throughout the cross-section of workpiece. After that it is cooled in air or oil to room temperature. The steel is then tempered. <b>Martempering</b> is a heat treatment for steel involving austenitisation followed by step quenching, at a rate fast enough to avoid the formation of ferrite, pearlite or bainite to a temperature slightly above the martensite start (Ms) point.|$|E
50|$|Tempering {{may also}} be {{performed}} on normalized steels. Other methods of tempering consist of quenching to a specific temperature, which is above the martensite start temperature, and then holding it there until pure bainite can form or internal stresses can be relieved. These include austempering and <b>martempering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Martempering</b> (Marquenching): <b>Martempering</b> is not {{actually}} a tempering procedure, hence the term [...] "marquenching". It {{is a form}} of isothermal heat treatment applied after an initial quench, typically in a molten salt bath, at a temperature just above the [...] "martensite start temperature". At this temperature, residual stresses within the material are relieved and some bainite may be formed from the retained austenite which did not have time to transform into anything else. In industry, this is a process used to control the ductility and hardness of a material. With longer marquenching, the ductility increases with a minimal loss in strength; the steel is held in this solution until the inner and outer temperatures of the part equalize. Then the steel is cooled at a moderate speed to keep the temperature gradient minimal. Not only does this process reduce internal stresses and stress cracks, but it also increases the impact resistance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Martempering</b> {{is similar}} to austempering, in that the steel is {{quenched}} in a bath of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in <b>martempering,</b> {{the goal is to}} create martensite rather than bainite. The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite start temperature. The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any bainite can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the martempered steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not. Modern files are often martempered.|$|E
50|$|Interrupted {{quenching}} {{methods are}} {{often referred to}} as tempering, although the processes are very different from traditional tempering. These methods consist of quenching to a specific temperature that is above the martensite start (Ms) temperature, and then holding at that temperature for extended amounts of time. Depending on the temperature and the amount of time, this allows either pure bainite to form, or holds-off forming the martensite until much of the internal stresses relax. These methods are known as austempering and <b>martempering.</b>|$|E
50|$|Austempering: The {{austempering}} {{process is}} the same as <b>martempering,</b> except the quench is interrupted and the steel is held in the molten salt bath at temperatures between 205°C and 540°C, and then cooled at a moderate rate. The resulting steel, called bainite, produces an acicular microstructure in the steel that has great strength (but less than martensite), greater ductility, higher impact resistance, and less distortion than martensite steel. The disadvantage of austempering is it can only be used on a few steels, and it requires a special salt bath.|$|E
50|$|Molten salts have {{a variety}} of uses. Molten {{chloride}} salt mixtures are commonly used as baths for various alloy heat treatments, such as annealing and <b>martempering</b> of steel. Cyanide and chloride salt mixtures are used for surface modification of alloys such as carburizing and nitrocarburizing of steel. Cryolite (a fluoride salt) is used as a solvent for aluminium oxide in the production of aluminium in the Hall-Héroult process. Fluoride, chloride, and hydroxide salts can be used as solvents in pyroprocessing of nuclear fuel. Molten salts (fluoride, chloride, and nitrate) can also be used as heat transfer fluids as well as for thermal storage. This thermal storage is commonly used in molten salt power plants.|$|E

After marquenching, <b>martempering</b> and austempering heat treatment, there was a cast-welding layer near the steel matrix, an irregular layer near the copper matrix and between {{of them was a}} middle layer. Through X-ray diffraction analysis was used to determine that the interface layer consisted of carbon and CuFeO 2. Through electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA), it was showed that iron atoms and carbons, mostly, diffused into the copper matrix.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of tribological investigations conducted on steel 20 with the carbon content of up to 0. 2 %. The steel was studied in the three conditions: initial (hot-rolled), after heat-treatment (quenching+tempering) and after heat treatment with subsequent severe plastic deformation (SPD) performed by equal channel angular pressing technique (ECAP). It was stated that after various treatments the material acquires various structural conditions and possesses various strength properties and has a considerable difference in oxygen content in the surface layer. This influences the tribological properties during the contact with tool steel. The lowest values of adhesive bond shear strength, friction coefficient and wear rate are demonstrated in the material after <b>martempering</b> with subsequent SPD by ECAP technique. The surface of the investigated material after SPD treatment by the ECAP technique possesses a highest bearing capacity and requires more time for wearing-in in friction assemblies. Oxygen content increase in the form of metal oxides on the surface of low-carbon steels is accompanied by a decrease of the adhesive component of friction coefficien...|$|E
40|$|The impact {{strength}} of hardened Type 410 stainless steel {{is known to}} be adversely af-fected when the steel is tempered between 750 and 1050 F. However, a desirable com-bination of other properties may be obtained by tempering within this range. An investigation was performed {{to determine the extent of}} improvement in {{impact strength}} that may result from certain variations in heat-treating procedures. The hard-ening operation was studied thoroughly, and a large number of commercial heats was in-cluded in the program to establish the consistency of results. It was found that the cooling rate through the martensite transformation range has a significant effect upon the impact properties after subsequent tempering. Rapid cool-ing such as that which occurs during oil quenching is detrimental, but air cooling of 0. 4 -in-diameter bar samples was sufficiently slow to bring about a marked improvement. This improvement was present for samples tempered at all temperatures through 1000 F with the greatest degree of improvement occurring for samples tempered in the range of 700 to 900 F. No improvement was observed for samples tempered at 1100 F and above. <b>Martempering</b> procedures are particularly suited for taking advantage of this phe-nomenon...|$|E
40|$|<b>Martempering</b> {{ductile iron}} (MDI) was {{produced}} {{through the use}} of salt-bath which is of high cost and non-users friendly because of the elevated temperature of the salt, high energy consumption during production, as well as the increased capital equipment cost for the bath and the equipment that operates it. This hinders the MDI production which becomes a big challenge and needs immediate urgent solution which is the rationale behinds this work. This research investigates the possible use of warm water for the interrupted or step quenching processes which is more users friendly and will minimize energy consumption that is {{associated with the use of}} salt-bath because of the elevated temperature of the salt as well as the increased capital equipment cost for the bath and the equipment that operates it. The evaluation of the suitability of warm water for interrupted quenching of ductile cast irons in the production of MDI was carried out. Ductile cast irons used were normalized at a temperature of 850 o C for 60 minutes. The normalized specimens were subsequently heat-treated in muffle furnace to a pre-determined temperature of 850 o C for 30 minutes, then step-quenched in warm water maintained at temperature of 80 o C for 40 seconds followed by tempering at different tempering temperatures (175 o C- 425 o C) and times (30 - 180 minutes).
