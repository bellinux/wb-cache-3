5|$|It is also {{possible}} to explain why zero is even without referring to formal definitions.

From this foundation, one can provide a rationale for the definition itself—and its applicability to zero.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} several round towers {{have been found}} in Malta, and they are {{believed}} to date back to the late Punic or Roman periods. It is possible that these were used as watchtowers, but some historians dispute this since their locations do not really <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in defensive systems.|$|E

5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology. The first was the development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of the geographical distribution of ancient life.|$|E
5|$|In the Puppet Theater minigame, {{the player}} is tasked with {{finishing}} the script {{of an ongoing}} play so that it makes sense. If the player chooses a word that does not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> {{in the context of}} the play, the play abruptly ends and the player is asked to try again; if all of the right words are chosen, the play is given an epilogue and an audience applauds.|$|E
5|$|Python uses duck typing and has {{typed objects}} but untyped {{variable}} names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object {{is not of}} a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of them.|$|E

5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of life {{from his point of}} view.|$|E
5|$|The {{exploratory}} {{parts of}} the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of their dimensionality, as told through artifacts.|$|E
5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie Christie was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to Christie that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. Christie was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E

5000|$|Hypernyms and {{hyponyms}} are asymmetric. Hyponymy can {{be tested}} by substituting X and Y in the sentence ‘X {{is a kind of}} Y’ and determining if it <b>makes</b> <b>sense.</b> [...] For example, ‘A screwdriver is a kind of tool’ <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> but not ‘A tool is a kind of screwdriver’.|$|R
5|$|To {{reduce the}} optical effects workload, Ferren {{rejected}} bluescreen compositing, opting instead for rear projection. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, and would <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> for {{elements such as}} the Enterprises bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a Mac II to create the animatics cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of the variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E

The use of the artificial intelligence of Watson has also {{been found in the}} hospitality industry. GoMoment uses Watson for its Rev1 app, which gives hotel staff a way to quickly respond to questions from guests. Arria NLG has built an app that helps energy companies stay within regulatory guidelines, making it easier for managers to <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> of thousands of pages of legal and technical jargon.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

5|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this method}} {{is that it can}} be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are. Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy. Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies {{are more likely to be}} considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like analogy and homology and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area and in other parts of Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International, Whedon {{announced}} the film would be subtitled Age of Ultron. Despite the subtitle, {{the film is}} not based on the 2013 comic book miniseries Age of Ultron. Feige explained that they simply liked the title Age of Ultron but the plot was taken from decades of Avengers story arcs. Whedon added that Ultron's origin would differ from his comics roots, and that Hank Pym would not be involved with Ultron's creation. Whedon disclosed that Edgar Wright had rights to the character first through his inclusion in Ant-Man, which was already in development. He also thought that Ultron needed to be conceived through the Avengers and since they already had Tony Stark and Bruce Banner on the team, it would not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to bring in a third scientist. Whedon also said the film would have a darker tone due to Ultron's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Cranial display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre cranial structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
