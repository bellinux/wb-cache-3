The basic concept is to crush Quartzite, the source rock to produce sand. This report focuses on sand manufacturing from a quartzite deposit at Dampellessa in Kurunegala district in Sri Lanka. The deposit has to be <b>mined</b> <b>in</b> multiple <b>benches</b> of 10 m height and 80 ° of maximum working angle. Blasting for rock loosening and subsequent ripping with dozers, excavators and hydraulic hammers is recommended as a mining method. The manufacturing process involves crushing of the aggregates after. which grinding and milling is simultaneously done by a specially designed perforated ball mill. Product is made on for customer specifications and suitable for concerting, plastering and as mortar...|$|R
50|$|The {{open pit}} {{operations}} are conventional drill and blast operations, using mining contractors. Mining operations {{are based on}} <b>mining</b> 10m <b>benches</b> <b>in</b> waste, and 5m <b>benches</b> <b>in</b> ore, with 0.5m of sub-drilling.The blastholes are 3.5 in. in diameter, and drilled on a 3m x 2.5m pattern in Los Santos Sur, and a 3m x 2.5m pattern in the other pits.Pre-split lines are drilled {{along the edges of}} final walls. These pre-split holes are 3 in. in diameter, and are 0.8m apart. When water is present, water-resistant emulsion explosives (Riogel) are used.The night following every blasting containing ore, a team of geologists checks with ultraviolet (UV) lighting the real position of the ore after blasting displacement, in order to reduce dilution to the minimum. They also pass the UV lamp by the waste dumps and stockpiles, tocheck for any kind of error on ore/waste selection.During all ore mucking operations, a grade control geologist is always present, to check for any other variations that {{can be seen in the}} pit with the blasted skarn material.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the correlation between strength gain <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press and spirometric parameters of sedentary women submitted to a circuit resistance training (CRT). 14 healthy and non-trained women 39. 8 ± 3. 9 years, 60. 6 ± 6. 6 kg and 163. 6 ± 6. 6 cm were submitted to a CRT. The training consisted of 3 sessions/week of a circuit training of 9 stations with alternating muscle groups. In each session, the subjects performed the circuit 2 times with one set of 8 - 12 maximal repetitions (RM) in each station, during 10 weeks. The spirometric maneuvers, slow vital capacity (SVC), forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were analyzed by spirometric test, while the strength <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press was measured by 1 -RM test. These tests were performed before and after the CRT. Paired Wilcoxon’s test was applied for comparison between the pre versus post CRT values of the spirometric parameters and of the 1 -RM test; and the Spearman’s test for correlation between strength gain <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press and spirometric parameters in the pre and post CRT (α= 0. 05 for all statistical tests). In post CRT the strength <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press test increased, but there was not modification in spirometric parameters; and there was not correlation between the strength gain <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press and the spirometric parameters analyzed. Therefore, our findings suggest that the gain of strength <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> press induced by CRT do not change spirometric parameters in healthy women...|$|R

40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{microarray}} technology it has been possible to measure thousands of expression values of genes in a single experiment. Analysis of large scale geonomics data, notably gene expression, has initially focused on clustering methods. Recently, biclustering techniques were proposed for revealing submatrices showing unique patterns. Biclustering or simultaneous clustering of both genes and conditions is challenging particularly {{for the analysis of}} high-dimensional gene expression data in information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and data <b>mining.</b> <b>In</b> biclustering of microarray data, several objectives have to be optimized simultaneously and often these objectives are in conflict with each other. A multi objective model is very suitable for solving this problem. Our method proposes a algorithm which is based on multi objective Simulated Annealing for discovering biclusters in gene expression data. Experimental result <b>in</b> <b>bench</b> mark data base present a significant improvement in overlap among biclusters and coverage of elements in gene expression and quality of biclusters...|$|R
