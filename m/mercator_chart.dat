40|$|The “true {{division}} of the nautical meridian,” that is, the correct spacing of the parallels of latitude on the <b>Mercator</b> <b>chart,</b> presented theoretical problems to 17 th-century mathematicians. Edmond Halley solved the problem by showing that under stereographic projection a rhumb line (line of constant bearing) projected into a logarithmic spiral. Hence he developed a rule, simple to apply, for calculating the meridional distance corresponding to any given latitude interval. Halley's younger contemporary, Roger Cotes, showed how his own logometric methods yielded Halley's rule more economically, and further, {{that the use of}} the logarithmic spiral was not necessary...|$|E

50|$|Edward Wright (baptised 8 October 1561; died November 1615) was an English {{mathematician}} and cartographer {{noted for}} his book Certaine Errors in Navigation (1599; 2nd ed., 1610), which {{for the first time}} explained the mathematical basis of the Mercator projection, and set out a reference table giving the linear scale multiplication factor as a function of latitude, calculated for each minute of arc up to a latitude of 75°. This was in fact a table of values of the integral of the secant function, and was the essential step needed to make practical both the making and the navigational use of <b>Mercator</b> <b>charts.</b>|$|R

The line-of-sight accelerations are plotted on Aeronautical Chart and Information Center <b>mercator</b> <b>charts</b> (scale 1 : 1, 000, 000) as contours at 10 -milligal intervals. Direct correlations between gravity variations and surface features are easily determined. Theophilus, Hipparchus, and Ptolemaeus are negative features, whereas Mare Nectaris is a large positive region. The acceleration profiles over Mare Nectaris are suggestive of a broad disk near the surface rather than a deeply buried spherical body...|$|R
50|$|A {{misunderstanding}} could arise {{because the}} term “rhumb” had no precise meaning {{when it came}} into use. It applied equally well to the windrose lines as it did to loxodromes because the term only applied “locally” and only meant whatever a sailor did in order to sail with constant bearing, with all the imprecision that that implies. Therefore “rhumb” was applicable to the straight lines on portolans when portolans were in use, as well as always applicable to straight lines on <b>Mercator</b> <b>charts.</b> For short distances portolan “rhumbs” do not meaningfully differ from Mercator rhumbs, but these days “rhumb” is synonymous with the mathematically precise “loxodrome” {{because it has been}} made synonymous retrospectively.|$|R

5000|$|His {{chart of}} the northwestern coast of Africa, {{displayed}} above is executed using the so-called [...] "plain chart model", where observed latitudes and magnetic directions were plotted {{directly into the}} plane, with a constant scale, as if the Earth were flat.

50|$|The {{stereographic}} projection solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the declination circles are enlarged {{in such a}} way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in <b>Mercator</b> <b>charts.)</b> Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.|$|R
500|$|According to Parsons and Morris, {{the use of}} Wright's {{publications}} {{by later}} mathematicians is the [...] "greatest tribute to his life's work". Wright's work was relied on by Dutch astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius, noted for the law of refraction now known as Snell's law, for his navigation treatise Tiphys Batavus (Batavian Tiphys, 1624); and by Adriaan Metius, the geometer and astronomer from Holland, for Primum Mobile (1631). Following Wright's proposals, Richard Norwood measured a degree on a great circle of the earth at , publishing the information in 1637. Wright was praised by Charles Saltonstall in The Navigator (1642) and by John Collins in Navigation by the Mariners Plain Scale New Plain'd (1659), Collins stating that <b>Mercator's</b> <b>chart</b> ought [...] "more properly to be called Wright's chart". The Caius annals contained the following epitaph: [...] "Of him it may truly be said, that he studied more to serve the public than himself".|$|R
60|$|It is not {{of course}} {{supposed}} that all the modifications here indicated co-existed at the same time. We {{have good reason to}} believe, from the known distribution of animals in the Tertiary period, that land-communications have at times existed between Europe or Asia and North America, either by way of Behring's Straits, or by Iceland, Greenland, and Labrador. But the same evidence shows that these land-communications were {{the exception rather than the}} rule, and that they occurred only at long intervals and for short periods, so as at no time to bring about anything like a complete interchange of the productions of the two continents.[24] We may therefore admit that the {85} communication between the tropical and Arctic oceans was occasionally interrupted in one or other direction; but if we look at a globe instead of a <b>Mercator's</b> <b>chart</b> of the world, we shall see that the disproportion between the extent of the polar and tropical seas is so enormous that a single wide opening, with an adequate impulse to carry in a considerable stream of warm water, would be amply sufficient for the complete abolition of polar snow and ice, when aided by the absence of any great areas of high land within the polar circle, such high land being, as we have seen, essential to the production of perpetual snow even at the present time.|$|R
50|$|The portolan {{combined}} the exact notations {{of the text}} of the periplus or pilot book with the decorative illustrations of a medieval T and O map. In addition, the charts provided realistic depictions of shores. They were meant for practical use by mariners of the period. Portolans failed {{to take into account the}} curvature of the earth; as a result, they were not helpful as navigational tools for crossing the open ocean, being replaced by later <b>Mercator</b> projection <b>charts.</b> Portolans were most useful in close quarters' identification of landmarks. Portolani were also useful for navigation in smaller bodies of water, such as the Mediterranean, Black, or Red Seas.|$|R
40|$|Map {{projection}} is {{an important}} component of modern cartography, and involves many fussy mathematical analysis processes, such as the power series expansions of elliptical functions, differential of complex and implicit functions, elliptical integral and the operation of complex numbers. The derivation of these problems by hand not only consumes much time and energy but also makes mistake easily, and sometimes can not be realized at all because of the impossible complexity. The research achievements in mathematical analysis of map projection by computer algebra are systematically reviewed in five aspects, i. e., the symbolic expressions of forward and inverse solution of ellipsoidal latitudes, the direct transformations between map projections with different distortion properties, expressions of Gauss projection by complex function, mathematical analysis of oblique <b>Mercator</b> projection, polar <b>chart</b> projection with its transformation. Main problems that need to be further solved in this research field are analyzed. It will be helpful to promote the development of map projection...|$|R

500|$|As the Chronologia {{was going}} to press in 1569, Mercator also {{published}} {{what was to become}} his most famous map: Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata (A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a rhumb line) did not correspond to a straight line on their <b>chart.</b> <b>Mercator's</b> solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars [...] suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator Projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. At a later stage this mariner's map became a general purpose map of the world although its distortion at high latitudes was abundantly evident. Usage other than for marine charts is now deprecated and more suitable projections are available.|$|R
