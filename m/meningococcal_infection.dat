40|$|AIMS—To {{examine a}} number of simple {{clinical}} features and investigations in children with a non-blanching rash to see which predict <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection.</b>  METHODS—A total of 233 infants and children up to 15 years of age presenting with a non-blanching rash were studied {{over a period of}} 12 months. Clinical features and laboratory investigations were recorded at presentation. The ability of each to predict <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was examined.  RESULTS—Eleven per cent had proven <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Children with <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> {{were more likely to be}} ill, pyrexial (> 38. 5 °C), have purpura, and a capillary refill time of more than two seconds than non-meningococcal children. Five children with meningococcal disease had an axillary temperature below 37. 5 °C. No child with a rash confined to the distribution of the superior vena cava had <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Investigations were less helpful, although children with <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> were more likely to have an abnormal neutrophil count and a prolonged international normalised ratio.

Children with a non-blanching rash confined to the distribution of the superior vena cava are very unlikely to have <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Measurement of C reactive protein may be helpful—no child with a normal value had <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection.</b> Lack of fever at the time of assessment does not exclude meningococcal disease. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> causes severe, rapidly {{progressing}} {{illness and}} reporting of cases is mandatory in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The NSW Department of Health operates near real-time Emergency Department (ED) surveillance that includes capture and {{statistical analysis of}} clinical preliminary diagnoses. The system can provide alerts in response to specific diagnoses entered in the ED computer system. This study assessed whether once daily reporting of clinical diagnoses of <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> using the ED surveillance system {{provides an opportunity for}} timelier public health response for this disease. Methods The study involved a prospective and retrospective component. First, reporting of ED diagnoses of <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> from the ED surveillance system prospectively operated in parallel with conventional surveillance which requires direct telephone reporting of this scheduled medical condition to local public health authorities by hospitals and laboratories when a <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> diagnosis is made. Follow-up of the ED diagnoses determined whether <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was confirmed, and the time difference between ED surveillance report and notification by conventional means. Second, cases of <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> reported by conventional surveillance during 2004 were retrospectively matched to ED visits to determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of ED surveillance. Results During the prospective evaluation, 31 patients were diagnosed with <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> in participating EDs. Of these, 12 had confirmed meningococcal disease, resulting in a PPV of 38. 7 %. All confirmed cases were notified earlier to public health authorities by conventional reporting. Of 149 cases of notified meningococcal disease identified retrospectively, 130 were linked to an ED visit. The sensitivity and PPV of the ED diagnosis for <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> was 36. 2 % and 36. 7 %, respectively. Conclusions Based on prospective evaluation, it is reassuring that existing mechanisms for reporting <b>meningococcal</b> <b>infection</b> perform well and are timely. The retrospective evaluation found low sensitivity and PPV of ED diagnoses for meningococcal disease. Even if more rapid forwarding of ED meningococcal diagnoses to public health authorities were possible, the low sensitivity and PPV do not justify this. In this study, use of an ED surveillance system to augment conventional surveillance of this scheduled medical condition did not demonstrate a benefit. </p...|$|E
