500|$|... "I'll <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> Out of You" [...] {{was written}} {{to replace the}} song [...] "We'll <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> of You" [...] after the film's {{original}} songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt (1998). Prior to Mulan, Osmond had auditioned {{for the role of}} Hercules in Disney's Hercules (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that he sounded too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song, [...] "I'll <b>Make</b> <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> Out of You" [...] is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her.|$|E

Michael Dequina of The Movie Report observed that [...] "Mulan's transformation is highly reminiscent of Demi Moore's in last year's Disney drama G.I.
