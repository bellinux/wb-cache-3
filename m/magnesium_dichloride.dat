40|$|The {{effect was}} {{investigated}} of {{the addition of}} different protic compounds, such as water, n-butanol, butanoic acid and methyl ethyl ketone, to triisobutylaluminium used as the cocatalyst for an Hf-Ti bimetallic catalyst supported on <b>magnesium</b> <b>dichloride</b> (Ti 1. 0 Hf 1. 3 Mg 2. 0 Al 0. 85 Cl 12. 45) in the polymerization of ethylene. All the above compounds show a similar behaviour by decreasing catalyst activity, increasing polymer molecular weight and narrowing polymer molecular weight distribution. Minor differences are observed in the end-group unsaturations. An attempt {{has been made to}} correlate these effects to the interaction of hafnium and titanium sites with the reaction products from AlR 3 and the different protic compounds...|$|E
40|$|An assay system {{employing}} radiolabeled, heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae {{and human}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes was utilized to study serum pneumococcal opsonic requirements. Comparing the kinetics of phagocytosis in normal serum, heat-inactivated serum, immunoglobulin G (IgG) -deficient serum, C 2 -deficient serum, and <b>magnesium</b> <b>dichloride</b> ethyleneglycol-tetraacetic acid (MgEGTA) -chelated serum allowed {{definition of the}} opsonic requirements for four pneumococcal serotypes: VI XVIII, XXIII, and XXV. All four serotypes were efficiently opsonized in 10 % normal serum. Only type XVIII was opsonized in heat-inactivated serum. All four were also opsonized in IgG-deficient serum but not as efficiently as in normal serum. Opsonization via the alternative pathway was diminished for all four serotypes in 10 % MgEGTA-chelated and C 2 -deficient serum. Furthermore, by varying the concentration of MgEGTA-chelated serum, {{it was found that}} type XXV was least efficiently opsonized via the alternative pathway. The quantitative nature of this assay system will permit measurement of bacterial and host factors that may contribute to host susceptibility to pneumococcal infection...|$|E
40|$|Neste trabalho foram preparados catalisadores a partir da imobilização do {{precursor}} catalítico (nBuCp) 2 ZrCl 2 em adutos de cloreto de magnésio (MgCl 2. nEtOH). Observou-se que o conteúdo residual de etanol do suporte teve influência significativa no teor de metal fixado, o qual variou de 0, 5 a 1, 5 % em peso de Zr/MgCl 2, bem como na atividade do catalisador em homopolimerização de etileno. Dentro da faixa de temperatura de 25 a 75 °C, o maior rendimento foi obtido com o catalisador preparado a 25 °C. Com base nos resultados, foram sugeridas as reações, possíveis de ocorrer, durante a preparação do catalisador. Os polímeros foram avaliados quanto ao seu peso molecular e polidispersão. This work {{describes the}} preparation of catalysts by the immobilization of bis(n-butylcyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride, (nBuCp) 2 ZrCl, on <b>magnesium</b> <b>dichloride</b> adducts, MgCl 2. nEtOH. The metal content on the support, which varied from 0, 5 to 1, 5 wt. -% Zr/MgCl 2 and the catalysts activity were dependent on the ethanol content. In the temperature immobilization range between 25 and 75 °C, the highest Zr incorporation and polymerization yield were obtained with the catalyst prepared at 25 °C. Based on the results obtained in this work, a series of reactions that may occur between the catalyst components during its preparation are proposed. The polyethylenes obtained were characterized by its molecular weight and polydispersivity...|$|E
