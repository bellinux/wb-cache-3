40|$|A {{procedure}} that uses gas-liquid chromatography and a pattern recognition computer model {{was developed for}} distinguishing cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from cultures of other mycobacteria, common bacteria, and fungi. In this procedure, a sample of a culture preparation is methanolyzed and trimethylsilylated sequentially and injected into a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. A pattern recognition procedure computes an error score by comparing the gas-liquid chromatography peak responses of a culture to those of a standard <b>M.</b> tuberculosis <b>culture.</b> Ten <b>M.</b> tuberculosis <b>cultures</b> {{were used in the}} development of the pattern recognition model. Computed error scores of 5 or less were established for identifying an <b>M.</b> tuberculosis <b>culture.</b> The method was evaluated with two sets of test samples, non-M. tuberculosis and <b>M.</b> tuberculosis <b>cultures.</b> Sample identification was correct for all 14 <b>M.</b> tuberculosis <b>cultures</b> (<b>M.</b> tuberculosis or non-M. tuberculosis), 45 fungal cultures, 94 bacterial cultures, and all but 1 of 18 cultures of mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT). The false prediction represented an isolate of M. fortuitum. For M. tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, and MOTT cultures, the ranges of error scores were 1 to 5, 16 to 33, 13 to 34, and 4 to 26, respectively. Therefore, we have demonstrated that this diagnostic model can distinguish M. tuberculosis from non-M. tuberculosis cultures with a high degree of accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Telkov et al. (2006) {{indicated}} that Rpf was a peptidoglycan-hydrolyzing enzyme, and strongly {{suggested that this}} specific activity was responsible for its growth promotion and resuscitation activity. Moreover, Mukamolova et al. (2006) demonstrated that Rpf stimulated bacterial culturability and resuscitation due to its muralytic activity. However, pure Rpf protein, both native (purified from <b>M.</b> luteus <b>culture</b> supernatant) and recombinant was prone to lose its activity after storage at 4 °C for 1 week. Recombinant Rpf protein was also less active than native Rpf protein. Furthermore, in the <b>M.</b> luteus <b>culture</b> supernatant, several other proteins had been found to possess the same muralytic activity as Rpf protein (Mukamolova et al. 2006). The resuscitation and stimulatory activities of proteins from <b>M.</b> luteus <b>culture</b> supernatant had been recently verified (Ding 2004; Su et al. 2013; Su et al. 2013). Therefore, {{for the purpose of}} resuscitating and stimulating VBNC or uncultured bacteria, proteins from <b>M.</b> luteus <b>culture</b> supernatant are more convenient and cost-effective than purified Rpf protein. While some studies have focused on the function of Rpf protein from the perspective of medicine and epidemiology (Dwivedi and Jaykus 2011; Hett and Rubin 2008), little has been done to investigate the capability of proteins from <b>M.</b> luteus <b>culture</b> supernatant to aid in culturing difficult-to-culture bacteria, and for exploring potential environmental functions of VBNC or uncultured bacteria.|$|R

40|$|Abstract There {{is little}} {{understanding}} of the effect that reactive oxygen metabolites have on cellular behavior during the processes of invasion and metastasis. These oxygen metabolites could interact {{with a number of}} targets modulating their function such as enzymes involved in basement membrane dissolution, adhesion molecules involved in motility or receptors involved in proliferation. We investigated the effect of increased scavenging of superoxide anions on the expression of the urokinase receptor (uPAR) in PC- 3 M human prostate cancer cells. Urokinase receptor is a GPI-linked cell surface molecule which mediates multiple functions including adhesion, proliferation and pericellular proteolysis. Addition of the superoxide scavenger 4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPOL) to PC- 3 <b>M</b> <b>cultures</b> stimulated expression of uPAR protein peaking between 48 and 72 hours. Cell surface expression of the uPAR was also increased. Surprisingly, uPAR transcript levels increased only slightly and this mild increase did not coincide with the striking degree of protein increase. This disparity indicates that the TEMPOL effect on uPAR occurs through a post-transcriptional mechanism. TEMPOL presence in PC- 3 <b>M</b> <b>cultures</b> reduced intracellular superoxide-type species by 75 % as assayed by NBT dye conversion; however this reduction significantly diminished within hours following TEMPOL removal. The time gap between TEMPOL treatment and peak uPAR protein expression suggests that reduction of reactive oxygen metabolites in prostate cancer cells initiates a multistep pathway which requires several hours to culminate in uPAR induction. These findings reveal a novel pathway for uPAR regulation involving reactive oxygens such as superoxide anion. </p...|$|R

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of cottage cheese, agglutination occurs when lactic cultures form long chains and clumps of chains. These chain of cells often form a net-like structure that fall {{to the bottom of}} the vat and sweeps or entraps the casein in the skim milk In this study, skim milk homogenized at 0. 28 (single stage) and 71 kg/cm 2 (dual stage, 35 kg/cm 2 second stage) was used in {{the manufacture}} of cottage cheese. Each lot of skim milk manufacture into cottage cheese was inoculated with one bulk starter (lactic <b>culture</b> <b>M</b> 30, lactic <b>culture</b> <b>M</b> 37, or Lactococcus lactis subsp. Cremoris UC 310. Each bulk starter was homogenized at 0. 35 (single stage), 176, and 246 kg/cm 2 (dual stage, 35 kg/cm 2 second stage). The 18 different bulk starters were used to inoculate 3 different skim milk treatments to produce a total of 54 bulk starter-skim milk treatment combinations. All 54 starter-skim milk treatment combinations were randomized prior to their manufacture. The experiment was replicated two times in {{the manufacture of}} 108 vats of cottage cheese. Culture agglutination was determined by pH and curd total solids. Culture agglutination decreased as the homogenization pressure applied to the bulk starter was increased. The agglutination, also, decreases with increased homogenization pressure applied to skim milk. L. lactis subsp.
