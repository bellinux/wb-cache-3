40|$|When {{a static}} {{stimulus}} appears successively at two different locations, we perceive a transition {{of the stimulus}} across them—apparent motion.

However, little is known about whether visual properties of an object engaged in apparent motion are maintained in this representation.

The results show that the regions of V 1 contain information of the intermediate representations (0 ° vs. 90 °) between the two gratings when they correspond to the path of perceived rotation but not when they are no longer on the <b>motion</b> <b>path.</b> This suggests that V 1 generates neural representation of visual features that do not exist in the physical stimulus, but that correspond to our conscious perceptual experience of dynamic visual objects...|$|E

40|$|A key {{component}} of any interactive computer graphics application is the system for tracking user or input device motion. An accurate estimate of the position and/or orientation of the virtual world tracking targets is critical to effectively creating a convincing virtual experience. Tracking {{is one of the}} pillars upon which a virtual reality environment is built and it imposes a fundamental limit on how real the “reality ” of Virtual Reality can be. Whether working on a new or modified tracking system, designers typically begin the design process with requirements for the working volume, the expected user motion, and the infrastructure. Considering these requirements they develop a candidate design that includes one or more tracking mediums (optical, acoustic, etc.), associated source/sensor devices (hardware), and an algorithm (software) for combining the information from the devices. They then simulate the candidate system to estimate the performance for some specific <b>motion</b> <b>paths.</b> Thus the predictions of such traditional simulations typically include the combined effect of hardware and algorithm choices, but only for the chosen <b>motion</b> <b>paths.</b> Before tracker algorithm selection, and irrespective of the <b>motion</b> <b>paths,</b> it is the choice and configuration of the source/sensor devices that are critical to performance.

40|$|Background: Human {{vision is}} vital in {{determining}} our {{interaction with the}} outside world. In this study we characterize our ability to judge changes {{in the direction of}} motion of objects–a common task which can allow us either to intercept moving objects, or else avoid them if they pose a threat. Methodology/Principal Findings: Observers were presented with objects which moved across a computer monitor on a linear path until the midline, at which point they changed their direction of motion, and observers were required to judge the direction of change. In keeping with the variety of objects we encounter in the real world, we varied characteristics of the moving stimuli such as velocity, extent of <b>motion</b> <b>path</b> and the object size. Furthermore, we compared performance for moving objects with the ability of observers to detect a deviation in a line which formed the static trace of the <b>motion</b> <b>path,</b> since {{it has been suggested that}} a form of static memory trace may form the basis for these types of judgment. The static line judgments were well described by a ‘scale invariant ’ model in which any two stimuli which possess the same twodimensional geometry (length/width) result in the same level of performance. Performance for the moving objects was entirely different. Irrespective of the path length, object size or velocity of <b>motion,</b> <b>path</b> deviation thresholds depended simply upon the duration of the <b>motion</b> <b>path</b> in seconds.
