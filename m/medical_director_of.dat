40|$|Palliative care {{within the}} {{community}} requires well coordinated multidisciplinary teamworking, involving both primary and secondary care practitioners. 'Out-of-hours' periods are a potentially problematic time for delivery of high quality care. We report on two national surveys-one <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> out-of-hours general practitioner cooperatives, the other <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> specialist palliative care units. The aim was to describe general practitioners' and specialists' perspectives on the availability and scope of community nursing and specialist palliative care services. The results point to wide variation in service provision {{within the community}}. The two groups differed strikingly in their perceptions, the general practitioners being much less positive than the specialists about the availability of specialist advice and admission to specialist units out of hours.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in our ability}} to test persons presymptomatically for genetic diseases have generated increasing concern that genetic information will be abused by insurance companies. Reasoning that the insurance companies may have the strongest interest in using genetic data and that the <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> those companies with responsibility for rating applicants would be a good source of information on the use of such data, we conducted a large survey <b>of</b> <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> <b>of</b> North American life insurance companies. We received responses from 27 <b>medical</b> <b>directors.</b> Our results suggest that (1) few insurers perform genetic tests on applicants, but most are interested in accessing genetic test information about applicants that already exists; (2) the degree of insurers' interest in using genetic test results may depend on the face amount of the policy applied for and on the specificity and sensitivity of the test; (3) many companies employ underwriting guidelines with respect to certain genetic conditions but may not always have specific actuarial data in house to support their rating decisions; (4) a considerable degree of subjectivity is involved in most insurers' rating decisions; and (5) some <b>of</b> the <b>medical</b> <b>directors</b> who responded to our survey are not fully informed about certain basic principles of medical genetics...|$|R
