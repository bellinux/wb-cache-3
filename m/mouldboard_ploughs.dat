40|$|Animal-drawn <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughs</b> {{are more}} {{expedient}} at controlling weeds among crops grown in rows than cultivators or hand labour. In Zimbabwe many smallholder farmers own just {{one piece of}} animal-drawn equipment, a mouldboard plough. To weed their maize and cotton crops they remove the mouldboard and cultivate with just the ploughshare. It means three or four passes {{up and down the}} row, and some hand weeding between plants. That requires some 85 labour hours/hectare, compared to 132 labour hours for just hand weeding. Using a proper cultivator reduces labour requirements to 68 hours/hectare. Research by the Silsoe Research Institute in collaboration with the Department of Research and Specialist Services in Harare Zimbabwe, is showing that even less labour is required if farmers do not remove the mouldboard from their ploughs. Using the complete plough takes 55 labour hours/ hectare, as the plough passes up and down the row just once. Hand weeding is eliminated at first weeding because the action of the plough ridges up the row-crops, smothering weeds around the plants in the process. Weeding with just the plough-share has other disadvantages. Yields seem to be lower than from crops that have been hand weeded or crops weeded with a cultivator. Leaving the mouldboard on the plough brings yields up to the same level-and Gives the best return for labour. The technique is also the most efficient at retaining moisture in the soil when furrows created between the crop rows are tied.

40|$|Abstract: Soil {{adheres to}} the {{surfaces}} of soil engaging components of various tools. The adhesion of soil increases the draft and adversely affects the quality of work. For example, up to 50 % of the gross energy required for tillage operations may be consumed by adhesion and friction between soil and tillage tools. Therefore, {{it is important to}} find out the ways to reduce adhesion of soil to {{the surfaces of}} various tools. Soil animals such as ground beetles stay in moist sticky soils for extended periods without soil sticking to their bodies. The soil adhesion preventing mechanisms of such animals can be used as guide for improving the scouring properties of various tools. Both the surface morphology and chemical composition of soil animal’s cuticle play important role in preventing adhesion of soil to their bodies. The surfaces of <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughs</b> and bulldozing plates were modified based on the surface morphology of ground beetle and tested in the laboratory. Two materials such as Steel- 45 and Ultra High Molecular Weight – Polyethylene (UHMW-PE) were used for convexes.

40|$|For {{historic}} reasons, <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughs</b> have a {{wide variety}} of surfaces. The concentration of manufacturers has reduced the number of different types but there are still few complete geometric descriptions of the surfaces of a mouldboard plough. With the aim of describing and characterizing the three-dimensional shape of the plough, permitting the obtaining of a tool for an adequate preparation of the soil for cultivation, as well as reducing labour costs, in this work different approximation methods of three-dimensional surfaces have been explored. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the application of non uniform rational B-splines, combined with an optimization algorithm based on assigning different weights to the control points of the surface analyzed, is a method which succeeds in improving the quality of the fit with respect to other algorithms proposed by several authors in different previous works also based on the use of splines. The root mean square error of the fit of these algorithms to a mouldboard plough was the lowest 1. 9. mm in the observed, and increases up to 14. 4. mm using a simple Bézier bicubic parametric surface. Using the efficiency index of Nash and Sutclife (1970), the highest value, 0. 995, corresponded to the non uniform rational B-splines method. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

Shallow spring ploughing (10 cm) with the Kverneland Ecomat has shown to be a good alternative to conventional autumn ploughing when growing spring crops. During the season 2005 tilling with the Ecomat resulted in a higher yield than conventional ploughing.

(2) Plants grown in field experiments, with and without recompaction in three primary tillage systems: <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing,</b> chisel ploughing to 10 cm, chisel ploughing to 20 cm. The recompacted plots were trafficked twice track-by-track with a tractor, weight 4500 kg, inflation pressure 50 kPa. In the soil cores, no general relationship between yield and bulk density was found.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of a reversible animal-drawn plough and a ridger is presented. The plough was developed {{on the basis of}} laboratory experiments reported earlier to determine optimum parameters for acurved implement. The basic design principles of conventional <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughs</b> and an ard were taken into consideration. A safety mechanism was developed which was a shear bolt. Apart from the share point, all components of the plough were made from wood, and the total mass was about 10 kg. The orientational parameters of the developed implement such as the tail angle, rake angle and the side-rake angle can be varied to suit the required soil operations and the pulling capability of the draught animals. The developed plough can also be used as a ridger by mounting an extra wing on the plough. Comparative field experiments were conducted in cooperation with the International Livestock Research Institute. ILRI, using the developed and traditional ard-type plough in Ethiopia. Tests were carried out in fields under various soil conditions using oxen and cows. The results showed that the draught required by the developed plough was about 30 percent less than the draught of the traditional Ethiopian ard. A frequency analysis was made to determine the dominant frequencies of the reversible plough under working conditions. The identified frequencies were 0. 5, 1. 3 and 3. 3 Hz. Preliminary assessments were made to compare the performances of a pair of cows with a pair of oxen in relation to speed and forces when pulling the developed plough. A pair of cows moved faster (an average of 0. 84 m/s) than the pair of oxen (an average of 0. 63 m/s) and exerted proportionally greater pulling forces when operating in the same field. The difference in speed is explained by the greater body weight of the cows and the correspondingly greater pull that could be exerted...|$|E
30|$|While {{disturbance}} {{is widely}} recognised {{as a primary}} influence on plant community in agro-ecosystems, weed species diversity and composition {{may be influenced by}} a suite of factors with varying degrees of intensity. These factors include agricultural practices such as weeding, soil tillage and agro-chemicals (Pal et al. 2013; Armengot et al. 2011). Soil tillage has the potential to change the plant community composition and diversity. The frequency of cultivating the land influences changes in weed species richness and diversity (Shemdoe et al. 2008). Soil tillage promotes establishment of highly competitive plant species. It makes soil suitable for germination and seedling establishment (Handa et al. 2012). In minimum till systems, weed seeds accumulate on the soil surface where conditions are favourable for seed germination and thus have high species richness and diversity (Yenish et al. 1992; Shemdoe et al. 2008). Broadleaf weed species tend to dominate under conventional tillage systems and are thought to be stimulated by light as they are brought to the soil surface (Froud-Williams et al. 1983). A study by Yenish et al. (1992) showed that non-tillage systems typically have higher populations of small-seeded annual weeds such as Setaria spp. and Amaranthus spp. while tillage systems using <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughs</b> have more large-seeded annual weeds like Xanthium strumarium L. However, studies by Swanton et al. (1999) concluded that there was no consistent relationship between weed diversity and tillage system. This contradictory observation suggests that there may be other factors other than tillage that may influence weed density. Such factors include crop rotation (Swanton and Weise 1991; Andersson and Milberg 1998; Legere and Samson 1999) and cover crops which may have demonstrated allelopathic properties that inhibited weed establishment and growth (Putnam et al. 1983; Mohler and Teasdale 1993). These cover crops have also been found to suppress weeds by competing for water, light and nutrients (Barnes and Putnam 1983). However, there has not been adequate information available on these factors on how they influence weed species composition and diversity in the agro-ecosystems of the seasonal floodplains in the Okavango Delta.|$|E

While rice remains the main crop in Cambodia, the production of other crops is undergoing a rapid expansion and will be especially important for the development of those parts of the Kingdom unsuited to lowland rice. We present results from socio-economic surveys carried out in the Battambang, Kampong Cham and Takeo Provinces to identify available resources, management practices and key constraints for emerging upland cropping systems. These are mainly cash crops, so the important issues to consider are profitability, technological and management changes, and household and social issues. The surveys were conducted in the Districts of Kamrieng, Sampov Lun, Rotonak Mondol and Banan in Battambang Province, Chamkar Leu, Ou Reang Ov and Tbong Khmum in Kampong Cham Province, and Tramkak in Takeo Province. Sample sizes were 181 in Battambang and Kampong Cham, and 50 in Takeo. Generally farm families had a male head aged in the mid- 40 s, with 3 to 4 years of schooling.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to compare the {{performance}} and the costs of alternative tillage systems and machinery, in both energy and economic terms. To determine the energy requirements of tillage implements, experimentation in field conditions and controlled laboratory was conducted. Costs of alternative implements and complete systems were analysed. The field experiment was undertaken to determine the performance of tillage implements in real conditions. Draught force and area of disturbance of the implements were measured and specific resistance calculated. The implements involved in the experiment were 4 furrow <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> 3 furrow disc plough, disc harrow and 7 winged tines. The <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> was operating at two different depths. Two tractors were used for execution of the implement and the wheel slip was measured. The soil bin studies were conducted in additional evaluation of the implements. The laboratory conditions ensure the uniformity of each test. The experiment was carried out to determine draught force, area of disturbance and specific resistance. The experiment involved single furrow <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> disc plough, disc harrow and winged tines. Winged tines were made up of four different wing widths. Finally, an economic cost calculator was developed to compare the costs of different implements and tillage systems. Technical parameters and current prices of the implements were obtained from the manufacturers. The results from the field experiment show that there is a similar draught force per unit implement for <b>mouldboard</b> and disc <b>ploughs,</b> while draught force of <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> is significantly higher. The tillage efficiency of all implements is similar, with a mean of specific resistance of 58 kN/m 2 and a range of 15 kN/m 2. In the soil bin the vertical force preventing penetration occurred for disc plough and disc harrow. The specific resistance of the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> had the lowest value, while the specific resistance of disc plough was higher by a factor of 1. 65. By increasing the wing width of the tines the draught force was increased but the specific resistance decreased.

Penetrometer resistance (PR) were measured in the field one month after sowing. Plant density of barley was also counted one month after sowing. Significantly higher Ks value was found for shallow tillage at the depth of 15 - 20 and 25 - 30 cm.

Project R 2 - 4111, started in 1999, investigates how the time of primary tillage affects the yield. Both tillage with a <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> and a stubble cultivator is tested at three different occasions, called early, normal and late tillage. Project R 2 - 7115, started in 1997, investigates how the tire inflation pressure affects the yield. Tillage with a <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> and a stubble cultivator tested with normal and low inflation pressures in the tires, also a treatment with permanent grassland is used as a comparison. Parameters that were compared were hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, tensile strength, aggregate stability, penetration resistance {{and the quality of the}} seedbed. Draught requirement was measured at each primary tillage occasion. The results showed no major differences in soil properties depending on tillage time or tire inflation pressure, but there were trends that the soil structure was poorer in treatments with normal inflation pressure and late tillage [...] Distinct differences were found between <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> and stubble cultivator treatments for some of the parameters. The stubble cultivated treatment had a higher proportion of soil aggregates > 5 mm and lower proportion of aggregates < 2 mm after sowing than the treatment with <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough.</b> For the stubble cultivated plots the penetration resistance were higher at the depth of 10 - 30 cm. In the stubble cultivated treatments the bulk density was higher and the hydraulic conductivity lower, but the results for hydraulic conductivity were insecure because of the great variability for this property. In the treatment with <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> the aggregate stability was lower than for stubble cultivation. The tire inflation pressure affected the penetration resistance, where the treatment with low tire inflation pressure had a lower penetration resistance at the level of 12 - 25 cm. Ploughless tillage was cheaper than tillage with a <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> but between the different times of tillage there were only small differences in machinery costs. The treatment with low inflation pressure was more expensive to till than the treatment with normal inflation pressure. The early tillage in R 2 - 4111 has had the best yield as an average for several years and the late tillage the lowest yield. The time of tillage was most important in the stubble cultivated treatments. In experiment R 2 - 7115 there were no differences in yield between the tillage systems but the treatment with low inflation pressure has had the best yield as an average for several years. To a farmer with an aim to achieve as good economy as possible, these field trials show that tillage with a stubble cultivator on this soil reduces costs without lowering crop yield. Early tillage and low tire inflation pressure increases yield which may further improve the economy...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in 2006 to investigate the effects of deep rotary cultivation on sugar beet growth. The background to the experiment was a 2005 study showing potentially higher yield, higher cleanness and higher sugar con tent when primary tillage was carried out to 35 cm depth with a rotary cultivator. On four field sites in Skåne (L:a Isie, Ädelholm, Stävie and Vragerup), five different treatments were compared: <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn to 20 cm; <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn to 20 cm + rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the autumn to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; and <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the spring to 20 cm. The rotary cultivator used in the treatments is manufactured by a Dutch company, Imants. The implement cultivates the soil with spade tines fitted on arms that are mounted on a horizontal rotating PTO-driven axle. Beet plants were inspected and yield determined in the experiment, and three soil parameters were examined: penetration resistance, water infiltration and infiltration of blue dye. Root shape was also examined. The site at Stävie was not harvested due to poor beet establishment. At the other sites, the highest yield was found when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. Pooling of the results from the three harvested sites showed that the yield was significantly higher (+ 4 %) and the sugar content was also significantly higher (+ 0. 3 %) when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn compared with conventional <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> in the autumn. The penetration resistance tended to be lower and the water infiltration rate higher when soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. The amount of blue colour covering the soil was also higher. The conclusion is that deep rotary cultivation has good biological potential. However this study was unable to determine the reasons behind this potential...|$|R
40|$|Water, wind, or tillage-induced {{soil erosion}} can {{significantly}} degrade soil quality. Therefore, understanding soil displacement through tillage translocation {{is an important}} step toward developing tillage practices that do not degrade soil resources. Our primary objective was {{to determine the effects of}} soil condition (i. e. grassland stubble versus previously tilled soil), opening angle, and harrow speed on soil translocation. A second field study also conducted on a Lixisol but only in the stubble field, quantified displacement effects of <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing.</b> The field studies were located 12 km South of Évora, Portugal. Soil displacement or translocation after each tillage operation in both studies was measured using aluminium cubes with a side length of 15 mm as ‘tracers’. Offset angles for the harrow disk were 20 ◦, 44 ◦ and 59 ◦; tractor velocities ranged from 1. 9 to 7. 0 km h− 1 and tillage depth ranged from 4 to 11 cm. The depth of <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> was approximately 40 cm with a wheel speed of 3. 7 km h− 1. The translocation coefficients for the two implements were very different averaging 770 kgm− 1 for the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> and ranging from 9 to 333 kgm− 1 for the harrow disk. This shows that the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> was more erosive than the harrow disk in these studies. All three variables (soil condition, opening angle, and tillage velocity) were critical factors affecting the translocation coefficient for the harrow disk. Displacement distances were the largest for compacted soils (stubble field), with higher opening or offset angles, and at higher velocities. The results also showed significant correlation for (a) mean soil displacement in the direction of tillage and the slope gradient and (b) soil transport coefficient and the opening angle. Our results can be used to predict the transport coefficient (a potential soil quality indicator for tillage erosion) for the harrow disk, provided tillage depth, opening angle, and tool operating speed are known...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to characterise the soil translocation effect induced by <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> with an implement traditionally used in the Tuscany region (Central Italy). We discuss the results of a set of field experiments performed to measure soil displacement along slopes of varying gradient in different directions and at several depths of tillage. Using the Soil Erosion by Tillage (SETi) model, soil translocation patterns for different tillage scenarios were analysed, with special attention paid to the effects of the direction and depth of tillage on the extent and spatial pattern of soil movement. The lateral slope gradient SP and tillage depth D were found to be the dominant controlling factors for total soil displacement. The effect of the slope gradient in a direction parallel to tillage ST was much less pronounced. These findings reveal the importance of the asymmetric nature of the soil movement produced by <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> and the predominant effect of the lateral displacement dP on the actual trajectory of soil motion. Results demonstrate that spatial patterns of soil redistribution due to <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> are highly variable and depend on the particular characteristics of the implement used. This dependence is so strong that maximum downslope soil translocation can occur during both, contour tillage or up–down tillage. For this particular <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> maximum downslope soil transport took place at a tillage direction ca. 708 and not when tillage was conducted along the steepest slope direction (08). These findings highlight the potential of the combined approach applied. The physically based SETi model can be properly calibrated using a relatively limited dataset from field experiments. Once calibrating, the SETi model can then be used to generate synthetic tillage translocation relationships, which can predict the intensity and spatial pattern of soil translocation over a much wider range of tillage scenarios than the particular experimental conditions, in terms of topography complexity (slope gradients and morphology) and the direction and depth of tillage. These synthetic relationships are useful tools for evaluating strategies designed to reduce tillage erosion...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{farmers are}} {{encouraged}} to adopt conservation tillage to preserve soil quality and fertility and prevent erosion. In {{the framework of a}} national study, we compared conservation (no tillage NT and reduced tillage RT) and conventional (<b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> MP and shallow <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> SMP) tillage systems in 3 field experiments and 2 on-farm surveys. We measured the impacts of soil tillage on: (1) soil compaction: more compacted soil under NT and RT, (2) earthworm populations: more earthworms under NT, (3) weed infestation: weed level tends to be higher under NT, {{but it is not a}} general trend, and (4) crops: crop yields are lower under NT according to weed infestation. Then, independent of soil type and experimental year (2 to 5 years), it seems that soil physical fertility decreases under NT and RT. But, the first reason of a decline of crop yield under NT is the weed infestation...|$|R
40|$|Reduced tillage is {{increasing}} among Swedish farmers, much {{caused by a}} poor profitability in cropping. In many cases the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> {{is replaced by a}} shallow tillage implement, often a stubble cultivator. The cultivator has got tines, which consist of a shank and a share. There are many different kind of shares to choose from. To make the decision of the share model easier, a project was performed during the autumn of 2005 where draught requirement and tillage outcomes were studied for different kinds of shares. In a first project, different kinds of shares were tested on one heavy soil (50 % clay) and on one light soil (19 % clay). The tested shares were 80 mm, worned 80 mm, 80 mm winged, 210 mm and sweep. The remaining treatments were a stubble cultivator with vibrating tines and one <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough.</b> In the second project shares with different width were compared on heavy soil (50 % clay). In all tests the specific (kN/m 2) and total (kN/m) draught requirement was determined. Every test was done with a Massey Ferguson 6290 equipped with a fuel measuring system. A data logger continually registered the PTO-effect, wheel speed, radar speed and engine speed. The drawbar power was calculated by subtracting power losses through wheel slip and rolling resistance. The draught requirement was calculated by dividing with the actual (radar) speed. The total draught requirement was calculated by dividing the draught with the working width. The actual working depth was measured by the help of a metal frame, with an area of 0, 25 m 2, which was placed in the tilled plot, and in which all of the tilled soil was weighed. By measuring the bulk density the actual working depth could be calculated. When the actual working depth, the working width of the implement and the draught force were known the specific draught requirement could be calculated. From each treatment soil was collected and sieved into six fractions to be able to calculate the total particle surface per kg soil. By doing this a measure of the fraction capacity of the shares could be detected. The energy requirement for fracturing could now also be calculated. The straw remaining on the soil surface was estimated visually and determined by image analysis. Some of the measured draught requirement values were compared with values predicted by models. On the heavy soil the actual working depth became smaller than the pre-set depth for every treatment except for the shallow sweep treatment and the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughed</b> treatment. On the light soil the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughed</b> treatment, the shallow sweep treatment and the 210 mm share treatment had an actual working depth larger than the depth that was pre-set. It was shown that the actual working depth was increasing with an increasing share width. The 80 mm and 210 mm shares had the largest specific draught requirement on the heavy soil. The <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> and the shallow sweep treatment had the smallest specific draught requirement. On the light soil the worn 80 mm share had the largest specific draught requirement and the shallow sweep treatment had the smallest. The specific draught requirement was increasing with an increasing share width. The <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> buried the residual best while the shallow sweep left most straw on the soil surface. The correlation between measured and calculated values were generally low. Draught requirement for the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> was generally overestimated by the model and values for the cultivator underestimated. The results show that both draught requirement and tillage outcome was very different between the share types. Further research would be valuable for both machinery manufacturers and farmers...|$|R

40|$|Modern soil tillage systems {{based on}} {{different}} tools than <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough</b> have very often stronger weed occurrence, {{which can be}} a serious problem for achieving high yields. An obvious solution for weed suppression is a herbicide, whose improper use can deteriorate environment and lead toward serious ecological problems. In order to investigate the interaction between soil tillage and herbicide, trial was set up in Valpovo in seasons 2008 / 09 - 2010 / 11. Two soil tillage systems (CT-conventional tillage, based on <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing,</b> and CH-chiselling and disk harrowing, without ploughing) and five herbicide treatments (NH-control, no herbicides; H 10 - recommended dose of Herbaflex (2 l ha- 1); H 05 -half dose of Herbaflex; F 10 - recommended dose of Fox (1. 5 l ha- 1); and F 05 -half dose of Fox) were applied to winter wheat crops. Results showed similar effects of soil tillage on the winter wheat yield, whereas different herbicide dosages showed similar weed suppression and influence on winter wheat yield...|$|R
40|$|The Golden Valley Agricultural Research Trust (GART) {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} for the introduction of conservation tillage to small farmers in the (semi-arid) central and southern provinces of Zambia. Major emphasis {{is given to the}} implementation of conservation tillage by using animal drawn rippers, as an alternative to conventional <b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing.</b> This simple technology has already proven (by on-station research and on-farm adaptive trials) to be quite successful in being able to establish a good crop stand while requiring little energy. It may provide the best opportunity to reduce the negative effects of drought, and thus improve food security and protect the agricultural base from further degradation. Crops are maize, cotton, sunflower and soybean. Results of this work will be presented with regard to operational (time and energy consumption) and agronomical aspects (soil structure, water availability, crop establishment, yields and weeds). Various tillage systems are being assessed and compared: shallow ripping by oxen, deep (15 - 25 cm) ripping by oxen, ploughing using a common ox-drawn <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> ridging after deep ripping (all by oxen), manual hoe or stick planting, manual preparation of basins. Energy input was by far the lowest in shallow ripping, followed by deep ripping. These operations can be carried out rapidly and timely (even before the onset of the rains). The most intensive tillage treatments (<b>mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing,</b> ridging) showed higher yields and caused the lowest weed pressure. In the very dry season 2001 - 2002, however, crops on ripped fields had a higher survival rate than on conventionally tilled fields...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} during the 2003, 2004 and 2005 growing seasons in northern Greece to evaluate effects of tillage regime (<b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> chisel plough and rotary tiller), cropping sequence (continuous cotton, cotton-sugar beet rotation and continuous tobacco) and herbicide treatment on weed seedbank dynamics. Amaranthus spp. and Portulaca oleracea were the most abundant species, ranging from 76 % to 89 % of total weed seeds found in 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil depths during the 3 years. With the <b>mouldboard</b> <b>plough,</b> 48 % and 52 % of the weed seedbank {{was found in the}} 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil horizons, while approximately 60 % was concentrated in the upper 15 cm soil horizon for chisel plough and rotary tillage. <b>Mouldboard</b> <b>ploughing</b> significantly buried more Echinochloa crus-galli seeds in the 15 - 30 cm soil horizon compared with the other tillage regimes. Total seedbank (0 - 30 cm) of P. oleracea was significantly reduced in cotton-sugar beet rotation compared with cotton and tobacco monocultures, while the opposite occurred for E. crus-galli. Total seed densities of most annual broad-leaved weed species (Amaranthus spp., P. oleracea, Solanum nigrum) and E. crus-galli were lower in herbicide treated than in untreated plots. The results suggest that in light textured soils, conventional tillage with herbicide use gradually reduces seed density of small seeded weed species in the top 15 cm over several years. In contrast, crop rotation with the early established sugar beet favours spring-germinating grass weed species, but also prevents establishment of summer-germinating weed species by the early developing crop canopy...|$|R
