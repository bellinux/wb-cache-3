5|$|Leto {{played his}} first video {{game at the}} age of five, playing Super Mario Bros. In his early teens he played and won local video game competitions. At the age of 17, he broke the world record for points scored in the video game Crazy Taxi, and when Twin Galaxies, which records video game records, wanted <b>more</b> <b>proof,</b> he {{recorded}} a video of beating his own record. He then spent the next year focused on breaking video game records and eventually broke 742 of them. He had the highest number of records ever achieved until Tom Duncan surpassed him. Originally Zyos was interested in going to DigiPen Institute of Technology to learn how to create video games, but found it intense and that it was not his passion. Having dropped out of college, he later left his job at an ice cream shop at age 19 and began pursuing a career in professional gaming. In late 2002 Leto competed at AGP1, his first video game tournament, and though his team placed fifth, he ranked second individually out of three hundred players.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game {{and that he was}} looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without <b>more</b> <b>proof</b> that the game could be a success.|$|E

25|$|Judah Ben-Hur {{trains in}} wrestling {{for five years}} in the Palaestra in Rome before {{becoming}} the heir of Arrius after his death. While traveling to Antioch on state business, Judah learns that his real father's chief servant, the slave Simonides, lives in a house in this city, and has the trust of Judah's father's possessions, which he has invested so well that he is now wealthy. Judah visits Simonides, who listens to his story but demands <b>more</b> <b>proof</b> of his identity. Ben-Hur says he has no proof, but asks if Simonides knows of the fate of Judah's mother and sister. He says he knows nothing and Judah leaves the house. Simonides sends his servant Malluch to spy on Judah to see if his story is true and to learn more about him. Shortly afterwards, Malluch meets and befriends Judah in the Grove of Daphne, and they go to the games stadium together. There, Ben-Hur finds his old rival Messala racing one of the chariots, preparing for a tournament.|$|E

Heather Phares of AllMusic stated that [...] "enough of Alright, Still works—as pure pop {{and on the}} meta level Allen aims for—to make the album a fun, summery fling, and maybe more". Praising Allen for her [...] "genuine personality with wit and attitude to spare", Pitchforks Mark Pytlik remarked that the album [...] "isn't anything else but a fantastic success". In his review for Blender, Jon Dolan complimented Allen's [...] "little-sisterly" [...] personality, describing it as a combination [...] "of panache and self-doubt, courage and chaos".|$|E

Powell asserted that unlike East Coast hip hop's [...] "hedonistic materialism" [...] or [...] "the gunplay and pimpism" [...] of West Coast hip hop, [...] "Andre and Big Boi display a unique ability to describe ghetto life while offering up life-affirming possibilities, something all too rare in today's hip-hop nation."

500|$|Mondo Cane {{has been}} met with {{generally}} favorable reviews. Review aggregation website Metacritic lists the album {{as having an}} average rating of 74 out of 100, based on seventeen reviews. Writing for Allrovi, Jason Lymangrover rated the album four stars out of five, calling it Patton's [...] "most elaborate endeavor to date". [...] Lymangrover singled out [...] "Deep Down" [...] as a highlight, and felt that the covers were treated with due deference to the original recordings while still featuring Patton's idiosyncratic take on them. Philip Bloomfield of Drowned in Sound awarded Mondo Cane a score of seven out of ten, describing it as [...] "yet <b>more</b> <b>proof</b> that his talent and his breadth are perhaps indeed 'senza fine'". Bloomfield compared {{the sound of the}} album to California, a 1999 release by Patton's first band Mr. Bungle; and also felt that although the album's covers were faithful to the original versions, they still showcased a degree of Patton's versatility. Slant Magazine Jesse Cataldo rated Mondo Cane three stars out of five, describing Patton as [...] "less a musician than a kind of gonzo multi-specialty clearinghouse". Cataldo felt that album was [...] "actually simpler and less interesting than it sounds", finding it to be well-made but slightly incohesive.|$|E
500|$|Critics had {{polarized}} {{opinions on}} the production of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that [...] "strings create a mournfully thoughtful tone" [...] on the ballad. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy commended [...] "the pleasant mix of cascading piano and tender strings", but criticized the drum sounds for their hollowness. He nevertheless added that the drums do not prevent the song from being [...] "a classy, well-constructed pop ballad". Nissim concluded that although [...] "the emotion-filled vocals offer yet <b>more</b> <b>proof</b> that [...] {{is one of the}} finest pop singers of her generation", [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is not as catchy as her best work. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called it a [...] "grand-piano ballad" [...] that may stand out from pop songs on a regular studio album, but seems monotonous on I Am... Sasha Fierce as it is on a disc that contains ballads only. Negative reviews came from The A.V. Club Michaelangelo Matos, who felt that [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] sounded [...] "unfinished", and Paste magazine's Jessica Suarez, who said Beyoncé's [...] "commanding voice sounds unusually thin" [...] on the ballad. She was unconvinced by the lyrics, noting that the line, [...] "I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl", [...] "rings false". Ben Westhoff of Las Vegas Weekly wrote that it was difficult to guess what inspired the development of the breakup ballad as Beyoncé married Jay-Z a few months before the album's release.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Oh Mother" [...] was {{met with}} mainly {{positive}} reviews from contemporary music critics. Lucy Davis from BBC Music wrote that the song [...] "might {{mean a lot to}} some, those with the tiresome self defence lyrics should go [...] when she gets on with the singing, there's nothing to prove". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani deemed [...] "Oh Mother" [...] a [...] "lovely" [...] piano and string melody [...] "that we're offered a reprieve". Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic was also positive toward [...] "Oh Mother", commenting that [...] "another ode to her single mother and middle-finger to her abusive father, is yet <b>more</b> <b>proof</b> that Aguilera works best when the subject matter actually means something to her, when the song is more than just something to sing". Spence D. for IGN was positive toward the song's meaning, writing that it [...] "resonates with a bittersweet energy that helps it rise above the standard young pop queen fare of the day". musicOMH's John Murray was not impressed with the song, calling it [...] "good" [...] but saying that it would [...] "just make the bad moments feel so much worse". Digital Spy critic Nick Levine provided a negative review, giving it a two out of five stars rating and calling it [...] "tremulous" [...] with a [...] "vibrato-fuelled conclusion". He also compared [...] "Oh Mother" [...] to Madonna's song [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989) for the same sad melody as well as the same theme of child abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Norton (Richard Gaines), the company's chief, {{believes}} the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow-moving train, to Neff's hidden delight. Keyes does not suspect foul play at first, but his instincts, {{to which he}} refers as the [...] "little man", pointing to his stomach, starts nagging. He wonders why Dietrichson did not file a claim for his broken leg, and deduces {{he did not know}} about the policy. Keyes tells Neff of his theory outside Neff's apartment, while Phyllis hides behind the door.

[...] The day after the debate, Mourdock issued a statement saying, [...] "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick." [...] He later said at a press conference, [...] "I believe God controls the universe. I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion." [...] The controversy likely contributed to Mourdock's loss to Representative Joe Donnelly, and Tom LoBianco of Associated Press' The Big Story commented upon the similarities to Akin's comments.|$|E
