40|$|Is Plato a logicist? A {{comparative}} study between The Republic and The Sofist shows {{at one side}} how Plato mantains the trascenderle of Good {{over the rest of}} the Ideas conserving it in this manner not just like a form but as that which <b>mades</b> <b>possible</b> the Ideas and the inteligibility of all that is. On the other hand one notice in The Sofist that being which Plato is talking about is surely the being (and not being) of propositions. Being is for Plato like an Idea, but this doesn't imply logicism because in his thought there's a place for a Foundation, a Principie -the Good- which trascends all the forms: which <b>mades</b> <b>possible</b> also "the seen" and seing itself...|$|R
5|$|Allen {{launched}} the Allen Distinguished Investigators Awards (ADI) in 2010 to support scientists pursuing early-stage research projects who often have difficulty securing funding from traditional sources. The ADI grant program backs pioneering {{researchers in the}} areas of emerging life sciences technology to cellular decision-making and neural engineering with the intent that research <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> by these grants will advance each respective field.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the battle}} at Winterthur <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> the victory at Zürich. Once the Austrian armies united west, {{north and east}} of Zürich, Charles decided he had a {{sufficiently}} superior force to attack Masséna's positions in Zürich. His strategy, to develop a converging attack, was not entirely possible without another Austria corps, which was commanded by Suvorov, and positioned in the mountains in Italy; this would have <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> the near encirclement of Masséna's command at Zürich, making the French position untenable. Even so, at the First Battle of Zürich (4–7 June 1799), the Austrian army forced the French to abandon Zürich; Masséna withdrew across the Limmat, where {{he set up a}} defensive position on the low-lying hills overlooking the city and awaited his opportunity to reacquire the city.|$|E
5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass {{manufacture of glass}} fiber was only <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E

5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} was <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> {{due to the}} efforts of the Komnenian dynasty. This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years was full of struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E

Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and <b>made</b> <b>possible</b> through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
