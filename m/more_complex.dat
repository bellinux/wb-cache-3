5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, but with <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads {{sit next to}} the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> reproductive systems.|$|E

5|$|Cnidarians form {{an animal}} phylum that are <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> than sponges, about {{as complex as}} ctenophores (comb jellies), and less complex than bilaterians, which include almost all other animals. However, both cnidarians and ctenophores are <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> than sponges as they have: cells bound by inter-cell {{connections}} and carpet-like basement membranes; muscles; nervous systems; and some have sensory organs. Cnidarians are distinguished from all other animals by having cnidocytes that fire like harpoons and are used mainly to capture prey. In some species, cnidocytes {{can also be used}} as anchors.|$|E

5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> species, and as species become progressively <b>more</b> <b>complex,</b> the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal epidural veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|Every line stays {{unchanged}} by the curve-shortening flow. Lines are {{the only}} curves that are unaffected by the curve-shortening flow, although there exist <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> stable networks of curves, such as the hexagonal tiling of the plane.|$|E

50|$|End point {{nephelometry}} {{tests are}} run by allowing the antibody/antigen reaction to run through to completion (until all of the present reagent antibodies and the present patient sample antigens that can aggregate have done so and no <b>more</b> <b>complexes</b> can form). However, the large particles will {{fall out of the}} solution and cause a false scatter reading, thus kinetic nephelometry was devised.|$|R

5|$|Hafted {{tools are}} further {{representative}} of human innovation. The large cutting {{tools of the}} Acheulian technocomplex become smaller, as <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> tools are better suited towards the needs of highly diversified environments. Composite tools represent {{a new level of}} innovation in their increased efficacy and <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> manufacturing process. The ability to conceptualize beyond the mere reduction of stone cores demonstrates cognitive flexibility, and the use of glue, which was often processed with ochre, to attach flakes to hafts demonstrates an understanding of chemical changes that can be utilized beyond the simple use of color. Adhesives were used to construct hafted tools by 70ka at Sibudu Cave in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In most situations, revenue-maximizing {{prices are}} not profit-maximizing prices. For example, if {{variable}} costs per unit are nonzero (which they almost always are), then a <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> computation {{of a similar}} kind yields prices that generate optimal profits.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Byzantine period, <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> plans emerge, {{such as the}} {{integrated}} chapels of Theotokos of Lips, a monastic church in Constantinople that was built around 907. It included four small chapels on its second floor gallery level {{that may have been}} domed.|$|E

5|$|Like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores {{have two}} main layers of cells that {{sandwich}} a middle layer of jelly-like material, {{which is called}} the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> animals, arises from the middle cell layer, {{and as a result}} some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|E

50|$|Housing areas {{provide an}} {{indication}} {{of life in the}} Epiclassical. The majority of the inhabitants lived in rectangular houses, with interior spaces often divided in several rooms. The high slab walls, built on a terrace, with roofs built with perishable materials. Among the houses were free spaces, often with changes made by terraces, which were probably used for agriculture. The ruling class rooms were large and <b>more</b> <b>complexes</b> part of the housing units.|$|R
5|$|<b>More</b> <b>complex</b> {{parts are}} formed using <b>more</b> <b>complex</b> moulds. These may have {{sections}} called slides, that {{move into a}} cavity perpendicular to the draw direction, to form overhanging part features. When the mould is opened, the slides are {{pulled away from the}} plastic part by using stationary “angle pins” on the stationary mould half. These pins enter a slot in the slides and cause the slides to move backward when the moving half of the mould opens. The part is then ejected and the mould closes. The closing action of the mould causes the slides to move forward along the angle pins.|$|E

30|$|Innovation, {{sustainability}} {{and education}} are strongly connected. An educated workforce {{is essential to}} a country’s competitiveness and productivity. As pointed out by Mota and Scott (2014), workers who have received little formal education can accomplish only simple manual tasks and find {{it almost impossible to}} adapt to <b>more</b> <b>complexes</b> production processes and techniques. Consequently, lack of education becomes a constraint on business development, making extremely difficult to produce sophisticated or value-intensive products, which depend on existing human resources.|$|R
50|$|The {{relative}} reducing and oxidizing natures {{of these}} photocatalysts {{can be understood}} intuitively by considering the ligands' electronegativity and the catalyst <b>complex's</b> metal center. <b>More</b> electronegative metals and ligands tend to stabilize electrons better than their less electronegative counterparts. Therefore, <b>complexes</b> with <b>more</b> electronegative <b>complexes</b> are <b>more</b> easily reduced (i.e. be more powerfully oxidizing) than <b>more</b> electropositive <b>complexes.</b> For example, the ligands 2,2'-bipyridine and 2,2'-phenylpyridine are isoelectronic structures, containing the same number and arrangement of electrons.|$|R
