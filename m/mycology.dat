5|$|<b>Mycology</b> is a {{relatively}} new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 17th century. Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588, the seminal work in the development of <b>mycology</b> is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera. Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that, under the proper conditions, they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated. Extending the use of the binomial system of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum (1753), the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon (1761–1836) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern <b>mycology.</b> Later, Elias Magnus Fries (1794–1878) further elaborated the classification of fungi, using spore color and various microscopic characteristics, methods still used by taxonomists today. Other notable early contributors to <b>mycology</b> in the 17th–19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley, August Carl Joseph Corda, Anton de Bary, the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne, Arthur H. R. Buller, Curtis G. Lloyd, and Pier Andrea Saccardo. The 20th century has seen a modernization of <b>mycology</b> that has come from advances in biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, and biotechnology. The use of DNA sequencing technologies and phylogenetic analysis has provided new insights into fungal relationships and biodiversity, and has challenged traditional morphology-based groupings in fungal taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Mycology</b> is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E
5|$|Potter's {{adolescence}} was a {{quiet as}} her childhood. She grew into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed {{her to be a}} permanent resident and housekeeper in their home. She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in <b>mycology,</b> but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in <b>mycology</b> textbooks and primary research literature.|$|E
5|$|Within botany {{there are}} a number of sub-disciplines that focus on {{particular}} plant groups, each with their own range of related studies (anatomy, morphology etc.). Included here are: phycology (algae), pteridology (ferns), bryology (mosses and liverworts) and palaeobotany (fossil plants) and their histories are treated elsewhere (see side bar). To this list can be added <b>mycology,</b> the study of fungi, which were once treated as plants, but are now ranked as a unique kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{species of}} fungi have been {{described}} by taxonomists, but the global biodiversity of the fungus kingdom is not fully understood. A 2017 estimate suggests there may be between 2.2 and 3.8 million species. In <b>mycology,</b> species have historically been distinguished {{by a variety of}} methods and concepts. Classification based on morphological characteristics, such as {{the size and shape of}} spores or fruiting structures, has traditionally dominated fungal taxonomy. Species may also be distinguished by their biochemical and physiological characteristics, such as their ability to metabolize certain biochemicals, or their reaction to chemical tests. The biological species concept discriminates species based on their ability to mate. The application of molecular tools, such as DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, to study diversity has greatly enhanced the resolution and added robustness to estimates of genetic diversity within various taxonomic groups.|$|E
5|$|As soon as Glynne {{graduated}} she {{was offered}} a post in the University College of North Wales department of agriculture, but {{within a few months}} she was volunteering at Rothamsted Experimental Station where E. John Russell was director. Winifred Brenchley, the first woman to work in agricultural sciences, soon offered her a permanent assistant botanist position at Rothamsted, where she remained for 43 years. Glynne was one of the original members of the <b>Mycology</b> Department in 1918 and later founded the Plant Pathology Department. Glynne's first major work was studying Synchytrium endobioticum, the cause of potato wart disease. A modified version of her method for identifying varieties resistant to the disease, the Glynne-Lemmerzahl method, is still in use today. The work was sufficiently notable that the University of Wales awarded Glynne an MSc in 1922 for her achievements.|$|E
5|$|Clark T. Rogerson {{belongs to}} the Dudley {{mycological}} lineage, which {{can be traced back}} to Anton De Bary, a famous German mycologist. William Russell Dudley was Assistant Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at Cornell University from 1883 to 1892, and received mycological training from De Bary in 1887. Joseph Charles Arthur, George Francis Atkinson, and Mason B. Thomas studied under Dudley. Thomas went to Wabash College, where he would influence Harry Morton Fitzpatrick to study <b>mycology.</b> Fitzpatrick received his Ph.D. in 1913 at Cornell under tutelage of Atkinson. Rogerson studied under Fitzpatrick at Cornell from 1946 to 1950. Contemporary to Rogerson was fellow student Richard P. Korf, another prominent mycologist. Students of Rogerson include Robert L. Shaffer (Kansas State; M.A.), Susan Carey Canham (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Anna F. Doyle (Columbia University; Ph.D.), Gary J. Samuels (Columbia University; Ph.D.), and Rosalind Lowen (Lehman College; Ph.D.). Katia F. Rodrigues and Priscila Chaverri (Penn State; Ph.D.) studied under Samuels. The Rogerson sublineage continues to expand under Chaverri at the University of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Moser {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. Moser became an authorised mushroom controller and instructor, and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around Germany and Austria. At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed Moser some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in <b>mycology,</b> collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E

25|$|<b>Mycology</b> is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans {{as a source for}} tinder, medicinals (e.g., penicillin) as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. Published in Florence, this seminal work laid the foundations for the systematic classification of grasses, mosses and fungi. The term <b>mycology</b> and the complimentary mycologist were first used in 1836 by M.J. Berkeley.|$|E
25|$|Cage {{was also}} an avid amateur mycologist. He co-founded the New York Mycological Society with four friends, and his <b>mycology</b> {{collection}} is presently housed by the Special Collections department of the McHenry Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.|$|E
25|$|Between 1957 and 1978, the Brown-Hazen Fund {{supported}} {{training and}} research in biomedical sciences and encouraged women to take up careers in science. For several years the fund was the largest single source of nonfederal funds for medical <b>mycology</b> in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In <b>mycology,</b> a stolon {{is defined}} as an {{occasionally}} septate hypha, which connects sporangiophores together. Root-like structures called rhizoids may appear on the stolon as well, anchoring the hyphae to the substrate. The stolon is commonly found in bread molds, and are seen as horizontally expanding across the mold.|$|E
25|$|The {{library and}} {{archives}} at Kew {{are one of}} the world's largest botanical collections, with over half a million items, including books, botanical illustrations, photographs, letters and manuscripts, periodicals, and maps. The Jodrell Library has been merged with the Economic Botany and <b>Mycology</b> Libraries and all are now housed in the Jodrell Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The same term {{is often}} used in <b>mycology</b> to {{describe}} an equivalent collection of preserved fungi, otherwise known as a fungarium. A xylarium is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood. The term hortorium (as in the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of horticultural origin.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomic {{names are}} written in italics (or {{underlined}} when handwritten) with a majuscule first letter {{with the exception of}} epithets for species and subspecies. Despite it being common in zoology, tautonyms (e.g. Bison bison) are not acceptable and names of taxa used in zoology, botany or <b>mycology</b> cannot be reused for Bacteria (Botany and Zoology do share names).|$|E
25|$|In the {{currently}} accepted classification of life, {{there are three}} domains (Eukaryotes, Bacteria and Archaea), which, in terms of taxonomy, despite following the same principles have several different conventions between them and between their subdivisions as are studied by different disciplines (botany, zoology, <b>mycology</b> and microbiology), for example in zoology there are type specimens, whereas in microbiology there are type strains.|$|E
25|$|The Preserve is {{open for}} {{research}} and educational programs, and public visitation is permitted by guided tour only. While most docents are students from Sonoma State University, many derive from the community at large. Tours are offered at 10am on Saturdays during the fall and spring. In addition to the nature hike guided tours by trained naturalists, there are periodic special workshops taught by Sonoma State University faculty and other scientists, covering such special topics as geology, <b>mycology</b> and amphibians.|$|E
25|$|Bloxam {{was also}} {{interested}} in fungi. He was associated with M.J. Berkeley, another clergyman from the English Midlands, who {{has been called the}} founder of British <b>mycology.</b> In 1854, Berkeley and his co-worker Broome gave a fungal genus the name Bloxamia in honour of Bloxam's work on the group of fungi then called the Sphaeriacei; they also named after him Agaricus bloxamii (now called Bloxam's Entoloma, Entoloma bloxamii). Bloxam gave new scientific names to at least 11 species of fungi in the Index Fungorum, including the Toasted Waxcap, now Hygrocybe colemanniana.|$|E
25|$|In many {{countries}} there are mainly {{three types of}} Medical Laboratories as per the types of investigations carried out. 1. Clinical Pathology: Haematology, Histopathology, Cytology, Routine Pathology2. Clinical Microbiology: Bacteriology, Mycobacteriology, Virology, <b>Mycology,</b> Parasitology, Immunology, Serology.3. Clinical Biochemistry: Biochemical analysis, Hormonal assays etc.Blood Banks:- Blood bank is a separate body. Its laboratory need Microbiological analysis for infectious diseases that {{may be found in}} blood. Pathology to observe Blood grouping, Haematology & cross matching reactions. It also involves PRO department for the communication & contact for blood donations etc.. Molecular diagnostic lab or cytogenetics and molecular biology lab is the latest addition to the three types of medical laboratories listed above in {{many countries}}.|$|E
25|$|In <b>mycology,</b> {{anastomosis}} is {{the fusion}} between {{branches of the}} same or different hyphae. Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials {{in the form of}} dissolved ions, hormones, and nucleotides, the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (i.e. by means of conidial anastomosis tubes), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in pheromonal recognition or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular clonal colony that can cover hectares called a genet or just microscopical areas.|$|E
25|$|Ryan {{is a staff}} Physician and Pediatrician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is Board {{certified}} in both Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases, and has expertise in global infectious diseases and tropical medicine, including clinical parasitology, virology, bacteriology and <b>mycology.</b> Ryan is the Director of Global Infectious Diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, and in 2006 isolated a new bacterial species (Bartonella rochalimae) {{in the blood of}} a woman with fever and splenomegaly who had recently been in Peru. The bacterium was characterized with colleagues at the University of California at San Francisco and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ryan served with the Massachusetts General Hospital field deployment team aboard the USNS Mercy hospital ship in Banda Aceh, Indonesia following the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.|$|E

[...] In a short obituary of Moser as part of their report on the Eighth International Symposium on Arctic-Alpine <b>Mycology,</b> mycologists Cathy Cripps and Joe Ammirati called him a [...] "gentlemanly scholar" [...] who [...] "led us in his quiet way across the tundra and down many dichotomous paths".|$|E

The name was meant [...] "to record the services which have been rendered to <b>Mycology</b> by many excellent illustrations and in other ways".|$|E
500|$|A {{characteristic}} that places fungi {{in a different}} kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Similar to animals, fungi are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesise. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), which share a common ancestor (form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted {{to the study of}} fungi is known as <b>mycology</b> (from the Greek μύκης mykes, meaning [...] "fungus"). In the past, <b>mycology</b> was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "definition" [...] of a taxon is {{encapsulated}} by its description or its diagnosis or by both combined. There are no set {{rules governing}} {{the definition of}} taxa, but the naming and publication of new taxa is governed by sets of rules. In zoology, the nomenclature for the more commonly used ranks (superfamily to subspecies), is regulated by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN Code). In the fields of botany, phycology, and <b>mycology,</b> the naming of taxa is governed by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).|$|E

[...] The book named 1,115 colors, illustrated with painted samples reproduced on 53 plates. [...] Special care was taken to ensure consistency of color reproduction across the edition, as well as the prevention of fading. [...] The color samples were printed as large sheets by A.

500|$|The English word fungus is {{directly}} adopted from the Latin fungus (mushroom), {{used in the}} writings of Horace and Pliny. This in turn is derived from the Greek word sphongos (σφογγος [...] "sponge"), which refers to the macroscopic structures and morphology of mushrooms and molds; the root is also used in other languages, such as the German Schwamm ("sponge") and Schimmel ("mold"). The use of the word <b>mycology,</b> which is derived from the Greek mykes (μύκης [...] "mushroom") and logos (λόγος [...] "discourse"), to denote the scientific study of fungi is thought to have originated in 1836 with English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley's publication The English Flora of Sir James Edward Smith, Vol. 5. A group of all the fungi present in a particular area or geographic region is known as mycobiota (plural noun, no singular), e.g., [...] "the mycobiota of Ireland".|$|E
500|$|The McHenry Library houses UCSC's {{arts and}} letters collection, {{with most of the}} {{scientific}} reading at the newer Science and Engineering Library.

The latter contains an extensive collection of photographs, letters, and other documents related to Lick Observatory dating back to 1870.|$|E
500|$|The strictest {{definition}} of [...] "plant" [...] includes only the [...] "land plants" [...] or embryophytes, which include seed plants (gymnosperms, including the pines, and flowering plants) and the free-sporing cryptogams including ferns, clubmosses, liverworts, hornworts and mosses. Embryophytes are multicellular eukaryotes descended from an ancestor that obtained its energy from sunlight by photosynthesis. They have life cycles with alternating haploid and diploid phases. The sexual haploid phase of embryophytes, {{known as the}} gametophyte, nurtures the developing diploid embryo sporophyte within its tissues for {{at least part of}} its life, even in the seed plants, where the gametophyte itself is nurtured by its parent sporophyte. Other groups of organisms that were previously studied by botanists include bacteria (now studied in bacteriology), fungi (<b>mycology)</b> – including lichen-forming fungi (lichenology), non-chlorophyte algae (phycology), and viruses (virology). However, attention is still given to these groups by botanists, and fungi (including lichens) and photosynthetic protists are usually covered in introductory botany courses.|$|E
