Three-year mean and median concentrations for <b>gaseous</b> elemental <b>Hg</b> (Hg 0) were 1. 6 and 1. 5 ng m− 3 (respectively), similar to global mean Hg 0 concentrations. The three-year mean reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) concentration (26 pg m− 3) was higher than values reported for rural sites across the western United States.

Maps of total Hg emissions and its three main chemical species: elemental <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg.</b> divalent <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg,</b> and particle-associated Hg are presented. The main emissions occur in southeast Asia (particularly in China), South Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Eastern United States.

40|$|Field {{measurements}} of mercury air-surface exchange from natural settings {{were made in}} various Canadian landscapes. Soil and water samples were analyzed for mercury concentrations, and air-surface exchange fluxes from these substrates were determined using dynamic chamber, micrometeorological, or modeling methods. Environmental variables, including air and soil/water temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed, were monitored concurrently with the air-surface exchange {{to better understand the}} processes affecting the environmental cycling of mercury. Average mercury fluxes from aquatic landscapes ranged from 0. 0 to 5. 0 ng m⁻² h⁻¹ with total mercury concentration in water ranging from 0. 3 to 6. 5 ng L⁻¹. A significant correlation (R² = 0. 47) was found between <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> fluxes and total Hg concentration in water. Mean <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> fluxes from forest soils varied from − 0. 4 to 2. 2 ng m⁻² h⁻¹, while those from agricultural fields ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 9 ng m⁻² h⁻¹. Non-mineralized bedrock, sand, and till sites yielded fluxes ranging from − 0. 03 to 5. 9 ng m⁻² h⁻¹. Mean fluxes from mercuriferous geological substrates at various locations were large compared to non-mercuriferous sites, ranging from 9. 1 to 1760 ng m⁻² h⁻¹, and represent natural emissions.

While relative humidity has no impact on SR, SR increases slightly with both wind speed (0. 003  m 3  day − 1 increase in SR or 2. 5  % of the previously calibrated SR for every m s − 1 increase for wind speeds [*]>[*] 1  m s − 1, typical of outdoor deployments) and temperature (0. 001  m 3  day − 1 increase in SR or 0. 7  % for every 1  °C increase). The temperature dependence can be fully explained by the effect of temperature on the molecular diffusivity of gaseous mercury in air. Although these effects are relatively small, accuracy can be improved by adjusting SRs using measured or estimated temperature and wind speed data at or near sampling sites. We also assessed the possibility of reusing Radiello ® diffusive barriers previously used in the passive air samplers. The mean rate of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> uptake was not significantly different between new and previously used diffusive barriers in both lab and outdoor deployments, irrespective of the applied cleaning procedure.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} deposition of mercury (Hg) occurs via several mechanisms including wet, dry, and occult processes. In {{an effort to}} understand the atmospheric cycling and seasonal depositional characteristics of Hg, event-based wet deposition samples and reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) measurements were collected for approximately 3 years at Thompson Farm (TF), a near-coastal rural site in Durham, NH, part of the University of New Hampshire AIRMAP Observing Network. Total aqueous mercury exhibited seasonal patterns in Hg wet deposition at TF. The lowest Hg wet deposition was measured in the winter with an average total seasonal deposition of 1. 56 μg m − 2 compared to the summer average of 4. 71 μg m − 2. Inter-annual differences in total wet deposition are generally linked with precipitation volume, with the greatest deposition occurring in the wettest year. Relationships between surface level RGM and Hg wet deposition were also investigated based on continuous RGM measurements at TF from November 2006 to September 2009. No correlations were observed between RGM mixing ratios and Hg wet deposition, however the ineffective scavenging of RGM during winter precipitation events was evidenced by the less frequent depletion of RGM below the detection level. Seasonal dry deposition of reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) was estimated using an order-of-magnitude approach. RGM mixing ratios and dry deposition estimates were greatest during the winter and spring. The seasonal ratios of Hg wet deposition to RGM dry deposition vary by up to a factor of 80...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, we have {{integrated}} an up-to-date physio-chemical transformation {{mechanism of}} Hg into {{the framework of}} US EPA's CMAQ model system. In addition, the model adapted detailed calculations of the air-surface exchange for Hg to properly describe Hg re-emissions and dry deposition from and to natural surfaces. The mechanism covers Hg in three categories, elemental Hg (<b>Hg</b> 0), reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) and particulate Hg (HgP). With interfacing to MM 5 (meteorology processor) and SMOKE (emission processor), we applied the model to a 4 -week period in June/July 1995 on a domain covering most of eastern North America. Results indicate that the model simulates reasonably well the levels of total <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (TGM) and the specific Hg wet deposition measurements made by the Hg deposition network (MDN). Moreover, results from various scenario runs reveal that the Hg system behaves in a closely linear way in terms of contributions from different source categories, i. e. anthropogenic emissions, natural re-emissions and background. Analyses of the scenario results suggest that 37 % of anthropogenically emitted Hg was deposited back in the model domain with 5155 kg of anthropogenic Hg {{moving out of the}} domain during the simulation period. Overall, the domain served as a net source, which supplied ~a half ton of Hg to the global background pool over the period.

40|$|Coal-fired {{power plants}} {{are a major}} source of {{emissions}} for a number of air pollutants including SO 2, NOx, particulate matter (PM), HCl, HF, and Hg amongst. In this work, intensive sampling campaigns were carried out at two power plants in Spain in 2007 and 2008 to study the fate of trace elements. Input and output flows were sampled in the coal combustion unit (boiler and Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)) and in the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system. Analyses of solid, water, gaseous, and PM samples, mass balance calculations and studies on partitioning for trace elements were conducted for the Pulverised Coal Combustion, FGD systems, and for the whole installation (PCC+FGD). Desulphurisation efficiency and emission abatement capacity for inorganic trace pollutants at both power plants was also assessed {{on the basis of these}} results. Results revealed (1) an unusual speciation of Hg in the outgoing gaseous stream of the flue gas desulphurisation (OUT-FGD) system at the two power plants: Hg 0 was the dominant Hg OUT-FGD species at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2; (2) a different retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> between the two sampling campaigns at the coal-fired power plant under co-combustion conditions: a higher retention of Hg 2 + in 2007 (73 %) than in 2008 (24 %) at PP 2; (3) a high concentration of trace pollutants and a distinctive behaviour of some elements in the waters of re-circulation to the scrubber at both power plants: Al, F, and SO 42 presented a higher concentration in the 2007 gypsum slurry than at PP 2 in 2008 and that at PP 1; and (4) a characteristic leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum: insignificant leaching of heavy metals from FGD-gypsums was found at PP 2. The behaviour of Se proved to be the inverse. Laboratory experiments were conducted to reproduce the differences in speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD with respect to that detected at industrial scale. Thermodynamic modelling tools were employed to study the causes of the different retention and speciation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> OUT-FGD and causes and effects of the high concentration of elements in the waters of re-circulation. Potentiometric titration experiments for FGD-gypsum samples were conducted to study the leaching behaviour of some elements from FGD-gypsum. Laboratory experiments confirmed Hg 0 as the dominant species in the OUT-FGD gas at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2. The <b>gaseous</b> speciation of <b>Hg</b> 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 in 2007 and in 2008 was caused by the high concentration of HCl and Hg in the IN-FGD gaseous stream. The unusual speciation of Hg 2 + OUT-FGD at PP 2 was probably due to the evaporation of HgCl 2 particles from the gypsum slurry in the OUT-FGD gas. The Al-additive used at PP 2 was responsible for the higher retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> in 2007 than in 2008. The enrichment of inorganic trace pollutants in the re-circulated water streams at PP 1 and PP 2 resulted from the continuous re-circulation of filtered water to the scrubber. The emission of the enriched elements by entraining particles and droplets of gypsum slurry OUT-FGD was the most significant consequence of such a fact. Thermodynamic modelling revealed that the Al-additive i) increased the concentration of F- in filtered waters at PP 2 in 2007, ii) gave rise to the differential behaviour and enrichment of Al, F, SO 42 -, Mg, and U in gypsum slurries and filtered waters, iii) led to the formation of SO 42 - complexes with metals increasing their concentrations in the gypsum slurry from PP 1 to PP 2 - 2008 and 2007, iv) caused the acidification of gypsum slurry from PP 2 via aluminium hydrolysis, and v) induced the protonation of the PP 2 FGD-gypsum surfaces. The relatively high leaching values of Se and the absence of significant leaching of heavy metals from the PP 2 FGD-gypsums resulted from the protonation of the surface of the FGD-gypsum and the formation of SO 4 -complexes...|$|R

In this work, the available Hg concentration datasets from a number of terrestrial sites (industrial, rural and remote) in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as well as over oceans and seas have been investigated. The higher Hg species concentration and variability observed in the Northern Hemisphere suggest that the majority of emissions and re-emissions occur there.

The analysis of Hg concentration patterns indicates the differences in regional source/sink characteristics, with increasing variability toward areas strongly influenced by anthropogenic sources.

They release large amount of mercury (Hg) -containing waste seawater into the adjacent seas. However, very limited impact studies have been carried out. Our research targeted the distribution of Hg in the seawater, sediment, biota, and atmosphere, and its environmental transportation. Methods Seawater samples were collected from five sites: 1, sea areas adjacent to the power plant; 2, near discharge outlets; 3, the aeration pool of the power plant; and 4 and 5, two reference sites. The total <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> was determined in situ with a Tekran 2537 B. Analyses of total Hg (TM) followed the USEPA methods. Results In most {{part of the study}} area, TM concentrations were close to the reference values and Hg transfer from the seawater into the sediment and biota was not obvious. However, in the aeration pool and near the waste discharge outlets, atmospheric and surface seawater concentrations of TM were much higher, compared with those at a reference site.

Comparison of vertical Hg soil profiles with As, Cu, Ni and Zn (which were not emitted by the plant) support Hg enrichment in surface horizons due to atmospheric Hg inputs from the chlor-alkali plant. Based on chemical extractions and elemental correlations, Hg {{was found to be}} weakly leachable and bio-available for plants, and most probably strongly bound to organic matter. In contrast, other trace elements were probably associated with phyllosilicates, iron oxides or with primary minerals. Hg stocks in the surface horizon of a forested soil (1255 mg Hg m(- 3)) were two-fold higher than in an agricultural soil (636 mg Hg m(- 3)) at a similar distance to the plant. The difference was attributed to the interception of atmospheric Hg by the canopy (most likely <b>gaseous</b> elemental <b>Hg</b> and reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg)</b> and subsequent litterfall incorporation. Some differences in the ability to trap atmospheric Hg were observed between tree species. The characterization of the litter showed an increasing Hg concentration in the plant material proportional to their degradation stage. In agricultural soils, very low Hg concentrations found in corn leaves and grains suggested a limited uptake via both the foliar and root pathways. Thus, the short-term risk of Hg transfer to agricultural crops and higher levels of the trophic chain appeared limited.

In late spring and late fall 2012, we determined <b>gaseous</b> elemental <b>Hg</b> (GEM or Hg(0)) in air and dissolved <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (DGM, mainly Hg(0)) in surface waters {{to explore the}} spatial-temporal variations of Hg(0) and further to estimate the air/sea Hg(0) flux in the Yellow Sea. The {{results showed that the}} GEM concentrations in the two cruises were similar (spring: 1. 86 +/- 0. 40 ng m(- 3); fall: 1. 84 +/- 0. 50 ng m(- 3)) and presented similar spatial variation pattern with elevated concentrations along the coast of China and lower concentrations in the open ocean. The DGM concentrations of the two cruises were also similar with 27. 0 +/- 6. 8 pg L- 1 in the spring cruise and 28. 2 +/- 9. 0 pg L- 1 in the fall cruise and showed substantial spatial variation. The air/sea Hg(0) fluxes in the spring cruise and fall cruise were estimated to be 1. 06 +/- 0. 86 ng m(- 2) h(- 1) and 2. 53 +/- 2. 12 ng m(- 2) h(- 1), respectively. The combination of this study and our previous summer cruise showed that the summer cruise presented enhanced values of GEM, DGM and air/sea Hg(0) flux. The possible reason for this trend was that high solar radiation in summer promoted Hg(0) formation in seawater, and the high wind speed during the summer cruise significantly increased Hg(0) emission from sea surface to atmosphere and subsequently enhanced the GEM levels.

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} pathway of {{the global}} mercury flux {{is known to be}} the primary source of mercury contamination to most threatened aquatic ecosystems. Notwithstanding, the emission of mercury from surface water to the atmosphere is as much as 50 % of total annual emissions of this metal into the atmosphere. In recent years, much effort has been made in theoretical and experimental researches to quantify the total mass flux of mercury to the atmosphere. In this study the most recent atmospheric modelling methods and the information obtained from them are presented and compared using experimental data collected during the Oceanographic Campaign Fenice 2011 (25 October – 8 November 2011), performed on board the Research Vessel (RV) Urania of the CNR in the framework of the MEDOCEANOR ongoing program. A strategy for future numerical model development is proposed which is intended to gain a better knowledge of the long-term effects of meteo-climatic drivers on mercury evasional processes, and would provide key information on <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> exchange rates at the air-water interface...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{describe}} work toward {{development of the}} components of a cost effective passive sampling system for <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> that could be broadly deployed by nontechnical staff. The passive sampling system included an external shield to reduce turbulence and exposure to precipitation and dust, a diffusive housing that directly protects the collection surface during deployment and handling, and a collection surface. A protocol for cleaning and deploying the sampler and an analytical method were developed. Our final design consisted of a polycarbonate external shield enclosing a custom diffusive housing made from expanded PTFE tubing. Two collection surfaces were investigated, gold sputter-coated quartz plates and silver wires. Research showed the former would require extensive quality control for use, while the latter had interferences with other atmosphere constituents. Although the gold surface exhibited the best performance over space and time, gradual passivation would limit reuse. For both surfaces lack of contamination during shipping, deployment and storage indicated that the handling protocols developed worked well with nontechnical staff. We suggest that the basis for this passive sampling system is sound, but further exploration and development of a reliable collection surface is needed...|$|R
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Hg concentration and deposition in the United States to emissions in China was investigated {{by using a}} global chemical transport model: Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers (MOZART). Two forms of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> {{were included in the}} model: elemental Hg (HG(0) and oxidized or reactive Hg (HGO). We simulated three different emission scenarios to evaluate the model's sensitivity. One scenario included no emissions from China, while the others were based on different estimates of Hg emissions in China. The results indicated, in general, that when Hg emissions were included, HG(0) concentrations increased both locally and globally. Increases in Hg concentrations in the United States were greatest during spring and summer, by as much as 7 %. Ratios of calculated concentrations of Hg and CO near the source region in eastern Asia agreed well with ratios based on measurements. Increases similar to those observed for HG(0) were also calculated for deposition of HGO. Calculated increases in wet and dry deposition in the United States were 5 – 7 % and 5 – 9 %, respectively. The results indicate that long-range transcontinental transport of Hg has a non-negligible impact on Hg deposition levels in the United States...|$|R
40|$|The PIMS (U. S. patent no. 6, 129, 843) is an {{effective}} alternative to conventional sampling for mercury vapor (Hg 0) in air and is highly suitable for long-term unattended sampling. It consists of a semi-permeable polymeric membrane containing a mercury-sequestering reagent sealed inside (Figure 1). Because mercury vapor readily permeates the membrane and is rapidly oxidized and stabilized inside the membrane, sampling intervals of weeks to months are possible. The PIMS sampling reagent is amenable to direct analysis for mercury (no chemical treatment required) by conventional methods (AA, AF, or ICP-MS) with virtually no interferences. Preliminary {{results indicate that the}} PIMS is also applicable for water sampling of neutral mercury species. Features: Passive sampling requires no pumps, traps, or electrical power. Integrative sampling for up to 90 days. Clean-room mercury facilities generally not required. Particularly useful for applications requiring unattended sampling for extended periods at remote locations. Sampler reagent is conveniently analyzed for mercury directly by ICP-MS, CVAF, or CVAA without chemical treatment. Simple alternative for Hg vapor screening and detection; sampling precision ~ 5 - 10 % RSD. Potentially applicable for <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> sampling in soil and water...|$|R

In this work, intensive sampling campaigns were carried out at two power plants in Spain in 2007 and 2008 to study the fate of trace elements. Input and output flows were sampled in the coal combustion unit (boiler and Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)) and in the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) system. Analyses of solid, water, gaseous, and PM samples, mass balance calculations and studies on partitioning for trace elements were conducted for the Pulverised Coal Combustion, FGD systems, and for the whole installation (PCC+FGD). Desulphurisation efficiency and emission abatement capacity for inorganic trace pollutants at both power plants was also assessed {{on the basis of these}} results. Results revealed (1) an unusual speciation of Hg in the outgoing gaseous stream of the flue gas desulphurisation (OUT-FGD) system at the two power plants: Hg 0 was the dominant Hg OUT-FGD species at PP 1, and Hg 2 + at PP 2; (2) a different retention of <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> between the two sampling campaigns at the coal-fired power plant under co-combustion conditions: a higher retention of Hg 2 + in 2007 (73...|$|R
40|$|Mercury stable {{isotopes}} are {{an excellent}} tool to distinguish among different sources of this element and to investigate its transformation processes in environmental compartments and in food webs. To do this, an highly precise and sensitive method {{was set up by}} using a cold vapor generator system (CVG) to introduce <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> 0 into a multicollector ICP-MS spectrometer[1], allowing “dry plasma” measurement conditions to minimize any matrix effect on the obtained results. Instrumental mass bias on measures was accounted by simultaneously monitoring 205 Tl/ 203 Tl from the isotopic SRM NIST 997 and applying the correction algorithm proposed by Yang and Sturgeon[2]. This method was applied to the case study of Grado and Marano Lagoon, Italy and of the northern Adriatic Sea. The lagoon has been subjected to Hg input from both industrial waste (chlor-alkali plant) and residues of long-term mining activity (Idrija mine, NW Slovenia) transported by the Isonzo river and marine currents[3]. Mercury isotopic ratios detected on sediments, fish and mollusk tissue samples show both mass-dependent (MDF) and mass-independent (MIF) fractionation phenomena for Hg. With these data, it has been possible to gain a more detailed characterization of the Hg input sources in the lagoon and to gather information on the uptake processes of the element and its derivatives in living organisms...|$|R

In order {{to better understand the}} role of volcanoes in the global mercury budget a number of field campaigns were carried out to evaluate the Hg/S ratios in volcanic gases around the world. Measurements have been made of emissions of Masaya (Nicaragua), Etna and Vulcano (Italy), Tatun (Taiwan), Taal and Makiling (Philippines) and Kilauea (Hawaii, USA). Emissions from open vents, fumaroles, hot springs, bubbling mud pools and altered ground were investigated at these sites and concentrations of mercury elevated above background levels were observed on most occasions. A Lumex 915 + portable mercury vapour spectrometer was employed to record real-time gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) concentrations alongside a Multi-GAS sensor, H S, CO, humidity, temperature and pressure. These box developed to monitor SO 2 2 2 measurements were carried out in parallel with the collection of GEM on gold coated sand traps, particulate Hg (Hg(p)) on quartz mini-traps, reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> (RGM) on glass denuders and sulphur on filter packs.

40|$|Salt marshes are ecologically {{sensitive}} ecosystems where mercury (Hg) methylation and biomagnification can occur. Understanding {{the mechanisms}} controlling <b>gaseous</b> <b>Hg</b> flux from salt marshes {{is important to}} predict the retention of Hg in coastal wetlands and project the impact of environmental change on the global Hg cycle. We monitored Hg flux from a remote salt marsh over 9 days which included three cloudless days and a 4 mm rainfall event. We observed a cyclical diel relationship between Hg flux and solar radiation. When measurements at the same irradiance intensity are considered, Hg flux was greater in the evening when the sediment was warm than {{in the morning when}} the sediment was cool. This is evidence to suggest that both solar radiation and sediment temperature directly influence the rate of Hg(II) photoreduction in salt marshes. Hg flux could be predicted from solar radiation and sediment temperature in sub-datasets collected during cloudless days (R 2 = 0. 99), and before (R 2 = 0. 97) and after (R 2 = 0. 95) the rainfall event, but the combined dataset could not account for the lower Hg flux observed after the rainfall event that is in contrast to greater Hg flux from soils after rainfall events...|$|R
