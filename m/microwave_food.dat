50|$|The {{microwave}} {{heat distribution}} {{is a term}} for the actual distribution (allocation) of the heat release inside the microwave absorptive material irradiated with high intensive microwaves.The pattern of microwave heat distribution depends on many physical parameters, which may include the electromagnetic field, the specific absorption rate {{and structure of the}} processed material, the geometrical dimensions of the processing cavity, etc.Most of the industrial microwave heating applications need a uniform heat distribution.For example, the uniformity of microwave heat distribution is key parameter in <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> sterilization, due to the potential danger directly related to human health if the food has not been heated evenly up to desirable temperature for neutralization of possible bacteria population.There are many different methods for achieving uniform heat distribution inside the irradiated material. They may involve computer simulation and different mechanical mechanisms such as turntables and stirrers.The proper microwave energy pattern is necessary for attaining a uniform heat release.|$|E
40|$|In China, food {{industry}} brings huge profit in every year, but the <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> industry still faces {{the problem of}} underdevelopment. To explore {{the extent of the}} potential market of <b>microwave</b> <b>food,</b> a research on it can be contributed. However, there are rare similar researches on the circumstances of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> in China, so it is valuable to design a research project which particularly focuses on the mainland conditions of <b>microwave</b> <b>food.</b> Shanghai {{is one of the most}} desirable places among the major mainland cities. Thus, its market of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> can perform as a model for other cities to develop a wider and sustainable expansion in the entire mainland market. To study the microwave food’s market in China, we will gather and analyze the information about the trend of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> and the effect of demographic and sociocultural factors on the growth of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> in Shanghai from primary and secondary sources. For the primary source, a survey was conducted and 150 samples were collected. We try to analyze our research hypotheses through the survey and useful data was collected. Besides, the secondary information was also collected through the Internet, books, journals, etc. With the information, we will analyze the circumstances of mainland food market, describe the environment factors in Shanghai and its current status of food market, and use the case study to predict the growing phenomenon of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> in China. We hope that this research can contribute in creating a favorable environment of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> market for the future and designing an appropriate strategy to implement into the <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> industry. Besides, the potential for microwave ready meals in this convenience-led society is a huge opportunity for manufacturers. Consequently, they can gain an appreciable return through the development of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> in China. As an effectual marketing strategy should be designed for a specific company, we choose the famous frozen food company in Hong Kong, Tao Fa, Amoy. We take it as an example and suggest the marketing plan for its development of <b>microwave</b> <b>food</b> in China...|$|E

The purpose of any food packaging regulations concerned with {{the safety of the}} food is to control and limit the migration of substances from the packaging into the food. The main objective of this thesis is to test three different microwaving packaging materials that are the most common material in the market, viz. polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), migrated into four food simulant solutions. Four different simulant solutions were used based on the food type and FDA recommendations and regulations. These food simulants include vegetable pure oil, 3 % (v/v) aqueous acetic acid, 15 % (v/v) ethanol, and olive oil in the temperature of 100 °C. Headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) was used to determine the relative migration values from packaging materials into food by putting the materials into contact with simulants for 10 days in temperature of 5 °C. The analyzed results show that the migrations of food package are dependent on microwaving time, package material types and simulant types. The polystyrene (PS) caused the fastest relative migration in olive oil while the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has the most relative migration in food simulant containing 15 % ethanol. In addition, acetaldehyde, which may be hazardous to consumers, was found in both 3 % aqueous acetic acid and olive oil after 10 minutes microwaving from PET...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ingestion}} of <b>microwaved</b> <b>foods</b> on serum antioxidant enzymes and vitamins in albino rats was investigated. In the study, thirty two (32) male wistar albino rats were obtained and grouped into four groups (A, B, C and D) of eight animals each. The animals were acclimatized for 7 days on commercial rat feed. The animals in groups B, C and D were all fed ad libitum with porridge yam, porridge beans and jellof rice with meat/fish reheated for 2  min, 4  min and 6  min for groups B, C and D respectively for 42 days. Group A was fed with un-microwaved {{food and water}} {{for the duration of}} the study (42 days) and served as control. Antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) activities, vitamins A and E concentrations were determined using standard methods. Result obtained from the study showed that <b>microwaved</b> <b>food</b> consumption resulted in a significant (P <  0. 05) decrease in SOD and CAT activity in rats fed with the <b>microwaved</b> <b>food.</b> Furthermore, antioxidant enzyme activity were more significantly (P <  0. 05) reduced in rats exposed to <b>food</b> <b>microwaved</b> for 6  min compared to the control group (A). Also, serum vitamins A and E concentrations were significantly (P <  0. 05) decreased in rats fed with <b>food</b> exposed to <b>microwaves</b> for 6  min as compared to the control group. Microwaves and increased microwaving time resulted to a significant reduction in SOD, CAT, vitamin A and E in fed rats.
