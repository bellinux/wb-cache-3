5|$|In {{addition}} to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from {{the addition of}} proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be <b>membrane</b> proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER <b>membrane</b> itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own <b>membrane</b> phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER <b>membrane</b> assemble phospholipids. The ER <b>membrane</b> expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma <b>membrane</b> has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the <b>membrane</b> assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma <b>membrane</b> allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of <b>membrane</b> proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma <b>membrane.</b> Receptor proteins on the <b>membrane</b> have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner <b>membrane</b> is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner <b>membrane</b> is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner <b>membrane</b> impermeable. Unlike the outer <b>membrane,</b> the inner <b>membrane</b> doesn't contain porins, and is highly impermeable to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special <b>membrane</b> transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner <b>membrane</b> (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a <b>membrane</b> potential across the inner <b>membrane,</b> formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E

Seven CTR and five TRD <b>membranes</b> were obtained during closed microsurgery. Six of the seven CTR <b>membranes</b> {{and one of the}} five TRD <b>membranes</b> contained RPE. Eleven of the 12 diabetic <b>membranes</b> incorporated glial cells. The findings emphasise that the intravitreal <b>membranes</b> of proliferative diabetic retinopathy contain a diversity of cell types and indicate that RPE tend to contribute to CTR, rather than TRD, <b>membranes.</b> The histopathological appearance of CTR <b>membranes</b> is that of a hybrid between TRD and proliferative vitreo-retinopathy <b>membranes...</b>|$|R
5|$|The inner {{mitochondrial}} <b>membrane</b> is compartmentalized into numerous cristae, which {{expand the}} surface area of the inner mitochondrial <b>membrane,</b> enhancing its ability to produce ATP. For typical liver mitochondria, {{the area of the}} inner <b>membrane</b> is about five times as large as the outer <b>membrane.</b> This ratio is variable and mitochondria from cells that have a greater demand for ATP, such as muscle cells, contain even more cristae. These folds are studded with small round bodies known as F1 particles or oxysomes. These are not simple random folds but rather invaginations of the inner <b>membrane,</b> which can affect overall chemiosmotic function.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{mitochondrial}} <b>membrane,</b> which encloses {{the entire}} organelle, is 60 to 75 angstroms (Ã…) thick. It has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio {{similar to that}} of the eukaryotic plasma <b>membrane</b> (about 1:1 by weight). It contains large numbers of integral <b>membrane</b> proteins called porins. These porins form channels that allow molecules of 5000daltons or less in molecular weight to freely diffuse from one side of the <b>membrane</b> to the other. Larger proteins can enter the mitochondrion if a signaling sequence at their N-terminus binds to a large multisubunit protein called translocase of the outer <b>membrane,</b> which then actively moves them across the <b>membrane.</b> Mitochondrial pro-proteins are imported through specialised translocation complexes. The outer <b>membrane</b> also contains enzymes involved in such diverse activities as the elongation of fatty acids, oxidation of epinephrine, and the degradation of tryptophan. These enzymes include monoamine oxidase, rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-reductase, kynurenine hydroxylase and fatty acid Co-A ligase. Disruption of the outer <b>membrane</b> permits proteins in the intermembrane space to leak into the cytosol, leading to certain cell death. The mitochondrial outer <b>membrane</b> can associate with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <b>membrane,</b> in a structure called MAM (mitochondria-associated ER-membrane). This is important in the ER-mitochondria calcium signaling and is involved in the transfer of lipids between the ER and mitochondria.|$|E
5|$|The plasma <b>membrane</b> is a {{phospholipid}} bilayer <b>membrane</b> {{that separates}} the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell.

This movement and the multiple components of the <b>membrane</b> are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma <b>membrane</b> freely by diffusion or osmosis.

40|$|Recent studies {{demonstrated}} that perforated pit <b>membranes</b> (i. e., pit <b>membranes</b> {{with a large}} opening in their central portion) are commonly present between wood fibers in core eudicots. It is unclear whether this type of pit <b>membranes</b> might also occur in ancestral angiosperms. Therefore, structure of interfiber pit <b>membranes</b> was examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy in nine species representing seven families that are located at more ancestral position than core eudicots.

Our observations indicate that perforated pit <b>membranes</b> are relatively common even in ancestral groups of angiosperms. In the non-perforated pit <b>membranes</b> of the other six species, we found a range of structural variations.

It was concluded that adhesion of the peribacteroid <b>membranes</b> to the bacteroid envelope outer <b>membranes</b> is likely to be a critical element in the process of division of the peribacteroid <b>membranes.</b> Differences in the degree of adhesion between peribacteroid <b>membranes</b> and the bacteroid envelope outer <b>membranes</b> may explain variations in the number of bacteroids enclosed by peribacteroid <b>membranes</b> in nodules of different legumes...|$|R
5|$|There {{are various}} types of vesicles each with a {{different}} protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes.
