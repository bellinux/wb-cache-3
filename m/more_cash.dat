5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money demand {{and how it}} impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did not assume that money demand and supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding <b>more</b> <b>cash</b> when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E

25|$|A tax {{called the}} undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time {{the primary purpose}} was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for {{payments}} of $2billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put <b>more</b> <b>cash</b> and spending {{power in the hands}} of individuals. In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism, the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938.|$|E

Hoping for some <b>more</b> <b>cash,</b> the Cardinals arranged to play the Milwaukee Badgers and the Hammond Pros, both of whom had already dispersed. Indeed, the Badgers were unable to bring back their full roster and resorted to substitute four high school players, which was in violation of NFL rules.

25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump <b>more</b> <b>cash</b> into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it was so close to the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led to too many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{project was}} largely {{reported}} by the press {{to have been a}} flop: badly thought-out, badly executed, and leaving the government with the embarrassing question {{of what to do with}} it afterwards. During 2000 the organisers repeatedly asked for, and received, <b>more</b> <b>cash</b> from the Millennium Commission, the Lottery body which supported it. Numerous changes at management and Board level, before and during the exhibition, had only limited, if any, results. Jennifer Page was sacked as chief executive of the New Millennium Experience Company just one month after the dome's opening. Press reports suggested that the then Prime Minister Tony Blair personally placed a high priority on making the Dome a success. But part of the problem was that the financial predictions were based on an unrealistically high forecast of visitor numbers at 12 million. During the 12 months it was open there were approximately 6.5 million visitors – significantly fewer than the approximately 10 million paying visitors that attended the Festival of Britain, which only ran from May to September. Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 held in Glasgow attracted more than 12 million visitors being open May to October. Unlike the press, visitor feedback was extremely positive. It was the most popular tourist attraction in 2000, second was the London Eye; third was Alton Towers, which had been first in 1999.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{solves the}} {{dispute between the}} free cash flow and {{tunneling}} hypotheses in explaining the role of cash dividends on asset expropriation of the controlling shareholders in Chinese listed firms. Investors value <b>more</b> the <b>cash</b> dividends and the cash holdings of firms with lower ownership control than those of firms with higher ownership control. This is more consistent with the tunneling hypothesis. However, when investment opportunities are considered, the free cash flow hypothesis better explains firms' dividend policy.

40|$|Recently in Australia, {{regulations}} have been proclaimed requiring companies to make cashflow disclosures {{in addition to}} earnings disclosures from 30 June 1992. This paper provides evidence on relationships between earnings and cash flow measures {{and in so doing}} examines the external validity of a U. S. A study of these relationships by Bowen, Burgstahler and Daley [1986]. We also extend their study through an industry analysis of the relationships. Evidence is presented first that shows low correlations between traditional cash flow measures (i. e., net income plus depreciation and amortisation; and working capital from operations) and a <b>more</b> refined <b>cash</b> flow measure (with additional adjustments for changes in non-cash current assets and current liabilities). Second, traditional cash flow measures exhibit high correlations with earnings, while the <b>more</b> refined <b>cash</b> flow measure has a lower correlation with earnings. Finally, traditional cash flow measures better predict future cash flows than models based on earnings or a <b>more</b> refined <b>cash</b> flow meaure. The industry evidence, albeit on small sample sizes, shows that the results on the first two issues, but not the latter issue, are generalisable across industry categories...|$|R
40|$|By exporting, firms sell {{in markets}} whose {{business}} cycles are not perfectly correlated, {{and so can}} be expected to have <b>more</b> stable <b>cash</b> flows. If companies are liquidity constrained, this stability of cash flows can provide exporters with certain advantages over firms that operate solely in a domestic market. For instance, under the existence of liquidity constraints, <b>more</b> stable <b>cash</b> flows should foster more stable capital investments. Moreover, the expectation of <b>more</b> stable future <b>cash</b> flows and the information signal from commencing exporting can lessen the severity of liquidity constraints for exporters compared to non-exporters. We test these arguments by examining a stratified representative sample of the Spanish manufacturing sector from 1990 to 1998. Our results suggest that exporters' cash flows and capital investments are more stable than non-exporters'. Moreover, we find that liquidity constraints are less binding for exporters than for non-exporters. The richness of our data allows us to examine alternative explanations for the results we present. We conclude by discussing the strategic implications of our findings for firms. Liquidity constraint; exporter; non-exporter...|$|R
