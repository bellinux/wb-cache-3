2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got to take <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> now." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{arrangement}} {{by which}} an annual grant {{was given to}} Christ's Hospital corresponded with Smith's own interests in that institution. <b>The</b> <b>Hospital</b> had for many years enjoyed close links with various Livery Companies and Smith had become a Governor there in 1658. The aftermath of the Great Fire of London in 1666, {{as a consequence of}} which <b>the</b> <b>Hospital</b> was destroyed, demonstrated his interest. He wrote that [...] Providence sometime after <b>the</b> fire directed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> <b>Hospital</b> which with grief I beheld in its ashes. The consideration of the many children that had their habitation there but then scattered abroad, made <b>me</b> resolve <b>to</b> encourage others with myself <b>to</b> raise <b>the</b> foundation.|$|R

And now, I believe it would be courteous {{for me to tell}} you who I am and how I came to be in such dire peril." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> {{and they}} called my illness brain-fever. But long before they thought me convalescent I was conscious, lying awake and {{plotting}} my escape. With cunning I managed it. Of my wife and child I never once thought. Every trace of human affection seemed withered up in my heart. I took the money subscribed for me with a hypocrite's smile, and I slunk away from England. I went to Montreal in Canada, and I deliberately entered upon a life of low pleasures. Pardon me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{reasonable}} compromise effected"--those {{were the}} words which I had brooded over all the morning, and which I now verified in the original.

60|$|I {{had been}} in the islands several months when the {{survivors}} arrived. I was laid up in my room at the time, and unable to walk.

But by good luck his Excellency Anson Burlingame was there at the time, on his way to take up his post in China, where he did such good work for the United States. He came and put me on a stretcher and had <b>me</b> carried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> where <b>the</b> shipwrecked men were, and I never needed to ask a question.

60|$|From Terragall {{we went to}} Sourabaya, where I prevailed on {{the captain}} to send <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> the mate still insisting I was merely shamming {{inability}} to work. The surgeons at Sourabaya, {{one of whom was}} a Scotchman, thought with the mate; {{and at the end of}} twenty days, I was again taken on board the ship, which sailed for Samarang. While at Sourabaya there were five English sailors in the hospital. These men were as forlorn and miserable as my self, death grinning in our faces at every turn. The men who were brought into the hospital one day, were often dead the next, and none of us knew whose turn would come next. We often talked together, on religious subjects, after our own uninstructed manner, and greatly did we long to find an English bible, a thing not to be had there. Then it was I thought, again, of the sermon I had heard at the Sailors' Retreat, of the forfeited promises I had made to reform; and, more than once did it cross my mind, should God permit me to return home, that I would seek out that minister, and ask his prayers and spiritual advice.|$|E
6000|$|... "After that, {{there is}} a spot of {{darkness}} like in my memory. The next thing I can call to mind, is coming back to my senses after some days. Three of my teeth were knocked out--but {{that was not the}} worst of it. My head had struck against something in falling, and some part of me (a nerve, I think they said) was injured {{in such a way as}} to affect my speech. I don't mean that I was downright dumb--I only mean that, all of a sudden, it had become a labor to me to speak. A long word was as serious an obstacle as if I was a child again. They took <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> When the medical gentlemen heard what it was, the medical gentlemen came crowding round me. I appeared to lay hold of their interest, just as a story-book lays hold of the interest of other people. The upshot of it was, that I might end in being dumb, or I might get my speech again--the chances were about equal. Only two things were needful. One of them was that I should live on good nourishing diet. The other was, that I should keep my mind easy.|$|E

I know you meant that. I remember what you said <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when you first spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> about <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> There is no sorrow I have thought more about than that--to love what is great, and try to reach it, and yet to fail." ...|$|R

30|$|When I {{first began}} to learn JSJ I {{attended}} classes at the cancer center of the Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey, USA 4.

At this New Jersey hospital there is tangible evidence of acceptance of an integrative approach to health – including Western Medicine and the option of treatments of complementary practices, including JSJ. As an example, when a friend of mine had a double mastectomy at <b>the</b> Morristown <b>hospital</b> I offered her JSJ as a way to afford a successful transition to good health.

Remember I told you that they didn’t want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go home Saturday, they wanted <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay in <b>the</b> <b>hospital?</b> Well now they’re trying to claim that they didn’t release me from the dump, and they’ve slapped a Wing Board on me. Don’t let the big name scare you honey. You see for any demerits awarded over six in number you have to meet a Wing Board. It’s nothing serious, the only thing is I might be {{restricted}} next weekend, it depends on how many demerits I’ll get at the board tomorrow. It will be at least seven, and that’s one tour (you walk a tour for every gig over six that you get) and this morning I got gigged for a dusty floor, that’s two gigs, totaling three tours. One more gig and I can’t get out Saturday night, since I can only walk three off Saturday, and can’t leave the post ‘til all are walked off. Aw honey, I’ve got to see you next weekend. It’s bad enough going from weekend to weekend, but for two weeks, I can’t see it. Gee I love you so, darling. That letter you wrote Sunday was so sweet. I know you’re then [sic] only girl I ever loved or ever will. I didn’t think it could happen <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but it has, and it’s marvelous, Dottie. And don’t worry, darling. Ever[y]thing is going to be all right. I said I was going to marry you in March, and by God, I’ll marry you in March, and nothing or no one will stop me. Don’t worry about Mom. You see hon, she and I are much closer than the average mother and son, what with Dad dead, and stuff. She doesn’t want <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry in March, it’s true, but she would never {{stand in the way of}} our happiness, darling, I know her too well. So don’t worry, sweetheart, everything will be O. K. Oh, and another thing.

She understands the way we feel about it. And as for me, I know what I’m doing. I’d marry you tomorrow if there wasn’t a war on. The only affect the war had on us was bringing us together. Marriage has been against my principles ever since I’ve been old enough to think about it. So when I ask you <b>to</b> marry <b>me,</b> after all these years of conscientious objections, don’t you think that I really mean it? I do darling, I mean everything I ever say to do, this is too big a step to take just because “everybody’s doing it. ” I was never much of a conventionalist anyhow.
