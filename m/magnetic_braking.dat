5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting protostar can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking.</b> The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing protostar.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the protostar, loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
25|$|The Sun's major {{component}} of magnetic field reverses direction every 11 years (so the period is about 22 years), resulting in a diminished magnitude of magnetic field near reversal time. During this dormancy, the sunspots activity is at maximum (because {{of the lack of}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> on plasma) and, as a result, massive ejection of high energy plasma into the solar corona and interplanetary space takes place. Collisions of neighboring sunspots with oppositely directed magnetic fields result in the generation of strong electric fields near rapidly disappearing magnetic field regions. This electric field accelerates electrons and protons to high energies (kiloelectronvolts) which results in jets of extremely hot plasma leaving the Sun's surface and heating coronal plasma to high temperatures (millions of kelvin).|$|E
5|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. <b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of <b>magnetic</b> <b>brakes.</b> <b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> do not make contact with the train.

50|$|<b>Magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> are a {{relatively}} new technology that are beginning to gain popularity due to their high degree of safety.

500|$|Occasionally, a {{train is}} {{launched}} with not enough speed {{to clear the}} crest. This typically happens in cool, wet, or breezy weather, or when the wind is working against it. In these conditions, the launch often does not provide it with enough speed to climb over the hill, which causes it to stop short of the top, and roll back down the hill in reverse, hence the term [...] "rollback". The launch track is equipped with retractable <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> fins which are raised after the train is launched in order to slow one that did not crest the hill.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} station, the train enters the launch area.

[...] Once the train is prepared to launch, a motor revving sound effect is played and its <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> fins are lowered from the launch track. It then launches, accelerating to a speed of [...] in 3.8 seconds. Shortly after reaching its maximum velocity, the train begins its ascent up a 90-degree incline, twisting 90 degrees clockwise before climbing over the [...] top hat. Upon descending, the track twists 270 degrees before leveling out, allowing the train to be stopped by the magnetic brakes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: For an {{effective}} search for survivors over debris in collapsed buildings, {{the authors have}} been developing the Throw and Collect type rescue inspector. The performance of this rescue robot {{is based on the}} parent robot throwing the child machine, equipped with cameras and sensors over high debris for inspection of the area and for searching for survivors, and then to draw it back, which should be better than trying to roll over, or jump over obstacles, as usual robots do. The throwing mechanism consists of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder, which was developed to overcome the problems of the internal pressure fall of the pneumatic cylinder when moving light loads. However, the first <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder designed does not have the necessary structure and mechanism to provide control over the child machine’s throwing distance. This paper describes the design and the controlling method of a new <b>magnetic</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder, which allows control of the throwing distance of the child machine...|$|R

50|$|Under this model, {{the core}} of the red dwarf is {{rotating}} faster than the orbital period. As mass transfer causes the radius of the star to shrink, conservation of angular momentum means that it spins faster, and this means the dynamo effect generates a stronger magnetic field. This increases the <b>magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> effect and accordingly the mass transfer rate.|$|E
