5|$|Until the 1980s FGM {{was widely}} known in English as female circumcision, {{implying}} an equivalence in severity with <b>male</b> <b>circumcision.</b> From 1929 the Kenya Missionary Council {{referred to it}} as the sexual mutilation of women, following the lead of Marion Scott Stevenson, a Church of Scotland missionary. References to the practice as mutilation increased throughout the 1970s. In 1975 Rose Oldfield Hayes, an American anthropologist, used the term female genital mutilation in the title of a paper in American Ethnologist, and four years later Fran Hosken, an Austrian-American feminist writer, called it mutilation in her influential The Hosken Report: Genital and Sexual Mutilation of Females.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{religious}} rituals such as <b>male</b> <b>circumcision,</b> {{food and}} water deprivation, and snake handling look paradoxical in evolutionary terms. Devout religious beliefs wherein such traditions are practiced therefore appear maladaptive. Religion may have arisen to increase and maintain intragroup cooperation. Cooperation leads to altruistic behaviour, and costly signalling could explain this. All religions may involve costly and elaborate rituals, performed publicly, to demonstrate loyalty to the religious group. In this way, group members increase their allegiance to the group by signalling their investment in group interests. However, as group size increases among humans, the threat of free riders grows. Costly signalling theory accounts for this by proposing that these religious rituals are costly enough to deter free riders.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and <b>male</b> <b>circumcision.</b> Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E

5|$|<b>Male</b> <b>circumcision</b> is {{the removal}} of the {{foreskin}} from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be done as a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, Jews refrain from active proselytizing, and some {{denominations}} discourage conversion. In Judaism, conversion {{is not a}} requirement or prerequisite to goodness or salvation, and if a person truly wishes to convert, they will seek out a community and rabbi they feel comfortable with and begin the process there. Conversion to Judaism involves extensive instruction in Jewish law, renouncing of other religious affiliations, immersion in a mikveh, and, for <b>males,</b> <b>circumcision.</b> If the potential convert is already circumcised, a procedure known as hatafat dam brit is performed, in which blood is drawn from the penis. Orthodox Judaism also requires acceptance of the entire code of Jewish Law.|$|R

Using {{data from the}} National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), annual rates of newborn circumcision are presented for 1979 – 2010. National and regional rates are shown in both tabular and graphical form, and trends across the 32 -year period are discussed. Note that these estimates do not include circumcisions performed outside the hospital setting (e. g., ritual circumcisions) or those performed at any age following discharge from the birth hospitalization. Thus, these rates cannot be used as prevalence estimates for all <b>male</b> <b>circumcisions</b> in the United States. National trends Across the 32 -year period from 1979 through 2010, the national rate of newborn circumcision declined 10 % overall, from 64. 5 % to 58. 3 % (Table and Figure 1). During this time, the overall percentage of newborns circumcised during their birth hospitalization was highest in 1981 at 64. 9 %, and lowest in 2007 at 55. 4 %.

25|$|The first {{randomized}} controlled trial {{to assess the}} effect of <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> on female to male HIV transmission was published in 2005 by Bertran Auvert and colleagues in PLOS Medicine. The Lancet a leading medical journal rejected this paper because of ethical concerns around how the trial was conducted before PLOS Medicine accepted it. The trial was stopped early by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board who advised the investigators to interrupt the trial and offer circumcision to the control group. The trial estimated that <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> provided protection of 60% (95% CI: 32%–76%) for female to male HIV transmission. The results of this trial along with two others led to the World Health Organization (WHO) assessing the evidence for <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> to prevent HIV transmission. The WHO and UNAIDS subsequently issued recommendations concerning <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> and HIV/AIDS including suggestions for government strategic plans, advocacy challenges and exploring the role of new technologies for voluntary medical <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> (VMMC) such as Prepex and other medical devices.

40|$|Using a {{sequential}} {{conditional independence}} assumption, this paper discusses fully nonparametric estimation of natural {{direct and indirect}} causal effects in causal mediation analysis based on inverse probability weighting. We propose estimators of the average indirect effect of a binary treatment, which operates through intermediate variables (or mediators) on the causal path between the treatment and the outcome, {{as well as the}} unmediated direct effect. In a first step, treatment propensity scores given the mediator and observed covariates or given covariates alone are estimated by nonparametric series logit estimation. In a second step, they are used to reweigh observations in order to estimate the effects of interest. We establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of this approach as well as a weighted version thereof. The latter allows evaluating effects on specific subgroups like the treated, for which we derive the asymptotic properties under estimated propensity scores. We also provide a simulation study and an application to an information intervention about <b>male</b> <b>circumcisions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Heterosexual {{route is}} the most common mode of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) transmission among married couples in India. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine HIV seroconcordance and serodiscordance among couples when one of the partners is HIV positive. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study which included HIV positive married cohabiting cases was carried out at the Department of Skin-VD, Medical College, Baroda. Detailed history of high-risk sexual behavior, blood transfusion (BT) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was taken. All the cases were examined for the presence of STIs and all males were examined for circumcision. The spouses of these cases were tested for HIV to know the seroconcordance/serodiscordance. Results: A total of 66 HIV positive cases were studied which included 34 males and 32 females. Forty-five cases had seropositive spouses that consisted of 20 out of 34 HIV positive males and 25 out of 32 HIV positive females. History of STI was present in 13 cases. History of BT in one of the spouses was present in 15 of 45 seroconcordant couples while in 6 out of 21 serodiscordant couples. Among 34 HIV positive <b>males,</b> <b>circumcision</b> was present in 8 cases out of which 6 were serodiscordant. Discussion: About 68 % concordance suggests continued intramarital transmission probably due to lack of spousal communication and late testing. In cases having transfusion transmitted HIV, seroconcordance rate was found to be high. Such cases are usually asymptomatic and hence tested late but continue to transmit HIV by unprotected sexual activity...|$|R

Circumcision is near universal in the Christian countries of Oceania. While The Catholic Church currently maintains a neutral position on the practice of non-religious circumcision, Coptic Christianity and Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Eritrean Orthodoxy still observe <b>male</b> <b>circumcision</b> and practice circumcision as a rite of passage.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{published}} to examine whether circumcision has any advantageous effect on the prevention of urinary tract infection (UTI), especially in male infants with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Colonization of bacteria in the inner prepuce and its reduction by circumcision has been documented, and circumcision may {{reduce the risk of}} febrile UTI (fUTI) in <b>males.</b> <b>Circumcision</b> is described as a therapeutic choice against VUR in the current American Urological Association and European Association of Urology/European Society for Pediatric Urology guidelines. In countries where neonatal circumcision is routinely performed, there may exist no clinical problems with regard to this issue. However, in Asian countries, there is a sharp division in the prevalence of circumcised males; for example, it is > 80 % in Islamic countries, South Korea, and the Philippines, but its prevalence is < 20 % in the majority of the other countries, including China, India, Japan, and Taiwan. In countries where neonatal circumcision is routinely performed, no clinical problem exists with regard to using it as a treatment for VUR. By contrast, in countries where circumcision is not routinely performed for children, strong objection exists against using this procedure for this purpose. Thus, treatment for fUTI among uncircumcised boys in these countries should be further studied in a separate context from the countries where circumcision is highly prevalent. In countries such as Korea and the Philippines where circumcision is performed during childhood, but not as a routine procedure in neonates, one may have an obligation to present circumcision as a choice of treatment for male infants with fUTI and/or VUR, and setting an appropriate age for circumcision could be an important clinical question...|$|R
