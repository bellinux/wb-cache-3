5000|$|Vera Baird {{was born}} in Chadderton, near Oldham in Lancashire, the {{daughter}} of Jack Thomas, a <b>maintenance</b> <b>painter</b> in a cotton mill, who {{died when she was}} 10 years old, and Alice Marsland, a print worker. Her paternal grandfather was a Welsh miner and her maternal grandparents were cotton mill workers. She went to Yew Tree County Primary School and the local authority-run Chadderton Grammar School for Girls and was then at Newcastle Polytechnic where she studied Law, gaining an LLB. Whilst there she founded and edited a Student Newspaper, [...] "Polygon" [...] and a year later was elected Vice President of the Polytechnic Union.In 1983 she gained a BA in Literature and Modern History at the Open University. In 1983 she became a legal associate of the Royal Town Planning Institute. She completed the first year of an MA in modern history at London Guildhall University from 1999 before transferring to University of Teesside on being selected for Redcar. She is currently studying for an MPhil (History) at the University of Teesside.|$|E

The 14 clusters (and the job titles included in each cluster) are as follows: (1) construction (bricklayer, carpenter, building maintenance worker, electrician, <b>maintenance</b> <b>painter,</b> plumber/pipefitter); (2) electronic (computer repair technician, electrical and electronic technician); (3) graphic communications (commercial artists, compositors and/or typesetters, offset lithographic press operators, printing photographers, camera operators); (4) transportation (automotive mechanic, diesel mechanic, gasoline engine/mower repair); (5) manufacturing (machine tool operator, machinist, tool and die maker, punch press operator, sheet r,etal worker, combination welder, maintenance repairer, automate...|$|E
40|$|Quantifying the {{exposure}} of construction painters to mixed organic solvents is difficult {{in the face of}} a lack of industrial hygiene data, the heterogeneity of the solvents used, and the variability in work practices which influences the amount of solvents to which a worker is actually exposed. This report describes an attempt to derive an estimate of airborne solvent exposure using questionnaire responses in a population of construction and <b>maintenance</b> <b>painters.</b> This exposure index (EI) is a weighted average of the total number of gallons used a year minus the fraction which would be absorbed by a respirator, where the weights are based on the method of application (spraying, rolling, brushing) and the presence of ventilation (per cent time inside v outside). An analysis performed to determine the sensitivity of the EI to variations in the values chosen for several parameters showed that the index is relatively insensitive to the underlying assumptions that we have used. One component of the EI (self report of hours worked) correlated well with union payroll records. The EI appears to provide a useful relative (not absolute) estimate of airborne exposure to organic solvent mixtures which may be used as a dose surrogate in epidemiological investigations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To re-examine the {{relation}} between heavy physical work and the occurrence of sciatic pain among construction workers reported previously to be absent in an epidemiological study. METHODS-Poisson log linear regression was used to model for the frequency of sciatic pain among concrete reinforcement workers and <b>maintenance</b> house <b>painters</b> with adjustment for {{the interactive effects of}} earlier back accidents and aging that modified {{the relation}}. RESULTS: Concrete reinforcement work not only had a direct effect on the frequency of sciatic pain, but it also contributed significantly to the risk indirectly through earlier back accidents. The risk of sciatic pain increased from age 25 to 54 in a different manner for a worker depending on his occupational group and record of back accidents. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological studies on low back pain need to be analysed with sound methodology. This is important in view of future meta-analyses that will be performed for the purpose of providing guidelines on the prevention of back disorders in heavy physical work...|$|R
