5|$|Development of Final Fantasy XIII-2 began around March and April 2010 {{and lasted}} about {{one and a}} half years.

The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used in Final Fantasy XIII and includes a less linear overall design.|$|E
5|$|Little {{information}} was revealed about Armada of the Damned plot. Sterling had {{no connection with}} the film series' characters and story arcs. The game and the films shared the same universe, but the former was to take place before {{the events of the}} latter. Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who decided to become a pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance. After these events, the player had the option to follow two paths: become either a Legendary or a Dreaded pirate. On the Legendary path, the player would be a well-respected pirate who acted in good faith. On the Dreaded path, the player would be <b>mysterious</b> <b>and</b> feared.|$|E

5|$|The oldest archaeological artifacts, ivory chess pieces, were {{excavated}} {{in ancient}} Afrasiab, today's Samarkand, in Uzbekistan, central Asia, and date to about 760, {{with some of}} them possibly older. The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840–850, written by al-Adli ar-Rumi (800–870), a renowned Arab chess player, titled Kitab ash-shatranj (Book of the chess). This is a lost manuscript, but referenced in later works. The eastern migration of chess, into China and Southeast Asia, has even less documentation than its migration west. The first reference to chess, called Xiang Qi, in China comes in the xuán guaì lù (玄怪录, record of the <b>mysterious</b> <b>and</b> strange) dating to about 800. Alternatively, some contend that chess arose from Chinese chess or one of its predecessors, although this has been contested.|$|E
5|$|The poem {{ends with}} the narrator turning towards his own fate, {{accepting}} his life and accomplishments. The poem, like many of Gray's, incorporates a narrator who is contemplating his position in a transient world that is <b>mysterious</b> <b>and</b> tragic. Although the comparison between obscurity and renown is commonly seen as universal and not within a specific context with a specific political message, there are political ramifications for Gray's choices. Both John Milton and John Hampden spent time near the setting of Stoke Poges, which was also affected by the English Civil War. The poem's composition could also have been prompted by the entrance of Prince William, Duke of Cumberland into London or by a trial of Jacobite nobility in 1746.|$|E

Sikorski's Liberator II crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several conspiracy theories that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously been blamed on the Soviets, British, Nazis or even a dissenting Polish faction. The incident is still described by some historians as <b>mysterious,</b> <b>and</b> since 2008 it has been under an investigation by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, ongoing as of July 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Mirza puzzled researchers {{for many}} years. Gray often created <b>mysterious</b> <b>and</b> unexplained taxonomic names—a trend not only continued with {{his description of}} Mirza in 1870, {{but also with the}} genera Phaner (fork-marked lemurs) and Azema (for M.rufus, now a synonym for Microcebus), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For Mirza, Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mîrzâ ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from Arabian Nights, a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert, which premiered in London on 19November1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.|$|E
