5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source <b>may</b> {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date <b>may</b> well {{be too late}} for man who was an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley <b>may</b> leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, <b>may</b> be evidence that the documents were drawn up at about the same time. If so, Ragnall's charter <b>may</b> be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters <b>may</b> indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant <b>may</b> also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there <b>may</b> partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
