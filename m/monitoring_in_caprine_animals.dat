40|$|Abstract Background This study {{reports the}} {{identification}} of a full-length cDNA sequence for two novel caprine prolactin-related proteins (cPRP 1 and cPRP 6), and their localization and quantitative expression <b>in</b> the placenta. <b>Caprine</b> PRPs are compared with known bovine PRPs. We examined their evolution and role in the ruminant placenta. Results Full-length cPRP 1 and cPRP 6 cDNA were cloned with a 717 - and 720 - nucleotide open-reading frame corresponding to proteins of 238 and 239 amino acids. The cPRP 1 predicted amino acid sequence shares a 72 % homology with bovine PRP 1 (bPRP 1). The cPRP 6 predicted amino acid sequence shares a 74 % homology with bovine PRP 6 (bPRP 6). The two cPRPs as well as bPRPs were detected only in the placentome by RT-PCR. Analysis by in situ hybridization revealed the presence of both cPRPs mRNA in the trophoblast binucleate cells. These mRNA were quantified by real-time RT-PCR analysis of the placentome at 30, 50, 90 and 140 days of pregnancy. Both new cPRP genes were able to translate a mature protein in a mammalian cell-expression system. Western blotting established the molecular sizes of 33 kDa for cPRP 1 with FLAG-tag and 45 kDa for cPRP 6 with FLAG-tag. The sequence properties and localized expression of cPRP 1 and cPRP 6 {{were similar to those}} of bovine. However, their expression profiles differed from those in bovine placenta. Although this study demonstrated possible roles of PRPs <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> placenta, PRPs may regulate binucleate-cell functions like those in bovine, but their crucial roles are still unclear. Conclusion We have identified the novel PRPs <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> placenta. Localization and quantitative expression of caprine PRPs were compared with bovine PRPs. The data indicate that PRP genes <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> placenta have coordination functions for gestation, as they do in bovine.

A protein hydrolysate (MHP, obtained from incubation of bovine milk with protease) or {{a mixture of}} free amino acids (FAA, similar to the amino acid fraction of MHP) was added as a nitrogen enrichment source. Bifidobacterium lactis and Lact. acidophilus were inoculated at 50 ml l− 1 and incubated at 37 °C with growth supplements added at ratios in the range 25 – 50 ml l− 1. The maximum viable counts of Bif. lactis were lower in plain ovine and <b>caprine</b> milk than <b>in</b> nitrogen-enriched milk, and MHP was a better growth promoter than FAA.

However, {{research into}} archaeological domestic populations has been hindered by the difficulty of recording and interpreting enamel hypoplasia in high-crowned species such as caprines and cattle. This research develops a methodological approach for recording enamel hypoplasia in high-crowned species which is applied to modern and archaeological caprine populations from three geographically distinct regions (Orkney, Kenya and Iceland). Modern caprines with known life histories are used to investigate baseline {{factors such as the}} impact of the environment and nutrition on the frequency and severity of enamel hypoplasia <b>in</b> <b>caprines.</b> These baselines are then used to interpret enamel hypoplasia in archaeological populations. Results indicate that enamel hypoplasia frequency and severity can be linked to variation in the climate /environment as well as nutrition levels <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> populations. By comparing enamel hypoplasia frequency and severity between populations with similar baseline factors, variation in animal management strategies can be identified. Physiological and seasonal stress events including birth, weaning, and seasonal periods of malnutrition are also identified using enamel hypoplasia in both modern and archaeological populations. ...|$|R

We observed that the testicular arteries emerge from the abdominal aorta, cross the inguinal canal to become coiled and involved by the pampiniform plexus. Close to the caudal extremity of the testis, the arteries become divided in cranial and caudal branches that emit collateral vessels to originate emerging branches. Testicles with intermediate level of scrotal division (group II) showed a smaller amount of those branches than the others, being the most populated the ventrolateral and the dorsolateral quadrants.

40|$|Abstract Recently, {{infant formula}} {{products}} made of caprine milk have gained popularity, mainly because the nutritional composition of caprine milk {{is similar to}} that of human milk. <b>In</b> addition, <b>caprine</b> milk is considered to be better than bovine milk in terms of nutrient composition and easier digestion.

40|$|The {{importance}} of goat milk in infant diet is growing, {{because it is}} reported that goat's milk in some cases is less allergenic than cow's milk. This is due probably to the lower presence of caseins associated with {{a specific type of}} alpha(s 1) -casein. <b>In</b> <b>caprine</b> breeds, four types of alpha(s 1) -casein alleles are identified and associated with various amounts of this protein in milk. The contribution of strong alleles to the goat milk is approximately 3. 6 g/L of alpha(s 1) -casein, while for middle alleles is only 1. 6 g/L, weak alleles 0. 6 g/L. The contribution of null allele is very low (or non-existent). The quantity of total caseins <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> milk is positively correlated with the amount of alpha(s 1) -casein. Milk from animals possessing strong alleles contain significantly more total caseins than milk from animals without those alleles. This is important because animals with mild alleles can be employed to produce milk for allergic subjects while the other animals can be used to produce milk for the dairy industry. This work shows casein profiles of two types of classified goat milk (B, strong alpha(s 1) allele, 0, null alpha(s 1) allele) with two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, and it confirms the different polymorphisms at locus alpha(s 1) casein...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrimate {{lentivirus}} (HIV and SIV) vpr accessory genes encode 12 - to 14 -kDa proteins which induce {{cell cycle}} arrest at the G 2 phase of infected cells, {{preventing them from}} going through mitosis. Members of the HIV- 2 /SIVmac/SIVsmm group also encode a second closely related accessory protein called Vpx. Vpx and HIV Vpr are critical for virus replication in nondividing cells due to their participation in nuclear import of the preintegration complex. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) and maedi visna virus are the natural lentiviruses of domestic goat and sheep, respectively, and their genomes do not carry vpr and vpx genes. In this study, we generated chimeric CAEV-based genomes carrying vpr and vpx genes from SIVmac 239 and tested their ability to induce G 2 cell cycle arrest <b>in</b> infected <b>caprine</b> cells. CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr is the chimeric genome that was shown to be infectious and replication competent. Our data demonstrated that CAEV–pBSCAvpxvpr-infected goat synovial membrane cell monolayer developed more cytopathic effects and {{a high proportion of}} cells remained in the G 2 phase of cell cycle. This G 2 arrest was observed both at the early and at the late stages of infection, while minimal effect was observed with the parental CAEV–pBSCA. These results, described {{for the first time in}} mammalian cells other than those of primates, indicate that Vpr-induced G 2 cell cycle arrest is not restricted to only primate cells. Thus, conservation of Vpx/Vpr protein functions <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> cells suggests a possible role for these proteins in the virus life cycle and its ability to adapt to new hosts.

In the early stages of endocytosis, intact erythrocytes were contained in some of the heterophagic vacuoles of macrophages. Later, granular, electron-dense material appeared on erythrocytes, presumably as a result of lysosomal degradation of their matrices. Subsequently, the matrix fragmented and probably formed &# 39;myelin-like figures&# 39; and residual bodies that dominated the macrophage cytoplasm. In addition, images of sinusoidal endothelium, reticular cells, lymphocytes and, rarely, eosinophils were observed that depicted structures resembling various stages of lysosomal digestion of erythrocyte matrix noted in macrophages. Our study provides evidence to support the fact that effete erythrocytes are filtered, besides known organs, also <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> hemal nodes. The morphology and location of hemal nodes suggest that the organ can be an efficient blood filter...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} {{the effect of the}} addition of IGF- 1 to the in vitro culture (IVC) medium on the development of caprine and bovine preantral follicles ≥ 150 μm <b>in</b> diameter. <b>Caprine</b> and bovine preantral follicles were cultured for 18 days in the absence or presence of 50 ng/mL IGF- 1. Follicles were classified according to morphological characteristics, and those showing morphological signs of degeneration such as darkness of oocytes and surrounding cumulus cells or those with misshapen oocytes were classified as degenerated. Oocyte and follicular diameter were measured only in healthy follicles and antral cavity formation was defined as a visible translucent cavity within the granulosa cell layers. Regarding follicular growth, the daily increase in follicular diameter was calculated, and oocyte extrusion was determined by calculating the rates of ruptured basement membrane with the release of cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs). After IVC, oocytes were submitted to in vitro maturation (IVM) and morphological analysis using fluorescent markers. IGF- 1 did not affect follicular morphology and antrum formation in both species. However, follicular extrusion and in vitro matured oocytes were obtained only <b>in</b> <b>caprine.</b> It can thus be said that although bovine and caprine preantral follicles react differently at same culture conditions, this study showed the successful in vitro development of caprine preantral follicles. We also suggest the enrichment of the IVC media and increase in the IVC period for bovine preantral follicles...|$|R
40|$|Papillomatous lesions were {{isolated}} from the mammary skin of goats and examined for evidence of papillomavirus (PV) infection by various criteria, including gross morphology, histology and DNA hybridization. Although some lesions showed gross papillomatous morphological and histological features similar to those caused by papillomavirus in other species, no viral particles were detected. Reverse slot hybridization revealed cross-hybridization between DNA extracted from goat mammary papillomas and human papillomaviruses (HPV). Southern blot, using ovine papillomavirus (OPV) and bovine papillomavirus type 5 (BPV 5) DNA probes under conditions of reduced stringency (Tm - 40 degrees C), detected homologous sequences in 40 % of the biopsies. DNA fragments corresponding probably to a monomeric form (7000 - 8000 bp) of an unknown papillomavirus genome were detected. This study provides evidence {{for the existence of}} papillomavirus-like sequences <b>in</b> <b>caprine</b> mammary papillomas and suggests that a papillomavirus is likely {{to be involved in the}} development of precancerous lesions of goat mammary skin.
