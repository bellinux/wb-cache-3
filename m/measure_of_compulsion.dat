But {{all that was}} before he suspected that life could still have anything to offer him, whilst he conceived that Rosamund was definitely lost to him. True, he had {{the memory of a}} certain tenderness she had shown him yesternight aboard the galley, but he had deemed that tenderness to be no more than such as the situation itself begot. Almost he had deemed the same to be here the case until he had witnessed her fierceness and despair in fighting for his life, until he had heard and gauged the sincerity of her avowal that she loved him and desired to make some amends to him for all that he had suffered in the past. That had spurred him, and had a further spur been needed, it was afforded him when they branded her words with falsehood, mocked her to her face with what they supposed to be her lies. Anger had taken him at that to stiffen his resolve to make a stand against them and use the one weapon that remained him--that a merciful chance, a just God had placed within his power almost despite himself.|$|E
40|$|A Regulation Approach {{framework}} {{has been}} adopted to analyse the very rapid period of change in social security policy since the late 1980 s. It is argued that the changes can be {{explained in terms of}} a number of regulatory dilemmas which emerged or were intensified under neo-liberal capital accumulation. Some of the regulatory dilemmas – high levels of economic inactivity, inflationary pressures consequent to higher employment and low levels of wages – it was thought could be managed through the social security system using what we call ‘market workfare’; by which we mean in-work means-tested social security benefits which have some <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> to work attached, such that it counts as workfare. The aim of in-work benefits is to reduce wages further so that the market can respond by creating more low-wage employment. By this stratagem it is the market which responds to labour demand, rather than the government creating work opportunities. The parliamentary neo-liberal right's approach to ‘market workfare’ is discussed, and then it is suggested that the marked similarities between New Labour and the previous parliamentary neo-liberal right can be explained because both administrations were attempting to manage the same regulatory dilemmas...|$|E

No research has been published to date on the use of ACT as a treatment for adolescent OCD. To begin investigating ACT for youth OCD, a multiple baseline study was conducted. The primary <b>measure</b> was self-monitoring <b>of</b> <b>compulsions</b> and assessor completed (CYBOCS). Three adolescent participants, ages 12 to 17, were treated with 8 to 10 sessions of ACT (without exposure). Results showed that the intervention was successful for all participants, with a 40 % mean reduction in self-reported <b>compulsions.</b> Near absence <b>of</b> <b>compulsions</b> was reported by two of three participants at posttreatment. CY-BOCS ratings decreased by an average of 28. 2 %. Treatment procedures were rated by participants and parents as highly acceptable. Experimental and clinical implications of results are discussed. Data suggest that ACT may be a viable treatment as an alternative or an adjunct to exposure-based treatments...|$|R
40|$|Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} debilitating of the anxiety disorders. As our knowledge about this childhood condition continues to grow, there is a need for controlled treatment-outcome trials with precise assessments that are sensitive to treatment change, to guide the development of effective interventions. To evaluate the efficacy of a treatment protocol, it is necessary to have reliable and sensitive <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> OCD symptoms, including <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> obsessions, <b>compulsions,</b> and related levels of distress and avoidance. Whilst structured diagnostic interviews, semistructured clinical interviews, and self-report measures have been widely used in the assessment of childhood OCD, related levels of behavioral distress and avoidance have not been measured in treatment-outcome trials. This study investigated the sensitivity of a behavioral avoidance test (BAT), conducted in the home environment, in assessing treatment-outcome effects for children and adolescents with OCD following a 14 -week cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, in comparison to children in an 8 -week "wait list" control group. The results of the current study strongly support the sensitivity of a standardized BAT in assessing treatment-related changes in children and adolescents with OCD. Implications and future directions for research are discussed. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The {{right of}} {{personal}} freedom {{is one of}} the most important right from the set of basic human rights and freedoms, contained in the most important acts of international legal character, and the constitutions of states based on the rule of law. This right is directly related to the very human existence, and, therefore, it is necessary to make its legal articulation. Personal freedom means the right to security of the citizen, that he will not be arrested and detained in prison by the state authorities, as well as the right to be free to move and inhabit. However, from the very nature of Criminal Law protection of social values, arises the need to limit the right to personal freedom in exceptional circumstances, including the detention of the suspect. Keeping the suspect is a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> procedural <b>compulsion,</b> by which, through the police decision, detained prison is temporarily imprisoned, for gathering information and hearing. The basic principles of humanity require that the detained suspect retains all the rights, derived from the principle of personal liberty...|$|R
40|$|Copyright © 2010 British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive PsychotherapiesBackground: Recent {{interest}} {{in the role of}} vulnerability factors in obsessional washing has suggested that disgust sensitivity, danger expectancy and health anxiety may be of interest. Aims: This study explores the differential impact of these factors on both behavioural and cognitive <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> washing behaviour and is based on a replication of the Jones and Menzies (1997) experiment, during which participants immersed their hands in a noxious compound while rating themselves on a range of measures: the time they subsequently took to wash their hands was measured and danger expectancies were found to be the best predictor of this. Method: The present study added <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> disgust sensitivity and health anxiety to this experimental methodology while removing factors they found to be of little import to compulsive washing. Thirty non-clinical participants took part. Results: Results confirmed that disgust sensitivity was related to the behavioural <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> washing time, but that this relationship was almost entirely mediated by the danger expectancy concerning judgements of severity of consequent disease. However, a different pattern emerged when the outcome measure was questionnaire based: danger expectancy was not at all related to this. Disgust sensitivity mediated the relationship between health anxiety and scores on a questionnaire <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> washing <b>compulsions.</b> Interestingly, these scores were not related to the behavioural <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> washing time. Conclusions: The implications of these relationships to the further development of subtypes of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{judgment}} of Valentyn Galunko, {{the matter of the}} branch of the administrative law of Ukraine is the system of broad [...] social relations between the public administration and the objects of public management, which arise in the sphere of authoritative-administrative activity, rendering of administrative services with the aim of public guaranteeing of rights and [...] liberties of the person and the citizen and normal functioning of the civil society and the state, with the possibility <b>of</b> applying <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> administrative <b>compulsion</b> and administrative responsibility to disturbers of the administrative-legal regulations.The foremost method of the administrative law is the administrative-legal method of legal regulation of social relations, the essence of which consists {{in the fact that the}} subject of the public management is empowered with authoritative competence, and the object is obliged to fulfill his legal requirements. Under the conditions of the [...] democratic lawful state the mentioned method has lost authoritarian features, because it is balanced by strict compliance with legality by the public administration and by the possibility of the object of public management to appeal against his actions to several independent instances.|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>compulsion,</b> {{in which}} {{addictive}} behaviour {{is said to}} be carried out against the will, is central to the disease theory of addiction and ubiquitous in modern definitions. The aims of this article are: (i) to describe various meanings <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> in the literature; (ii) to compare the part thought to be played by compulsion in addiction with its suggested role in obsessive-compulsive disorder; (iii) to critically examine the place <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> in influential neurobiological accounts of addiction; (iv) to summarise the empirical evidence bearing on the usefulness <b>of</b> the <b>compulsion</b> concept, evidence that seems at first sight incompatible with the notion <b>of</b> <b>compulsion.</b> This is followed by a discussion of which possible meanings <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> can survive an empirical test and what role they might play in understanding addiction, paying particular attention to a distinction between strong and weak senses <b>of</b> <b>compulsion.</b> A conclusion is that addictive behaviour cannot be considered compulsive at the time it is carried out, though other possible meanings <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> as an explanation or description of addictive behaviour and experience are discussed. Among other conclusions, it is suggested that, although in some senses of the term it may seem arbitrary whether or not ‘compulsion’ should be retained, its use has important consequences for the public understanding of addiction, and is likely to deter people's attempts to overcome their addictions and their chances of success...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} {{debate in the}} UK as to the place <b>of</b> {{coercion}} and <b>compulsion</b> in community mental health care. Recent changes in service provision and amendments to the Mental Health Act in England and Wales have increased the scope for compulsion in the community. This has intensified the debate revealing fault lines in the psychiatric and legal professions. Despite powerful arguments from all sides there is little empirical evidence to inform this debate at a clinical or a theoretical level. This review utilizes evidence from articles in peer reviewed journals. Papers were identified from electronic databases, the authors' databases of relevant literature and personal correspondence with experts in the field. The evidence base is relatively small but is expanding. It has been demonstrated that informal coercion is common in USA mental health services and can be experienced negatively by patients. There is evidence that powers <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> in community mental health care are used frequently when available and their availability is generally seen as positive by clinicians when practice becomes embedded. The evidence for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> in community mental health care is patchy and conflicting, with randomized or other trials failing to show significant benefits overall even if secondary analyses may suggest positive outcomes in some subgroups. There are widespread regional and international differences in the use <b>of</b> community <b>compulsion.</b> Research examining treatment pressures (or 'leverage') and the subjective patient experience of them appears to be expanding and is increasing our awareness and understanding of these complex issues. There is an urgent need for evidence regarding the usefulness and acceptability <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> in the community now that powers have been made available. Trials of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>compulsion</b> are needed as is qualitative work examining the experiences {{of those involved in}} the use of such orders. These are needed to help clinicians utilize the powers available to them in an informed and judicious fashion and to ensure adequate training...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} paper {{deals with the}} legal nature <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> {{criminal}} procedural <b>compulsion</b> {{in the form of}} seizure of property. Methodological basis of the article is based on general scientific dialectical methods of cognition of objective reality of the legal processes and phenomena that allowed us to conduct an objective assessment of the state of legislation and law enforcement practice in the procedural aspects of the cancellation of the seizure of property in criminal proceedings of Russia. The results and scope of it’s application. It is submitted that the cancellation of the seizure of the property (or the individual limit) is allowed only on the grounds and in the manner prescribed by the criminal procedure law of the Russian Federation. However, the study found serious contradictions in the application of the relevant law. In particular, cases in which the question of exemption of property from arrest (exclusion from the inventory),imposed in the criminal case was resolved in a civil procedure that, in the opinion of theauthor of the publication, is extremely unacceptable. On the stated issues topics analyzes opinions of scientists who say that the dispute about the release of impounded property may be allowed in civil proceedings, including pending resolution of the criminal case on the merits. The author strongly disagrees with this position and supports those experts who argue that the filing of a claim for exemption of property from arrest (exclusion from the inventory) the reviewed judicial act of imposing of arrest without recognition per se invalid. In this regard, the author cites the legal position of the constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, from which clearly follows that of the right of everyone to judicial protection does not imply the possibility of choice of the citizen at its discretion, techniques and procedures of judicial protection, since the features of such judicial protection is defined in specific Federal laws. The author analyzes and appreciates Kazakhstan's experience of legal regulation of the permissibility of filing a civil claim for exemption of property from seizure imposed in criminal proceedings. The author notes that the new civil procedural legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which came into force from 01 January 2016, clearly captures that consideration in the civil proceedings are not subject to claims for exemption of property from seizure by the criminal prosecution body. Conclusions. Necessity of amendment to article 422 of the Civil Procedure Code of Russia: this article should not apply to cases <b>of</b> application <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> criminal procedural <b>compulsion</b> in the form of seizure of property.
