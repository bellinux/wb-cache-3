5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are <b>methyl</b> <b>formate</b> isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

50|$|Related to the {{production}} of furfural, MMF can be produced from C-6 sugars hexoses such as glucose and fructose. It is formed via the dehydration of the hexoses and subsequent etherification of HMF. Already in 1936 a batch process was patented for {{the production}} of MMF and methyl levulinate. Bicker reported first order kinetics for the dehydration of fructose, etherification of HMF into 5-methoxymethyl-2-furfural (MMF) and by-products formation in methanol. An MMF yield of 78% at 99% conversion was obtained at 240 °C and a residence time of 2 s. At short residence times, especially at lower temperatures significant amounts of HMF were observed and smaller amount of MMF. The amount of MMF increased with residence time at the cost of the amount of HMF, which indicates that MMF formation goes through HMF. Reactions in various alcohols by Brown et al. {{led to the formation of}} the appropriate HMF ether and levulinic acid ester. A number of primary and secondary alcohols was tested, from methanol to 2-butanol. In methanol a yield of 43% MMF was reported in combination with 47% methyl levulinate. Garves has shown that also cellulose is efficiently degraded by alcohols and strong acid-catalysts at 180 °C to 200 °C within minutes.

In this study, the metabolic effects of MnIO-NPs (dosed at 1 and 5 mg Fe/kg) on Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated using metabonomic analysis, histopathological examination, and conventional biochemical analysis. The histological changes included a focal inflammation in the liver at high-dose and a slightly enlarged area of splenic white pulp after 48 h post-dose. Blood biochemical analysis showed that albumin, globulins, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose changed distinctly compared to the control. The metabonomic analysis of body fluids (serum and urine) and tissues (liver, kidney, and spleen) indicated that MnIO-NPs induced metabolic perturbation in rats including energy, nucleotides, amino acids and phospholipid metabolisms.

Growth was exponential, and both methane {{production}} and formate consumption were linear functions of the growth rate. Hydrogen was produced in only trace amounts, and the dissolved H 2 concentration of the culture medium was below 1 μM. The effect of temperature or pH on the rate of methane formation was studied with a single fermentor culture in mid-log phase that was grown with formate under standard conditions at 37 °C and pH 7. 6. Methane formation from formate occurred over the pH range from 6. 5 to 8. 6, with a maximum at pH 8. 0. The maximum temperature of methanogenesis was 56 °C. H 2 production increased at higher temperatures. Hydrogen and formate were consumed throughout growth when both were present in saturating concentrations. The molar growth yields were 1. 2 ± 0. 06 g (dry weight) per mol of formate and 4. 8 ± 0. 24 g (dry weight) per mol of methane.

The {τ_(L 1) < τ_(L 2) } values at which the inflections occur depend exponentially, but with opposite trends, on the solution pH.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{routinely}} used microbiological {{diagnosis of}} ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is time consuming and often requires invasive methods for collection of human specimens (e. g. bronchoscopy). Therefore, {{it is of}} utmost interest to develop a non-invasive method for the early detection of bacterial infection in ventilated patients, preferably allowing {{the identification of the}} specific pathogens. The present work is an attempt to identify pathogen-derived volatile biomarkers in breath {{that can be used for}} early and non- invasive diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). For this purpose, in vitro experiments with bacteria most frequently found in VAP patients, i. e. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were performed to investigate the release or consumption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Results Headspace samples were collected and preconcentrated on multibed sorption tubes at different time points and subsequently analyzed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). As many as 32 and 37 volatile metabolites were released by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Distinct differences in the bacteria-specific VOC profiles were found, especially with regard to aldehydes (e. g. acetaldehyde, 3 -methylbutanal), which were taken up only by P. aeruginosa but released by S. aureus. Differences in concentration profiles were also found for acids (e. g. isovaleric acid), ketones (e. g. acetoin, 2 -nonanone), hydrocarbons (e. g. 2 -butene, 1, 10 -undecadiene), alcohols (e. g. 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol, 2 -butanol), esters (e. g. ethyl <b>formate,</b> <b>methyl</b> 2 -methylbutyrate), volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs, e. g. dimethylsulfide) and volatile nitrogen compounds (VNCs, e. g. 3 -methylpyrrole). Importantly, a significant VOC release was found already 1. 5 hours after culture start, corresponding to cell numbers of ~ 8 * 10 6 [CFUs/ml]. Conclusions The results obtained provide strong evidence that the detection and perhaps even identification of bacteria could be achieved by determination of characteristic volatile metabolites, supporting the clinical use of breath-gas analysis as non-invasive method for early detection of bacterial lung infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} investigations on the gas-phase {{chemistry of}} dimethyl sulfide (DMS: CH 3 -S-CH 3) with hydroxyl (OH) radicals {{performed in a}} 336 l quartz glass reactor in the laboratory of the Department of Physical Chemistry of the University of Wuppertal, Germany. In this work kinetic, product and mechanistic data for the reaction of OH radicals with DMS were obtained. The investigations were aimed at achieving {{a better understanding of}} the oxidation mechanism for DMS as a function of temperature. Such an insight will help to provide a basis for understanding the atmospheric processes that link DMS photooxidation to particle formation and climate change. Relative rate coefficients were measured for the first time for the gas-phase reactions of hydroxyl radicals with dimethyl sulfide for a wide range of temperature (250 - 299 K) and different partial pressures of oxygen (~ 0, 205 and 500 mbar) at 1000 mbar total pressure. Using in situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the analyses the following averaged values of the rate coefficients for the reaction of OH radicals with DMS were obtained: Temperature   k DMS x 10 11 (cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1) (K) ~ 0 mbar O 2 205 mbar O 2 500 mbar O 2 299 0. 50 ± 0. 10 0. 78 ± 0. 18 0. 95 ± 0. 19 0. 57 ± 0. 11 0. 98 ± 0. 23 1. 34 ± 0. 27 280 0. 62 ± 0. 13 1. 20 ± 0. 26 1. 54 ± 0. 31 270 0. 63 ± 0. 14 1. 51 ± 0. 34 1. 85 ± 0. 37 260 0. 64 ± 0. 13 1. 99 ± 0. 47 2. 38 ± 0. 47 250 0. 66 ± 0. 14 2. 82 ± 0. 77 2. 83 ± 0. 62   From the kinetic data the following Arrhenius expressions for the reaction of OH radicals with DMS, valid in the temperature range 250 to 299 K, have been obtained: O 2 partial pressure (mbar) k DMS (cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1) ~ 0 (1. 56 ± 0. 20) x 10 - 12 exp[(369 ± 27) / T] 205 (1. 31 ± 0. 08) x 10 - 14 exp[(1910 ± 69) / T] 500 (5. 1 ± 0. 71) x 10 - 14 exp[(1587 ± 24) / T]   Detailed product studies were performed on the OH radical initiated oxidation of dimethyl sulfide for different conditions of temperature (260, 270, 280, 290 and 298 K), oxygen partial pressure (~ 0, 250 and 500 mbar) and initial NO x concentrations (NO + NO 2 : 0 - 3215 ppbv 0 - 106 ppbv). The present work represents the first product study at low temperatures (260 - 280 K). The major sulfur-containing products identified in the OH radical initiated oxidation of DMS using in situ FTIR spectroscopy were: dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO: CH 3 S(O) CH 3) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), in the absence of NO x, and dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl sulfone (DMSO 2 : CH 3 S(O) 2 CH 3) and sulfur dioxide, in the presence of NO x. Formation of dimethyl sulfone, <b>methyl</b> thiol <b>formate</b> (MTF: CH 3 SCHO) and carbonyl sulfide (OCS), in the absence of NO x, and of methyl sulfonyl peroxynitrate (MSPN: CH 3 S(O) 2 OONO 2) and methane sulfonic acid (MSA: CH 3 S(O) 2 OH), in the presence of NO x, has also been observed. Using Ion Chromatography (IC) evidence has been found for the formation of methane sulfinic acid (MSIA: CH 3 S(O) OH) and methane sulfonic acid, both in the absence and presence of NO x. The variation of the product yields with temperature, NO x concentration and partial pressure of oxygen is consistent with the occurrence of both addition and abstraction channels in the OH radical initiated oxidation of DMS. At all temperatures and reaction conditions studied, in the presence of oxygen, the combined yields of dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethyl sulfone are roughly equal to the fraction of the reaction proceeding via the addition channel. The DMSO/DMSO 2 yield ratio observed in the reaction system was sensitive to the initial NO concentration. Increasing NO caused a decrease in the DMSO concentration with an approximately equivalent increase in the DMSO 2 concentration. A reaction sequence involving a DMS-OH adduct and O 2 has been proposed to explain the observation. The observations, however, support that this sequence will be unimportant under most atmospheric conditions and that reaction of the DMS-OH adduct with molecular oxygen will mainly produce DMSO. Based on the work it is suggested that in the OH radical initiated photooxidation of DMS in the remote marine atmosphere, where NO levels are extremely low, the major product of the O 2 -dependent pathway will be DMSO with a branching ratio of ≥ 0. 95 and DMSO 2, if formed at all, with a ratio of ≤ 0. 05. The work has confirmed that the reaction of CH 3 S radicals with O 2 to produce CH 2 S and its further oxidation is the most probable pathway for the production of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) under NO x -free experimental systems. At around room temperature the measured yield is similar to that reported in other studies; the present study, however, indicates that the process forming OCS may not be efficient at temperatures below 290 K. In all of the experimental systems the yield of SO 2 was always lower than the fraction of the reaction proceeding via the O 2 -independent pathway. In the NO x -free systems this has been attributed to the formation of products such as CH 3 SCHO (<b>methyl</b> thiol <b>formate),</b> CH 3 SCH 2 OH (methyl thiomethanol) and possibly CH 3 SCH 2 OOH. Of these products only CH 3 SCHO has been positively identified. The results support that in the remote marine atmosphere the yield of this compound in the oxidation of DMS will not be more than a few percent even at low temperatures. In the presence of high levels of NO x the low SO 2 yields can be explained by the formation of sulfur reservoir species such as CH 3 S(O) 2 OONO 2, CH 3 S(O) OONO 2, CH 3 S(O) ONO 2, CH 3 S(O) NO 2 and CH 3 S(O) NO. The low levels of SO 2 observed also support that the further oxidation of DMSO formed in the O 2 -dependent pathway is not leading to formation of high yields of SO 2 under the conditions of the experiments. The results from the kinetic and product studies have been used to propose a reaction mechanism for the reaction of OH radicals with DMS which can be implemented over the temperature range 260 - 306 K...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the gas phase oxidation of the lower aliphatic esters and of propane. The kinetics of the oxidation of methyl, ethyl, and propyl <b>formate,</b> <b>methyl</b> acetate, methyl propionate and methyl butyrate were determined at various temperatures from 280 ° to 450 °C. The experiments were made in a silica reaction vessel and the pressure changes accompanying oxidation were followed on a mercury manometer. The pressure-time curves usually showed an induction period after which the rate of change of pressure in the reaction vessel increased up to a maximum. Two temperature ranges of reactivity were observed with ethyl and propyl <b>formate,</b> <b>methyl</b> butyrate and propane. The rate of oxidation increased smoothly with increasing temperature up to about 350 Â°C. Between 350 Â° and 400 °C. the rate decreased rapidly with an increase in temperature. Above 400 Â°C. the rate increased continuously until ignition occurred. At all temperatures, an increase in the initial concentration of the combustible material increased the rate of oxidation and decreased the induction period. In the high temperature region an increase in the oxygen concentration similarly increased the rate of oxidation. In the low temperature region the rate of oxidation was independent of the oxygen concentration. Except at very low partial pressures of oxygen the induction period was independent of ths oxygan concentration in both the low and high temperature regions. A mass spectrometer was used to analyse the combustion gases for the unchanged ester (or propane), for residual oxygen, and for the amount of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide formed. At all temperatures the concentrations of the major constituents were directly proportional to the pressure changes measured in the reaction vessel. Sufficient experiments were made to establish the pressure measurements as a true measure of the oxidation process. Chemical and polarographic analyses were made for formaldehyde, aoetaldehyde, total acid and peroxide substances. In each case the concentration of the intermediate species passed through a maximum as the reaction went to completion. No significant oxidation was detected during the induction period. The outstanding feature of the general kinetics of the esters was the marked dependence of the rate of oxidation, in the low temperature region, on the molecular structure of the combustible material. An increase in the carbon chain length increased the rate of oxidation much more than would have been expected from tue normal organic chemistry of a homologous series. The effect was most pronounced between the esters of higher molecular weight. An increase in the carbon chain length on the ethereal side of the ester configuration had a much greater effect than a corresponding increase on the carbonyl side. Where only methyl groups, and no metnylene groups occurred, the ease of oxidation wae greatly reduced. The kinetic results are interpreted in terms of a series of reaction steps analogous to those proposed by Cullis and Hinshelwood for paraffin oxidation. The scheme postulates the formation of peroxide substances capable, in the low temperature region, of decomposition and the propogation of a branching chain reaction. The rate expression for the oxidation reaction is of the form f([O 2], [RH]) l - 2 kF The remarkable effects of the substituent groups are attributed largely to the effect of the structural changes on the rate of decomposition, k, of the peroxide species. The theories of Walsh and Norrish are discussed in relation to the experimental evidence of the present investigation. The analytical investigation of the cool flame mixtures of propane indicated that the products of cool flame combustion are very similar to those detected in the low temperature region of oxidation. The changes in the concentrations of the initial reagents and final products followed the same pattern as that observed at lower temperatures. The polarograme of the combustion samples collected immediately before, and after, the occurrence of a cool flame, showed a marked decrease in the concentration of peroxide material with the explosion. The analyses support the theory of Hardwell and Hinshelwood, that oool flakes result from the self-heating of the gas mixture by the thermal decomposition of the peroxide intermediates. The general scheme proposed is R- + 0 2 = R 00 - R 00 - + RH = R 00 H + R- R 00 H = R 0 - + - 0 H where the temperature coefficient of the rate of decomposition of the peroxide is greater than that of the rate of formation. If the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic, under appropriate conditions of concentration and reaction temperature, self-heating would be expected, and the rate would increase rapidly until the peroxide substances are largely consumed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Recently we {{proposed}} a new approach for analyzing and understanding dynamics and feasibility of combined reaction separation processes (Grüner and Kienle, 2004). The apprach is based on assumption of simultaneous phase and reaction equilibrium and {{can be viewed as}} an extension of the well-known equilibrium theory developed by Rhee et. al. (1986, 1989) among other non-reactive separation processes. It makes use of transformed concentration variables, which were first indtroduces by Doherty and co-worker (1987) for the steady state design of reactive distillation processes. It was shown that these transformed concentration variables can be directly generalized to the corresponding dynamic problem. Further, they can also be applied to other reactive separation processes, like fixed-bed as well as moving bed chromatographic reactors, for example. The approach provides profound insight into the dynamic behavior of these processes reveals inherent bounds feasible operation caused by reactive azeotropy. In the present contribution the methods are applied to ternary reaction systems of type 2 A B + C. It is shown that in the first case total conversion is only possible if reactant A has intermediate affinity to the solid phase. If A has highest or lowest affinity to the solid phase conversion, is limited due to reactive azeotropy for any feed concentration. In contrast to this in the second case the behavior depends on the feed concentration. If the feed concentration is sufficiently low, total conversion is possible for any order of affinities to the solid phase. Instead for high feed concentrations similar limitations occur as in the first case. As a practical example for the second reaction scheme, some ester hydrolysis reactions of <b>methyl</b> and ethyl <b>formate,</b> as well as methyl and ethyl acetate are discussed by Seidel-Morgenstern and co-workers (2004). Water is taken as a solvent in large excess and therefore has approximately constant concentration. In this application, the ester has always the highest affinity to the solid phase. It is shown that in the present case no limitations occur within the feasible range of feed concentration below the solubility boundary. The theoretical predictions are in agreement with simulation results from a rigorous model and with experimental observations. References: Barbosa, D., M. F. Doherty, Pro. R. Soc. Lond.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Numerous {{investigations}} {{have been made}} on the contribution of butter cultures to the flavor of cultured cream butter, but production of uniform cultured cream butter has not been possible in industry. Therefore, it was desirable to investigate in detail the qualitative and quantitative chemistry of the flavor of high quality butter cultures, and to examine more closely some of the aspects of flavor production by butter culture organisms. Volatile flavor components of high quality butter culture and control heated milk were isolated from intact samples {{by means of a}} specially designed low-temperature, reduced-pressure steam distillation apparatus. Most of the flavor compounds present in the resulting distillate fractions were tentatively identified by gas chromatographic relative retention time data. Flavor concentrates obtained by ethyl ether extractions of aqueous distillates were also separated by temperature-programmed, capillary column gas chromatography, and the effluent from the capillary column was analyzed by a fast- scan mass spectrometer. Many of the flavor compounds in the flavor concentrates were positively identified by correlation of mass spectral and gas chromatographic data. In addition, supporting evidence for the identification of some flavor components was obtained through the use of qualitative functional group reagents, derivatives and headspace gas chromatography. Compounds that were positively identified in butter culture include ethanol, acetone, ethyl <b>formate,</b> <b>methyl</b> acetate, acetaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfide, butanone, 2 -butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methane, methyl chloride, carbon dioxide and methanol; also included were 2 -pentanone, 2 -heptanone, acetoin, formic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, methyl hexanoate, ethyl hexanoate, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, methyl octanoate and ethyl octanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in butter culture include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, n-butanal, n-butanol, 2 -hexanone, n-pentanal, n-pentanol, 2 -mercaptoethanol, n-butyl formate, n-butyl acetate, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methylpropanal, methyl heptanoate, n-octanal, 2 -tridecanone, methyl benzoate, methyl nonanoate, ethyl nonanoate, ethyl decanoate, methyl dodecanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. Compounds that were positively identified in control heated milk include acetaldehyde, ethyl formate, ethyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, 2 -furfural, 2 -furfurol, 2 -nonanone, 2 -undecanone, ethyl octanoate and methyl decanoate. Compounds that were tentatively identified in control heated milk include dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methyl mercaptan, methyl acetate, acetone, methanol, butanone, butanal, n-butanol, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -mercaptoethanol, 2 -furfuryl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl heptanoate, 2 -tridecanone, ethyl decanoate, ethyl dodecanoate, delta-octalactone and delta-decalactone. The data indicated that the qualitative flavor composition of control heated milk and butter culture were very similar. Diacetyl, ethanol, 2 -butanol and acetic acid were noted to be consistently absent in the data for the control heated milk. Other compounds were not observed in the heated milk fractions, but were also absent from some of the culture fractions. This was attributed to their presence in low concentrations, chemical instability or inefficient recovery. A modified 3 -methyl- 2 -benzothiazolone hydrazone spectrophotometric procedure was adapted for the determination of acetaldehyde produced in lactic starter cultures. The procedure was applied in conjunction with diacetyl measurements in studying single- and mixed-strain lactic cultures. The diacetyl to acetaldehyde ratio was found to be approximately 4 : 1 in desirably flavored mixed-strain butter cultures. When the ratio of the two compounds was lower than 3 : 1 a green flavor was observed. Acetaldehyde utilization at 21 °C by Leuconostoc citrovorum 91404 was very rapid in both acidified (pH 4. 5) and non-acidified (pH 6. 5) milk cultures. The addition of five p. p. m. of acetaldehyde to non-acidified milk media prior to inoculation greatly enhanced growth of L. citrovorum 91404 during incubation at 21 °C. Combinations of single-strain organisms demonstrated that the green flavor defect can result from excess numbers of Streptococcus lactis or Streptococcus diacetilactis in relation to the L. citrovorum population. Diacetyl, dimethyl sulfide, acetaldehyde, acetic acid and carbon dioxide were found to be "key" compounds in natural butter culture flavor. Optimum levels of these compounds in butter culture were ascertained by chemical or flavor panel evaluations. On the basis of these determinations, a synthetic butter culture prepared with heated whole milk and delta-gluconolactone (final pH 4. 65) was flavored with 2. 0 p. p. m. of diacetyl, 0. 5 p. p. m. of acetaldehyde, 1250 p. p. m. of acetic acid, 25. 0 p. p. b. of dimethyl sulfide and a small amount of sodium bicarbonate for production of carbon dioxide. The resulting synthetic butter culture exhibited the typical aroma, flavor and body characteristics found in natural high quality butter cultures, except that the delta-gluconolactone was found to contribute an astringent flavor...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to identify the flavor compounds in Blue cheese, however, duplication of Blue cheese flavor has not yet been accomplished. Therefore, it was desirable to make a qualitative and quantitative investigation of Blue cheese flavor compounds and to study the effect of certain microorganisms on Blue cheese flavor. The aroma fraction of Blue cheese was isolated by centrifugation of the cheese and molecular distillation of the recovered fat. The volatiles were separated by gas chromatography on packed columns containing polar and nonpolar phases and by temperature programmed capillary column gas chromatography. Relative retention time data and fast scan mass spectral analysis of the capillary column effluent were used to identify compounds in the aroma fraction. Compounds positively identified were as follows: 2 -pentanone, 2 -hexanone, 2 -heptanone, 2 -octanone, 2 -nonanone, 2 -decanone, 2 -undecanone, 2 -tridecanone, 2 -propanol, 2 -pentanol, 2 -heptanol, 2 -octanol, 2 -nonanol, methyl butanoate, methyl hexanote, methyl octanoate, methyl decanoate, <b>methyl</b> dodecanoate, ethyl <b>formate,</b> ethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, ethanal, 3 -methyl butanal, 2 -methyl butanol, 3 -methyl butanol, 1 -pentanol, benzene, and toluene. Tentatively identified compounds included acetone, delta-octalactone, delta-decalactone, methyl acetate, isopropyl hexanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, pentyl hexanoate, ethyl- 2 -methylnonanoate, isopropyl decanoate, furfural, 2 -methyl propanal, methanol, ethanol, 2 -phenylethanol, cresyl methyl ether, dimethylcyclohexane, diacetyl, methyl mercaptan, and hydrogen sulfide. A combination of liquid-liquid column chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography was utilized to quantitate the major free fatty acids in Blue and Roquefort cheese samples. The average concentration (mg acid/kg cheese) in three Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 : 0, 826; 4 : 0, 1, 448; 6 : 0, 909; 8 : 0, 771; 10 : 0, 1, 318; 12 : 0, 1, 588; 14 : 0, 5, 856; 16 : 0, 12, 789; 18 : 0, 4, 243; 18 : 1, 12, 455; 18 : 2, 1, 072; 18 : 3, 987. Roquefort cheese was found to be proportionately more abundant in 8 : 0 and 10 : 0 acids and low in 4 : 0 acid compared to Blue cheese. No formic, propionic, or isovaleric acid was detected in any of the cheeses tested. A quantitative procedure involving adsorption chromatography, liquid-liquid chromatography and absorption spectrophotometry was used to isolate and measure the concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones in the fat of Blue and Roquefort cheese. The average methyl ketone concentration (micromoles ketone/ 10 g cheese fat) of five Blue cheese samples was as follows: acetone, 1. 7; 2 -pentanone, 5. 9; 2 -heptanone, 11. 2; 2 -nonanone, 9. 3; 2 -undecanone, 2. 4. Considerable variation in ketone concentration was noted between samples, but no consistent differences were observed between Blue and Roquefort cheese. One Roquefort sample contained no acetone. The annount of ketone formed during cheese curing does not depend directly on the amount of available fatty acid precursor. There appears to be a selective conversion of the 8 : 0, and to a lesser extent the 6 : 0 and 10 : 0, fatty acids to methyl ketones by the Penicillium roqueforti spores. The concentration of the C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols was determined in the same cheeses used for ketone analysis. The previously measured ketones acted as internal standards and facilitated a semi-quantitative calculation of alcohol concentrations from peak areas of gas chrorriatograms. The average alcohol concentration (micromoles alcohol/ 10 g cheese fat) in five Blue cheese samples was as follows: 2 -pentanol, 0. 3; 2 -heptanol, 2. 1; 2 -nonanol, 0. 8. The alcohols were present in approximately the same ratios as their methyl ketone analogs, but at much lower concentrations. A synthetic Blue cheese flavor was prepared using a blend of butterfat, dry curd cottage cheese, cream, and salt as a base. The most typical flavor was obtained using the following' compounds: the 2 : 0, 4 : 0, 6 : 0, and 8 : 0 fatty acids at two-thirds the average concentration found in cheese; twice the average concentration of the C₃, C₅, C₇, C₉, and C₁₁ methyl ketones and C₅, C₇, and C₉ secondary alcohols found in cheese: 2. 0 mg/kg of base of 2 -phenylethanol; 1. 5 mg/kg of base of ethyl butanoate; 6. 0 mg/kg of base of both methyl hexanoate and methyl octanoate. Incorporation of higher acids caused a soapy flavor. The presence of 2 -phenylethanol and the esters was judged as very important in duplicating Blue cheese flavor. The mycelia of Penicillium roqueforti appear to be more active in the reduction of methyl ketones to secondary alcohols than the spores. Yeasts associated with Blue cheese are capable of reducing methyl ketones to secondary alcohols. Yeasts also may play a role in Blue cheese flavor by producing ethanol and other alcohols and certain esters...|$|R
