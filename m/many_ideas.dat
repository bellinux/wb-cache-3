5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the basic principles of the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would go through the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower was {{directed}} by Hifumi Kono, who wished to use the game {{to pay homage to}} one of his favorite film directors, Dario Argento. Most notably, the game borrows <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> from his film Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower has strong relations to its plot and shares other similarities with Argento's 1980s films, such as occult themes, distressed young women, and bright colors atop a foggy setting. Kono had a passion for old horror films, and wanted Clock Tower to feel like one.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{cartridge}} space, <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> {{were abandoned}} during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is killed by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes. Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.|$|E
5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so he felt no reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E

5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} nunchaku with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his nunchaku.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed {{the notion of the}} Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|Planning began a {{month before}} the {{original}} Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used {{as the basis for the}} characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} and graphics received positive reviews. Although IGN {{felt that the}} in-depth character traits in Final Fantasy IX could be generally found in other Final Fantasy games, it still found the characters to be engaging and sympathetic. GameSpot found the characters, up to their dialogue and traits, amusing and full of humor. IGN {{also noted that the}} Active Time Event system helps to expand the player's understanding of the characters' personalities as they question <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> and emotions. Their semi-deformed appearance, which also covers monsters of every size, contain detailed animation and design. They gave praise to the pre-rendered backgrounds, noting the careful attention given to the artwork, movement in animations and character interactivity. The movies are seen as emotive and compelling, and the seamless transition and incorporation to the in-game graphics helped to move the plot well.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{designs were}} done by Senri Kita, an artist {{new to the}} series. In contrast to previous Fire Emblem games, where the protagonist was of royal blood, the main character Ike {{was intended to be}} of lower social rank, a mercenary who becomes involved in royal politics and conflict rather than being born into it. Ike was born from the <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> for new directions being suggested for the new 3D game, with many people wanting the protagonist everyone could empathize with. His status as a mercenary was a highly requested character trait by male staff. A character that returned from previous games was Jeigan, who was this time designed as a female character. Designing all the characters to be unique under the new conditions proved a challenge. This also resulted in higher-quality character artwork being produced during the initial design stages. The full-motion videos were created by Japanese animation studio Digital Frontier. Introducing the cutscenes into the game proved challenging for the team. The game's subtitle does not refer to a specific object or place, but instead acts {{as a metaphor for the}} journeys of Ike and other characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Super Mario Galaxys {{gameplay}} originated from ideas taken from Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000 to exemplify the processing {{power of the}} GameCube. The demonstration's director (and future director of Super Mario Galaxy), Yoshiaki Koizumi, desired {{that one of its}} distinguishing features, spherical-based platforms, should be used in a future game, but was held back in belief that such a feature would be impossible for technical reasons. Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto suggested to work on the next large-scale Mario game after Nintendo EAD Tokyo finished development on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, pushing for the spherical platform concept to be realised. A prototype of the game's physics system took three months to build, where it was decided that the game's use of spherical platforms would best be suited to planetoids in an outer space environment, with the concept of gravity as a major feature. During development, the designers would often exchange ideas with Miyamoto from his office in Kyoto, where he would make suggestions to the game design. According to Koizumi, <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> were conceived before development of the Wii console itself begun.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} {{starting}} this task early would make him more involved with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E
5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of <b>many</b> <b>ideas</b> included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit for added strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E
