5|$|In {{the early}} days of Twitter, tweets were stored in <b>MySQL</b> {{databases}} that were temporally sharded (large databases were split based on time of posting). After the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases, the company decided that the system needed re-engineering.|$|E
5|$|The LAMP {{architecture}} {{has become}} {{popular in the}} web industry {{as a way of}} deploying web applications. PHP is commonly used as the P in this bundle alongside Linux, Apache and <b>MySQL,</b> although the P may also refer to Python, Perl, or some mix of the three. Similar packages, WAMP and MAMP, are also available for Windows and macOS, with the first letter standing for the respective operating system. Although both PHP and Apache are provided as part of the macOS base install, users of these packages seek a simpler installation mechanism that can be more easily kept up to date.|$|E
25|$|This {{software}} {{can be used}} to access the public <b>MySQL</b> database, avoiding the need to download enormous datasets. The users could even choose to retrieve data from the <b>MySQL</b> with direct SQL queries, but this requires an extensive knowledge of the current database schema.|$|E

25|$|In January 2005, {{the project}} ran on 39 {{dedicated}} servers in Florida. This configuration included a single master database server running <b>MySQL,</b> multiple database servers, 21 web servers running the Apache HTTP Server, and seven Squid cache servers.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, a Lucene {{extension}} {{was added}} to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from <b>MySQL</b> to Lucene for searching. The site currently uses Lucene Search 2.1, which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3.|$|E
25|$|But more {{important}} to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same <b>MySQL</b> driver can be used to connect to any <b>MySQL</b> server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using human readable names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E

Currently Lucene Search 2.1, which is written in Java and based on Lucene library 2.3, is used. Wikimedia Foundation also uses CiviCRM and WordPress.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of Wikimedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open-source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the <b>MySQL</b> database. The software incorporates programming {{features such as}} a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection. MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, {{as well as many}} other wiki projects. Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later. Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a <b>MySQL</b> database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.|$|E
25|$|Linden Lab pursues {{the use of}} open {{standards}} technologies, {{and uses}} free and open source software such as Apache, <b>MySQL,</b> Squid and Linux. The plan is to move everything to open standards by standardizing the Second Life protocol. Cory Ondrejka, former CTO of Second Life, stated in 2006 that a while after everything has been standardized, both the client and the server will be released as free and open source software.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the rise}} of thin client {{computing}} using HTML as an intermediate format has reduced the need for ODBC. Many web development platforms contain direct links to target databases â€“ <b>MySQL</b> being very common. In these scenarios, {{there is no direct}} client-side access nor multiple client software systems to support; everything goes through the programmer-supplied HTML application. The virtualization that ODBC offers is no longer a strong requirement, and development of ODBC is no longer as active as it once was.|$|E
25|$|The Mono/Linux/GNOME {{development}} stack provide {{tools for}} application development while using the existing GNOME and free and open-source libraries. These include: Gtk# for {{graphical user interface}} (GUI) development, Mozilla libraries for working with the Gecko rendering engine, Unix integration libraries (Mono.Posix), database connectivity libraries, a security stack, and the XML schema language RelaxNG. Gtk# allows Mono applications to integrate into the Gnome desktop as native applications. The database libraries provide connectivity to the object-relational database db4o, Firebird, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), <b>MySQL,</b> Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and many others. The Mono project tracks developing database components at its website.|$|E
25|$|As Microsoft {{turned its}} {{attention}} away from working directly on ODBC, the Unix field was increasingly embracing it. This was propelled by two changes within the market, the introduction of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like GNOME that provided a need to access these sources in non-text form, {{and the emergence of}} open software database systems like PostgreSQL and <b>MySQL,</b> initially under Unix. The later adoption of ODBC by Apple for using the standard Unix-side iODBC package Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) (which OpenLink Software had been independently providing for Mac OS X 10.0 and even Mac OS 9 since 2001) further cemented ODBC as the standard for cross-platform data access.|$|E
25|$|Many {{programs}} added UTF-8 conversions for UCS-2 {{data and}} did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the surrogate-pair using UTF-16. In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. Oracle and <b>MySQL</b> databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not deliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting order when CESU-8 is binary sorted.|$|E
25|$|Initially, The Pirate Bay's four Linux servers ran {{a custom}} web server called Hypercube. An old version is open source. On 1 June 2005, The Pirate Bay updated its website {{in an effort}} to reduce {{bandwidth}} usage, which was reported to be at 2 HTTP requests per millisecond on each of the four web servers, as well as to create a more user friendly interface for the front-end of the website. The website now runs Lighttpd and PHP on its dynamic front ends, <b>MySQL</b> at the database back end, Sphinx on the two search systems, memcached for caching SQL queries and PHP-sessions and Varnish in front of Lighttpd for caching static content. , The Pirate Bay consisted of 31 dedicated servers including nine dynamic web fronts, a database, two search engines, and eight BitTorrent trackers.|$|E
