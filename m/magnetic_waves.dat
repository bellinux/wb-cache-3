In the case of propagating <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> (with specified amplitude, frequency and the wavelength), the low temperature dynamical mode is a propagating spin wave and the system becomes structureless or random in the high temperature. A dynamical symmetry breaking phase transition is observed at a finite (nonzero) temperature. This symmetry breaking is confirmed by studying the statistical distribution of {{the angle of the}} spin vector. The dynamic nonequilibrium transition temperature was found to decrease as the amplitude of the propagating <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> increases.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{response of}} an Ising ferromagnet to a plane polarised standing <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> is modelled and studied here by Monte Carlo simulation in two dimensions. The amplitude of standing <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is modulated along the direction x. We have detected two main dynamical phases namely, pinned and oscillating spin clusters. Depending {{on the value}} of field amplitude the system is found to undergo a phase transition from oscillating spin cluster to pinned as the system is cooled down. The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of magnetic field oscillations is defined as the dynamic order parameter. The transition is detected by studying the temperature dependences of the variance of the dynamic order parameter, the derivative of the dynamic order parameter and the dynamic specific heat. The dependence of the transition temperature on the magnetic field amplitude and on the wavelength of the <b>magnetic</b> field <b>wave</b> is studied at a single frequency. A comprehensive phase boundary is drawn in the plane described by the temperature and field amplitude for two different wavelengths of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave.</b> The variation of instantaneous line magnetisation during a period of magnetic field oscillation for standing wave mode is compared to those for the propagating wave mode. Also the probability that a spin at any site, flips, is calculated. The above mentioned variations and the probability of spin flip clearly distinguish between the dynamical phases formed by propagating <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> and by standing <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> in an Ising ferromagnet.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of the time evolution of ground magnetic fluctuations in three (12 – 48 s, 24 – 96 s and 48 – 192 s) period bands during nightside auroral activations. We use an independently derived auroral activation list composed of both substorms and pseudo-breakups to provide {{an estimate of the}} activation times of nightside aurora during periods with comprehensive ground magnetometer coverage. One hundred eighty-one events in total are studied to demonstrate the statistical nature of the time evolution of <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power during the ∼ 30 min surrounding auroral activations. We find that the <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power is approximately constant before an auroral activation, starts to grow up to 90 s prior to the optical onset time, maximizes a few minutes after the auroral activation, then decays slightly to a new, and higher, constant level. Importantly, <b>magnetic</b> ULF <b>wave</b> power always remains elevated after an auroral activation, whether it is a substorm or a pseudo-breakup. We subsequently divide the auroral activation list into events that formed part of ongoing auroral activity and events that had little preceding geomagnetic activity. We find that the evolution of wave power in the ∼ 10 – 200 s period band essentially behaves in the same manner through auroral onset, regardless of event type. The absolute power across ULF wave bands, however, displays a power law-like dependency throughout a 30 min period centered on auroral onset time. We also find evidence of a secondary maximum in wave power at high latitudes ∼ 10 min following isolated substorm activations. Most significantly, we demonstrate that <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power levels persist after auroral activations for ∼ 10 min, which is consistent with recent findings of wave-driven auroral precipitation during substorms. This suggests that <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> power and auroral particle precipitation are intimately linked and key components of the substorm onset process...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} charge {{transports}} originating from triangle anomaly in out-of-equilibrium {{conditions in the}} framework of AdS/CFT correspondence at strong coupling, to gain useful insights on possible charge separation effects that may happen in the very early stages of heavy-ion collisions. We first construct a gravity background of a homogeneous mass shell with a finite (axial) charge density gravitationally collapsing to a charged blackhole, which serves as a dual model for out-of-equilibrium charged plasma undergoing thermalization. We find that a finite charge density in the plasma slows down the thermalization. We then study the out-of-equilibrium properties of Chiral Magnetic Effect and Chiral <b>Magnetic</b> <b>Wave</b> in this background. As the medium thermalizes, the magnitude of chiral magnetic conductivity and the response time delay grow. We find a dynamical peak in the spectral function of retarded current correlator, which we identify as an out-of-equilibrium chiral <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave.</b> The group velocity of the out-of-equilibrium chiral <b>magnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is shown to receive a dominant contribution from a non-equilibrium effect, making the wave moving much faster than in the equilibrium, which may enhance the charge transports via triangle anomaly in the early stage of heavy-ion collisions.
