To consider more practical case, an elastomeric engine mount {{is used as}} the case study. Finite element model updating technique using Radial Basis Function neural networks is implemented to predict the dynamic <b>material</b> <b>constants.</b> <b>Material</b> <b>constants</b> of 2 -parameter Mooney-Rivlin model are obtained by curve fitting on uni-axial stress-strain curve. The initial estimations of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> are achieved by using uni-axial tension test data. To ensure of the consistency of dynamic response of a real component, frequency response function of three similar engine mounts are extracted from experimental modal data and average of them used in the procedure.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{simultaneously}} measuring <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> (complex permittivity and permeability) {{of a sample}} was theoretically and experimentally investigated. In this method，a cylindrical cavity containing the sample is placed between two coaxial lines. First，the relation between the S parameters of the cavity and the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> of the sample is deduced by using the Galerkin method. The Computed results of the S parameters for the given <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> are in good agreement {{with those of the}} mode-matching method. The gradient method is applied to the calculation of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> from the S-parameter measurement， and stable solutions are obtained.

40|$|New derivations of origin-independent {{expressions}} for {{the electric}} permittivity are presented, starting {{either from the}} response function of the current density that defines the absorption coefficient, or from the off-resonance single-photon scattering amplitude {{that leads to the}} Kramers–Heisenberg dispersion formula. The resulting expression for the permittivity is compared with earlier work on the origin dependence of the <b>material</b> <b>constants.</b> Different origin-independent expressions for the permittivity, the inverse permeability and the magnetizability are calculated and discussed. By considering electromagnetic plane waves in the absence of external sources, the macroscopic Maxwell equations are used to describe the response of matter to external fields. In combination with the constitutive relations, a wave equation expressed in terms of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> is derived. It is shown that the different definitions of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> lead to the same wave equation. The non-uniqueness of the definitions of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> is discussed in this context. Finally, based on the discussions, we propose a possible unique, origin-independent definition of the <b>material</b> <b>constants...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{quick and}} {{accurate}} method of measuring elastic and viscoelastic <b>constants</b> of a <b>material</b> {{is the essential}} first step for characterizing the material. This is more challenging for composite materials because unlike homogeneous metals and ceramics the material properties change from specimen to specimen for composite materials as the volume fraction of fibers and their orientations change. Anisotropic properties of composite materials add another difficulty in the measurement technique, since anisotropy increases the number of independent <b>material</b> <b>constants.</b> Polymer composites exhibit {{a high degree of}} attenuation in the matrix material; as a result, these composite materials cannot be assumed to be pure elastic material, so they should be modeled as viscoelastic materials by making the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> complex. The real part is associated with the elastic behavior and the imaginary part is associated with the viscoelastic or attenuative behavior of the material. The number of independent <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> for a unidirectional (UD) composite, which is transversely isotropic, is ten (five real and five imaginary). Naturally, it is not practical and almost impossible to measure all these <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> by the traditional engineering method of applying stresses and measuring strains in different directions. Because of the measurement difficulty the imaginary parts of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> are often ignored. However, it should be mentioned here {{that it is important to}} measure the imaginary components of <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> because porosity and microcracking in the matrix due to material fatigue and aging affect the attenuation more than the elastic properties. In other words, the imaginary components of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> are a better indicator of material aging compared to the real components. Hence, an efficient technique to measure both real and imaginary components of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> is warranted and developed in this paper...|$|R

This binary library file contains the results of the 2 -dimensional transport calculations of all the fuel/reflector assemblies loaded in a specific core and for all the possible operating conditions. More precisely, SIMULATE- 3 is used for reading this file and for interpolating the data at the operating points necessary for representing the dependence of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> in PARCS. The full dependence of the <b>material</b> <b>constants</b> on history variables, instantaneous variables, and exposure can thus be reconstructed in a consistent way with the PARCS formalism.

The <b>material</b> <b>constant</b> in Curie's law is known as the Curie constant. He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a critical temperature transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the Curie temperature. The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields.|$|E

50|$|In gemology/gemmology, the {{gemstone}} refractometer is one {{the fundamental}} {{pieces of equipment}} used in a gemological laboratory. Gemstones are transparent minerals and can therefore be examined using optical methods. Refractive index is a <b>material</b> <b>constant,</b> dependent on the chemical composition of a substance. The refractometer is used to help identify gem materials by measuring their refractive index, {{one of the principal}} properties used in determining the type of a gemstone. Due to the dependence of the refractive index on the wavelength of the light used (i.e. dispersion), the measurement is normally taken at the wavelength of the sodium line D-line (NaD) of ~589 nm. This is either filtered out from daylight or generated with a monochromatic light-emitting diode (LED). Certain stones such as rubies, sapphires, tourmalines and topaz are optically anisotropic. They demonstrate birefringence based on the polarisation plane of the light. The two different refractive indexes are classified using a polarisation filter. Gemstone refractometers are available both as classic optical instruments and as electronic measurement devices with a digital display.|$|E
5000|$|Equivalent {{circuits}} {{build on}} the electromechanical analogy. In {{the same way as}} the current through a network of resistors can be predicted from their arrangement and the applied voltage, the displacement of a network of mechanical elements can be predicted from the topology of the network and the applied force. The electro-mechanical analogy maps forces onto voltages and speeds onto currents. The ratio of force and speed is termed “mechanical impedance”. Note: Here, speed means the time derivative of a displacement, not the speed of sound. There also is an electro-acoustic analogy, within which stresses (rather than forces) are mapped onto voltages. In acoustics, forces are normalized to area. The ratio of stress and speed should not be called [...] "acoustic impedance" [...] (in analogy to the mechanical impedance) because this term is already in use for the material property Zac = ρc with ρ the density and c the speed of sound). The ratio of stress and speed at the crystal surface is called load impedance, ZL. Synonymous terms are [...] "surface impedance" [...] and [...] "acoustic load." [...] The load impedance is in general not equal to the <b>material</b> <b>constant</b> Zac = ρc = (Gρ)1/2. Only for propagating plane waves are the values of ZL and Zac the same.|$|E
