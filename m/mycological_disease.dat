40|$|Cryptococcosis is {{the leading}} cause of {{life-threatening}} <b>mycological</b> <b>disease</b> of the central nervous system, with a high worldwide mortality and morbidity in immunocompromised patients. In the Netherlands from 1996 on incidence numbers are declining, in parallel with incidence numbers in the rest of the Western world. This decline is due to the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In countries that can not afford costs of HAART, like for example in Sub Saharan Africa and India, cryptococcal related infection are an enormous problem. C. neoformans enters the body by inhalation of poorly encapsulated yeast cells. In the lungs innate immune responses like phagocytosis of C. neoformans by resident macrophages (alveolar macrophages) take place. We developed a new, rapid and objective method to measure interaction between the yeast C. neoformans and adherent phagocytic cells. This method was used to investigate if surfactant proteins like surfactant protein A and D play a role in innate host defense against cryptococci. In contrast to many other micro-organisms like E. coli, M. tuberculosis and influenza A virus, pulmonary surfactant proteins do not support phagocytosis of C. neoformans. Cytokines that are present during the initiation ofresponse will determine whether CMI or B-cell development will take place. The time kinetics of cytokine release in PBMC of healthy donors stimulated with cryptococcal capsular polysaccharides indicate an autocrine-paracrine network regulation of the cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-aDPAF, IL- 8 and fMLP. Another capsular component of C. neoformans Mannoprotein 4 (MP 4) was found to potent inhibitor of PMN migration. Neutrophil infiltration into the central nervous system is a dual-edged sword in that it protects the tissue from infection and injury but can also be detrimental to the host. In diseases such as bacterial meningitis or cerebrovascular ischemia there is evidence that a high influx of PMN plays an adverse role in the pathogenesis of neurological damage Accordingly, it is now assumed that adjunctive therapeutic strategies with anti- inflammatory agents may favor neurological recovery. Therefore we will investigate the possibilities to use GXM and MP 4 therapeutically...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionOpportunistic fungal organisms, such as Aspergillus and Candida species, tend {{to cause}} {{diseases}} in tuberculosis (TB) patients. Respiratory tract mycosis has clinical and radiological characteristics {{which are very}} similar to TB, thereby making the disease easily misdiagnosed. TB can be a predisposition to serious opportunistic fungal infections. Prolonged use of anti-TB drugs promotes the growth and reproduction of opportunistic fungi and, in turn, aggravates the course of the underlying process in the lung tissues. The study objective is to determine fungal coexistence with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in patients attending the Central Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory of the Health Center in Ghaemshahr city, Iran. Material and methodsTwenty-five participants were recruited into the study during two months. For each patient, three successive morning samples during one month were collected into sterile wide-neck universal sputum mugs. Specimen collection was taken for analysis at the Laboratory. None of {{the participants in this study}} had been placed on anti-fungal therapy. Sputa samples were studied for fungal elements and MTB. Direct microscopy by three stainings – KOH+Calcofluor white, Gomori-methenamine-silver and Giemsa – and fungal culture were done on Sabouraud Dextrose agar. Analysis for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) was done by the Ziehl–Neelsen technique. ResultsA total of 75 fresh sputa samples were collected. Branching hyphae in 10 samples of 5 (20 %) patients and pseudo-hyphae and blastoconidia in 12 samples of 5 (20 %) patients were seen together with TB. Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans were identified in the culture method and <b>mycological</b> exams. DiscussionMycotic <b>disease</b> is an important coexistence in patients with TB. Although active mycosis may be an independent marker of advanced immunosuppression, it may also act as a co-factor in accelerating and amplifying the clinical course of TB disease. It is necessary in TB patients to increase the cure rate considering coexistencing opportunistic infections...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dermatophytoses are {{cosmopolitan}} contagious mycoses of {{the skin}} and concern {{a wide range of}} mammals, including man, and more rarely birds. These mycoses are rarely diagnosed in New World Primates. The most frequent tinea of the subhuman Primates is microsporosis due to Microsporum canis or trichophytosis by Trichophyton mentagrophytes and T. simii. The main clinical features are regular alopecia with erythema and squamosis, usually non-pruriginous although various degree of inammation may modify this typical aspect. As a consequence, an accurate clinical examination, a good differential diagnosis and laboratory analyses are required for a correct identification. Alouatta guariba are primates found from the Amazon region up to the Argentina Norwest. Due to the population development and expansion of the urban perimeters these animals are loosing their space in their own natural habitat and being exposed to more closed relationship with domestic animals and humans. This report contains five cases of dermatophytoses caused by Microsporum canis in Alouatta sp., which were treated in a private clinic in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. Case: Five females of Alouatta guariba with aged between 2 and 8 months old were admitted in a private veterinary clinic (Toca dos Bichos, Porto Alegre). Each of them had different injuries (electric chock, death of the parent due gun shot, aggression between families and dog bite) and were admitted in different dates. All five primates were presented with intense pruritus after 7 or 10 days of admission. At physical examination lesions characteristic of dermatophytoses were found. To establish a definitive diagnosis it was collected fur and skin and the material was send to the Mycology Laboratory of the Faculdade de Veterinária, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. The fungic culture was positive for Microsporum canis. The treatment established was fluconazole, 18 mg/kg/day PO, mixed in smashed bananas. After two weeks of treatment, a sensitive clinic improvement was seen in all primates, characterized by diminishing of pruritus and alopecic areas. At 30 days of treatment the animals had no clinical signs of lesions and had their fur completely re-grown. The medication was administered for more 15 days, totalizing 45 days of treatment, at which time the animals were considered cured. The primates were monitored for more 30 days after the last dose of fluconazole. Discussion: Case reports on the isolation of Microsporum canis in non-human primates, mainly in New World Primates, are very rare in the Brazilian literature. It is necessary more cohesive approach to nonhuman primate (NHP) dermatology, without relying on assumptions that it is similar to other veterinary <b>disease.</b> <b>Mycological</b> culture remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of animal dermatophytosis and the only method for the phenotypic identication of dermatophyte species. The fluconazole treatment proved to be highly effective, as the animals were all cured and there was no side effects related. This case report proves the importance of a correct mycological diagnostic in free-range animals as an effective treatment in Alouatta guariba...|$|R
