5|$|To placate {{physical}} retailers {{affected by}} the digital exclusivity period, Universal offered them a deluxe version of Songs of Innocence that contains four additional songs, along with several acoustic versions of the record's songs. The bonus tracks were exclusive to brick-and-mortar stores and <b>music</b> <b>streaming</b> services for five weeks; the iTunes Store then released the ten deluxe edition tracks under the title Songs of Innocence + on 18 November 2014. Retailers also received catalog deals that discounted U2's albums in stores by US$3 {{for a period of}} time. A Grammy Awards spokesperson initially said the album would not be eligible for consideration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards because {{it would not have been}} available for purchase prior to the 30 September eligibility deadline. However, this ruling was reversed after UMG released a limited-edition vinyl pressing of the album to retailers on the cutoff date.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the music}} {{typesetting}} program LilyPond is restructured. The program is separated into two distinct modules: One that parses the input file, {{and one that}} handles music formatting. A new music representation format <b>music</b> <b>stream</b> is introduced, as an intermediate format between the two modules. A <b>music</b> <b>stream</b> is semantically equivalent to the original input file, but the new format is easier for a computer program to interpret. <b>Music</b> <b>streams</b> {{can be used to}} make communication between LilyPond and other software easier; in particular, the format can eliminate incompatibilities between different versions of LilyPond...|$|R

50|$|Both {{using new}} <b>music</b> <b>streams</b> made {{specifically}} for the game, and using previously released/recorded <b>music</b> <b>streams</b> are common approaches for developing sound tracks to this day. It is common for X-games sports-based video games to come with some popular artists recent releases (SSX, Tony Hawk, Initial D), {{as well as any}} game with heavy cultural demographic theme that has tie-in to music (Need For Speed: Underground, Gran Turismo, and Grand Theft Auto). Sometimes a hybrid of the two are used, such as in Dance Dance Revolution.|$|R
40|$|In {{formating}} temporal {{sequences of}} notes {{played by the}} same instrument (referred to as <b>music</b> <b>streams),</b> timbre of musical instruments may be a predominant feature. In polyphonic music, the performance of timber extraction based on power-related features deteriorates, because such features are blurred when two or more frequency components are superimposed in the same frequency. To cope with this problem, we integrated timbre similarity and direction proximity with success, but left using other features as future work. In this paper, we investigate four features, timbre similarity, direction proximity, pitch transition and pitch relation consistency to clarify the precedence among them in <b>music</b> <b>stream</b> formation. Experimental results with quartet music show that direction proximity is the most dominant feature, and pitch transition is the secondary. In addition, the performance of <b>music</b> <b>stream</b> formation was improved from 63. 3 % by only timbre similarity to 84. 9 % by integrating four features. 1...|$|R
