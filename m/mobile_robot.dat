5|$|Air-Cobot (Aircraft Inspection {{enhanced}} by smaRt & Collaborative rOBOT) is a French {{research and development}} project of a wheeled collaborative <b>mobile</b> <b>robot</b> able to inspect aircraft during maintenance operations. This multi-partner project involves research laboratories and industry. Research around this prototype was developed in three domains: autonomous navigation, nondestructive testing and human-robot collaboration.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the <b>mobile</b> <b>robot</b> is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not to take off.|$|E

This paper suggests a design for an adaptive PD controller that estimates and adapts to the weight-related parameters of robots that bear varying heavy burdens. Using the suggested adaptive PD controller, the motion of <b>mobile</b> <b>robots</b> can be independent of the weight-related parameters and the operational performance is confirmed by target tracking simulations...|$|R
5|$|Launched in January 2013, {{the project}} {{is part of the}} Interministerial Fund program of Aerospace Valley, a {{business}} cluster in southwestern France. With a budget of over one million euros, Air-Cobot aims to develop an innovative collaborative <b>mobile</b> <b>robot,</b> autonomous in its movements and able to perform the inspection of an aircraft with nondestructive testing sensors during preflight or during maintenance operations in a hangar. Testing has been performed at the premises of Airbus and Air France Industries.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A <b>mobile</b> <b>robot</b> can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

25|$|A simple example {{would be}} a GPU program that {{collects}} data about average lighting values as it renders some view from either a camera or a computer graphics program {{back to the main}} program on the CPU, so that the CPU can then make adjustments to the overall screen view. A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a processed image representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a <b>mobile</b> <b>robot.</b> Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other picture element in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.|$|E

The Atkinson character was dropped after the ninth episode of this season, and Steve was given a promotion, becoming IADC Director, and Diana's boss, in the process.
