5|$|Having {{realised}} the Hungarian Estates' growing dissatisfaction, Matthias held a Diet in November. The Diet again authorized him to levy {{an extraordinary}} tax, stipulating that {{the sum of}} all taxes payable per porta could not exceed one florin. The Estates also <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> opposed the war in Bohemia. George of Poděbrady died on 22 March 1471. The Diet of Bohemia proper elected Vladislaus Jagiello king on 27 May. The papal legate Lorenzo Roverella soon declared Vladislaus's election void and confirmed Matthias's position as King of Bohemia, but the Imperial Diet refused Matthias's claim.|$|E

In April 2015, the producers <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted to resolve the issue, and in mid-2016, producer Robert Tabert stated that the rights issue had been solved and that references to Army of Darkness would appear from season two onward.|$|E
25|$|The Barnstormers {{are heavily}} {{covered in the}} Lancaster press and receive a {{significant}} following from Lancaster-area fans, many of whom hail the organization as family-friendly in their planning of events for game nights. Even though some Lancastrians have speculated {{the possibility of the}} organization becoming a Major League-affiliated club, two nearby affiliated teams in Harrisburg and Reading have <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will not waive their territorial claims over Lancaster.|$|E
25|$|Moving the {{collections}} of the National Gallery to a new location would leave the Buda Castle empty and available for other use. Although the government has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will {{move out of the}} Parliament building by 2014, officials have not stated whether it is their intention to move government offices — including that of the Prime Minister — into the Castle once it is vacant.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} {{before the start of the}} new franchise, the IBA <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were happy about the service changes, and were {{particularly}} impressed with TVS in connection with new programming for the ITV network, in areas in which the IBA wished for improvements, mainly children's and the sciences. TVS' aims were for a different line of programming in the early evening slots, to win back the 50,000 viewers they claimed were switching over to rivals, due to the poor service provided by Southern.|$|E
25|$|In late February 2006, IAEA Director Mohammad El-Baradei {{raised the}} {{suggestion}} of a deal, whereby Iran would give up industrial-scale enrichment and instead limit its program to a small-scale pilot facility, and agree to import its nuclear fuel from Russia (see nuclear fuel bank). The Iranians indicated that while they would not be willing to give up their right to enrichment in principle, they were willing to consider the compromise solution. However, in March 2006, the Bush Administration <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not accept any enrichment at all in Iran.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Christopher {{discovered}} that a Calgary-based oil company, Talisman Energy, {{had been accused of}} complicity in the rape, bombing, kidnapping, enslavement, and execution of local people while operating in South Sudan. Talisman executives <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were uncomfortable with Christopher investigating the story, and sent a letter to CHED threatening to sue the company for libel if the story was ever reported. After Christopher filed the story the station refused to report it. Christopher attempted to have the story carried by other local media companies, including Global TV and The Edmonton Journal; they refused to run the story.|$|E

25|$|A further {{element of}} this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press {{agencies}} revealed that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia {{to participate in the}} project. JAXA has <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are more likely to join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005. The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.|$|E
25|$|The two {{metropolitan}} county councils {{were subject to}} the legal requirement to make their precept by 10 March. They were also facing their own abolition {{at the end of}} March 1986. Faced with the prospect of immediate legal sanctions if they failed to do set a budget and with no continuing existence, neither were inclined to press their objections to rate-capping. At a meeting of capped councils on 19 February, both <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would set a legal precept on time. South Yorkshire County Council then made it clear publicly that it would fix a budget within the cap, and proceeded to do so at a budget meeting on 7 March.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1913, {{a meeting}} of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies was held in a meadow in Bullace Lane where the Australian suffragist, Miss Muriel Matters, had been invited to address a {{gathering}} on the subject of votes for women. The event was organised by, and presided over by, Florence Conybeare of Oakfield Park, Dartford, Kent, whose husband Charles Conybeare had been a Liberal MP from 1885 until 1895. Florence kicked off the meeting by mounting the wagon which was being used as a stage. Her introduction <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not militant suffragists, and that they sought to make changes by argument rather than by force.|$|E

25|$|During the lead-up to the 1999–2000 season, the {{selectors}} <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted Adam Gilchrist to {{keep for}} the Test team {{as well as}} the ODI side. Initially, Healy requested that he be allowed to play one more season and then retire, which was refused. He then asked to play the first Test, scheduled for his home ground at Brisbane, as a farewell. This, too, was refused, so he announced his immediate retirement from all forms of the game in a statement released on 28 October 1999. In response to the tremendous public farewells afforded to Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer {{at the end of the}} fifth Test at Sydney in 2006–07, Healy called for long-standing players to have their farewells to the game managed more appropriately than his own.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, Terry Jones {{announced}} {{she would be}} retiring from Point of Grace. She was finding it {{harder and harder to}} handle a full-time music career and being a full-time wife and mother. She wrote a letter which was posted on the group's website, along with a letter from Heather, Shelley, and Denise. They <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no intentions of carrying on as a trio, and called upon band leader Dana Cappillino's wife Leigh to join her husband on tour. Terry's last tour with the group was the 2003 Christmastime Tour with Michael W. Smith, and her last concert was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 28, 2004. Leigh had been officially on board since January 1, 2004, but her first concert was in Atlanta, Georgia on March 12, 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} reform was {{the loss of}} the {{conveyancing}} monopoly. Before 1983, only solicitors had been authorised to take part in conveyancing work—for anyone else to draft documents relating to the transfer of property was a statutory offence. In December 1983 Austin Mitchell, a Labour Member of Parliament who {{had been one of the}} initial supporters of Alf Dubs' private member's bill introduced a private member's bill of his own called the House Buyers Bill. This aimed to remove the restrictions on conveyancing, and although the government opposed it they <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> planned to allow banks and building societies to carry out conveyancing for their customers, and would also be prepared to allow non-solicitors with suitable qualifications to carry out conveyancing work as well.|$|E

25|$|The seceded states laid {{claim to}} the {{national}} forts within their boundaries, {{but they did not}} make good their claim to Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Forts Pickens, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson in Florida. They soon <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would use force if necessary to gain possession of Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens. President Abraham Lincoln resolved not to cede them without a fight. Secretary of State William H. Seward, Captain Montgomery C. Meigs of the US Army, and Porter devised a plan for the relief of Fort Pickens. The principal element of their plan required use of the steam frigate , which would be commanded by Porter and would carry reinforcements to the fort from New York. Because no one was above suspicion in those days, the plan had to be implemented in complete secrecy; not even Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles was to be advised.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Pei Songzhi, who annotated Sun He's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, drew {{comparisons between}} the Sun He–Sun Ba succession struggle and other similar conflicts {{such as the one}} between Yuan Shao's sons and Liu Biao's sons. He commented that Sun Quan was worse than Yuan Shao and Liu Biao because, unlike Yuan Shao and Liu Biao who defied traditional norms of succession and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted a younger son to succeed them, Sun Quan created ambiguity and uncertainty when he favoured Sun Ba despite having already designated Sun He as his heir apparent. Pei Songzhi criticised Bu Zhi, Lü Dai and Quan Cong for supporting Sun Ba because he deemed Sun Ba's claim to the succession as illegitimate. He also remarked that this incident had a huge negative impact on Bu Zhi in particular, because Bu Zhi had a reputation for being virtuous and generous.|$|E
25|$|From 1825 to 1828 {{the number}} of native attacks more than doubled each year, raising panic among {{settlers}}. Over the summer of 1826–7 clans from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations speared stock-keepers on farms and <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wanted the settlers and their sheep and cattle to move from their kangaroo hunting grounds. Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826 Governor George Arthur issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aborigines when they attacked settlers or their property and in the following eight months more than 200 Aborigines {{were killed in the}} Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists. After another eight months the death toll had risen to 43 colonists and probably 350 Aboriginals. Almost 300 British troops were sent into the Settled Districts, and in November 1828 Arthur declared martial law, giving soldiers the right to shoot on sight any Aboriginal in the Settled Districts. Martial law would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period of martial law in Australian history.|$|E
