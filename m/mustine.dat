25|$|The {{first use}} of small-molecule drugs to treat cancer {{was in the early}} 20th century, {{although}} the specific chemicals first used were not originally intended for that purpose. Mustard gas was used as a chemical warfare agent during World War I and was discovered to be a potent suppressor of hematopoiesis (blood production). A similar family of compounds known as nitrogen mustards were studied further during World War II at the Yale School of Medicine. It was reasoned that an agent that damaged the rapidly growing white blood cells might have a similar effect on cancer. Therefore, in December 1942, several patients with advanced lymphomas (cancers of the lymphatic system and lymph nodes) were given the drug by vein, rather than by breathing the irritating gas. Their improvement, although temporary, was remarkable. Concurrently, during a military operation in World War II, following a German air raid on the Italian harbour of Bari, several hundred people were accidentally exposed to mustard gas, which had been transported there by the Allied forces to prepare for possible retaliation in the event of German use of chemical warfare. The survivors were later found to have very low white blood cell counts. After WWII was over and the reports declassified, the experiences converged and led researchers to look for other substances that might have similar effects against cancer. The first chemotherapy drug to be developed from this line of research was <b>mustine.</b> Since then, many other drugs have been developed to treat cancer, and drug development has exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry, although the principles and limitations of chemotherapy discovered by the early researchers still apply.|$|E

50|$|A {{member of}} Allied Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's medical staff, Dr. Stewart F. Alexander, was {{dispatched}} to Bari following the raid.

Although he was not informed of the cargo carried by John Harvey, and most victims suffered atypical symptoms caused by exposure to mustard diluted in water and oil (as opposed to airborne), Alexander rapidly concluded that mustard gas was present. Although he could not get any acknowledgment from the chain of command, Alexander convinced medics to treat patients for mustard gas exposure and saved many lives as a result. He also preserved many tissue samples from autopsied victims at Bari. After World War II, these samples would result in the development of an early form of chemotherapy based on mustard, <b>Mustine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Before {{their use}} in chemotherapy, alkylating agents were better known for their use as sulfur mustard, ("mustard gas") and related {{chemical}} weapons in World War I. The nitrogen mustards were the first alkylating agents used medically, {{as well as the}} first modern cancer chemotherapies. Goodman, Gilman, and others at Yale began studying nitrogen mustards at Yale in 1942, and, following the sometimes dramatic but highly variable responses of experimental tumors in mice to treatment, these agents were first tested in humans late that year. Use of methyl bis (B-chloroethyl)emine hydrochloride (mechlorethamine, <b>mustine)</b> and tris (B-chloroethy) amine hydrochloride for Hodgkin's disease lymphosarcoma, leukemia, and other malignancies resulted in striking but temporary dissolution of tumor masses. Because of secrecy surrounding the war gas program, these results were not published until 1946. These publications spurred rapid advancement in the previously non-existent field of cancer chemotherapy, and a wealth of new alkylating agents with therapeutic effect were discovered over the following two decades.|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1919 {{it was known}} that mustard agent was a {{suppressor}} of hematopoiesis. In addition, autopsies performed on 75 soldiers who had died of mustard agent during World War I were done by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania who reported decreased counts of white blood cells. This led the American Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to finance the biology and chemistry departments at Yale University to conduct research {{on the use of}} chemical warfare during World War II. As a part of this effort, the group investigated nitrogen mustard as a therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma and other types of lymphoma and leukemia, and this compound was tried out on its first human patient in December 1942. The results of this study were not published until 1946, when they were declassified. In a parallel track, after the air raid on Bari in December 1943, the doctors of the U.S. Army noted that white blood cell counts were reduced in their patients. Some years after World War II was over, the incident in Bari and the work of the Yale University group with nitrogen mustard converged, and this prompted a search for other similar chemical compounds. Due to its use in previous studies, the nitrogen mustard called [...] "HN2" [...] became the first cancer chemotherapy drug, <b>mustine,</b> to be used.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES—Skin lesions in Langerhans cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) {{are often}} painful {{and difficult to}} treat. Topical application of nitrogen mustard (0. 02 % mechlorethamine hydrochloride, <b>mustine),</b> an alkylating cytostatic agent, {{has been shown to}} be effective. There is, however, concern about potentially harmful long term side effects.  STUDY DESIGN—In a retrospective study 20 children with LCH (average extent of initial skin involvement: 16. 4 % body surface) were followed up for an average of 8. 3 years after completion of topical <b>mustine</b> therapy. They had received a total of 34 courses (mean duration 14. 2 weeks) of topical <b>mustine.</b> Disease status on follow up was assessed according to the Histiocyte Society classification.  RESULTS—After <b>mustine</b> was introduced, 16 patients were able to discontinue systemic steroids and/or chemotherapy. Topical <b>mustine</b> was well tolerated in 18 patients, but two developed irritant dermatitis. On follow up, the disease was inactive in 10 patients. Among the children with active disease, six had mild skin disease and four had progressive disease, two of them with skin lesions unresponsive to <b>mustine</b> treatment. Scars confined to areas of formerly active skin disease were found in six patients. There was no evidence of premalignant or malignant skin disease in the treated areas.  CONCLUSION—Topical <b>mustine</b> is an effective and safe treatment for skin disease in most children with LCH. Residual scarring was probably a result of the disease itself rather than to <b>mustine.</b> Although no evidence of skin cancer was found in this study, continued long term follow up is advisable. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{outcome of}} drug induced pleurodesis has been {{evaluated}} in a non-randomised retrospective study of 67 patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusions treated during 1976 - 83.

Of the remaining 53 patients, 26 studied during 1976 - 80 were treated with intrapleural <b>mustine</b> hydrochloride, while 27 studied during 1978 - 83 were treated with intrapleural Corynebacterium parvum. There was no significant dif-ference between the groups in age, sex, or tumour type, most tumours being secondary to bronchial neoplasms. Corynebacterium parvum successfully prevented reaccumulation of the effusion in 24 (92 %) patients, while <b>mustine</b> was effective in only 17 (65 %) (p < 0. 05). Data on survival were obtained on 47 cases where a single agent was used to induce pleurodesis.

There was {{no statistically significant}} difference between the complete remission (CR) rates (63 % for MOPP, 57 % for LOPP), percentage of patients remaining disease free at 5 years (38 % for MOPP, 35 % for LOPP) and overall survival at 5 years (65 % for MOPP, 64 % for LOPP). On multivariate analysis younger age, grade I histopathology, absence of systemic symptoms, and normal albumin level were favourable prognostic factors for survival. Acute toxicity in the form of nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, and phlebitis were less with LOPP than MOPP.

40|$|The {{effect of}} quadruple {{chemotherapy}} (<b>mustine,</b> vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone) on gonadal function {{was investigated in}} 15 males and 2 females treated for Hodgkin's disease during childhood. The 2 females have regular menstrual cycles with evidence of ovulation in one. Twelve of the males have shown normal progression of pubertal development since completing their treatment. Nine out of 10 late pubertal or adult subjects had small testes but only one developed gynaecomastia. All 4 prepubertal subjects had normal basal and peak gonadotrophin responses to luteinising hormone-releasing hormone. Nine of the 12 subjects studied during puberty or adulthood had either an increased basal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or an exaggerated FSH response to luteinising hormone-releasing hormone. Each of the 6 males who provided semen for analysis was azoospermic after an interval of between 2. 4 and 8 (mean 5. 3) years after completion of treatment. We conclude that severe testicular damage is common after treatment with <b>mustine,</b> vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisolone in childhood.

40|$|Increased protein loss during {{peritonitis}} {{associated with}} peritoneal dialysis is neutrophil dependent. BackgroundPeritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients {{is accompanied by}} an enhanced migration of neutrophils (PMNs) and increased protein loss into the peritoneal cavity; however, the role of PMNs in governing increased protein loss during peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis is unknown. MethodsWe determined the importance of PMNs in governing changes in peritoneal permeability to protein in New Zealand White rabbits in which acute peritonitis was induced by adding 4 × 106 colony-forming units of Escherichia coli to 35 mL/kg of 0. 9 % saline dialysate. The total leukocyte and PMN migration into the peritoneal cavity was assessed by differential cell counts in the dialysate, and peritoneal permeability to protein was evaluated by calculating the dialysate to plasma concentration ratio for total protein {{as a function of}} time during a six- or eight-hour dwell. In series 1 experiments, leukocytes were depleted from the rabbit circulation by an intravenous injection of <b>mustine</b> (1. 2 mg/kg) three days before the experiment; in series 2 experiments, integrin-dependent PMN migration into the peritoneal cavity was inhibited by an intravenous injection of monoclonal antibody (mAb) 60. 3 (2 mg/kg) directed against the integrin CD 18 on leukocytes five minutes before the experiment. ResultsIn series 1 experiments, <b>mustine</b> decreased circulating leukocytes by 82 ± 5 % (mean ± SEM) and circulating PMNs by 93 ± 3 %. Total leukocyte and PMN migration into the peritoneal cavity and peritoneal permeability to protein were decreased in mustine-treated rabbits after exposure to E. coli in the dialysate to levels similar to those found in rabbits without bacterial peritonitis. In series 2 experiments, an intravenous injection of anti-CD 18 antibody also abrogated both the enhanced PMN migration into the peritoneal cavity and the increased peritoneal permeability to protein after exposure to E. coli in the dialysate.

Remission rates were 76 % among 49 untreated patients and 90 % among 42 {{patients who had}} relapsed after radiotherapy. The corresponding five-year survival rates were 65 % and 86 % respectively. Provided the observed yearly mortality (6 %) remains unchanged 75 % of patients who had previously received no treatment or irradiation and achieved remission are expected to continue in first remission after five years. Forty-two patients had received prior chemotherapy. They had lower remission and five-year survival rates (40 % and 33 % respectively), and {{fewer than half of}} those achieving remission were still in first remission after five years. There were several reasons for the poor prognosis in this group, including advanced-stage disease (stage IVB), age over 40, and achievement of remission...|$|E
