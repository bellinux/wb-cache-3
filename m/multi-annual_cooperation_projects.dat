40|$|Projecte realitzat en col. laboració amb el centre École Centrale ParisWhen {{looking for}} {{documents}} related to project management thousands of references appear. However {{just a few of}} them are specific to <b>cooperation</b> <b>projects.</b> This thesis discusses cooperation from a university point of view by following a general to specific approach. The existence of an association that supports the students who take part in <b>cooperation</b> <b>projects</b> ensures higher levels of quality and effectiveness. Likewise it facilitates the involvement of students, professors and other university workers in the cooperation. Therefore in the first chapter we propose a methodology of management of associations of students for cooperation. 10 By the time a project is developed there are certain recommendable practices to follow during the pre‐execution, the execution and the post‐execution of the project. The second chapter presents a methodology of management of <b>cooperation</b> <b>projects.</b> Since the methodology has been conceived for generic projects, it may be useful for anyone willing to develop a <b>cooperation</b> <b>project</b> in any field. Eventually, the third chapter contains real examples of <b>cooperation</b> <b>projects.</b> Based on the experience and background of the writers, the examples are related to the use of wireless networks to provide connection in rural areas. In the chapter we develop a benchmark study of different suitable technologies, an analysis of the tools required for the design of the projects and ultimately two examples of projects developed in Perú and Chile respectively...|$|R
