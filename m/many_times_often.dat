2500|$|Around 1890, Sargent painted two daring non-commissioned portraits as show pieces—one of actress Ellen Terry as Lady Macbeth {{and one of}} {{the popular}} Spanish dancer La Carmencita. Sargent was elected an {{associate}} of the Royal Academy, and was made a full member three years later.

To be real Managers, Management need to grow-up their knowledge because experience alone, without theory, teaches nothing what to do to make Quality. For Higher Education Institutions, this means that professors MUST learn Quality ideas on Quality Management, in a correct and scientific way. In the paper, as already done several times, we present some new cases (out of the hundreds known to the author) where professors were acting with disquality. Would that be useful...|$|R
