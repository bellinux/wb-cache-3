40|$|Transient Current Technique (TCT) and Charge Collection Efficiency (CCE) {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} low resistivity (280 Ωcm) n-bulk, p-readout magnetic Czochralski <b>ministrip</b> sensors and diodes. The detectors were irradiated with neutrons and 24 GeV/c protons up to a total NIEL equivalent fluence of 8 × 10 15 / cm 2. The study was addressed to assess the radiation tolerance of the detectors up to fluences expected in the next generations of High Energy Physics experiments. The charge collection efficiency after irradiation {{was found to be}} much higher than for standard FZ silicon p-in-n sensors. The underlying physics of this remarkable result was investigated by performing Edge-TCT measurements on one of the neutron irradiated <b>ministrip</b> sensors to extract detailed informations about the field and efficiency profiles of the detector. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this work is the design, test and {{construction}} of a new silicon tracking detector for the extreme forward region of the DELPHI experiment at LEP. I joined the Very Forward Tracker (VFT) <b>Ministrip</b> group in 1993, {{at a time when the}} upgrade of the DELPHI tracking system was proposed. My first task was to participate in the design of the <b>ministrip</b> detector for the VFT. This included the optimisation of the detector layout in simulations and the study of prototype detectors in the testbeam. In 1994 I became responsible for the tests and assembly' of the VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector at CERN. The main focus of my work was the study of the performance of a large variety of detectors in beam tests. This included the preparation of the test setup, the tests of different detectors and the analysis of the measurements. With these measurements it is possible to compare the advantages and disadvantages of various new layouts for large pitch silicon strip detectors. In particular the signal response and spatial resolution of the VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector was precisely measured and modelled. The results of this study form the central part of my thesis. During 1995, prior to the assembly of the VFT detector, my main task was the quality monitoring of the final VFT <b>ministrip</b> detectors in acceptance tests at CERN. The experience gained during these tests was subsequently used to optimise the control of the detector to assure reliable operation in DELPHI. In the following I will give a brief overview of the contents of this thesis: In chapter 1 an overview of the DELPHI detector and its components, in particular the silicon tracking detector, is presented. Chapter 2 is dedicated to the design of the DELPHI Very For- ward Tracker. The requirements for the VFT are given together with the considerations infiuencing the layout and capability of the detector. The chapter shows the complex environment in the extreme forward region of collider experiments. A new unconven- tional design with inclined detectors was necessary to optimise efficiency and acceptance area. The only way to cope with the tight space constraints in the forward region is to mount the readout electronics on top of the active detector surface. The advantages and technical problems of this solution are described. Chapter 3 presents the results of testbeam studies carried out on different large pitch strip detectors. The signal response and spatial resolution of well known and newly developed detectors was precisely measured. This study allows the comparison of many different layouts concerning their track reconstruction capability and intrinsic problems like insufficient charge measurement. The study provides useful information for the VFT <b>ministrip</b> layout and demonstrates the influence of layout parameters. It also provides necessary information for the design of similar detectors to be used in the future LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiments. The tracking capability of the VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector is pre$ented in chapter 4. As the tracks in DELPHI will be inclined with respect to the detector surface, dedicated measurements at different track angles were carried out with the VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector. The measured signal response and spatial resolution could be modelled in a simulation, which proves excellent agreement with measurement data. Chapter 4 is concluded by an evaluation of the effects infiuencing the spatial resolution. In chapter 5 the production of the VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector is summarised. The chapter prescnts test results from the acceptance test of the full VFT <b>ministrip</b> detector prior to the installation in DELPHI. Extensive tests with the final configuration helped us to op- timise the operation parameters and insure reliable detector operation. Throughout the last three years I have been given the possibility to report on my work for this thesis. The considerations and results of the detector design are sumrnerisecl in Nucl. Phys. B(Proc. Supp.) 44 (1995) 292 - 295, which I had the pleasure to present at the 4 th Int. Conference on Aclvanced Technology and Particle Physics 1994. The predictions of the detector simulation for the final layout has been accomplished with testbeam meas- urements on VFT prototype detectors (NIM A 349 (1994) 424 - 430, DELPHI internal note DELPHI 94 - 44 Track 78). I had also the pleasure to report the results of the testbeam analysis with different large pitch detectors to the CMS collaboration (CMS collaboration meeting, Feb. 1996). Write-ups of the results presented in chapter 3 and 4 are currently in preparation and will be submitted for publication. I owe special thanks to Dr. M. Krammer, head of the serniconductor group of the lnstitute for High Energy Physics, for the motivating work in his group and the many hours of fruitful discussions. His attention, encouragement and knowledge was essential for this thesis. I would like to thank my thesis superviser, Prof. M. Regier, for his constant support and interest over many years. His advise and guidance was important for the analysis presentecl in this thesis. I want to express my gratefullness to Prof. W. Majerotto, director of the Institute for High Energy Physics, for financial support during this work. Furthermore I want to thank all my colleagues, in particular W. Adam, D. Rakoczy, N. Ncufelcl, V.

40|$|The DELPHI {{experiment}} at LEP is {{the first}} collider experiment with hybrid pixel detectors contributing to its track reconstruction. The pixel detector has been installed in 1996 with the final DELPHI silicon tracker, an assembly of microstrip, <b>ministrip</b> and pixel detectors optimized for the operation at LEP 2. It was completed for the physics period in 1997. The pixel detector comprises 1. 2 million detector cells of 330 * 330 mu m/sup 2 /. 152 detector modules are arranged in 4 inclined cone-shaped layers which cover polar angles from 10 degrees to 25 degrees. Experience on the system's features has been gained during three years of operation. The article intends to provide information on positive and critical aspects which might be useful for designers of pixel detector systems in forthcoming experiments. (4 refs) ...|$|E

During the 1995 / 96 shutdown the first 95 modules were installed and the installation {{was completed in}} May 97 with all 152 modules. Production yields and failures during the assembly will be presented. The detector operated at a threshold of around 9000 electrons resulting {{in a number of}} noisy pixels at the 10 Γ 3 level. After masking these hot pixels in the readout, the remaining number of random hits per event is at the 10 Γ 6 level.

40|$|The DELPHI Silicon Tracker, an {{ensemble}} of microstrips, ministrips and pixels, {{was completed in}} 1997 and has accumulated over 70 pb^- 1 of high energy data. The Tracker is optimised for the LEP 2 physics programme. It consists of a silicon microstrip barrel and endcaps with layers of silicon pixel and <b>ministrip</b> detectors. In the barrel part, three dimensional b tagging information is available down to a polar angle of 25 ^∘. Impact parameter resolutions have been measured of 28 μ m⊕ 71 /(p sin ^ 3 / 2 θ) μ m in R ϕ and 34 μ m⊕ 69 /p μ m in Rz, where p is the track momentum in GeV/c. The amount of material has been kept low {{with the use of}} double-sided detectors, double-metal readout, and light mechanics. The pixels have dimensions of 330 × 330 u m^ 2 and the ministrips have a readout pitch of 200 μ m. The forward part of the detector shows average efficiencies of more than 96 %, has signal-to-noise ratios of up to 40 in the ministrips, and noise levels at the level of less than one part per million in the pixels. Measurements of space points with low backgrounds are provided, leading to a vastly improved tracking efficiency for the region with polar angle less than 25 ^∘...|$|E
