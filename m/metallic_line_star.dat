40|$|High-resolution spectroscopic {{observations}} of the eclipsing binary system RR Lyn were made using the 1. 8 m telescope at the Bohuynsan Optical Astronomical Observatory in Korea. The spectral resolving power was R = 82, 000, with a {{signal to noise ratio}} of S/N > 150. We found the effective temperatures and surface gravities of the primary and secondary components to be equal to Teff = 7, 920 & 7, 210 K and log(g) = 3. 80 & 4. 16, respectively. The abundances of 34 and 17 different chemical elements were found in the atmospheric components. Correlations between the derived abundances with condensation temperatures and the second ionization potentials of these elements are discussed. The primary component is a typical <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> <b>star</b> with the abundances of light and iron group elements close to solar values, while elements with atomic numbers Z > 30 are overabundant by 0. 5 – 1. 5 dex with respect to solar values.

In this type of stars, CNO abundances are close to solar values, while the abundance pattern shows a negative correlation with condensation temperatures...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the origin of}} the abundance peculiarities of non-magnetic A-type stars, we present the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of a <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> <b>star</b> HD 23193 (A 2 m) and an A-type subgiant HD 170920 (A 5) which could have been a HgMn star on the main sequence. Our analysis is based on medium (R∼ 14000) and high (R∼ 40000) resolution spectroscopic data of the stars. The abundance of 18 elements are derived: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Zn, Sr, Y, and Ba. The masses of HD 23193 and HD 170920 are estimated from evolutionary tracks, as 2. 3 ± 0. 1 M_ and 2. 9 ± 0. 1 M_. The ages are found 635 ± 33 Myr for HD 23193 and 480 ± 50 Myr for HD 170920 using isochrones. The abundance pattern of HD 23193 shows deviations from solar values in the iron-peak elements and indicates remarkable overabundances of Sr (1. 16), Y (1. 03), and Ba (1. 24) with respect to the solar abundances. We compare the derived abundances of this moderately rotating (vsini = 37. 5 km s^- 1) Am star to the theoretical chemical evolution models including rotational mixing. The theoretically predicted abundances resemble our derived abundance pattern, except for a few elements (Si and Cr). For HD 170920, we find nearly solar abundances, except for C (- 0. 43), S (0. 16), Ti (0. 15), Ni (0. 16), Zn (0. 41), Y (0. 57), and Ba (0. 97). Its low rotational velocity (vsini = 14. 5 km s^- 1), reduced carbon abundance, and enhanced heavy element abundances suggest that the star is most-likely an evolved HgMn star.

In addition HD 8801 is a rare pulsating <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) <b>star.</b> We determined the astrophysical fundamental parameters to locate HD 8801 in the HR diagram. We analyzed the element abundances, paying close attention to the errors involved, and confirm the nature of HD 8801 as a <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) <b>star.</b> We also determined an upper limit on the magnetic field strength. Our abundance analysis is based on classical techniques, but uses for the final step a model atmosphere calculated with the abundances determined by us. We also discuss spectropolarimetric observations obtained for HD 8801. This object is remarkable in several respects. It is a non-magnetic <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) <b>star,</b> pulsating simultaneously in p- and g-modes, but also shows oscillations with periods in between these two domains, whose excitation requires explanation. Overall, the pulsational incidence in unevolved classical Am stars is believed to be quite low; HD 8801 does not conform to this picture.

Their compositions were determined for comparison with analyses of somewhat similar stars and with theoretical predictions. Here we provide {{new and improved}} elemental abundances analyses for the well-studied hot <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> <b>stars</b> 3 ̆b 8 Leonis and o Pegasi to better understand their relationship with other A stars. The analyses, which employ Kurucz 2 ̆ 019 s ATLAS 9 model atmospheres and WIDTH 9 codes and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectrograms obtained with Reticon and CCD detectors, are consistent with our previous analyses based upon coadded photographic plates. The spectral synthesis program STELLAR is used with the fluxes, the H 3 ̆b 3 profiles, and the spectra to provide better estimates of the effective temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity. The agreement of the results for two species of the same element are usually improved. The errors have been slightly reduced compared to those of their previous analyses using DAO spectrograms. Abundances of additional elements have been determined. The very high S/N (2 ̆ 265500) spectra of o Peg (used previously for the stellar atlas of Gulliver et al.) were critical to finding the weakest lines and to defining the profiles of all lines.

40|$|We {{used the}} Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the ESO-Very Large Telescope {{to obtain a}} high {{resolution}} and high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of Stock 16 - 12, an early-type star which previous ∆a photometric observations suggest being a chemically peculiar (CP) star. We used spectral synthesis to perform a detailed abundance analysis obtaining an effective temperature of 8400 ± 400 K, a surface gravity of 4. 1 ± 0. 4, a microturbulence velocity of 3. 4 + 0. 7 − 0. 3 km s− 1, and a projected rotational velocity of 68 ± 4 km s− 1. We provide photomet-ric and spectroscopic evidence showing the star is most likely {{a member of the}} young Stock 16 open cluster (age 3 – 8 Myr). The probable cluster membership, the star’s position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the found infrared excess strongly suggest the star is still in the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase. We used PMS evolutionary tracks to determine the stellar mass, which ranges between 1. 95 and 2. 3 M⊙, depending upon the adopted spectro-scopic or photometric data results. Similarly, we obtained a stellar age ranging between 4 and 6 Myr, in agreement with that of the cluster. Because the star’s chemical abundance pattern resembles well that known of main sequence CP <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> (Am) <b>stars,</b> the object sets im-portant constraints to the diffusion theory. Additional spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data allowed us to conclude that the object is probably a single non-magnetic star...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The pseudo-luminosity {{effect in}} the <b>metallic</b> <b>line</b> A-type <b>stars</b> found by Abt & Morgan (1976) is {{confirmed}} in {{a random sample of}} 27 Am stars. From a morphological study of their spectra in the wavelength interval 3850 – 4400 Å at a reciprocal dispersion of 66 Å/mm, revised spectral types are given on the MK system for their K-line and metallic-line spectra. This shows that: (a) our segregation of weak Am from the Am stars largely agrees with that by Cowley et al. (1969); (b) all the stars in the sample are dwarfs according to their K-line classification; (c) more than 80 per cent exhibit the pseudo-luminosity effect significantly, with their metallic-line spectra resembling a giant or even a supergiant in the violet (3850 – 4100 Å), and a giant rather than a dwarf in the blue region (4260 - 4400 Å); (d) in two-thirds of the stars under (c), the Sr II 4077 Å line is found to have a markedly brighter luminosity class compared to any region, and in {{more than one-third of the}} sample it is comparable to that in Ap stars; (e) at least five stars exhibit characteristics which might suggest a spectrum variability: among these, the most striking example is 41 Sex A which was found to show a phase-modulated spectrum variation hitherto unknown in Am stars; (f) the metallic-line spectra of another five stars appear to be similar to A-shell type in differing degrees; (g) less than 20 per cent of the sample comprises stars which do not show any significant differential luminosity effect; these stars might have been misclassified or perhaps they are in a quiescent state. We also confirm the conclusion arrived at by Böhm-Vitense & Johnson (1978) that all Am stars may vary and our observations suggest that groups may exist among them...|$|R

Monte Carlo simulations allow the study within a unified theoretical framework of a variety of relevant features related to the electromigration.

We focus on identification of the H-band lines and analysis of the emission peak velocity separations (v_p) and emission peak intensity ratios (V/R) of the usually double-peaked H I and non-hydrogen emission lines. H I Br 11 emission is found to preferentially form in the circumstellar disks at an average distance of ~ 2. 2 stellar radii. Increasing v_p toward the weaker Br 12 [...] Br 20 lines suggests these lines are formed interior to Br 11. By contrast, the observed IR Fe II emission lines present evidence of having significantly larger formation radii; distinctive phase lags between IR Fe II and H I Brackett emission lines further supports that these species arise from different radii in Be disks. Several emission lines have been identified for the first time including ~ 16895, a prominent feature in the spectra for almost a fifth of the sample and, as inferred from relatively large v_p compared to the Br 11 -Br 20, a tracer of the inner regions of Be disks.
