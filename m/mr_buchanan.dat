500|$|The same evidences of {{mourning}} were seen along the levee. The Halliday Hotel the City National Bank {{and the gas}} office all bore crepe on their doors, while a number of buildings along the levee were draped in black and flags hung at half-mast.The funeral of the late Capt. Halliday {{was held at the}} Halliday Hotel Tuesday afternoon. [...] Long before two o’clock the crowds commenced to gather and when the services began the parlors and halfway were crowded with people and numbers could not get upstairs but waited in the office or outside on the street. Rev. F. A. DeRosset, rector of the Church of the Redeemer, conducted the last solemn rites and a quartette choir composed of <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> Miss Lelia Miller, and Messrs. Buchanan and Tunnel sang several beautiful hymns. [...] The funeral address was delivered by Rev. C. T. Phillips, of Princeville, Ill., formerly pastor of the Presbyterian Church here. [...] Mr. Phillips was a close friend of the deceased, and it was the wish of Capt. Halliday that he might assist in the service. [...] Mr. Phillips spoke of the Captain’s kindness and generosity, how he rendered assistance to so many and did it in such a delicate way that no sensitive or proud natures were hurt. [...] He spoke of the Captain’s loyalty to Cairo. [...] How he aided the city in its struggle against the great floods; how he instructed the bank to cash all paper issued by the city in those dark days; how his fortune was ready to be used in protecting life and property here, and how his barges were always placed in readiness to be sunk opposite weak places in the levee. [...] He told of a conversation the Captain had with him in the panic days of 1892-’93, when banks were failing everywhere, in which the deceased said his entire fortune was ready to preserve the integrity of the bank here and to protect the businessmen from loss. [...] He told what a kind employer Capt. Halliday was, how a position with him was a life job if the employee did his work faithfully. [...] Mr. Phillips said he had known men at DuQuoin 21 years ago that were still in the service of Capt. Halliday. [...] He told how Capt. Halliday watched the careers of young men who were striving to get ahead in life, and how he helped them to get on by opening the way for them without ever letting them see his hand. [...] All this he told and more of the man whom he termed the best friend Cairo ever had.|$|E

If <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> instead of admitting the right of secession, had declared it to be, as it plainly is, rebellion, he would not only have received the unanimous support of the Free States, but would have given confidence to the loyal, reclaimed the wavering, and disconcerted the plotters of treason in the South.|$|E

I would only remind the Judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise. I want to know if Buchanan has not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has Douglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all questions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself? Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject? ...|$|E

6000|$|Is it, then, {{possible}} {{to consider the}} price of the necessaries of life as regulated upon the principle of a common monopoly? Is it possible, with M. de Sismondi, to regard rent as the sole produce of labour, which has a value purely nominal, and the mere result of that augmentation of price which a seller obtains in consequence of a peculiar privilege; or, with <b>Mr</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> to consider it as no addition to the national wealth, but merely as a transfer of value, advantageous only to the landlords, and proportionately injurious to the consumers? ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{excellent}} work of M. de Sismondi, De la richesse commerciale, {{he says in}} a note on the subject of rent, 'Cette partie de la rente fonciere est celle que les Economistes ont decoree du nom du produit net comme etant le seul fruit du travail qui aj outat quelquechose a la richesse nationale. On pourrait au contraire soutenir contre eux, que c'est la seule partie du produit du travail, dont la valeur soit purement nominale, et n'ait rien de reelle: c'est en effet le resultat de l'augmentation de prix qu'obtient un vendeur en vertu de son privilege, sans que la chose vendue en vaille reellement d'avantage.' [3] The prevailing opinions among the more modern writers in our own country, have appeared to me to incline towards a similar view of the subject; and, not to multiply citations, I shall only add, that in a very respectable edition of the Wealth of nations, lately published by <b>Mr</b> <b>Buchanan,</b> of Edinburgh, the idea of monopoly is pushed still further. And while former writers, though they considered rent as governed by the laws of monopoly, were still of opinion that this monopoly in the case of land was necessary and useful, <b>Mr</b> <b>Buchanan</b> sometimes speaks of it even as prejudicial, and as depriving the consumer of what it gives to the landlord.|$|E

60|$|The dispute {{was upon}} the {{question}} of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution had been fairly formed by the people or not. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan</b> and his friends have not contended for the contrary principle {{any more than the}} Douglas men or the Republicans.

The question was, Was it a fair emanation of the people? It was a question of fact, and not of principle. As to the principle, all were agreed. Judge Douglas voted with the Republicans upon that matter of fact.|$|E

60|$|From Boston, on the 27th of November, my wife {{returned}} to England, leaving me to prosecute my journey southward to Washington by myself. I shall {{never forget the}} political feeling which prevailed in Boston at that time, or the discussions {{on the subject of}} Slidell and Mason, in which I felt myself bound to take a part. Up to that period I confess that my sympathies had been strongly with the Northern side in the general question; and so they were still, as far as I could divest the matter of its English bearings. I have always thought, and do think, that a war for the suppression of the Southern rebellion could not have been avoided by the North without an absolute loss of its political prestige. Mr. Lincoln was elected President of the United States in the autumn of 1860, and any steps taken by him or his party toward a peaceable solution of the difficulties which broke out immediately on his election must have been taken before he entered upon his office. South Carolina threatened secession as soon as Mr. Lincoln's election was known, while yet there were four months left of Mr. Buchanan's government. That <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan</b> might, during those four months, have prevented secession, few men, I think, will doubt when the history of the time shall be written. But instead of doing so he consummated secession. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan</b> is a Northern man, a Pennsylvanian; but he was opposed to the party which had brought in Mr. Lincoln, having thriven as a politician by his adherence to Southern principles. Now, when the struggle came, he could not forget his party in his duty as President. General Jackson's position was much the same when Mr. Calhoun, {{on the question of the}} tariff, endeavored to produce secession in South Carolina thirty years ago, in 1832--excepting in this, that Jackson was himself a Southern man. But Jackson had a strong conception of the position which he held as President of the United States. He put his foot on secession and crushed it, forcing Mr. Calhoun, as Senator from South Carolina, to vote for that compromise as to the tariff which the government of the day proposed. South Carolina was as eager in 1832 for secession as she was in 1859-60; but the government was in the hands of a strong man and an honest one. Mr. Calhoun would have been hung had he carried out his threats. But <b>Mr.</b> <b>Buchanan</b> had neither the power nor the honesty of General Jackson, and thus secession was in fact consummated during his Presidency.|$|E
