40|$|Downobtained {{over the}} full range of {{operating}} conditions and their im-plementation requires substantial space which is not often avail-able in practice. Conceptually, these standard techniques deal with the consequences of combustion instabilities but not with the driving sources. It is shown here that an alternative solu-tion may be to directly act on the causes of the onset of thermo-acoustic coupling. The basic idea is to modify the flames dynam-ics using the dynamical response of the injection system. The principle of the passive control strategy proposed on this basis is to counteract the onset of oscillations by tackling the underly-ing causes. The injection system is modified to avoid a coherent motion of the flames when they are submitted to an acoustic mod-ulation and reduce the coupling between acoustic perturbations and heat release fluctuations. Numerical simulations and exper-imental data are presented and one may infer that the method could bring a substantial improvement to the system stability. The efficiency of this technique is demonstrated in the case of small premixed flames anchored on a <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> (the configuration is that of a premixed gaseous–fueled multi-point dump combustor), but the principle is more general an...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{a process}} of combustion in a spark-ignition engine. The aim of the analysis {{was to determine the}} differences in the combustion process between the engine with a classic <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> and a system wh ich injects fuel directly to the cylinders as well. To aid in the analysis the measuremen ts of the high variable pressure in th e engine's cylinder against the crankshaft angle were taken. This allowed us to obtain indicated diagrams for both types o f engines. To eliminate distortions, both functions were approximated using combined functions. Th e other basic parameters were also measu red: torque, RPM and insta ntaneous fuel consumption. The analysis of the indicated diagrams yielded an indicated mean pressure and thermal e fficiency for both fuel systems. Then, a comprehensive analysis of pressures in cylin ders was performed {{in order to determine the}} way the flame spreads in the cylinder for the two types of engines. The results obtained from this analysis show that the speed of combustion is grea ter for the charge formed by the dual-injector fuel system. The increased spee d of the combustion, especially when it reaches a 50 % fraction of the exhaust gas in the cylinder, is what accounts for the increase in the indicated mean pressure and the increase in the thermal efficiency of the engine with a dual-injector fuel system. The time of the spreading of the flame, as well as the fast burn period were reduced. The increased eff iciency of the combustion process in the cylinder means tha t the heat losses through the cylinder sleeve are greatly reduced. The results of the research in th is paper confirm the purposefulness of using a dual-injector fuel system in a spark-ignition engine...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a fundamental thermoacoustic test rig developed by Noiray (“Linear and nonlinear analysis of combustion instabilities, application to <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> and control strategies”, PhD thesis, École Centrale Paris, 2007) and models {{it with an}} entirely analytical approach. The test rig is treated as a system of two coupled elements: an acoustic resonator and a flame with oscillating rate of heat release. We describe the acoustics of the combustion rig in terms of modes, and derive a governing equation for one such mode. This {{turns out to be}} the equation for a damped harmonic oscillator, forced by the heat release rate from the flame. In order to model the heat release rate, and in particular its nonlinear aspects, we develop a generalised nτ-law with amplitude-dependent coefficients and multiple time-lag. The coefficients are determined from Noiray's measured flame describing function. Stability predictions are made by evaluating the sign of the damping coefficient in the governing equation. These predictions are in excellent qualitative agreement with the measured stability behaviour. Finally, the physical mechanisms of the amplitude-dependence are explored...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Intake {{manifolds}} provide {{fresh air}} to internal combustion engines {{and have a}} major effect on their performance. Therefore, many investigations are related to their design {{in order to improve}} the charging efficiency and to achieve the uniform distribution of fresh air among the engine cylinders. This paper deals with the design procedure of a cheap <b>multipoint</b> <b>injection</b> intake <b>system,</b> adapted to a racing car engine. Some special demands had to be taken into consideration. The intake manifold must contain the imposed constraint for the airflow {{in the shape of a}} single circular restrictor placed between the throttle and the engine to limit its power. The flow and the pressure loss reduction in the engine intake region were investigated with computational fluid dynamics software. Two different geometries of the intake manifold were taken into consideration. On the basis of the numerically obtained three-dimensional results, a mathematical model of the engine with a more appropriate intake was made in the engine simulation code in order to anticipate its characteristics. The intake system was designed, practically manufactured, and tested in the laboratory. The experimental results confirmed numerical predictions, justifying the simple and relatively quick design procedure for the intake system...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, most of {{the natural}} gas {{conversion}} systems available {{on the market for}} bifuel vehicles are based on the venturi principle or on the continuous injection principle for the carburation of the engine. Even if the driveability of these systems is satisfactory, their emission performance does often not reflect the full environmental potential offered by natural gas. This is mainly due to the low response of these systems to transient conditions. During the past years, EPFL has been involved in a co-operative program with the industry to develop a new natural gas <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> intended for <b>multipoint</b> sequenced and phased indirect gaseous fuel injection. Mounted on a four cylinder 1. 4 -liter engine, the system includes specifically developed injectors and a PC based electronic control unit. Emission results on the engine test vench are shown for typical transient sequences as well as steady state conditions. Results on the chassis dynamometer are given for the New European Driving Cycle (94 / 12 /EC directive). Keeping the standard vehicle components (like catalytic converter and lambda sensor), the current emissions results from our novel <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> are well below the legal emissions limits. Those results are compared with the performance of a state of the art <b>multipoint</b> continuous <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> from the market, measured on the same engine. In order to control accurately the narrower lambda window when working with natural gas, the system, among others, accounts for the sensitivity of the lambda sensor to the composition of the exhaust gases. While maintaining a good driveability, this system has shown significant emissions improvements compared to actual natural gas systems. New engine control strategies currently under evaluations are likely to still further reduce emissions...|$|R
