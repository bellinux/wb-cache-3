5|$|Like other snake species, {{the forest}} cobra has skin covered in scales. Snakes are entirely covered with scales or scutes of various shapes and sizes, known as snakeskin as a whole. Scales protect {{the body of}} the snake, aid it in locomotion, allow {{moisture}} to be retained within, and alter the surface characteristics such as roughness to aid in camouflage. The dorsal scales of the forest cobra are smooth, glossy and strongly oblique. The colour of this species is variable, with three <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> morphs. Those from the forest or forest fringe, from Sierra Leone east to western Kenya and south to Angola are glossy black, the chin, throat and anterior region of the belly are cream or white, with broad black cross-bars and blotches. The sides of the head are strikingly marked with black and white, giving the impression of vertical black and white bars on the lips. The second colour morph, from the west African savanna, is banded black and yellow, with a black tail, the head is brownish-yellow on top, the lips, chin and throat are yellow. The third colour morph, from the coastal plain of east Africa, south to KwaZulu-Natal, inland to Zambia and southern Democratic Republic of Congo, is brownish or blackish-brown above, paler below, the belly is yellow or cream, heavily speckled with brown or black, and specimens from the southern part of its range have black tails. Melanistic (all black) specimens have been documented from west Africa.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

25|$|When Perth Glory {{was formed}} (in 1996), the club felt it {{important}} to create a logo and name with no ethnic overtones and which symbolised the rebirth of association football in Western Australia. It was felt the name Perth Glory had broad appeal {{and a sense of}} history. The sunburst in the logo is characteristic of Perth in summer, while purple was chosen as the <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> and orange and white as the secondary colours, they were chosen in contrast to the more traditional combinations (generally white, red or blue).|$|E
25|$|This {{match is}} {{so named because}} blue is the <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> of both teams' playing kits, and is also Australian slang for a fight or a contest. The rivalry {{has emerged as a}} result of a number of spiteful {{encounters}} between the teams in recent years, and due to the longstanding rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two largest cities. The teams have competed against each other in three grand finals; in 2010 & 2017, with Sydney winning 4–2 on penalties after a 1–1 draw on both occasions and in 2015, with Victory winning 3–0. In 2010, Sydney FC won the A-League Premiership on the final day of the season by defeating Victory 2–0. A Big Blue match is traditionally played on Australia Day each year.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the club}} wore yellow and blue {{chequered}} shirts {{in honour of}} the city's traditional colours, which date back to 1545 when the Duchy of Parma was established, but white shirts with a black cross on the chest were introduced after the First World War, drawing inspiration from Juventus' colours, following a name change. White continued to be worn as the <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> of the home kits {{for much of the}} remainder of the century, although often complemented with yellow, blue or both, rather than black. The club did, however, experiment in the 1950s with blue shirts and blue and yellow striped shirts. The cross shirts were restored and worn until bankruptcy in 1968, when white shirts with off-centre blue and yellow vertical bands were worn, but the cross returned from 1970 until 1983 when a yellow and blue-sleeved white shirt was introduced and used for 8 years.|$|E

25|$|Units of the Chilean Army carry one <b>main</b> <b>Colour,</b> {{known as}} the estandarte de combate (combat standard). This {{is the same as}} the {{national}} flag, but with an embroidered star and with the unit designation, honorific title, founding date and place, and, depending on the unit, other historic information and honours embroidered diagonally across the fly in gold. The flag is also trimmed with gold fringe. It is mounted on a staff with a gilt condor finial; below the finial is a cravat in the national colours with decorations attached. In addition to the military Colour, particularly distinguished units, and long serving units may carry a second Colour known as a bandera coronela (colonel's colour). This is a red field with a large white five-pointed star. In the angles of the star are the names and dates of battle honours surrounded by laurel wreaths, all in gold, while in an arc above the star is the designation of the unit, also in gold. The flag is also surrounded by gold fringe.|$|E

500|$|Saperstein {{directed}} {{the use of}} warm and soft colours in the series; this colour scheme was modelled after that of Winnie the Pooh, bestowing a [...] "soft, cuddly feel", according to Far Eastern Economic Review journalist S. Jayasankaran, to the animation. [...] Much of the show's visuals followed Lat's art style. [...] Outlines are drawn in bold manner, making objects {{stand out from the}} backgroundan effect particularly aided by the rich use of brown, green, and yellow as the primary colours. [...] The last two colours are heavily used in the depictions of nature, [...] contrasting well with each other and separating the background from the middle ground. [...] Aside from being the <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> for the houses, brown is used as the skin tone of the characters. [...] Drawn with [...] "short and round shapes", Mat and his fellow Malays are highlighted with bright colours.|$|E
500|$|The reliquary exuberantly {{exploits}} the ronde bosse or [...] "encrusted" [...] enamelling technique, {{which involves}} creating small three-dimensional figures coated in enamel {{on a metal}} core, often just gold wire. [...] The technique was a recent innovation which the goldsmiths working for the Valois were pushing to its limits {{at the end of}} the 14th century. [...] The <b>main</b> <b>colour</b> of enamel used is a lead-based white, which had also only been developed a decade or two at most before the date of the reliquary, and was evidently very fashionable {{at the end of the}} century. [...] White dominates the few surviving large enamels in ronde bosse dated to the period beginning about 1380 and ending about 1410, used as here for both the clothes and flesh of the figures. [...] Gold is used for their hair, and other enamel colours are mostly used at the neck and cuffs to demarcate between white robes and white flesh; [...] "throughout, colour is used in a very considered way"; [...] "a controlled use of red includes the alternation of rubies and pearls", except where [...] "a single sapphire interrupts this rhythm" [...] above God the Father. [...] Blue, an important enamel colour in other works, is almost entirely absent here, perhaps so as not to overshadow the large sapphires.|$|E
