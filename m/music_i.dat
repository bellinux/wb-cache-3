5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> love country <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give it a little more life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
25|$|We {{would meet}} monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and {{give money to}} deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle sang for us. The other judges thought her voice was too small, but I thought she had an {{incredible}} ability to communicate through <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> talked the other judges into giving her a grant.|$|E
25|$|A lean loose-jointed Negro had {{commenced}} plunking {{a guitar}} beside me while I slept...

25|$|It {{became a}} burden. Some {{people say it}} helped me invent the kind of <b>music</b> <b>I</b> play, but I don’t know whether it did. It’s just {{something}} I’ve {{had to learn to}} live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E
25|$|The {{album was}} re-released as a 2-disc 'Deluxe Edition' on 22 October 2012. The second disc {{includes}} the album re-recorded, with each song {{performed in a}} different style, including acoustic performances. It was recorded at Regal House Studio in Cambridgeshire, and produced by Lee Batiuk, with Chris Pennells and Lee Wilson involved in the recording process unlike the original release, after the band were inspired to experiment with their sound by performing at St Pancras International railway station {{as part of the}} Station Sessions. This was the same studio where the drums were recorded for the original release. Speaking about the Station Sessions performance, which was an acoustic 'stripped down' performance, James Veck-Gilodi explained; 'we thought we sounded better than we did as a rock band' and noted that 'it's nice to make music that sounds more like the <b>music</b> <b>I</b> listen to'. The release will feature banjo, mandolin and piano.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of music among the Israelites was coincident {{with that of}} poetry, the two being equally ancient, since every poem was also sung. Although little mention is made of it, music was used in very early times in connection with divine service. Amos vi. 5 and Isa. v. 12 show that the feasts immediately following sacrifices were very often attended with music, and from Amos v. 23 it may be gathered that songs had already {{become a part of}} the regular service. Moreover, popular festivals of all kinds were celebrated with singing and music, usually accompanying dances in which, as a rule, women and maidens joined. Victorious generals were welcomed with music on their return (Judges xi. 34; I Sam. xviii. 6), and music naturally accompanied the dances at harvest festivals (Judges ix. 27, xxi. 21) and at the accession of kings or their marriages (I Kings i. 40; Ps. xlv. 9). Family festivals of different kinds were celebrated with music (Gen. xxxi. 27; Jer. xxv. 10). I Sam. xvi. 18 indicates that the shepherd cheered his loneliness with his reed-pipe, and Lam. v. 14 shows that youths coming together at the gates entertained one another with stringed instruments. David by his playing on the harp drove away an evil spirit from Saul (I Sam. xvi. 16 et seq.); the holy ecstasy of the Prophets was stimulated by dancing and <b>music</b> (<b>I</b> Sam. x. 5, 10; xix. 20); playing on a harp awoke the inspiration that came to Elisha (II Kings iii. 15). The description in Chronicles of the embellishment by David of the Temple service with a rich musical liturgy represents in essence the order of the Second Temple, since, as is now generally admitted, the liturgical Temple Psalms belong to the post-exilic period.|$|E
500|$|Einstein {{developed}} {{an appreciation for}} music at an early age, and later wrote: [...] "If I were not a physicist, I {{would probably be a}} musician. I often think in <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> live my daydreams in <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> see my life in terms of <b>music...</b> <b>I</b> get most joy in life out of music." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi and Strepponi now {{decided on}} marriage; they {{travelled}} to Collonges-sous-Salève, a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 {{the couple were}} married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses. At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more <b>music,</b> <b>I</b> have not seen any more <b>music,</b> <b>I</b> have not thought anymore about <b>music.</b> <b>I</b> don't even know what colour my last opera is, and I almost don't remember it." [...] He began to remodel Sant'Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued {{to work for the}} next twenty years. This included major work on a square room that became his workroom, his bedroom, and his office.|$|E
