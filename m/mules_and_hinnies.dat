50|$|The {{different}} {{number and}} different structure in chromosomes {{makes it difficult}} for them to pair up. Donkeys have 62 chromosomes, <b>mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies</b> have 63 pair of chromosomes and horses have 64 pair of chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies</b> have 63 chromosomes, {{a mixture}} of the horse's 64 and the donkey's 62. The {{different}} structure and number usually prevents the chromosomes from pairing up properly and creating successful embryos, rendering most mules infertile.|$|E
5000|$|Other than size, some {{additional}} minor differences occur {{that can be}} used to distinguish between <b>mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies.</b> The head of a hinny is said to resemble that of a horse more than it does a mule's, with shorter ears (although these are still longer than those of horses), and more horse-like manes and tails than mules. [...] A male hinny is properly called a horse hinny, and a female hinny is properly called a mare hinny, though in British English both female hinnies and a female donkeys are sometimes called a jennet.|$|E
40|$|Among {{different}} duck genetic types, Muscovy <b>and</b> especially <b>mule</b> ducks are {{the only}} ones involved in fatty liver production. Mule ducks are hybrids from male Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata, Cm) and female common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos, Ap). They benefit from a heterosis effect on feed ingestion capacity and fatty liver weight and thus they account for 95 % of fatty liver production. Conversely, common ducks <b>and</b> <b>hinny</b> hybrids (male common duck X female Muscovy duck) are not used to produce fatty liver. In order to better characterize these reciprocal hybrids, genome specific expression was analyzed. RNA sequencing was conducted in the liver of common, Muscovy, <b>mule</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinny</b> ducks fed ad libitum or overfed (n= 10). SNPs with genome specific alleles were selected in common and Muscovy duck RNA sequences by discosnp++, a de novo assembly method that does not require a reference genome. Sequence reads corresponding to the two alleles of genome specific SNPs were then counted in RNA sequences from <b>mule</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinny</b> hybrids. These counts were considered as expression levels. Only three loci were found to be expressed in a strict genome specific manner. They were localized in the mitochondrial genome and, as expected, the maternal allele of the hybrids was found to be expressed. Interestingly, some genes were also found to be expressed with allelic imbalance, i. e. the ratio of Ap allele expression on Cm allele expression being 1 in overfed ducks or conversely > 1 in at libitum fed and < 1 in overfed ducks, pointing out orthologue genes with and without regulation by (over) feeding. In conclusion, genome specific expression and allelic imbalance could be observed in duck hybrids, strongly suggesting regulatory divergence between parental alleles...|$|R
5|$|Interspecific hybrids are bred by mating {{individuals}} from two species, normally {{from within the}} same genus. The offspring display traits and characteristics of both parents, but are often sterile, preventing gene flow between the species. Sterility is often attributed to the different number of chromosomes between the two species. For example, donkeys have 62 chromosomes, horses have 64 chromosomes, <b>and</b> <b>mules</b> or <b>hinnies</b> have 63 chromosomes. <b>Mules,</b> <b>hinnies,</b> <b>and</b> other normally sterile interspecific hybrids cannot produce viable gametes, because differences in chromosome structure prevent appropriate pairing and segregation during meiosis, meiosis is disrupted, and viable sperm and eggs are not formed. However, fertility in female mules has been reported with a donkey as the father.|$|R
60|$|These several remarks are {{apparently}} applicable to animals; but {{the subject is}} here excessively complicated, partly owing {{to the existence of}} secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the <b>mule</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hinny</b> more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.|$|R

40|$|The {{academic}} textbook Stock Breeding in Tropical and Subtropical Conditions {{contains the}} following chapters: General part, Cattle and camels, Sheep and goats, Horses, donkeys, <b>mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies,</b> Index and Appendix {{with photographs of}} domestic animals in tropical and subtropical area. The textbook is written for students of the Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek {{and serves as a}} reading recommended within the module of the same title. Since 1997, when this module was introduced to curriculum as an elective course, students have showed great interest for gaining knowledge on cattle breeding in specific tropical and subtropical conditions. They prepared numerous seminary papers and final theses on the mentioned topic. Gaining of such knowledge contributes to openness and mobility of students to other European universities, which further promotes Bologna Process principles. The textbook covers all topics that are planned to be elaborated within the module. The handbook content is divided into two parts. The first part overviews numerous problems that producers of cattle in tropical and subtropical conditions are faced with. Some of those problems are also present in Croatia, especially in the warmer part of a year, becoming more obvious because of global climatic changes. Some breeds of cattle typical for tropical and subtropical areas are presented {{in the second part of}} the textbook within three chapters (Cattle and camels, Sheep and goats, Horses, donkeys, <b>mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies).</b> According to historical records, some of these animals, such as buffalos lived in our areas, particularly in Slavonia, while some other breeds live today across Europe and are treated as exotic animals...|$|E
30|$|In many countries, {{horses are}} food-producing {{animals and the}} storage of {{specific}} elements in the equine muscles and organs can become relevant for human and animal nutrition. The statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat) indicates that 214526 equids, including mainly horses, but also asses, <b>mules</b> <b>and</b> <b>hinnies,</b> were slaughtered in the European Union in the year 2007, with the highest rate in Italy (46.6 %). In Germany, the per capita consumption of horse meat is low (0.04 kg), while other countries like Italy (1 kg), Luxembourg (0.68 kg) or France (0.35 kg) show a higher per capita consumption (Eurostat). Besides the relevance of horses for the food chain, these animals can partly be important as indicator for environmental pollution, as plants, the equine basic food resource, incorporate elements depending on the concentrations in the soil or air. For instance, horses are postulated to be an indicator for the cadmium (Cd) pollution of the environment (Elinder 1981). In this context, also other elements are of interest: the radioactive strontium (90 Sr) is an important contaminant in soil, since it was released during overhead nuclear weapon tests in the 1950 s and 1960 s. The transition to plants and consecutively to food-producing animals and humans is intensively discussed since the 1960 s. Beside Cd and Sr, antimony (Sb) is also interesting for {{an evaluation of the}} environmental exposition of horses. It has been reported (Daunderer 1998) that the air in Europe contains 8 ng Sb/m 3 and the sea water 0.2 μg/l, while stream water contains 0.1 - 1 μg/l, and markedly higher concentrations (> 1000 μg/kg dry matter) can be found in spruce needles, leaves of fruit-bearing trees and grass (Streit 1994). Moreover, the alkaline earth metal barium (Ba) is of interest. Ba shows a high reactivity and therefore exists in nature only in form of Ba compounds. Since only few information is available on the relevance of Ba for horses or other animals, the present study may help to generate new knowledge on its storage in the equine organs. Finally, lead (Pb) is an important environmental contaminant that can be ingested by water, soil and food (Brown and Margolis 2012). Since Pb accumulates in the organism, noxious effects can appear {{as a result of a}} high exposition (Ciobanu et al. 2012).|$|E

60|$|With animals, the jackal is prepotent {{over the}} dog, as is stated by Flourens, who made many crosses between these animals; {{and this was}} {{likewise}} the case with a hybrid which I once saw between a jackal and a terrier. I cannot doubt, from the observations of Colin and others, that the ass is prepotent over the horse; the prepotency in this instance running more strongly through the male than through the female ass; so that the mule resembles the ass more closely than does the hinny. (14/16. Flourens 'Longevite Humaine' page 144 on crossed jackals. With respect {{to the difference between}} the <b>mule</b> <b>and</b> the <b>hinny</b> I am aware that this has generally been attributed to the sire and dam transmitting their characters differently; but Colin, who has given in his 'Traite Phys. Comp.' tome 2 pages 537-539, the fullest description which I have met with of these reciprocal hybrids, is strongly of opinion that the ass preponderates in both crosses, but in an unequal degree. This is likewise the conclusion of Flourens, and of Bechstein in his 'Naturgeschichte Deutschlands' b. 1 s. 294. The tail of the hinny is much more like that of the horse than is the tail of the <b>mule,</b> <b>and</b> this is generally accounted for by the males of both species transmitting with greater power this part of their structure; but a compound hybrid which I saw in the Zoological Gardens, from a mare by a hybrid ass- zebra, closely resembled its mother in its tail.) The male pheasant, judging from Mr. Hewitt's descriptions (14/17. Mr. Hewitt who has had such great experience in raising these hybrids says ('Poultry Book' by Mr. Tegetmeier 1866 pages 165-167) that in all, the head was destitute of wattles, comb, and ear-lappets; and all closely resembled the pheasant {{in the shape of the}} tail and general contour of the body. These hybrids were raised from hens of several breeds by a cock-pheasant; but another hybrid, described by Mr. Hewitt, was raised from a hen-pheasant, by a silver-laced Bantam cock, and this possessed a rudimental comb and wattles.), and from the hybrids which I have seen, preponderates over the domestic fowl; but the latter, as far as colour is concerned, has considerable power of transmission, for hybrids raised from five differently coloured hens differed greatly in plumage. I formerly examined some curious hybrids in the Zoological Gardens, between the Penguin variety of the common duck and the Egyptian goose (Anser aegyptiacus); and although I will not assert that the domesticated variety preponderated over the natural species, yet it had strongly impressed its unnatural upright figure on these hybrids.|$|R

The average values were between 2. 55 and 6. 40 g per 100 g of muscle. Breast muscle from overfed ducks showed higher lipid and lower water levels than breast muscle from ducks fed ad libitum. Muscle from the overfed ducks was also paler in color and exhibited greater yellowness and cook-ing loss values. Juiciness was judged lower and flavor more pronounced in overfed ducks. Muscovy ducks ex-hibited higher breast weight and lower lipid levels than the other genotypes.
