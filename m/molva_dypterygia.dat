40|$|Interest in {{sourcing}} high quality non-quota fish species {{continues to increase}} as fish quotas tighten and traditional whitefish stocks decline. Quality aspects of one such species, silver smelt. (Argentinus silus), were examined {{in an article in}} Farm and Food, October-December 1991. This work has now been extended using spot samples of a further six deep water, non-quota species caught in the Atlantic off the north west coast of Ireland. The tests, which will continue on an annual basis, are a co-operative effort between staff at The Fisheries Research Centre and The National Food Centre. The six species evaluated were Bairds smoothead (Alepocephalus bairdii), blue ling, (<b>Molva</b> <b>dypterygia),</b> black scabbard(Aphanopus carbo), rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and greater forkbeard (Phycis blennoides). Details of catching, procurement and fish characteristics are reported from The Fisheries Research Centre, while tests for proximate analysis, water holding capacity, gel strength, and colour were carried out at The National Food Centre using samples which were blast frozen at sea...|$|E
40|$|The WKAMDEEP met at IMEDEA (UIB/CSIC) in Esporles, Spain from 21 to 25 Octo-ber 2013 {{to review}} age {{determination}} methods and growth patterns of several deep-water fish species {{in order to}} pave the way for solid input data of future age-based assessments for these species. The species dealt with by the Group were: tusk (Brosme brosme), ling (Molva molva), blue ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>dypterygia),</b> roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), greater silver smelt (Argentina silus), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and black-spotted sea bream (Pagellus bogaraveo). All relevant information was collated in species-specific annexes, in order to have a protocol which was easy to consult and use for each species. The main report sums up the discussions in the group and presents results from the small WebGr-exchanges of each species made prior to and during the meeting. The body of the report is found in the species-specific annexes, which describe the general biological knowledge of growth and longevity for each species, review available ageing protocols, identify any unresolved problems with interpretation and recommend future actions...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} Spanish deep-sea fishery performed in international waters on the Hatton Bank and proximities (NE Atlantic) {{during the period}} 1996 - 2000. This is a multi-species fishery, carried out by stern bottom trawlers, mainly between June and September, in depths mainly between 800 m to 1600 m. The importance of the fishing activity {{in this area is}} increasing notably. This fishery has been monitored since the beginning in 1996, with the collaboration of the fishing industry, by means of a scientific observer programme. The observers on board provide data on catches, discards, location and depth, haul by haul. Length samples of the main species and biological material are also collected. The species composition of the catches is presented. In terms of weight, the roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris) and the bairdii smoothhead (Alepocephalus bairdi i) are the most important species in the catches. Other less important species are the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and the blue ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>dypterygia).</b> In addition to the total catch, the composition of the retained catch and the discard are studied. For the main retained species, the dressing types are described and the conversion coefficients are presented. The length distribution of the catches and the discards, length-weight relationships and other biological aspects of some of the main species are analysed...|$|E
40|$|The {{report is}} based on work {{conducted}} in a workshop that was held in Brest, France on 13 – 16 October 2015, and describes the preparatory work {{in response to the}} EC longterm management plans for western EU waters (ICES Subareas V to X). Specifically Art. 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1380 / 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, which requires a multiannual plan including quantifiable target. In this context ICES was requested to provide plausible values around FMSY for some stocks inhabiting western EU waters. Estimates of reference points Blim, Bpa, Flim and Fpa are provided for the stocks considered, and the FMSY ranges [Flower, Fupper] are estimated by ICES to be precautionary, and deliver no more than 5 % reduction in long-term yield compared with MSY. The report provides information on the following stocks: •	Black-bellied anglerfish (Lophius budegassa) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	White-bellied anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Blue ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>dypterygia)</b> in Subdivision Vb, and Subareas VI and VII •	Cod (Gadus morhua) in Divisions VIIe-k (Celtic Sea cod), Division VIIa (Irish Seand Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) in Divisions IVbc, VIIa, and VIId–h (Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, English Channel, and southern North Sea) •	Greenland halibut in Subareas V, VI, XII and XIV •	Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) in Divisions VIIb,c,e-k and Division VIb (Rockall) •	Hake (Merluccius merluccius) in Division IIIa, Subareas IV, VI and VII and Divisions VIIIa,b,d (Northern stock) and in Division VIIIc and IXa (Southern stock) •	Megrim (Lepidorhombus spp) in Divisions IVa and VIa •	Four-spot megrim (Lepidorhombus boscii) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) in Divisions VIIIc and IXa •	Plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in Division VIIe (Western Channel) •	Sole (Solea solea) in Divisions VIIIa,b (Bay of Biscay), Divisions VIIf,g (Celtic Sea, Division VIIe (Western Channel) and Division VIIa (Irish Sea) •	Whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in Division VIIe-k, Division VIIa (Irish Sea) and Division VIa (West of Scotland) •	Nephrops in Division VIa (North Minch, FU 11), Division VIa (South Minch, FU 12),Division VIa (Firth of Clyde + Sound of Jura, FU 13, Division VIIa (Irish Sea East, FU 14), Division VIIa (Irish Sea West, FU 15), Division VIIb,c,j,k (Porcupine Bank, FU 16), Division VIIb (Aran Grounds, FU 17), Division VIIa,g,j (Southeast and West of IRL, FU 19) and the Smalls (FU 22) For stocks where ICES advice is given based on the MSY approach, ICES has developed an advice rule (AR) based on the FMSY fishing mortality reference point, that provides the exploitation rate to give catch advice, and a biomass reference point MSY Btrigge r which is used to linearly reduce F if the biomass in the TAC year is predicted to be lower than this reference value (ICES, 2015). The ICES MSY AR is evaluated to check that the FMSY and MSY Btrigge r combination results in maximum long-term yield subject to precautionary considerations. The report provides ranges for both with and without the AR...|$|E
40|$|Capture {{fisheries}} and aquaculture supplied {{the world with}} about 148 million tonnes of fish in 2010, of which about 128 million tonnes were utilized as food for people. The fishery market is becoming much more complex and stratified, with greater diversification among species and product forms {{and for this reason}} food safety remains a major concern facing the seafood industry. Along fish value chain {{there are a lot of}} concern regarding public health and for this reason the aim of this work was to propose an approach to antibiotic resistance and parasites risk assessment in fish production value chains. The main consequences of the use and the abuse of antibiotics is the development and diffusion of antibiotic resistance that become a serious global problem. The aim of this research was to evaluate the presence of antimicrobial residues and to assess the antimicrobial resistance in bacteria species isolated from different wild caught seawater fish and fishery products. Three antibiotic substances (Oxytetracicline, Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) were detected (by screening and confirmatory methods) in Octopus vulgaris, Sepia officinalis and Thais haemastoma. All Vibrio strains isolated from fish were resistant to Vancomycin and Penicillin. In Vibrio alginolyticus, isolated in Octopus vulgaris, a resistance against 9 antibiotics was noted. Human fishery product-borne parasitic diseases include those caused by cestodes, trematodes and nematodes. These diseases are either caused by an infection following ingestion of viable parasites, or as an allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction against parasite antigens which occurs for nematodes of the family Anisakidae. Parasite risk assessment was evaluated in 3 different steps: •	Different infection indexes in european hakes (Merluccius merluccius) belonging from Atlantic ocean (FAO zone 27 IXa) and from Tyrrhenian sea (FAO zone 37. 1. 2) were assessed identifying and charactering species and populations of parasites. A total of 2990 larval specimens of A. simplex (s. l.) from Merluccius merluccius captured in the two different fishing grounds were collected: 2836 anisakids in hakes from FAO 27 fishing ground and only 154 anisakids in hakes from 37. 1. 2 fishing ground. A. simplex (s. s.) and A. pegreffii co-infected the same individual fish host, in viscera and in the fillets (hypaxial and epaxial) fished from the FAO 27 fishing ground; only A. pegreffii in hakes from FAO area 37. 1. 2 in viscera and in hypaxial flesh was found. •	The presence of nematodes in 33 fish species belonging from different FAO areas using artificial peptic digestion was evaluated and parasites identification using microscopical techniques and RT-PCR was performed. A total of 10897 anisakid larvae were found and collected in the flesh. The blue ling (<b>Molva</b> <b>dypterygia),</b> european conger (Conger conger) and Peter's fish (Zeus faber) were the most highly infected species respectively. A total of 27, 27 % of the species analyzed were anisakid-free; a monitoring tool for the evaluation of parasite infection in fish lots with the aim to assess parasites impact on marketed fish, as EFSA states in a recent report, was applied; 29 % of the evaluated fish lots had a score between 0 - 3, refering to serious weaknesses in the fish lots. •	The survival of Anisakis larvae, naturally present in fish, at different stages of ripening process in traditional salted anchovies was evaluated since a recent EFSA panel on risk assessment of parasites in fishery products stated that research on identification of alternative treatments for killing viable parasites in fishery products are needed. Viability was tested with different methods and the results showed that all larvae were not viable at the 15 th ripening day. The dry salting process at mean salt concentration of 24 % in all parts of the flesh at the end of the ripening period can be considered an effective method for devitalising anisakids larval forms present in the raw material and obtain a safe product for the consumer...|$|E
