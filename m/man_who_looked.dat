500|$|As {{the trial}} had made {{headlines}} in the daily newspapers, so did Colt's death. [...] Theories were put forth that Colt had killed another prisoner and escaped during the fire. [...] One newspaper account said that Colt had fled to California with his wife, as did a book published by a former New York Chief of Police. A man named Samuel M. Everett claimed he met John Colt (or a <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>looked</b> identical) in the Santa Clara Valley in California in 1852, and the account was published in Pearson's Magazine. [...] Harold Schechter, a researcher and author of two books about John Colt dismisses this as [...] "an outlandish tale" [...] and a [...] "product of folklore, not fact". [...] A New York Times article written in 1880 said that Caroline Henshaw was watched by private detectives for years after Colt's death and no sign was ever seen of him alive. [...] None of these speculations of Colt's escape were proven to be true.|$|E

Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E
