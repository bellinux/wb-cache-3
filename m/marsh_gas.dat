25|$|Methanogens {{are also}} the {{producers}} of <b>marsh</b> <b>gas</b> in wetlands, and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year—the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of cattle and other herbivores, which can release up to 150 liters per day, and of termites, is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, {{at the end of}} the carbon cycle, with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.|$|E
25|$|Methane was {{discovered}} and isolated by Alessandro Volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying <b>marsh</b> <b>gas</b> from Lake Maggiore. It {{is the major}} component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields, with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source (see Coal bed methane extraction, a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit, while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels, and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by anaerobic {{decay of organic matter}} and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil.|$|E
60|$|Never did two {{men look}} more surprised, and never did two {{generally}} grave savants laugh more heartily {{than did the}} two examiners when they realized what the candidate had answered. Their mirth speedily {{brought him back to}} his senses. He saw with a feeling of despair that it was <b>marsh</b> <b>gas</b> which they had expected--one of the simplest and commonest of chemical combinations. Alas! it was too late now. He knew full well that nothing could save him. With poor marks in botany and zoology, such an error in chemistry was irreparable. He did what was perhaps the best thing under the circumstances. Rising from his chair he made a respectful bow to the examiners, and walked straight out of the room--to the great astonishment of the janitor, who had never before witnessed such a breach of decorum. As the student {{closed the door behind him}} he looked back and saw that the other professors had left their respective tables and were listening to an account of the incident from one of the chemists--and a roar of laughter the moment afterwards showed that they appreciated the humour of it. His fellow-students gathered round Tom outside in the hope of sharing in the joke, but he pushed them angrily aside and strode through the midst of them and down the University steps. He knew that the story would spread fast enough without his assistance. His mind was busy too in shaping a certain resolution which he had often thought over during the last few months.|$|E

50|$|The {{historic}} {{centre of the}} village was formerly {{an island in the}} tidal marshes - {{one of a series of}} islands around the coast of The Wash (each one marked by a medieval church). The parishes along the coast of the Wash had no eastern boundaries, and were continually expanding as new land was reclaimed from the tidal marshes. The <b>marshes</b> produced methane <b>gas</b> which spontaneously ignited to produce flares, giving rise to the belief that they were haunted by spirits and that the new land needed cleansing before it was safe to use. This may account for the veneration of St Guthlac at Fishtoft, the saint being renowned for driving out devils; a medieval statue of St Guthlac can be seen high up on the tower of the Fishtoft parish church, and formerly held the whip with which he cleansed the land of evil spirits.|$|R

40|$|Salt marshes are physically, chemically, and biologically dynamic environments found {{globally}} at temperate latitudes. Tidal {{creeks and}} marshtop ponds may expand {{at the expense}} of productive grass-covered marsh platform. It is therefore important to understand the present magnitude and drivers of production and respiration in these submerged environments in order to evaluate the future role of salt marshes as a carbon sink. This thesis describes new methods to apply the triple oxygen isotope tracer of photosynthetic production in a salt <b>marsh.</b> Additionally, noble <b>gases</b> are applied to constrain air-water exchange processes which affect metabolism tracers. These stable, natural abundance tracers complement traditional techniques for measuring metabolism. In particular, they highlight the potential importance of daytime oxygen sinks besides aerobic respiration, such as rising bubbles. In tidal creeks, increasing nutrients may increase both production and respiration, without any apparent change in the net metabolism. In ponds, daytime production and respiration are also tightly coupled, but there is high background respiration regardless of changes in daytime production. Both tidal creeks and ponds have higher respiration rates and lower production rates than the marsh platform, suggesting that expansion of these submerged environments could limit the ability of salt marshes to sequester carbon. by Evan M.

"Thunder in the Skies" [...] implicates the Little Ice Age (circa 1250-1300 AD) in the {{invention}} of the chimney, as well as knitting, buttons, wainscoting, wall tapestries, wall plastering, glass windows (Hardwick Hall 1597 has [...] "more glass than wall"), and the practice of privacy for sleeping and sex. The genealogy of the steam engine is then examined: Thomas Newcomen's engine for pumping water out of mines (1712); Abraham Darby's cheap iron from coke, James Watt's addition of a second condensing cylinder (for cooling) to the engine (1763); John Wilkinson's improving of cannon boring (for the French military) and cylinder making (for Watt; 1773-75). Wilkinson's brother-in-law, Joseph Priestley, investigated gases, leading Alessandro Volta to invent [...] "bad air" [...] (<b>marsh</b> <b>gas)</b> detectors and ignitors.

If it did, the atmosphere in that bubble would surely be noxious, they said. It would be methane or <b>marsh</b> <b>gas.</b> And the pressure in it would be intolerable for man." [...] The confusion came from Crowther's assertion that the footage was filmed at great depth, an issue not clearly addressed in the film. His other complaint was a long tracking shot moving out from the window of one of the underwater structures, which Crowther claimed could only have been produced in an aquarium. Cousteau later demonstrated how he and his son Philippe produced the shot with a combination of ropes and small underwater motorized vehicles. Cousteau took great offense, and continued to describe and defend the difficult and innovative techniques used to create the film.|$|E
5000|$|Pavel Bazhov {{theorized that}} most of the {{existing}} mythical creatures were created by the populace to explain various unexplained natural phenomena, as they are related to some aspects of miners' life. Giving as example, the Earth Cat from [...] "Cat's Ears" [...] is described as [...] "two blue flames that look like cat's ears" [...] above the ground and represents sulfur dioxide gas. The antlered [...] "goat" [...] Silver Hoof from the story of the same name explained the occurrence of chrysolite: [...] "... people often found stones in the glade where the goat had run about. Most of them were green ones, chrysolites, folks call them." [...] The blue snake from the story of the same name represents a gold nugget. Although speaking about the blue snake was a bad omen among the local miners, to see one was a good sign, and it meant that a person would find a gold nugget. The crone Sinyushka from the tale [...] "Sinyushka's Well" [...] represents <b>marsh</b> <b>gas,</b> which was actually called [...] "sinyushka" [...] at the Urals. The author noted that supernatural played a bigger part in the miners' lore than in the lore of charcoal burners or blast furnace workers. Mining and mine exploration in particular were always connected with some supernatural forces which presumably helped the workers. Even as late as the 19th century, people used to say about the lucky workers that they [...] "knew the words" [...] and had certain helpers. The geography is well known because it is specified in the stories. Bazhov mentions real locations such as Sysert, the Polevskoy Copper Smelting Plant, the Gumyoshevsky mine, the villages Kosoy Brod and Krasnogorka, the Ryabinovka river.|$|E
