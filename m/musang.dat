5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, {{full-bodied}} creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee {{is the best in}} terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or <b>Musang</b> King.|$|E
5|$|The only {{carnivore}} in the Moluccas is the Malayan civet (<b>Musang),</b> {{which he}} supposes {{has been introduced}} by accident as it is kept for its musk. The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology to confirm this ability. The other mammals are marsupial, so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, {{there are at least}} 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.|$|E
25|$|Cekak <b>Musang</b> and Teluk Belanga are {{types of}} collar {{design for the}} male garment 'baju melayu'. It is said that Teluk Belanga was {{designed}} by Sultan Abu Bakar in 1866 to commemorate the shift of Johor's capital from Teluk Belanga to Johor Bahru. The Teluk Belanga design is a simple hemmed round collar with a stiff stitching called 'tulang belut' or 'eel's spine', with a loop at the end to fit a 'kancing'. This collar design creates an exposed neck {{in contrast to the}} neck-covering Cekak <b>Musang</b> design that is a raised stiff collar of about 1–2cm with an opening down to the chest. The collar ends have matching holes to fit buttons.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Cathay-Keris Films was formed. The studio, {{situated}} in out in East Coast Road, produced its own {{films in the}} Malay. These were former barracks occupied by the Japanese and were converted into processing labs, sound studios, offices and even a canteen. That year, Cathay-Keris produced Singapore's first colour film, Buloh Perindu. More than 100 films were made at Cathay Keris's studios between 1953 and 1973 including five Pontianak movies; Pontianak (1957), Dendam Pontianak (1957), Sumpah Pontianak (1958), Pontianak Kembali (1963) & Pontianak Gua <b>Musang</b> (1964). Sadly the first two classic Pontianak films are long lost.|$|E
500|$|Popular cultivars in Malaysia and Singapore (Singapore imports {{most of its}} durians from Malaysia {{hence the}} {{varieties}} are similar although there may be slight variation in the names) include [...] "D24" [...] which is a popular variety known for its bitter sweet taste; [...] "XO" [...] which has a pale color, thick flesh with a tinge of alcoholic fermentation; [...] "Chook Kiok" [...] (Cantonese meaning: bamboo leg) which has a distinctive yellowish core in the inner stem and [...] "Musang King" [...] ('musang' is the Malay word for civet cat) which is usually the priciest of all cultivars. <b>Musang</b> King {{is known for its}} bright yellow flesh and is almost like a more potent or enhanced version of the D24. This particular variety should be consumed last since it tends to make other durians taste bland in comparison.|$|E
500|$|Prices of durians are {{relatively}} high {{as compared with}} other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24(Sultan), and <b>Musang</b> King (Mao Shan Wang) has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit. With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15). The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "flesh" [...] or [...] "pulp", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit. Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about half a dozen of the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.|$|E

In former times, some children would be given [...] "bajang bracelets" [...] (gelang bajang) made of black silk to protect them against it, and sharp metal objects such as scissors would be placed near babies for the same purpose. Even the striations of pregnancy are somewhat jokingly said to be the scars left by a bajang's attack.|$|E
