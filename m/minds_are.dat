5|$|Pacific Rim is a 2013 American {{science fiction}} monster film {{directed}} by Guillermo del Toro and starring Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Burn Gorman, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. The screenplay {{was written by}} Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film {{is set in the}} future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal {{on the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas each controlled by at least two pilots, whose <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kaiju.|$|E
25|$|By {{contrast}} to drones, <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> {{orders of magnitude}} more powerful and intelligent than the Culture's other biological and artificial citizens. Typically they inhabit and act as the controllers of large-scale Culture hardware such as ships or space-based habitats. Unsurprisingly, given their duties, <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> tremendously powerful: capable of running all of the functions of a ship or habitat, while holding potentially billions of simultaneous conversations with the citizens that live aboard them. To allow them to perform at such a high degree, they exist partially in hyperspace to get around hindrances to computing power such as the speed of light.|$|E

The most commercially {{successful}} Scottish {{band of the}} 1980s, they have achieved five UK number one albums during their career and have sold over 70 million records worldwide. Despite various personnel changes, they continue to record and tour.|$|E

2500|$|The primary quality {{attributed}} to the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> that it {{is considered to be}} radiant, or luminous (Pali: “pabhassara”). Teachers in the forest tradition assert that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> an immutable reality and that the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> indestructible — that the mind simply “knows and does not die”. The <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> also a fixed-phenomenon (Pali: [...] "thiti-dhamma") — the mind itself does not “move” or follow out after its preoccupations, but rather receives them in place. Since the mind as a phenomenon often eludes attempts to define it, the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> often simply described in terms of its activities: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{events of}} Use of Weapons are {{an example of}} just how dirty Special Circumstances will play {{in order to get}} their way and the {{conspiracy}} {{at the heart of the}} plot of Excession demonstrates how at least some <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> prepared to risk killing sentient beings when they conclude that these actions are beneficial for the long term good. Special Circumstances represents a very small fraction of Contact, which itself is only a small fraction of the entire Culture, making it comparable again to size and influence of modern intelligence agencies.|$|E
25|$|As we {{have thus}} seen, any {{correlations}} {{seen in the}} wavefunction of each observer's <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> only concrete after interaction between the different polarizers. Even though the correlations {{on the level of}} individual minds correspond to the appearance of non-locality (or equivalently, violation of Bell's inequality). However, since the interactions only take place in individual minds they are local, since there is no real interaction between space-like separated events that could influence the minds of observers at two distant points. This, like the many worlds theory, makes the many-minds theory completely local.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the Culture {{can be seen}} as {{fundamentally}} hedonistic (one of the main objectives for any being, including Minds, is to have fun rather than to be 'useful'). Also, <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> constructed, by convention, to care for and value human beings. While a General Contact Unit (GCU) does not strictly need a crew (and could construct artificial avatars when it did), a real human crew adds richness to its existence, and offers distraction during otherwise dull periods. In Consider Phlebas it is noted that Minds still find humans fascinating, especially their odd ability to sometimes achieve similarly advanced reasoning as their much more complex machine brains.|$|E
5000|$|Upeksha {{as a power}} {{includes}} {{freedom from}} all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are - Sadangopeksha (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure), Brahma-wiharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all beings), Bowdyangopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all thoughts), Wiryopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected by the same force of determination), Sankharopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom), Wedanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> sensible to neither pleasure nor pain), Widarsanopeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> not affected by what is seen), Tatramadyastopeksha (when all modes of upeksha are applied together), Dhyanopeksha (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind)and Parisudi-upeksha (when the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first.|$|R

25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones. Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity. Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> products of natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's mental development.|$|E
25|$|The {{roots of}} Simple <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> in the {{short-lived}} punk band Johnny & The Self-Abusers, {{founded on the}} South Side of Glasgow in 1977. The band was conceived by would-be Glasgow scene-maker Alan Cairnduff, although he left the job of organising the band to his friend John Milarky. At Cairnduff’s suggestion, Milarky teamed up with two musicians he had never worked with before – budding singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill {{had known each other}} since the age of eight. After joining Johnny & The Self-Abusers, they brought in two of their school friends, Brian McGee on drums and Tony Donald on bass (all four had previously played together in the schoolboy band Biba-Rom!).|$|E
25|$|The Culture has {{achieved}} artificial intelligences where each Mind has thought processing capabilities many {{orders of magnitude}} beyond that of human beings, and data storage drives which, if written out on paper and stored in filing cabinets, would cover thousands of planets skyscraper high (as described by one Mind in Consider Phlebas). Yet it has managed to condense these entities to a volume of several dozen cubic metres (though much of the contents and the operating structure are continually in hyperspace). Minds also demonstrate reaction times and multitasking abilities orders of magnitude greater than any sentient being; armed engagements between Culture and equivalent technological civilizations sometimes occur in timeframes as short as microseconds, and standard Orbital <b>Minds</b> <b>are</b> capable of running all of the vital systems on the Orbital while simultaneously conversing with millions of the inhabitants and observing phenomena in the surrounding regions of space.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Mind,</b> in Buddhism, <b>is</b> also {{described}} as being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> space-like {{in the sense that}} it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In Mahayana Buddhism, <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> illusion-like {{in the sense that it}} is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being [...] "space and illusion" [...] and being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. <b>Mind</b> <b>is</b> not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.|$|R

25|$|In the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, Romana {{undergoes}} a second regeneration, {{and her new}} incarnation (Romana III, whose appearance was modelled on silent movie actress Louise Brooks) is far less sympathetic and far more ruthless than the other two. This third incarnation pursues the Eighth Doctor in a story arc relating to the Future War, a War between the Time Lords and an as-yet-unidentified enemy, seeking to use his new companion Compassion – who has been unintentionally mutated into a Type 102 TARDIS {{in the aftermath of}} the destruction of the Doctor's own ship – as breeding stock for the new sentient TARDISes in the Future War. With the Doctor refusing to allow the Time Lords to make Compassion a slave, he, Compassion and fellow companion Fitz Kreiner go on the run between The Shadows of Avalon and The Ancestor Cell, the final confrontation on board the Doctor's believed-destroyed original TARDIS resulting in the obliteration of Gallifrey and the apparent retroactive wiping out of the Time Lords from history. A flashback in the final Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Gallifrey Chronicles suggests that Romana is killed by Faction Paradox skulltroopers just before Gallifrey's destruction. However, it is hinted in Tomb of Valdemar by Simon Messingham that Romana may be one of a few Time Lords who survived this cataclysm, possibly in a fourth incarnation and The Gallifrey Chronicles itself suggests that the Doctor will eventually restore Gallifrey and all the dead Time Lords whose <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> stored in the Matrix, in time for its destruction again in the Time War.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the reasons}} Trimmer {{believed}} fairy tales were dangerous was because they led child readers into a fantasy world where adults could not follow and control their exposure to harmful experiences. She was just as horrified by the graphic illustrations included with some fairy tale collections, complaining that [...] "little children, whose <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> susceptible of every impression; and who from the liveliness of their imaginations are apt to convert into realities whatever forcibly strikes their fancy" [...] {{should not be allowed}} to see such scenes as Blue Beard hacking his wife's head off.|$|E

[...] As the dialogue unfolds, [...] "the difference of their thoughts and sentiments is however laid open, their <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> separated from each other by signs as plain and as little to be mistaken as the complexions of their husbands." ...|$|E
500|$|The Moon Matrix is {{introduced}} in Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More (2010), in which Icke {{suggests that the}} Earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the Moon, a spacecraft and inter-dimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the left hemisphere of the brain, which gives us our sense of reality: [...] "We {{are living in a}} dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon." [...] Unless people force themselves to become fully conscious, their <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> the Moon's mind.|$|E

500|$|In his judgement, {{issued on}} 16 November, Biron applied the Hicklin test of obscenity: a work was obscene if it tended to [...] "deprave and corrupt those whose <b>minds</b> <b>are</b> open to such immoral influences". He {{held that the}} book's {{literary}} merit was irrelevant because a well-written obscene book was even more harmful than a poorly written one. The topic in itself was not necessarily unacceptable; a book that depicted the [...] "moral and physical degradation which indulgence in those vices must necessary involve" [...] might be allowed, but no reasonable person could say that a plea for the recognition and toleration of inverts was not obscene. He ordered the book destroyed, with the defendants to pay court costs.|$|E
