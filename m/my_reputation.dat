The book was published on July 11, 2003, only 12 days after Hepburn's death. It spent 11 weeks on the New York Times Nonfiction Best Seller list, but received uneasy critical response. In The New York Times, Robert Gottlieb called it an [...] "odd and unsettling book [...] a sense of exploitation", and gossip columnist Liz Smith, a friend of Hepburn's, called Berg [...] "vain and narcissistic", and declared the book [...] "elf-promoting fakery....Hepburn would have despised it and his betrayal of her friendship." [...] Berg responded in a written statement, {{saying that he was}} [...] "truly shocked at Liz Smith's professional behaviour — or, more accurately, her lack thereof" [...] in [...] "her personal assault on <b>my</b> <b>reputation,</b> one that stops just short of character assassination".|$|E

2500|$|While Denis O'Brien {{is often}} newsworthy, the Sunday Independent has paid {{particular}} attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media.

Shamrock responded to his critics in an interview: [...] "I trained three fighters that were the first three (UFC) Middleweight Champions: Jerry Bohlander, Guy Mezger and Frank Shamrock. And I’ve trained dozens of guys to be champs in other organizations. In Pancrase, I had eight fighters in the top ten at one point.

2500|$|Hutton {{responded to}} these criticisms in a 2010 paper {{entitled}} [...] "Writing the History of Witchcraft: A Personal View", published in [...] Hutton {{was critical of}} Whitmore's work, characterising it {{as an attempt to}} [...] "destroy <b>my</b> <b>reputation</b> as an authority upon the history of Paganism and witchcraft, at least among Pagans, and especially belief in the arguments of Triumph." [...] Noting that Whitmore [...] "makes no attempt to construct an alternate history" [...] to that presented in Triumph, Hutton accuses Whitmore of carrying out [...] "very little research" [...] into primary source material, instead basing his arguments on [...] "secondary texts of varying quality". Contesting some of Whitmore's claims, Hutton then criticises Whitmore's final chapter, which he calls a [...] "meanspirited" [...] collection of [...] "every criticism that {{he has been able to}} find of anything that I have written." [...] He went on to challenge Whitmore on this, asking why his work in Triumph of the Moon had not been criticised by [...] "leading figures of British and American Paganism" [...] and by [...] "professional historians, archaeologists, anthropologists, classicists, and literary experts" [...] if it had been as flawed as Whitmore claims.|$|E
2500|$|Romoşan, who {{had earlier}} denied {{involvement}} with the Securitate, claimed that Negoiţescu had actually both been recruited as an agent since their release from prison in the 1960s, and had spied for the Securitate's foreign bureau during his time in Germany. Speaking after Corlăţan's article, he admitted having functioned as a Securitate informer, but not before 1987, when his wife, writer Adina Kenereş, was threatened with losing her travel privileges. He indicated that his signature on any other such documents was obtained {{with the use of}} violence and intimidation. He argued: [...] "I presently think that I was being used by the Securitate, which destroyed <b>my</b> <b>reputation</b> in order to provide Negoiţescu with a cover", and claims that Negoiţescu himself apologized to him for [...] "all the harm" [...] during a chance meeting in the early 1990s. According to Nistorescu's assessment: [...] "When the threads of Negoiţescu's file will come loose, perhaps I'll understand something from [...] adventure." [...] In contrast, Morar and Ştefan Agopian both assessed that Romoşan's own flight abroad was part of a Securitate diversion. Literary critic Dan C. Mihăilescu gave Romoşan's claims {{the benefit of the doubt}} and urged for the Negoiţescu file to be publicized in its entirety, but also asserted that Romoşan had lost his credibility.|$|E

2500|$|Griffith—indignant at the film's {{negative}} critical reception—wrote {{letters to}} newspapers and published a pamphlet {{in which he}} accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. [...] Griffith's 1916 pamphlet The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America used racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted [...] "censorship" [...] as a monstrous black man with a lascivious {{expression on his face}} eyeing [...] "free speech" [...] who appeared as a white woman dressed in a white dress. [...] "Free Speech" [...] points at [...] "Censorship" [...] and says: [...] "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!". In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship [...] "this malignant pygmy" [...] who had mutated into a fully grown [...] "Caliban" [...] (a character from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest who is often depicted as a black man). When Sherwin Lewis of The New York Globe wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few [...] "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that [...] "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was [...] "damaging <b>my</b> <b>reputation</b> as a producer" [...] and [...] "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, Intolerance (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.|$|E
