5|$|Beecher's Handmade Cheese is an artisan cheesemaker {{and retail}} shop with {{locations}} in the Pike Place Market, Seattle, Washington and New York City's Flatiron District. The company was founded by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003 and opened in the Pike Place Market after Dammeier obtained a difficult to obtain storefront lease in the <b>Market.</b> <b>Because</b> Dammeier {{had never been a}} cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{with the}} IG Farben {{conglomerate}} dismantled {{because of its}} {{central role in the}} Nazi regime, Sterling Products bought half of Bayer Ltd, the British Bayer subsidiary—the other half of which it already owned. However, Bayer Aspirin made up {{only a small fraction of}} the British aspirin <b>market</b> <b>because</b> of competition from Aspro, Disprin (a soluble aspirin drug) and other brands. Bayer Ltd began searching for new pain relievers to compete more effectively. After several moderately successful compound drugs that mainly utilized aspirin (Anadin and Excedrin), Bayer Ltd's manager Laurie Spalton ordered an investigation of a substance that scientists at Yale had, in 1946, found to be the metabolically active derivative of acetanilide: acetaminophen. After clinical trials, Bayer Ltd brought acetaminophen to market as Panadol in 1956.|$|E

Braathens had contacted British Airways, but they had stated {{that they did not}} wish to purchase Braathens. The deal with SAS was initiated by Braathens; they stated that this would allow the two companies to cooperate to eliminate the overcapacity in the domestic <b>market.</b> <b>Because</b> both airlines operated a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, about NOK150 million could be saved in maintenance. The agreement also involved that Malmö Aviation would have to be sold before the take-over. If not, the Braathens family would purchase the airline for NOK1. At the same time, the family-owned companies guaranteed for about NOK1 billion in the Swedish subsidiary.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio <b>market</b> <b>because</b> of concerns the takeover {{may not be}} in the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to <b>market,</b> <b>because</b> its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
