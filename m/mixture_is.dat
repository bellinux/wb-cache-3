40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to use Direct Coal Liquefaction Residue (DLCR) to modify the asphalt binders and mixtures and to evaluate the performance of modified asphalt mixtures. The dynamic modulus and phase angle of DCLR and DCLR-composite modified asphalt <b>mixture</b> <b>were</b> analyzed, and the viscoelastic properties of these modified asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> compared to the base asphalt binder SK- 90 and Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene (SBS) modified asphalt mixtures. The master curves of the asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> shown, and dynamic and viscoelastic behaviors of asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> described using the Christensen-Anderson-Marasteanu (CAM) model. The test {{results show that the}} dynamic moduli of DCLR and DCLR-composite asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>are</b> higher than those of the SK- 90 and SBS modified asphalt mixtures. Based on the viscoelastic parameters of CAM models of the asphalt mixtures, the high- and low-temperature performance of DLCR and DCLR-composite modified asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>are</b> obviously better than the SK- 90 and SBS modified asphalt mixtures. In addition, the DCLR and DCLR-composite modified asphalt <b>mixtures</b> <b>are</b> more insensitive to the frequency compared to SK- 90 and SBS modified asphalt mixtures...|$|R
30|$|Sediment {{samples were}} first {{air-dried}} in the laboratory, {{after which they}} were digested according to the procedures prescribed by the AOAC (1990).

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} used to {{separate}} potassium salts from sodium and magnesium compounds. The most-used method is fractional precipitation using the solubility differences of the salts at different temperatures. Electrostatic separation of the ground salt <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> also used in some mines. The resulting sodium and magnesium waste is either stored underground or piled up in slag heaps. Most of the mined potassium mineral ends up as potassium chloride after processing. The mineral industry refers to potassium chloride either as potash, muriate of potash, or simply MOP.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to high {{temperature}} weak stability of common asphalt mixture, rutting tests of diatomite modified asphalt mixture, modified lake asphalt mixture, modified rock asphalt mixture and common asphalt <b>mixture</b> <b>are</b> carried out.

5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} gunpowder formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.|$|E
5|$|The ferric {{chloride}} test {{is a traditional}} colorimetric test for phenols, which uses a 1% iron(III) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO(OH) is formed. The <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> filtered before use. The organic substance is dissolved in water, methanol or ethanol, then the neutralised iron(III) chloride solution is added—a transient or permanent coloration (usually purple, green or blue) indicates {{the presence of a}} phenol or enol.|$|E
40|$|Free {{energies}} and correlation functions of liquid and solid hard-sphere (HS) <b>mixtures</b> <b>are</b> calculated using the fundamental measure density functional theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} in the diploma work {{was to determine the}} characteristisc of fresh concrete and mechanical properties of hardened concrete for one highly flowable and two self-compacting concrete mixtures. Self-compacting concrete <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> prepared from two types of aggregates, chrused aggregate and the natural river gravel, both with added limestone powder. Highly flowable <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> prepared with chrused aggregate and with fly ash, which replaced part of the cement.

Properties of fresh self-compacting <b>mixtures</b> <b>were</b> evaluated by slump-flow test and L-box test. Compressive and tensile tests were cerried out on hardened concrete specimens of age 7 and 28 days. We also evaluated the stress-strain relationship at uniaxial compression and modulus of elasticity. From the tests results, we evaluated the influence of different types of aggregates and different types of added powder particles on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete...|$|R
5|$|When a {{compound}} has limited {{solubility in water}} it is common practice (in the pharmaceutical industry, for example) to determine pKa values in a solvent mixture such as water/dioxane or water/methanol, in which the compound is more soluble. In the example shown at the right, the pKa value rises steeply with increasing percentage of dioxane as the dielectric constant of the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Acid {{digestion}} is a two-stage process, {{involving the}} use of up to 93% sulfuric acid at 210–230°C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300°C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot {{be added to the}} acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200°C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> then cooled to 70°C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.|$|E
5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, {{but they also have}} a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the hot gas manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the hot gas manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited.

5|$|Sundews are characterised by the glandular tentacles, {{topped with}} sticky secretions, that cover their laminae. The {{trapping}} and digestion mechanism usually employs {{two types of}} glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup (the latter glands are missing in some species, such as D.erythrorhiza). Small prey, mainly consisting of insects, are attracted by the sweet secretions of the peduncular glands. Upon touching these, the prey become entrapped by sticky mucilage which prevents their progress or escape. Eventually, the prey either succumb to death through exhaustion or through asphyxiation as the mucilage envelops them and clogs their spiracles. Death usually occurs within 15 minutes. The plant meanwhile secretes esterase, peroxidase, phosphatase and protease enzymes. These enzymes dissolve the insect and free the nutrients contained within it. This nutrient <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> then absorbed through the leaf surfaces {{to be used by}} the rest of the plant.|$|E
