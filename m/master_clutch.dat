50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet <b>master</b> <b>clutch,</b> a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the reverse gears are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 reverse gears (1x3x4). Note that the top three reverse gears are not available for use.|$|E

50|$|Adam {{is the old}} {{faithful}} servant {{of the family of}} Sir Rowland de Boys, who spent four-score years in the family with unflinching devotion to his master. His loyalty to the old master is evidenced by the touching reference to the dead master when Oliver calls him an old dog. He loves Orlando, becausehe is the image and 'memory of old Sir Rowland'. He places all the savings of his thrifty life and faces all unknown perils {{to save the life of}} the young <b>master</b> from the <b>clutches</b> of the cruel brother. Thus Adam has the 'soul of a servant to him'.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the light car range, the Rapier's front {{suspension}} was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A brake servo became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new diaphragm clutch and new <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinder brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{two high}} flow, high modulus fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for automotive and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness and high strength. These materials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration welding, etc.) and mechanical performance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep). The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto mirror housing brackets, <b>clutch</b> pedals, <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinders, ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms. In Part I of this paper, we are presenting results of reinforcement analysis with {{the influence of}} level of loading and geometrical parameters of used fiber-glass.

ABSTRACT: The report of investigation of the wear behaviour of aluminium alloy samples used in the floating calliper of <b>master</b> cylinder <b>clutch</b> or brake is presented in this paper. As-received commercial aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile hydraulic brake cylinder calliper was melted in electric furnace under a controlled atmosphere, and sand cast at pouring temperature range of 700 - 800 oC into rod of 300 mm long by 30 mm diameter. A wear jig {{was used to determine}} the wear resistance of the aluminium samples with and without the use of hydraulic fluid. The microstructures and surface of the as-received and cast specimen were examined under high resolution microscope to assess the effects of wear with and without hydraulic oil. It was observed that the aluminium sample wears faster in the absent of hydraulic fluid and was reduced to a bearable minimum when hydraulic fluid was applied. The results obtained are presented in figures showing the wear rates and weight loss of the aluminium samples with respect to the wear cycle, from which models equations are derived. The test results show that eutectic structured cast aluminium alloy behaves relatively better than the as-received aluminium alloy specimen in oil. It is significant that the oil functions as lubricant on the alloy under test, hence the common deteriorations experience from the cast alloy under service must have aggravated from the chemical adulterations in the oil wherewith a thin film of more wear and chemical resistance would bring effective and significant wear and corrosio...|$|R
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to negative earth and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|R
50|$|Lotus used {{a variety}} of parts from other cars to reduce {{development}} costs. Esprits built before 1993 used many British Leyland parts while those built after 1993 had many GM (Vauxhall, Opel) parts. Door handles from the Morris Marina/Austin Allegro were used until the S4 model in 1994 when GM Calibra door handles were used. Early cars used a Momo steering wheel, while later ones had the same wheel as the Pontiac Trans Am. Headlight lift motors came from the Pontiac Fiero. The aerial mount and whip on the S4 and V8 was the same as the GM Calibra and Tigra. The side mirrors were from the Citroën CX. Non-SE fog lamps from about 1989 were GM Astra MK1. The fan motors came from the Ford Fiesta Mk2. The alternator on the V8 models was a standard GM unit also found in the V6 Opel Omega B and the earlier Lotus Carlton/Omega, which also provided interior plastic fittings such as door handles and steering column covering. The <b>clutch</b> <b>master</b> and slave cylinders on 1998 and newer models were Girling parts shared with the series 2A Land Rover. The S1 and S2 shared some front suspension components with the Opel Ascona. The GT3's Brembo front brake pads were the same as on a Fiat Coupé Turbo or a Peugeot 406 3.0 V6. The SE's fuel pump was from the Renault Fuego.|$|R
5000|$|Masters made a {{claim that}} {{his version of the}} full nelson hold, which he dubbed the Master Lock, was unbreakable. Masters began a series of {{contests}} he would call [...] "Master Lock Challenges" [...] where Masters would put an opponent in the Master Lock and the opponent would try to break free before Masters made him submit or pass out. Masters would go on to log more full nelson submission victories than any wrestler in WWE history, breaking the record previously held by Kurt Angle. Originally he would call out plants from the crowd, placing a $1,000 prize of his own money to be paid to anyone who could break free from the Master Lock. At Backlash, he defeated Melissa Coates in a Master Lock Challenge. He engaged in feuds with lower-card wrestlers, Val Venis and Sgt. Slaughter, who both failed to break the Master Lock. Using villainous tactics, he often attacked the wrestlers beforehand and frequently cheated (for example using a low-blow to escape Sgt. Slaughter's cobra <b>clutch).</b> <b>Masters</b> increased the offered reward each week up to $20,000 and sometimes threw in a bonus. After defeating the 400-pound Rosey on July 18, Masters defiantly stated [...] "it doesn't matter how big they are!", prompting The Big Show to accept a Master Lock Challenge. In accordance with his villainous persona, Masters fled, refusing a match with the Big Show.|$|R
