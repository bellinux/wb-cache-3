25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. <b>My</b> <b>fears</b> of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|The work progressed slowly, {{hampered}} by the partially submerged nature of the site, violent storms that wracked the area, {{and the fact that}} preparatory work had to be done away from the building site. During construction, a particularly violent storm hit the construction site, sweeping away much of the iron framework intended to support the stone shell of the lighthouse. Captain Alexander was discouraged, reportedly saying, [...] "If wrought iron won't stand it, I have <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> about a stone tower." [...] Those fears were allayed when news reached Alexander that the damage had been due to a ship striking the lighthouse, rather than from just the storm alone. Work recommenced on building the lighthouse, and the final stone was laid on June 29, 1860, five years after Alexander and his workmen first landed at the ledge. The final cost of about $300,000 made {{it one of the most}} expensive lighthouses in United States history.|$|E
500|$|To Steinhauer's {{apparent}} surprise, Lody appeared nonchalant {{about the}} danger {{that he was about}} to go into. [...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German can do more than that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me and told me <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E

500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Moyers interviewed Collins, Cash, {{opera singer}} Jessye Norman, Appalachian folk {{musician}} Jean Ritchie and her family, white Sacred Harp singers in Georgia, black Sacred Harp singers in Alabama, and a prison choir at the Texas State Penitentiary at Huntsville. Collins, Cash, and Norman {{were unable to}} discern if {{the power of the}} song came from the music or the lyrics. Norman, who once notably sang it {{at the end of a}} large outdoor rock concert for Nelson Mandela's 70th birthday, stated, [...] "I don't know whether it's the text I don't know whether we're talking about the lyrics when we say that it touches so many people or whether it's that tune that everybody knows." [...] A prisoner interviewed by Moyers explained his literal interpretation of the second verse: [...] "'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> relieved" [...] by saying that the fear became immediately real to him when he realized he may never get his life in order, compounded by the loneliness and restriction in prison. Gospel singer Marion Williams summed up its effect: [...] "That's a song that gets to everybody".|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak {{noted that}} Beyoncé [...] "ecstatically and hyperactively" [...] changes keys four {{times during the}} entire song. As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush, she {{constantly}} sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past, this being illustrated in lyrics such as, [...] "after fighting through <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> [...] finally you've put me first." [...] The chorus, complimented with sweet backing harmonies, then arrives, with Beyoncé chanting, [...] "Baby it's you, you're the one I love / You're the one I need / You're the only one I see / Come on baby it's you / You're the one that gives your all / You're the one I can always call / When I need you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top." [...] The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes, proceeding to D♭, then to D, E♭ and finally to [...] E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that [...] "the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder-reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes." [...] In this way, the word [...] "baby" [...] is said about 24 times throughout the song. As soon as the synthesizers drop out, the song fades out almost instantaneously.|$|E
5000|$|Erich Fromm contends that, [...] "The term 'the unconscious' is {{actually}} a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as I am guilty of doing in these pages). There {{is no such thing}} as the unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, of which we are unconscious. If I hate a man because I am afraid of him, and if I am aware of my hate but not of <b>my</b> <b>fear,</b> we may say that my hate is conscious and that <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> is unconscious; still <b>my</b> <b>fear</b> does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious." ...|$|R

500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at <b>my</b> <b>fears,</b> our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E
2500|$|Whitman {{met with}} Dr. Maurice Dean Heatly, the staff {{psychiatrist}} at the University of Texas Health Center, on March 29, 1966. Whitman {{referred to his}} visit with Heatly in his final suicide note, writing, [...] "I talked with a Doctor once {{for about two hours}} and tried to convey to him <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> that I felt come [...] overwhelming violent impulses. After one visit, I never saw the Doctor again, and since then have been fighting my mental turmoil alone, and seemingly to no avail." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 she {{produced}} a {{show at the}} Boesky Gallery featuring elderly women posed in ornate costumes and wigs. She painted them in oils on ovals of glass and had them photographed. Her inspiration for the set of pieces was Miss Havisham from Great Expectations. She told an interview that being pregnant at the time, [...] "I guess I was thinking about mortality, feminine beauty, <b>my</b> <b>fears</b> about being a mother and an artist." [...] An ArtForum reviewer noted that the costume and pose of one drawing was a [...] "nearly identical copy" [...] of a Feinstein photograph in a Marc Jacobs advertisement {{from the year before}} and that the elderly model in fact looked much like Ms. Feinstein might look when she aged. The reviewer wrote the [...] "(self-)portraits" [...] felt [...] "in line with the current vogue for noble iconography" [...] and also described them as [...] "celebratory caricatures, self-indulgent and vain." [...] She also criticized the one foam and three wood sculptures from the exhibition as [...] "merely clunky hybrids of kitschy Cubism and craft." ...|$|E
