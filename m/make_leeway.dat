40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} building modeling and energy simulations in the design process  of  a  building.   The  take-off  point  is  the  notion  of  energy  simulations  being needed early and throughout the building design process, and {{that the lack of}} energy simulations may be {{explained by the fact that}} they are time consuming and therefore often too expensive. A greater interoperability between software tools used by relevant disciplines,  such  as  the  architect  and  the  energy  specialist,  would  create  smoother workflows, which would reduce this cost and open up for more frequent and iterative energy  simulation  processes.   The  study  is  an  assessment  of  the  modeling  tool  Revit and  the  simulation  tool  Virtual  Environment  and  whether  they  can  create  smoother workflows, and <b>make</b> <b>leeway</b> for a more frequent use of energy simulations throughout the  design  process.   It  also  investigates  the  limitations  of  what  can  be  examined  by simulations in Virtual Environment. This will hopefully help clarify the future role of energy  simulations  in  design  processes.   The  method  is  a  trial  by  error  approach  of testing the two software tools by building and simulating a model. The results of these tests  show  that  the  workflow  is  not  optimal  (and  therefore  time  consuming)   for frequent  and  iterative simulations  throughout the  design  process,  but  it  also  reveals some  great  possibilities  of  what  can  be  performed  with  these  two  powerful  tools  at hand.   Further  development  with  regards  on  platform  independency  of  the  building information  model,  including  seamless  exporting  and  importing,  seems  necessary  to strengthen the future role of energy simulations...|$|E

60|$|In the {{old days}} the navigators used to strive {{as far south as}} 64 degrees or 65 degrees, into the Antarctic drift ice, hoping, in a favouring spell, to make westing at a prodigious rate across the extreme-narrowing wedges of longitude. But of late years all shipmasters have {{accepted}} the hugging of the land all the way around. Out of ten times ten thousand passages of Cape Stiff from east to west, this, they have concluded, is the best strategy. So Captain West hugs the land. He heaves-to on the port tack until the leeward drift brings the land into perilous proximity, then wears ship and heaves-to on the port tack and <b>makes</b> <b>leeway</b> off shore.|$|R

Nancy's mainsail split {{and the ship}} could <b>make</b> no <b>leeway.</b> Everything on board was washed overboard and then the ship struck a small sandy beach between two headlands. The ship promptly broke up with one crew member, Richard Wall, from Exeter, drowning. The remaining crew walked to Sydney, arriving on 1 May 1805.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is the ubiquitous topic in shipping today. However, {{it had been}} neglected for numerous reasons. Now that environmental protection and cost-cutting have rightly come into focus, bunker consumption has become a target of optimization measures. It is now to the shipping industry to <b>make</b> up <b>leeway</b> and to <b>make</b> energy consumption manageable. To make energy consumption manageable means to make it measureable. This involves consisted data collection on board, data transfer to shore and a solid database that stores this valuable resource. Using a performance monitoring tool, employees on shore and onboard crew could be able to analyse and to evaluate current bunker consumption with the aim to reveal saving potentials. The gained information could be helpful to various departments and give answers on different questions within liner shipping organisations. This study examines the implications of bunker consumption monitoring system in liner shipping at the example of Hapag-Lloyd. The status quo of performance monitoring at Hapag-Lloyd and the already available consumption data are analysed. Furthermore {{is the need for}} bunker consumption monitoring evaluated and a potential target state presented...|$|R

"Then I {{will come}} again or, {{if you want}} me before that, send for me," [...] and the first mate went out on deck again, for though well skilled to handle a ship in all weathers, and as brave and hardy a seaman as sailed out of Plymouth, James Standing could neither read nor write; and though in a rough sort of way he could reckon the course a ship should lie, and <b>make</b> {{allowance}} for <b>leeway</b> and currents and baffling winds, and could bring a ship into any port in England or the Low Countries, he was of no use in a matter of this kind.|$|R
60|$|Our voyage {{during the}} next two weeks was most {{interesting}} and prosperous. The breeze continued generally fair, and at all times enabled us to lie our course; for being, as I have said before, clipper-built, the pirate schooner could lie very close to the wind and <b>make</b> little <b>leeway.</b> We had no difficulty now in managing our sails, for Jack was heavy and powerful, while Peterkin was active as a kitten. Still, however, we were a very insufficient crew for such a vessel; and if any one had proposed to us to make such a voyage in it before we had been forced to go through so many hardships from necessity, we would have turned away with pity from the individual making such proposal as from a madman. I pondered this a good deal, and at last concluded that men do not know how much they are capable of doing till they try, and that we should never give way to despair in any undertaking, however difficult it may seem--always supposing, however, that our cause is a good one, and that we can ask the Divine blessing on it.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{measurement}} problem of Quantum Mechanics, non-unitary time evolution has been derived from the unitarity of standard quantum formalism. New wave functions of free and non-free quantum systems follow from Schroedinger equation after inserting an ansatz. Quantum systems show up as probability waves before measurement. A pure entangled state of a composite system evolves non-unitarily, only to disentangle itself into a definite state after reduction at the measurement point. A classical space-time point is created momentarily in this event. Unitarity is restored at that point. The non-Hermitian observables defined {{in the domain of}} rigged Hilbert space transform into Hermitian ones at the measurement point. The problem of preferred basis is resolved by the requirement of specifying the position of measurement point. Two theorems prove that time is a non-Hermitian operator, thus placing space and time on an equal footing. Bound states are found to need discrete space-time, which supports its use in loop quantum gravity. Non-unitarity in the theory helps buttress the no-boundary proposal; and uncertainty relation <b>makes</b> a <b>leeway</b> to singularity-free Quantum Cosmology. Quantum Mechanics also accommodates complex and negative probabilities. Comment: 40 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} rising income {{inequality}} does not only gain in relevance {{since the two}} prominent reports by the OECD (Growing unequal? Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries, Paris 2008; Divided we stand 2 ̆ 014 Why inequality keeps rising, Paris 2011) but rather since the financial crisis. So far there is only scarce empirical evidence 2 ̆ 013 besides a rather broad literature dealing with the US 2 ̆ 013 {{about the consequences of}} the financial crisis on income inequality in Europe (e. g. Jenkins et al. in The Great Recession and the distribution of household income, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2013) and more important about wealth inequality (Lundberg and Waldenstr 6 m in Paper presented at the 4. SEEK conference, Mannheim 2014). In this paper we focus on the short-term distributional effects in Germany, as this country was one of the OECD countries which had been hit hardest 2 ̆ 014 as measured by a decline in GDP 2 ̆ 014 by the Great Recession in 2008 / 2009. The underlying data source comes from the German Socio Economic Panel which is a representative longitudinal survey of private households in Germany. This survey provides consistent yearly information about incomes since 1984 and for wealth in at least three survey years. Thus, we are able to identify any potential effects of the financial crisis on incomes (e. g. earnings, market income, post-government income) and wealth components (e. g. property, business assets, financial assets, net worth) and their respective inequality in Germany. Our main finding is that we do not find any significant distributional changes during the Great Recession. However, the Great Recession temporary froze the income structure while afterwards income mobility tries to <b>make</b> up <b>leeway.</b> Findings of a factor decomposition showed as expected that the relative contribution of capital income to overall inequality lost in relevance during the Great recession. Several factors attenuated the impact of the Great Recession and will be discussed in detail. The final publication is available at Springer via [URL]...|$|R
60|$|Of course, therefore, all the {{ordinary}} unscientific conceptions of how plants feed are absolutely erroneous. Vegetable physiology, indeed, got beyond these conceptions a good hundred years ago. But {{it usually takes}} a hundred years for {{the world at large}} to <b>make</b> up its <b>leeway.</b> Trees don't suck up their nutriment by the roots, they don't derive their food from the soil, they don't need to be fed, like babies through a tube, with terrestrial solids. The solitary instance of an orchid hung up by a string in a conservatory on a piece of bark, ought to be sufficient at once to dispel for ever this strange illusion--if people ever thought; but of course they don't think--I mean Other People. The true mouths and stomachs of plants are not {{to be found in the}} roots, but in the green leaves; their true food is not sucked up from the soil, but is inhaled through tiny channels from the air; the mass of their material is carbon, as we can all see visibly to the naked eye when a log of wood is reduced to charcoal: and that carbon the leaves themselves drink in, by a thousand small green mouths, from the atmosphere around them.|$|R
40|$|Brazil’s largest city, São Paulo, faces a huge housing deficit. Many {{people are}} {{affected}} by the housing problem, and the demand for decent housing is high. The roofless movement in São Paulo is extensive, and has been since it emerged {{in the beginning of the}} 1980 s. Hundreds of thousands of people are organized in or affiliated with the movement. Their main repertoire is occupying buildings and land to pressure the local government to prioritize social housing projects. Recently the movement has had an upswing in activity; the number of occupations has tripled during mayor Fernando Haddad’s (PT) term. This thesis explores the roofless movement in São Paulo and its root causes, characteristics and challenges. It shows that the massive and persistent socio-economic inequality contributes to explain the prevalence of the roofless movement. It also looks into the internal fragmentation, and goes in depth on two roofless organizations within the movement; the Roofless Workers Movement – Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem-Teto (MTST) and the Roofless Movement of São Paulo – Movimento Sem-Teto do São Paulo (MSTS). Even though they belong to the same social movement, they differ on a range of characteristics, one of them being political affiliation. Historically the roofless movement has had strong ties to the Worker’s Party PT. This thesis looks into how some roofless organizations have found new political allies, and how this affects the movement as a whole. There have been few studies on roofless organizations with bonds to the political right. This study gives new insight on this issue. Currently, the movement faces a range of challenges, both towards the external environment, and internally within the movement. Lack of political <b>leeway</b> <b>makes</b> progress on the housing issue slow, and fragmentation within the movement may in the long-term lead to a weakening of the movement’s demands. This thesis goes in depth on these challenges; it aims to deepen the understanding of an important social movement – the roofless movement in São Paulo. M-I...|$|R
5000|$|... "HUME LEAGUE. LAVINGTON PREMIERS. BETHANGA OVERWHELMED IN ROUGH GAME.From {{start to}} finish {{there was only one}} team in it. Furthermore on various {{occasions}} blows were struck, and in one instance, the umpire, who rushed in to stop a melee, was violently thrown aside. Tripping and elbowing, which appeared deliberate, was an order of the day, and only on rare occasions was good and systematic play in evidence. By way of comparison, this match was miles behind the first semi final played on the same ground between Bethanga and Walbundrie the three weeks previously. Lavington won the toss, {{and with the help of}} a strong breeze blowing diagonally across the ground soon had Bethanga in difficulties. The side was on the defense throughout the quarter, and failed to score. Opening with several behinds L. O’Connell then kicked two goals, which were followed by a string of seven behinds. Only on one occasion did the ball cross the centerline in Bethanga’s favor. Rough and congested play excluded good football, and the game was held up several times in order to quell disturbances caused by pugilistic encounters. At the change Lavington led by 21 points to nil. It was expected that with the wind in its favor, Bethanga would <b>make</b> up the <b>leeway</b> in the second quarter, but supporters were disappointed when Lavington quickly added three goals to their score (T Farley-1 goal, Rowley Gulson-2 goals). Play was again interrupted by fighting and when the goal umpire fell over a boy who got in his road, he was unable to signal the score, and play ceased for about 10 minutes to give way to arguments and explanations. Order being restored, play was resumed and Bethanga seemed to wake up. Wally Butler kicked two goals and several behinds gave them more points. Then the game swerved in Lavingtons favor again, and with the help of 4 behinds and a goal by Jack Livermore, they led by 35 points at half time. Although Bethanga opened the third quarter well, and early scored several points they were for the most part defending desperately and were unable to add further to their tally. Lavington was now definitely on top, and did as it liked. By adding 4 goals (Jack Livermore 2 goals, T Farley, Spud Prater 1 goal each) and eight behinds, they drew away from their opponents, who were beaten in the ruck, in the air, in fact anywhere. The issue was no more in doubt, and the players, realizing that the game was won and lost, managed to keep their ruffled tempers in check. As in the previous quarter Bethanga again scored first in the last term. Wally Butler raised the two flags. Rowley Gulson replied with a sixer, and Tom Barnett gave Bethanga another goal. W. Dawson, T. Farley and L. O’Connell in turn kicked correctly, and Tom Barnett once more gave Bethanga a goal. Three goals by Lavington (Jack Livermore, Spud Prater, Harold McIntosh) made the margin still wider, and large numbers had already left the ground when the final bell proclaimed Lavington premiers of the Hume League for 1938.The scores: first quarter, Lavington 2-9 Bethanga nil. Second quarter, Lavington 6-13 Bethanga 2-2. third quarter, Lavington 10-21 Bethanga 2-4. Final scores. Lavington, 17 goals 23 behinds (125 points). Bethanga, 5-6 (36 points). Goal kickers-Lavington.
