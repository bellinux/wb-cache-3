25|$|On October 23, 1891 a {{group of}} {{entrepreneurs}} obtain a 10-year permit to build the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company {{on the banks of}} the North Saskatchewan River. The Edmonton Electrical Lighting and Power Company became a <b>municipally</b> <b>owned</b> <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> in 1902, then the Electrical Distribution and Power Plant departments combined to form Edmonton Power in 1970. Electrical generation capacity was also expanded in 1970 with the coal fired Clover Bar Generating Station construction. Within the next eight years, another three units are added, bringing the combined generating capacity of the Clover bar and Rossdale generating stations to 1050 megawatts by 1979. Expansion occurred again in 1989 with the first Genesee unit is operating at full load and in 1994 with a second Genesee unit to a total capacity of both units to 850 megawatts. Electricity generated at Genesee was made commercially available through the Alberta Interconnected Grid in the early 1990s. EPCOR was formed from the merger of Edmonton's municipal natural gas, power and water utilities in 1996 and converted into a public company in 2006. Then EPCOR Utilities Inc. spun off its power generation business to create Capital Power Corporation in 2009.|$|E

By 1893, {{it was the largest}} woolen mill west of Philadelphia. In 1897, a generator was installed, producing the first electricity in the town. In 1901, the city contracted an electric plant with steam engines running two 75 kW generators, and in 1909 the Cedarburg Electric Light Commission was formed to run the utility. In 1923, responsibility for water and sewerage was given to the utility, and it was renamed the Light & Water Commission.

40|$|Owensboro Municipal Utilities (OMU) is a <b>municipally</b> <b>owned</b> and {{operated}} <b>electric</b> <b>utility</b> based in Owensboro, Kentucky. OMU’s Elmer Smith Station is a coal-burning facility {{consisting of two}} units (one cyclone and one T-fired) with a combined capacity of 425 MW. It is under continuous pressure to reliably and cost-effectively deliver electricity to its ratepayer owners. OMU believes that to improve the plant’s profitability, it needs to improve its ability to understand the financial impacts of its operational and maintenance actions. The plant had invested in instrumentation, control and data systems (e. g. Metso DCS, Black and Veatch’s Online Performance Monitoring (OPM) system, OSIsoft PI data historian, and Invensys AvantisPro CMMS), but it was having difficulty extracting the knowledge necessary to make financially-motivated decisions. To that end, OMU invested in NeuCo, Inc. ’s integrated performance, maintenance and profit optimization systems, to enable the plant to perform comprehensive, real-time cost and revenue analyses and determine opportunities for improving profitability. The system brings together process, fuels, and maintenance data so plant personnel can better understand the impacts of their actions and decisions, and prioritize their wor...|$|R

40|$|Cities {{continue}} to struggle to provide the level {{of goods and services}} demanded by their residents while federal and state support dwindles. One proposal for resolving this dilemma is privatization because it is assumed that the private sector is more efficient, at least {{partly as a result of}} more readily adopting efficiency enhancing techniques such as TQM. The electric power industry provides an excellent comparison between the public and private sectors because its units of input and output are easily quantifiable in standard terms, and meaningful measures of efficiency can be developed. This study uses data from a comprehensive survey of Florida’s electric power enterprises to determine the extent of TQM imple-mentation; whether TQM has enhanced productivity; and whether there are measurable differences in efficiency between the state’s private and public sector power producers.
