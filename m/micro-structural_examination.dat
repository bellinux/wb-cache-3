40|$|The {{development}} of the fabrication technology of macro-brush configuration of tungsten (W) and carbon (graphite and CFC) plasma facing components (PFCs) for ITER like tokamak application is presented. The fabrication of qualified joint of PFC is a requirement for fusion tokamak. Vacuum brazing method has been employed for joining of W/CuCrZr and C/CuCrZr. Oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper casting onWtiles was performed followed by machining, polishing and ultrasonic cleaning of the samples prior to vacuum brazing. The W/CuCrZr and graphite/CuCrZr based test mockups were vacuum brazed using silver free alloys. The mechanical shear and tensile strengths were evaluated for the W/CuCrZr and graphite/CuCrZr brazed joint samples. The <b>micro-structural</b> <b>examination</b> of the joints showed smooth interface. The details of fabrication and characterization procedure for macro-brush tungsten and carbon based PFC test mockups are presented...|$|E
40|$|Vernonia amygdalina (bitter leaves) {{was tested}} as a green {{inhibitor}} for zinc-plate in 2 M hydrochloride solution {{by means of}} weight loss, gasometric principle and potentiostatic polarization at 313 - 343 K. Increasing rate of hydrogen gas during the chemical reaction was examined in gasometric studies. Inhibition feasibility was explained by formation of insoluble complex adhesion {{on the surface of}} metal. However, results obtained indicated that, percentage of extract concentration increased due to the volume of H 2 gas generated. Extract in acid medium retard corrosion degradation of the deposited zinc- plate and forcefully reduce corrosion rate. <b>Micro-structural</b> <b>examination</b> through AFM revealed the morphology and evaluation performance of vernonia amygdalina. Polarization results obtained showed that performance efficiency of vernonia amygdalina was outstanding and the inhibitory effectiveness was as a result of increase in vernonia amygdalina concentratio...|$|E

40|$|SiC/SiC {{composites}} {{are excellent}} material candidates for high temperature applications where the performance requirements are high strength, high creep-rupture resistance, high environmental durability, and high thermal conductivity. In the past, the NASA UEET program has demonstrated fabrication of high-performance SiC/SiC flat panels reinforced by Sylramic-iBN SiC fibers. Currently NASA UEET is scaling up this SiC/SiC system by fabrication of more complex shaped components {{using the same}} fiber type. This paper reports the effects of various fiber architectures on the processing, mechanical, and durability behavior of small-diameter 0. 5 " ID SiC/SiC tubes, which are potential sub-elements for leading edges and cooling channels in turbine vanes and blades. Nine different fiber architectures were utilized for construction of seamless tube preforms, from simple 2 D jelly-rolling to complex braiding, pin-weaving, filament-winding and 3 D orthogonal weaving with approximately 5 % fibers in the thru-thickness direction. Using the BN interphase and Sic matrix processing steps established for the flat panels, SiC/SiC tubes were fabricated with wall thicknesses of approximately 60 mils and total fiber fractions of approximately 35 %. The "D" split ring tests for hoop tensile properties, <b>micro-structural</b> <b>examinations</b> for relationship between fiber architecture formation and matrix infiltration, and the low-pressure burner rig tests for the high temperature durability under thru-thickness thermal gradient were conducted. The better matrix infiltration and higher hoop strength were achieved using the tri-axial braided and the three-float pin woven SiC/SiC tubes. In general, it needs not only higher hoop direction fibers but also axial direction fibers for the higher hoop strength and the better infiltration, respectively. These results are analyzed to offer general guidelines for selecting fiber pre-form architectures and SiC/SiC processes that maximize tube hoop strength, thru-thickness thermal conductivity, and burner-rig durability under a high thermal gradient...|$|R
40|$|The {{excellent}} {{mechanical and}} durability properties, with its large availability and affordable costs, make concrete the most used engineered material, {{with an estimated}} worldwide consumption about 6 billion tons per year. The prices of this wide diffusion lie into the relevant environmental emissions associated to concrete industry: concrete production is in fact {{one of the main}} responsible of carbon emission in atmosphere, mainly due to cement manufacturing and natural aggregates extraction. Together with the energy requirements, water consumption and generation of construction and demolition waste, these factors contribute to the general appearance that concrete is not particularly compatible with the demands of sustainable development. Several operations can be applied to limit concrete impacts: the replacement of Portland cement with supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) and the use of recycled aggregates in place of natural resources are solutions that may achieve the aim of reducing concrete emissions during all its life cycle. Between the various recycled materials which can be suitable in concrete applications, promising results were obtained when limited quantities of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition wastes (C&DWs) and from electric arc furnace (EAF) slag are used, generally not affecting mechanical properties and environmental compatibility. Nevertheless, in the most of cases a lack of standardized rules hinder their use at market level, in particular when recycled aggregates or mineral additions come from metallurgical industry. In this thesis the use of two types of recycled aggregates for structural concrete production is explored: EAF slag as recycled aggregates and recycled aggregates from C&DW. In addition, the use of supplementary cementing materials is analyzed, paying particular attention on the suitability of the application of co-combustion fly ash in structural concrete. Two extensive experimental campaigns were carried out to analyze the main mechanical and durability-related properties of recycled concrete with EAF slag. Several mixes with increasing substitution ratios were produced, using both the coarse and the fine aggregates. A specific chemical and <b>micro-structural</b> in-depth <b>examination</b> was carried out in order to evaluate the actual stability of the material, the influence of the substitution ratio on hardened concrete properties and to study the aggregates-matrix bond when detrimental cycles were applied to concrete specimens. Once determined the suitability of some of the substitution ratios used, for the first time real-scale reinforced concrete beams with EAF slag were realized and tested for bending and shear failure, and their structural behavior is analyzed and discussed. The second part of the thesis deals with the use of recycled aggregates coming from C&DWs, to assess their influence on the rheological behavior of fresh concrete. An experimental campaign was conducted, and since slump value is often operator-sensitive, a more quantitative estimate was derived in terms of fundamental physical quantities, such as plastic viscosity and yield stress, by means of viscometer measures. The variables analyzed were the aggregates substitution ratio and proportioning method, the super-plasticizer content and the water/cement ratio. Lastly, an experimental campaign was performed to compare the effects of two different (SCMs) on mechanical and durability-related properties of structural concrete. Three mixes were produced, where coal and co-combustion fly ashes were used as partial substitute of cement (20...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} wear {{resistance}} of the cylinder liner of the engines operating in desert area, the tungsten carbide-based cermet coating (WC- 12 wt. %Co) was produced using the supersonic plasma spraying technique. The microstructure and phase composition of the as-sprayed coating were evaluated. The effect of sand size in lubricant on the friction and wear behavior of the coating under the lubrication of oil containing sand was investigated on a ball-on-disk tribometer. Characterization of the coating shows that the coating possesses dense microstructure with low level of porosity. The decarburization of WC is limited for the high particle velocity of the supersonic plasma spraying {{and only a few}} of W 2 C phases are observed in the coating. With the higher hardness and the good adhesion with the substrate the sprayed coating exhibits a better wear resistance compared with the gray casting iron used in the current cylinder liner. <b>Micro-structural</b> <b>examination</b> shows that the wear of coating is dominated by micro-cutting, WC particles pull-out and sub-surface indentation-induced sub-surface cracking, while the main wear mechanism of the gray casting iron is micro-cutting and plastic deformation.

40|$|AbstractThe rising {{necessity}} to improve corrosion and wear resistance of metals for engineering applications cannot be over emphasized. This {{has led to}} employing diverse models, method and techniques to obtain better corrosion and wear resistances for metallic materials and components which will otherwise fail during service. This work investigated the effect of Ni-P binary and Ni-Sn-P ternary electroless depositions on the corrosion and wear behavior of mild steel. <b>Micro-structural</b> <b>examination</b> using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows finer and more evenly distributed particle orientation across the substrate surface. The Ni-Sn-P ternary deposits on the mild steel displayed from the linear polarization analysis a better corrosion resistance with corrosion rate values of 0. 000246 mm/yr as {{compared with that of}} the Ni-P binary deposits with 0. 016672 mm/yr. Also the coefficient of friction of the unplated sample varies between 0 and 0. 08 while for the plated samples the coefficient of friction was relatively lesser and ranged from 0 to 0. 02. Significant improvement in corrosion resistance was also indicated by a positive shift in potential. Sliding wear analysis demonstrates consistently enhanced wear resistance of the ternary deposits as well as the binary deposits, with the ternary Sn addition showing better resistance to wear. This work has established that Ni-Sn-P electroless coating of mild steel can be used to improve the corrosion and wear resistance for engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|Black slag {{produced}} during the melting process in Electric Arc Furnace can represent {{a good opportunity}} {{in the operation of}} environmental recovery, in the building operation of road grounds and in the production of concrete. On the other hand, the chemical species contained in the scraps and the dirty material on their surfaces constitute a pollution source that causes the release of chemical species regarded as dangerous by the technical standards and by the limits imposed by some national rules, i. e. Cr, Ba, V, Mo, etc [...] Several experimental trials have been performed on the slag produced by two Italian steelmaking plants producing reinforcing bars, whose production is usually interested by a significant heterogeneity and poor selection of the scraps. The chemical compositions of the final obtained slag belong to a range in which the slag has shown a releasing behaviour that is significantly different {{as a function of the}} different ratios among the fundamental constituting chemical species, i. e. CaO, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, MgO etc [...] The chemical composition has been characterized through the optical basicity and the slag has been investigated from a microstructural point of view through SEM-EDS analysis that has permitted to identify the main phases contained in the slag and to characterize their chemical composition and the dangerous polluting elements solved in each phase. The combination of the data coming from chemical analysis, <b>micro-structural</b> <b>examination</b> and data coming from the releasing tests have permitted to identify a chemical range that allows to avoid dangerous chemical releasing and this statement has provided the possibility to identify a correct procedure for treating and modifying the slag...|$|E
