30|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown oxide layer {{formation}} on the weld Al substrate in Al-Cu joints manufactured with fusion welding, which results in insufficient bonding and ineffective electrical properties (Lloyd 1957). This phenomenon of incomplete fusion in the joint caused by oxide formation has also been noted in friction welding (Ochi, et al., 2004). Another problem found in welding Al and Cu is that mutual solubility between Al and Cu occurs in the liquid state but brittle intermetallic compounds form after solidification, resulting in degradation of the weld properties (Weigl & Schmidt, 2009). These brittle intermetallic compounds can initiate cracks, due to the significant difference in melting temperature, thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of the base <b>metals,</b> <b>migration</b> of the elements and the microstructural gradient (Sun & Karppi, 1996; Posinasetti and Prasad 2005; Joseph 2006; Ihor & Schmidt, 2006).

40|$|To {{understand}} the difference in reversible energy storage capacity between the O 3 -type layered Na and Li compounds, we use first principles calculations to study and contrast the effect of two well-known destabilization mechanisms, transformation into the spinel-type structures and cation mixing due to transition <b>metal</b> <b>migration.</b> This study is performed on the layered oxides at the A 0. 5 MO 2 composition, where A = (Na, Li) and M is a 3 d transition metal. We find that while all Li 0. 5 MO 2 compounds have strong driving forces and low energy kinetic paths to transform to the spinel structure, Na 0. 5 MO 2 compounds do not have thermodynamic driving forces to transform to spinel type structures. We also find that transition metal mobility is higher in Li layered compounds than in Na layered compounds because of the unusual activated state for transition metal hopping. For many compounds, migration goes along an oct–tet–oct path, but transition <b>metal</b> <b>migration</b> needs to be assisted by alkali migration into a tetrahedral site forming activated Atet–Mtet defects; substituting Na for Li in the layered structure results in increased transition <b>metal</b> <b>migration</b> barriers due to the larger size of Na+ ions. Overall, our findings indicate that Na compounds in the layered O 3 structure have fundamentally different destabilization mechanisms to those of Li compounds. This distinction allows superior battery electrode performance in many Na compounds and offers optimistic perspective on finding many high energy density Na electrodes that cycle with stable high capacity.

First, the paper presents the information about metal content in the tree leaves in alluvial recipients polluted by metals from uranium deep mining at Dolní Rožínka, the Czech Republic. X-ray fluorescence analysis of dried leaves results showed the increased content of Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Rb, Sr, Zn and U; it corresponds to the most seriously polluted areas in the world comparing with the scientific literature. However, statistically, we did not succeed to demonstrate in none of areas of interest the element heterogeneity between the upper, middle and lower streams segments. Element habitat homogeneity can be caused by current stand species composition where Picea abies L. dominates and this fact results in the negative impact on the soil pH since it is a primary factor of metals immobilization in the ecosystem and their transformation into toxic variations. Within the area of interest, there is demonstrated positive effect of reconstruction of forest stands, which are close to the dominating deciduous trees, especially Fagus silvatica L.

40|$|The fate of {{contaminant}} migration {{through the}} subsurface environment {{as well as}} their potential hazard to humans, animals, and aquatic life {{has become one of the}} major current concerns of the scientific community. Accordingly, various theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted on the saturated soil by many researchers. The literature review emphasizes that the problem of the unsaturated transport of contaminants through porous media has received little attention. Thus, the present work is carried out to contribute to the study of heavy <b>metals</b> <b>migration</b> within unsaturated clay soil through mathematical modeling of the mechanisms and parameters which influence the transport phenomenon. For successful modeling, it is imperative that parameters which affect the transport phenomenon be investigated and determined properly. Hence, the study was conducted through two principal parts. The first part is an experimental investigation to quantify the various soil-water (solution) interactions that have an effect on the flow and contaminant transport and to derive the constitutive relationships required in mathematical modeling. The second part develops a contaminant migration mathematical model which includes unsaturated flow, hydrodynamic dispersion, and physico-chemical reaction between the solid and the liquid phase, employing the theory of mass transport. The experimental investigation contains two main sets of laboratory tests: (i) some independent tests in order to isolate and better understand the individual processes, and (ii) some tests on experimental models of the real phenomena to verify the related parameters in a combined kinetic situation. The results of all experiments are followed by discussion, in order to better understand the phenomenon behavior, and to realize the relationships among the various processes. Based on the above mechanisms, the governing equations of the problem are derived to provide a quantitative account of the behavior of the phenomenon. Finally, a finite volume algorithm is developed, on the basis of the mathematical model, in order to solve the contaminant transport equations numerically. Using experimental results, the numerical model is then calibrated and verified. The developed computer code provides the ability to predict the contaminant migration for any depth and period of time.
