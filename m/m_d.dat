40|$|A {{detailed}} study is presented of the room-temperature absorption, natural and magnetic circulation-dichroism (c. <b>d.</b> and <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.)</b> spectra of cytochrome c oxidase {{and a number}} of its derivatives in the wavelength range 700 - 1900 nm. The spectra of the reduced enzyme show a strong negative c. d. band peaking at 1100 nm arising from low-spin ferrous haem a and a positive <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> peak at 780 nm assigned to high-spin ferrous haem a 3. Addition of cyanide ion doubles the intensity of the low-spin ferrous haem c. d. band and abolishes reduced carbonmonoxy derivative the haem a 32 +-CO group shows no c. <b>d.</b> or <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> bands at wavelengths longer than 700 nm. A comparison of the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> spectra of the oxidized and cyanide-bound oxidized forms enables bands characteristic of the high-spin ferric form of haem a 33 + to be identified between 700 and 1300 nm. At wavelengths longer than 1300 nm a broad positive <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> spectrum, peaking at 1600 nm, is observed. By comparison with the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> spectrum of an extracted haem a-bis-imidazole complex this <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> peak is assigned to one low-spin ferric haem, namely haem a 3 +. On binding of cyanide to the oxidized form of the enzyme a new, weak, <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> signal appears, which is assigned to the low-spin ferric haem a 33 +-CN species. A reductive titration, with sodium dithionite, of the cyanide-bound form of the enzyme leads to a partially reduced state in which low-spin haem a 2 + is detected by means of an intense negative c. d. peak at 1100 nm and low-spin ferric haem a 33 +-CN gives a sharp positive <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> peak at 1550 nm.

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Mughal-e-Azam {{began in}} the early 1950s. Each sequence was reportedly filmed three times, as the film was being produced in Hindi/Urdu, Tamil, and English. The film was eventually dubbed in Tamil and released in 1961 as Akbar, but that version's commercial failure resulted in the abandonment of the planned English dubbing, for which British actors were considered. Asif was accompanied by an extensive crew, which included his assistant directors S. T. Zaidi, Khalid Akhtar, Surinder Kapoor (assisting primarily for the English version), and five others. Additional crew members included cinematographer R. D. Mathur, choreographer Lachhu Maharaj, production manager Aslam Noori, cameraman <b>M.</b> <b>D.</b> Ayub, editor Dharamavir, makeup artists P.

40|$|The visible-near-i. r. -region <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> (magnetic-circular-dichroism) {{spectrum}} {{recorded at}} low {{temperature in the}} range 450 - 900 nm is reported for oxidized resting mammalian cytochrome c oxidase. <b>M.</b> c. <b>d.</b> magnetization curves determined at different wavelengths reveal the presence of two paramagnetic species. Curves at 576, 613 and 640 nm fit well to those expected for an x,y-polarized haem transition with g values of 3. 03, 2. 21 and 1. 45, i. e. cytochrome a 3 +. The <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> features at 515, 785 and 817 nm magnetize as a S = 1 / 2 paramagnet with average g values close to 2, and simulated <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> magnetization curves obtained by using the observed g values of CuA 2 +, i. e. 2. 18, 2. 03 and 1. 99, fit well to the experimental observations. The form of the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> magnetization curve at 466 nm is curious, {{but it can be}} explained if CuA 2 + and cytochrome a 3 + contribute with oppositely signed bands at this wavelength. By comparing the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> spectrum of the enzyme with that of extracted haem a-bisimidazole complex it has been possible to deconvolute the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> spectrum of CuA 2 +, which shows transitions throughout the spectral region from 450 to 950 nm. The <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> -spectral properties of CuA 2 + were compared with those of a well-defined type I blue copper centre in azurin isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The absolute intensities of the <b>m.</b> c. <b>d.</b> signals at equal fields and temperatures for CuA 2 + are 10 - 20 -fold greater than those for azurin.

40|$|Two {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 2 and <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 3) specific for {{the alpha}} 2 -fragment (C 4 d), and one antibody (mAb M 4 c 3) specific for the gamma-chain of human complement protein C 4, {{have been tested}} for cross-reactivity against mammalian complement. These mAb have also been found to react with C 4 from guinea-pig (mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 2 and <b>M</b> 4 c 3) {{as well as from}} cattle, baboon and rhesus monkey (mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 3 and <b>M</b> 4 c 3) in an activation ELISA. Since reactivity of mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 2 and <b>M</b> 4 c 3 included guinea-pig complement, the specific recognition of mammalian C 4 could be confirmed with sera from C 4 -deficient (def') guinea-pigs. mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 2 or <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 3, but not mAb M 4 c 3, stained glomerular deposits within renal tissue sections from pig, cattle and guinea-pig. In the case of mAb <b>M</b> 4 <b>d</b> 2, specificity of that staining could also be demonstrated in kidney specimens from C 4 -def' guinea-pigs. It can be concluded that, as in humans, the C 4 d fragment is also present in mammalian glomeruli. Compared with normal guinea-pigs, the C 4 -def' and C 2 -def' animals showed markedly increased glomerular deposits of IgM. It appears that glomerular deposition of complement C 4 d in mammals: (1) indicates activation via the classical pathway; (2) represents a general phenomenon of renal homeostasis; and (3) seems {{to be involved in the}} physiological clearance of immune complexes...|$|R

In addition, content of β-glucans in hull-less barley were determined. In average, hull-less barley and oat had the lowest content of hemicellulose (22. 54 and 13. 11 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively), cellulose (1. 36 and 1. 41 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively), lignin (0. 98 and 0. 49 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively), as well as NDF (24. 84 and 15. 16 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively) and ADF (2. 30 and 2. 04 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.,</b> respectively). In average, the highest content of hemicellulose was in durum wheat (33. 47 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.),</b> followed by rye (29. 63 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.),</b> and bread wheat (23. 24 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.).</b> Among tested hull-less barley genotypes the the content of β-glucans ranged from 4. 1 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.</b> (IWHBON 97 - 18) to 5. 6 % <b>d.</b> <b>m.</b> (Apolon).

40|$|Community {{respiration}} (CR) {{of organic}} material to carbon dioxide plays {{a fundamental role in}} ecosystems and ocean biogeochemical cycles, as it dictates {{the amount of}} production available to higher trophic levels and for export to the deep ocean. Yet how CR varies across large oceanographic gradients is not well-known: CR is measured infrequently and cannot be easily sensed from space. We used continuous oxygen measurements collected by autonomous gliders to quantify surface CR rates across the Pacific Ocean. CR rates were calculated from changes in apparent oxygen utilization and six different estimates of oxygen flux based on wind speed. CR showed substantial spatial variation: rates were lowest in ocean gyres (mean of 6. 93 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 2168. 0 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21 standard deviation in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre) and were more rapid and more variable near the equator (8. 69 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 2167. 32 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21 between 10 uN and 10 uS) and near shore (e. g., 5. 62 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21645. 6 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21 between the coast of California and 124 uW, and 17. 0 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21613. 9 mmol <b>m</b> 23 <b>d</b> 21 between 156 uE and the Australian coast). We examined how CR varied with coincident measurements of temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll concentrations (a proxy for phytoplankton biomass), and found that CR was weakly related to different explanatory variables across the Pacific, but more strongly related to particular variables in different biogeographical areas. Our results indicate that CR is not a simple linear function of chlorophyll or temperature, and that at the scale of the Pacific, the coupling between primary production, ocean warming, and CR i...|$|R
