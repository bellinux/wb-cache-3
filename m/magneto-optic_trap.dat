It {{is based on an}} “optical-shepherd” technique, in which far-off-resonance blue-detuned swept sheet laser beams are used to make new types of high-density traps, atom waveguides, and other components for achieving very efficient Bose–Einstein condensation and cw atom laser operation. A shepherd-enhanced trap is proposed that should be superior to conventional <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>traps</b> for the initial collection of molasses-cooled atoms. A type of dark-spot optical trap is devised that can cool large numbers of atoms to polarization-gradient temperatures at densities limited only by three-body collisional loss. A scheme is designed to use shepherd beams to capture and recycle essentially all of the escaped atoms in evaporative cooling, thereby increasing the condensate output by several orders of magnitude. Condensate atoms are stored in a shepherd trap, protected from absorbing light, under effectively zero-gravity conditions, and coupled out directly into an optical waveguide.

I describe experiments, laser systems and vacuum trap assemblies designed to facilitate this guiding. These experiments are intended to aid progression {{within the field of}} cold atom guidance wherein narrow diameter, long distance hollow-fibre guides are a current goal. Realisation of these guides could lead to promising applications such as atom interferometers and spatially accurate, multi-source, atom depositors. Herein, guided fluxes are observed in free-space guiding experiments for distances up to 50 mm and up to 10 GHz red-detuning from resonance. Additionally hollow-core, Kagome structured, quasi- and true-photonic crystal fibres are characterised. Finally a number of detailed fibre-guiding <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>traps</b> are developed. Both cold atomic-beams and cold atomic clouds are reliably positioned above fibre entrance facets in conjunction with a guiding laser beam coupled into the fibre core.

40|$|A {{transportable}} atom interferometer-based {{gravity gradiometer}} {{has been developed}} at JPL to carry out measurements of Earth's gravity field at ever finer spatial resolutions, and to facilitate high-resolution monitoring of temporal variations in the gravity field from ground- and flight-based platforms. Existing satellite-based gravity missions such as CHAMP and GRACE measure the gravity field via precise monitoring of {{the motion of the}} satellites; i. e. the satellites themselves function as test masses. JPL's quantum gravity gradiometer employs a quantum phase measurement technique, similar to that employed in atomic clocks, made possible by recent advances in laser cooling and manipulation of atoms. This measurement technique is based on atomwave interferometry, and individual laser-cooled atoms are used as drag-free test masses. The quantum gravity gradiometer employs two identical atom interferometers as precision accelerometers to measure the difference in gravitational acceleration between two points (Figure 1). By using the same lasers for the manipulation of atoms in both interferometers, the accelerometers have a common reference frame and non-inertial accelerations are effectively rejected as common mode noise in the differential measurement of the gravity gradient. As a result, the dual atom interferometer-based gravity gradiometer allows gravity measurements on a moving platform, while achieving the same long-term stability of the best atomic clocks. In the laboratory-based prototype (Figure 2), the cesium atoms used in each atom interferometer are initially collected and cooled in two separate <b>magneto-optic</b> <b>traps</b> (MOTs). Each MOT, consisting of three orthogonal pairs of counter-propagating laser beams centered on a quadrupole magnetic field, collects up to 10 (exp 9) atoms. These atoms are then launched vertically as in an atom fountain by switching off the magnetic field and introducing a slight frequency shift between pairs of lasers to create a moving rest frame for the trapped atoms. While still in this moving-frame molasses, the laser frequencies are further detuned from the atomic resonance (while maintaining this relative frequency shift) to cool the atom cloud's temperature to 2 K or below, corresponding to an rms velocity of less than 2 cm/s. After launch, the cold atoms undergo further state and velocity selection to prepare for atom interferometry. The atom interferometers are then realized using laser-induced stimulated Raman transitions to perform the necessary manipulations of each atom, and the resulting interferometer phase is measured using laser-induced fluorescence for state-normalized detection. More than 20 laser beams with independent controls of frequency, phase, and intensity are required for this measurement sequence. This instrument can facilitate the study of Earth's gravitational field from surface and air vehicles, as well as from space by allowing gravity mapping from a low-cost, single spacecraft mission. In addition, the operation of atom interferometer-based instruments in space offers greater sensitivity than is possible in terrestrial instruments due to the much longer interrogation times available in the microgravity environment. A space-based quantum gravity gradiometer has the potential to achieve sensitivities similar to the GRACE mission at long spatial wavelengths, and will also have resolution similar to GOCE for measurement at shorter length scales...|$|R
40|$|Entanglement {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} quantum mechanics, and arguably the clearest manifestation of the non-locality that is so intimately written within the quantum theory. The wave {{functions}} used to describe matter are, in fact, spatially extended; only when {{the position of a}} particle is measured the wave function collapses and the local particle description of matter can be used. The counter intuitive nature of entanglement has intrigued physicists since {{the very beginning of the}} quantum era, and sparked controversies and paradoxes. Among these, we cite the famous paradox proposed by A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N. Rosen 1935, in which a pair of entangled particles deceptively give the impression that information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light. While in the past the concept of quantum entanglement was primarily applied to systems with few degrees of freedom, this has changed in the modern days. The developments of the theories of quantum decoherence, condensed matter and quantum information, together with the huge improvements in the experimental techniques of ultra-cold atoms, nano technologies and quantum optics, have fuelled a new interest on the entanglement of many-body systems. An extensive literature has built up on the problem of measuring the entanglement of a part of an extended system with the rest. The interest in it was motivated, among other reasons, by the ideas of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy and the holographic principle first proposed by 't Hooft. The development of measures such as the von Neumann and Rényi bipartite entanglement entropies are great theoretical achievements in these respects. In thermodynamics, entropy is an extensive quantity, and hence scales with the volume of the system, i. e. S_therm∼ L^d, with L the typical dimension of a system and d its spatial dimension. Entanglement entropies are somewhat peculiar in that they typically scale as the extension of the hyper-surface separating the two parts of the system one considers, i. e. S_ent∼ L^d- 1. This is commonly referred in literature as the area law scaling of entanglement entropies. An extremely important application of area laws is their use as flags for quantum criticality: in fact, under reasonable assumptions, the scaling is logarithmically violated at quantum critical points, i. e. S_ent∼ L^d- 1 (L). Measuring entanglement is often not an easy task, as a quite deep understanding of the system is required. Spin chain models are particularly useful to overcome these limitations, in that they are sufficiently complex to have real-world counterparts and at the same time sufficiently simple to allow a rigorous, albeit sometimes only approximate, analytical solution. By exploiting the known solution to some models in low spatial dimensions, it was possible to analytically compute entanglement entropies, both for finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. This is even more the case for some one-dimensional models at quantum critical points, whenever the system is invariant under translations, rotations and scaling transformations. In these cases the system is usually invariant under the wider conformal group in 1 + 1 dimensions (the second dimension being the imaginary time obtained by a Wick rotation of the real time). The powerful methods of Conformal Field Theory confirmed and sometimes extended the results on the bipartite entanglement entropies of critical one-dimensional systems. By using these methods, together with profound mathematical theorems, it was possible to also obtain the behaviour of the entanglement and the scaling of the leading corrections in dimensions higher than one. In this thesis we review in detail the main aspects of quantum entanglement described above. We then build upon exact results for systems of free spinless Fermi gases in a finite-size one-dimensional box. From these, we derive analytical expressions for the entanglement entropies of free Fermi gases in higher dimensions for the particular strip-like geometry. The results are asymptotic for the limit of a large number of particles. Contrarily to previously published results, in this work the subleading corrections are rigorously calculated and the next order corrections can be estimated. The formulae are thoroughly verified against numerical results in two and three dimensions, and are in perfect agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, an argument is found for the wide oscillation of entanglement entropies that are present in dimensions higher than one. These are found to be linked to the particular way in which the Fermi sea is filled as the particle number is increased. In two dimensions, it is numerically proven that the oscillation exactly correspond to the pseudo-periodicity of perfect squares. Finally, the most recent developments in the field of entanglement entropies for Fermi gases are reviewed, with particular attention to dynamic situations with non-trivial interactions. These, together with known relations between entanglement entropies and particle densities, provide us with a complete picture that can be tested experimentally.
