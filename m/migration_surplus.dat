40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} a spatial analysis considering the effect of demographic ageing and ageing-in-place processes in Germany according to spatially differentiated ageing patterns among urban, sub-urban and rural counties up to 2025. As to the latest official population forecast counties of urban core regions will undergo a slower ageing process than other types of counties, resulting in a reversal of ageing patterns. Urban core areas in this analysis will gain demographically from their net <b>migration</b> <b>surplus</b> while suburban housing locations of the past will be no longer able to attract enough young migrants to compensate for their now rapidly ageing baby boomer generation. The process presented is typical for the fate of (suburban) housing areas with homogenous populations under conditions of ageing and shrinking if spatial mobility in ageing population groups is declining. ...|$|E

For continental migrant households, <b>migration</b> has removed <b>surplus</b> male labor, a cause for inefficiency in production. Intercontinental migration leads to a gender imbalance in the household, which cannot be compensated for by investments in farm equipment.

The mainland population increased by nearly 266, 000 people (+ 0. 4 %) in 2003. This was slightly down on 2003 due to a slight fall in the surplus of births over deaths (the same level of births but slightly more deaths) combined with a slight fall in net <b>migration</b> (<b>surplus</b> of immigration over emigration) as estimated by Insee (table page 3). Population doubled in two centuries The population of metropolitan France is likely to top the 60 million mark in May 2004, having doubled in 200 years from the 30 million at which it stood in 1804 (figure 1). These were not two centuries of steady population growth, as comparatively sustained growth {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century gradually slowed down after 1850. Not until 1893 did the population rise above 40 million. Slow growth in the following decades brought pre-war France to a population of 41. 6 million in 1914. The combination of war deaths and a birth slump reduced the population to 38. 5 million in 1918. Driven mainly by immigration, it rose to top 40 million again in 1924. Growth again slowed at the end of the 1920 s, and the population stagnated at 41. 5 million throughout the 1930 s. Then the Second World War brought the population down to just under 39 million in 1944. * Institut national d’études démographique...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} if capital and labour are {{complementary}} inputs and labour is in surplus[LS], economic development will reduce investment in the agricultural sector. We analyse the impact of factor substitutability and factor mobility on economic welfare as indicated by changes in output {{by the use of}} appropriate fiscal policies in LS economies. Next, we demonstrate how a LS economy results in a higher agricultural employment but it can also accumulate more capital in the rural sector under certain conditions given by the elasticity of substitution between inputs in a nested CES production function. Finally, we analyse the welfare economics of migration and show that the net benefits crucially depend on the response of urban unemployment rate to migration and the flexibility of real wages with respect to unemployment rate. Migration without capital mobility is welfare enhancing iff the absolute value of the semi-elasticity of the urban real wage with respect to industrial unemployment is large. Benefits from migration are then estimated by calibrating the model. In the long-run, we allow capital to adjust to the increases in migration to show the welfare-enhancing impact of <b>migration.</b> <b>Migration,</b> labour <b>surplus</b> economies, capital accumulation, welfare...|$|R
40|$|Many {{bird species}} need to {{accumulate}} fat deposits prior to long distance <b>migration.</b> The <b>surplus</b> energy {{required to achieve}} this {{can be obtained by}} increasing food intake. There are two main ways of attaining an increased food intake; by increasing feeding day length or by an increase in the rate of feeding. The foraging and roosting behaviour of Turnstones, Arenaria interpres, and Purple Sandpipers, Calidris maritima, was studied in the spring pre-migratory period at Hartlepool, N. E. England. Adult Turnstone increase both their feeding day length and feeding rate. First year Turnstones show no lengthening of their feeding day and only a small increase in feeding rate, they do not undergo long distance migration so do not need to deposit fat. Purple Sandpipers do not exhibit an increase in their feeding day length, due to the availability of their feeding areas being strictly tidally controlled, and rely on an increased feeding rate alone to achieve fat deposition. Associated with the increased feeding rates is a reduction in time spent vigilant, suggesting a trade off occurs as increased time spent foraging becomes more beneficial. The possible conseqences of redevelopment of the West Harbour roost site are discussed and suggestions made for future study...|$|R

The integrated CGE-BEM model is regionally disaggregated with a variety of crops and livestock, and includes the responses of farmers and consequent feedback effects in the regional economic system. The results show that under the total water use control scenario, the water use structure is changed and water use efficiency is improved. The total water use control policy has limited negative impact on the regional economic growth with only a slightly lower growth rate of 13. 38 % compared with a growth rate of 14 % by 2020 under a business as usual water use scenario. However, the total water use control policy has significant negative impacts on several sectors, especially agriculture and food processing. It is expected cropping systems will change through a replacement of water-intensive crops with water-efficient crops. Farmers’ incomes will decrease by 3. 14 %. In order to alleviate farmers’ income loss and deal with water use conflicts across different sectors and regions, the promotion of <b>migration</b> of <b>surplus</b> labor from agriculture to non-agricultural sectors and the improvement of water use efficiency in agriculture are needed...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} the patterns and determinants of migration flows {{of young women}} at the age between 18 and 30 years. At the NUTS- 3 regional level, i. e. the district level (Kreise), the German internal migration flows of the year 2005 are explored. From descriptive statistics {{it can be seen}} that peripheral regions in East Germany face the strongest migration deficit with respect to young women, whereas agglomerations in West Germany but also in the East benefit from an intense <b>migration</b> <b>surplus</b> within this group. The econometric analysis of determinants of regional migration flows emphasizes the importance of economic, family-related and educational migration motives. Generally speaking, young women tend to choose regions with good income and job opportunities. In addition, they seem to be attracted by regions enabling an appropriate balance between family and career. Furthermore, the existence of excellent educational facilities is a significant pull factor regarding young female migration. This educationally motivated type of migration generates an enduring effect on the regional balance of migration, which is especially true if the educational opportunities in the target region are associated with adequate career perspectives for highly qualified female graduates. In terms of recommendations for action, the study underlines the importance of policy measures improving the regional job and income opportunities. Secondly, the upgrading of fields of study mainly chosen by women seems to be a suitable way to stimulate female immigration. Moreover, the enhancement of the social infrastructure, which promotes a satisfactory work life balance, might attract young women or at least reduce the number of them leaving the region. ...|$|E

40|$|The years 1998 to 2003 {{were marked}} by a {{deterioration}} in the economic situation of the German population with an immigrant background as the share of immigrants living {{below the poverty line}} increased at an above average rate. The older and younger age groups in this segment of the population are particularly prone to poverty. The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, which is carried out by the DIW Berlin in collaboration with the Infratest Social Research Institute, shows that 28 % of children and young people aged under 20 with an immigrant background were living in precarious circumstances in 2003. The share of native Germans of the same age living in such circumstances was substantially lower, albeit still disturbingly high at 20 %. Citizens of Turkish origin, in particular, are frequently found living below the poverty line. Immigrants from Western countries, by contrast, live comparatively rarely in poverty. Naturalised Germans are better off on average than foreign nationals, although this is not true for ethnic Germans. The fact that poverty is not a transitory phenomenon but an enduring condition for many immigrants is particularly alarming. Only improved education and training will solve this problem in the long term. The recruitment of foreign labour, the admission of refugees and the return of ethnic German settlers from former Eastern Bloc countries have culminated in large waves of immigration to Germany over the last 50 years. On official figures, over seven million foreign nationals and over four million ethnic Germans are living in Germany today. Germany still has a net <b>migration</b> <b>surplus,</b> although it has diminished significantly in recent years. ...|$|E
40|$|Migration of {{population}} has been a recurrent phenomenon {{since the dawn of}} human history. Though its form has changed but it remains a dominant event in the global social system. In modern days also people migrate from underdeveloped areas to the developed ones in search of better opportunities. Several theories have been propounded to explain the occurrence of migration. A number of social, cultural, economic, spatial, climatic, demographic factors induce migration. Among them, the economic factors are considered as the primary reasons for inducing migration. Migration of male labour force from Bihar has increased during last two decades which prompted us to analyze its consequences on efficiency of input in agricultural production, livelihood through remittances and also the empowerment of women left behind at place of origin. It was observed that the efficiencies of human labour and irrigation in rice production were higher than non-migrant households and statistically significant, indicating rational use of these two critical inputs on migrant households in Bihar. The migration seems to have helped in judicious use of human labour at native place due to <b>migration</b> of <b>surplus</b> labour force for gainful employment to destination of migration. Remittances have been utilized for meeting consumption needs, improved livelihood, better education to children and better health care facilities which help in overall improvement in livelihood on migrant households in Bihar. Migrant households also preferred to save money to meet their requirements in unforeseen situations. It can thus be infered that migration may be one of risk-coping strategies for the weaker sections of the society and has helped developing the saving habits among migrant households. The allocation of remittances on agricultural inputs could have increased if proper infrastructure facilities were present in rural areas for faster dissemination of modern agricultural technology for increasing agricultural production. Level of women employment has increased on migrant households, particularly on poor households; however, work load of women has also increased. It has been observed that role of women of migrant households changed from unpaid female labour to managers of the household, however, they face problem in management of fund, technology and input-output marketing. There is a need to launch a programme for their training to improve their knowledge in financial, technological and marketing management. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a theoretical analysis {{of how the}} processes of industri-alization and development interact with international trade in goods or services to influence a country’s turning point from labor exporter to labor importer. It is concluded that trade in goods complements capital move-ments but substitutes for labor movements, whereas trade in services and labor movements complement each other. The proposed analytical frame-work suggests that both international trade and migration may contribute to, but cannot lead to, a development process that brings about a <b>migration</b> transition in <b>surplus</b> labor economies. The process of industrialization and development {{is associated with a}} structural transformation of economies. In a long term perspective, the most important dimension of such transformations is a structural change in the composition of output and employment over time. To begin with, the share of the agricultural sector in both output and employment is over-whelmingly large. As industrialization proceeds, the share of the manufac-turing sector, and later the services sector, in output and in employment rises, while that of the agricultural sector falls. The absorption of surplus labor is reflected in the migration of unemployed or underemployed workers from rural hinterlands to urban settlements. Given the massive differences in employment probabilities and wage levels, wherever possi-ble, migration of workers across national boundaries also absorbs a part of the labor surplus. Over time, the process of economic development is associated with a migration transition. Rural-urban migration comes to an end when the surplus of labor in the subsistence sector is exhausted. Emigration flows are also significantly reduced in part because surplu...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} devoted to the {{development}} of the transhumance in Spain, Italy, Southern France, and the Balkan countries. It elaborated an idealtype of evolution of transhumance within the context of medieval European economies. The ideal-type modes of organization range from the integration of sheep raising, in the business cycles of rural communities to the regulations for extensive migratory sheep raising by public institutions. The degrees of spatial interrelatedness, the separation of pastoral production and reproduction from the rural production and living units, and the disposition of the yields from transhumant sheep raising are used as criteria for characterizing each stage. Spatial relations between the places of rural and pastoral productions allege the labelling of the various stages: intra-local sheep raising (use of the common land; no supplementary pastures; division of labour between the members of the rural production unity; the head of the household is authorized to dispose of the surplus); inter-local migratory pastoral economy (supplementary pastures in different village lands; division of labour between shepherd and rural production unity; the shepherd's participation in surplus and income from sales); intra-regional migratory pastoral industry (supplementary pastures beyond the village, but within the same physiographic region; division of labour between shepherd and rural production unity or larger production unities; aside from them, owners of pasture grounds and landowners in regions through which flocks pass during their <b>migrations</b> participate in <b>surplus</b> and income from sales); inter-regional migratory pastoral industry (supplementary pastures in different physiographic regions, division of labour between shepherd and rural or larger economic unities or flock owners; also division of labour within the pastoral production unity; aside from shepherds, peasants, flock owners, owners of pasture grounds, and landowners in regions through which flocks pass during their migrations, the government or similar organizers of transhumance participate in surplus and income from sales) ...|$|R
40|$|Migration—environment {{linkages}} are at {{the centre}} of media attention because of public concern about climate change and a perceived "flooding" of migrants from less developed countries into more affluent parts of the world. In the past few years, a substantial body of conceptual literature about environmentally induced migration has evolved, {{but there is still}} a paucity of empirical work in this area. Moreover, the environmental causes of migration have been studied largely in isolation of the environmental consequences. In this paper we present an analysis of migration and vegetation dynamics for one country (Ghana) to assess four migration—environment linkages. On the one hand, we look at two environmental drivers of migration: environmental push and pull. On the other hand, we look at the environmental impact of migration on source and destination areas. Census data at the district level (N= 110) are used to map domestic migration flows in Ghana, which are then related to vegetation dynamics retrieved from a remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset (1981 — 2006). The analysis shows that at the national level, there are significant but weak correlations between migration and vegetation cover and trends therein. Districts with a migration deficit (more out-migration than in-migration) tend to be more sparsely vegetated and have experienced a more positive NDVI trend over the past quarter century than districts with a <b>migration</b> <b>surplus.</b> A disaggregation of data in three principle migration systems shows stronger correlations. Namely that north—south migration and cocoa frontier settlement have important environmental dimensions, but environmental factors do not seem {{to play a major role}} in migration to the capital, Accra. An important insight from this paper is that migration flows in Ghana can be explained partly by vegetation dynamics but are also strongly related to rural population densities. This is because access to natural resources is often more important than the scarcity or abundance of natural resources per se. This study further shows that satellite remote sensing can provide valuable input to analyses of migration—environment linkages...|$|E
