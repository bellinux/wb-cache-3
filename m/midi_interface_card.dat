50|$|Cakewalk was a MIDI {{sequencer}} {{developed by}} Twelve Tone Systems, Inc. (the company {{now known as}} Cakewalk, Inc.) originally for DOS, starting with version Cakewalk 1.0 in 1987, and beginning in 1991, for Windows 3.0. Cakewalk for DOS, until version 4.0, required an MPU-401 <b>MIDI</b> <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> operating in intelligent mode, while 4.0 and later versions relied on the dumb UART mode only. Cakewalk was delivered in two versions, Cakewalk Pro and Cakewalk Express.|$|E
40|$|The {{wide range}} of options for {{experimentation}} with the synthesis of sound are usually expensive, difficult to obtain, or limit the experimenter. The work described in this thesis shows how the IBM PC and software can be combined to provide a suitable platform for experimentation with different synthesis techniques. This platform {{is based on the}} PC, the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and a musical instrument called a digital sampler. The fundamental concepts of sound are described, with reference to digital sound reproduction. A number of synthesis techniques are described. These are evaluated according to the criteria of generality, efficiency and control. The techniques discussed are additive synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis, subtractive synthesis, granular synthesis, resynthesis, wavetable synthesis, and sampling. Spiral synthesis, physical modelling, waveshaping and spectral interpolation are discussed briefly. The Musical Instrument Digital Interface is a standard method of connecting digital musical instruments together. It is the MIDI standard and equipment conforming to that standard that makes this implementation of synthesis techniques possible. As a demonstration of the PC platform, additive synthesis, frequency modulation synthesis, granular synthesis and spiral synthesis have been implemented in software. A PC equipped with a <b>MIDI</b> <b>interface</b> <b>card</b> is used to perform the synthesis. The MIDI protocol is used to transmit the resultant sound to a digital sampler. The INMOS transputer is used as an accelerator, as the calculation of a waveform using software is a computational intensive process. It is concluded that sound synthesis can be performed successfully using a PC and the appropriate software, and utilizing the facilities provided by a MIDI environment including a digital sampler. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} for testing MIDI performance characteristics, which is both inexpensive and highly accurate. Following {{a description of the}} test method, actual results for a number of <b>MIDI</b> <b>interface</b> technologies are presented.

Other potential applications of this technique are briefly discussed. Finally, we consider implications for the future, since the recent PC 2001 Guidelines and WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) logo requirements will forbid the use of the older <b>MIDI</b> <b>interface</b> technologies in new personal computer designs...|$|R
