500|$|Clark {{returned}} to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the Los Angeles Times {{asked a question}} about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said [...] "distorted the comment" [...] with headlines such as [...] "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" [...] in The New York Times. Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a [...] "complete misunderstanding of <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> and of the facts," [...] and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: [...] "Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helm {{later wrote}} about The Last Waltz in his autobiography, This Wheel's on Fire, {{in which he}} {{made the case that}} it had been {{primarily}} Robbie Robertson's project and that Robertson had forced The Band's breakup {{on the rest of the}} group. Robertson offered a different take in a 1986 interview: [...] "I made my big statement. I did the movie, I made a three-record album about it—and if this is only <b>my</b> <b>statement,</b> not theirs, I'll accept that. They're saying, 'Well, that was really his trip, not our trip.' Well, fine. I'll take the best music film that's ever been made, and make it <b>my</b> <b>statement.</b> I don't have any problems with that. None at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{on in the}} interview, Bertone again {{addresses}} {{the question as to}} whether a text exists with words attributed to the Blessed Virgin that was censored: [...] "The part of the text where the Virgin speaks in the first person wasn't censored, {{for the simple reason that}} it never existed. ...I'm basing <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> on Sister Lucia's own direct confirmation that the Third Secret is none other than the text that was published in the year 2000." ...|$|E

2500|$|She {{has been}} accused of {{fabricating}} incidents in her memoir and lacing it with half-truths and fantasies. She herself confessed, [...] "I may have made mistakes in some dates or minor incidents but…I feel I have held to the spirit of <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> if not to the letter". Nevertheless, Karen Swenson, a Garbo biographer, and Schanke identified and corrected significant errors in de Acosta's account. While the memoir was initially unsuccessful, it was rediscovered in the late 1960s and widely read in the underground gay community. In spite of its inaccuracies, it is now recognized as an important contribution to gay and lesbian history.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985 British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher apologised to {{the school}} after mistakenly criticising members of its {{teaching}} staff who belonged to the National Union of Teachers for taking strike action. It was NUT members at the nearby Exhall School who had struck. In a House of Commons statement on 18 March, Thatcher said, [...] "I very much regret any embarrassment or offence to the teachers of this school which may have followed from <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> last Thursday. The misunderstanding arose because publicity material from the National Union of Teachers was in error. It was Exhall school which was affected; Exhall Grange school was not." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, a more {{systematic}} {{use of the}} phrase [...] "Golden Age of Piracy" [...] was introduced by historian John Fiske, who wrote: [...] "At no other time in the world's history has the business of piracy thriven so greatly as {{in the seventeenth century}} and {{the first part of the}} eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have extended from about 1650 to about 1720." [...] Fiske included the activities of the Barbary corsairs and East Asian pirates in this [...] "Golden Age," [...] noting that [...] "as these Mussulman pirates and those of Eastern Asia were as busily at work in the seventeenth century as at any other time, their case does not impair <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> that the age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of piracy." ...|$|E

In both the latter offences significant sums of money were paid to the police to effect the outcome...While operating as a prostitute I made regular payments {{to members of the}} Vice Squad over ten years. I have been involved in a number of transactions which I referred to in <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> which have involved substantial payment to members of the Drug Squad and other detectives relating to drug matters. I believe that the New South Wales Drug Squad and the Armed Hold-Up Squad are both totally corrupt and that they feed on the very activities which they are supposed to stop." ...|$|E
2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country where we could do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E

6000|$|As far as I can guess, {{the next}} thing that {{happened}} was that some timid or unawakened member of the Committee read <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> and was frightened or scandalized out of his wits by it. At all events {{it is certain that}} the majority of the Committee allowed themselves to be persuaded to refuse to allow any statement to be read; but to avoid the appearance of pointing this expressly at me, the form adopted was a resolution to adhere strictly to precedent, the Committee being then unaware that the precedents were on my side. Accordingly, when I appeared before the Committee, and proposed to read <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> [...] "according to precedent," [...] the Committee was visibly taken aback. The Chairman was bound by the letter of the decision arrived at to allow me to read <b>my</b> <b>statement,</b> since that course was according to precedent; but as this was exactly what the decision was meant to prevent, the majority of the Committee would have regarded this hoisting of them with their own petard as a breach of faith on the part of the Chairman, who, I infer, was not in agreement with the suppressive majority. There was nothing for it, after a somewhat awkward pause, but to clear me and the public out of the room and reconsider the situation IN CAMERA. When the doors were opened again I was informed simply that the Committee would not hear <b>my</b> <b>statement,</b> but as the Committee could not very decently refuse my evidence altogether, the Chairman, with a printed copy of <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> in his hand as [...] "proof," [...] was able to come to the rescue to some extent by putting to me a series of questions to which no doubt I might have replied by taking another copy out of my pocket, and quoting <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> paragraph by paragraph, as some of the later witnesses did. But as in offering the Committee <b>my</b> <b>statement</b> for burial in their bluebook I had made a considerable sacrifice, being able to secure greater publicity for it by independent publication on my own account; and as, further, the circumstances of the refusal made it offensive enough to take all heart out of the scrupulous consideration with which I had so far treated the Committee, I was not disposed to give its majority a second chance, or to lose the opportunity offered me by the questions to fire an additional broadside into the censorship. I pocketed <b>my</b> <b>statement,</b> and answered the questions VIVA VOCE. At the conclusion of this, my examination- in-chief, the Committee adjourned, asking me to present myself again for (virtually) cross-examination. But this cross- examination never came off, as the sequel will shew.|$|E
