40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the use of Cold Gas Spray {{technology}} (CGS) to spray different nature powders onto light alloys with the aim of increasing their wear resistance. The growing industrial interest for costs reduction (fuel consumption, machinery lifetime, or personal security) has emphasized the necessity to investigate the potential applications that light alloys can offer. Weight reduction is a reason why light metals and its alloys have been associated with strong industries as transport or aerospace. Nevertheless, weight saving aspect should not opaque the fact that light metals possess other “relevant technological” properties like the high corrosion resistance and high electrical and thermal conductivity of aluminium, the machinability of magnesium and the extreme corrosion resistance of titanium. It {{must be taken into account}} that despite these technological importance properties, due to their density, among some other physical properties, aluminium and magnesium have a low hardness and low wear resistance, which provokes the need of improving its surface properties. The main objective has been the obtention and optimization of Ti 6 Al 4 V and 316 L stainless steel coatings onto light alloys, by means of Cold Gas Spray technology, a thermal spray technique which provides a dense and with no oxidation traces coatings, keeping the original microstructure of the spraying powders. Ti 6 Al 4 V and SS 316 L coatings have been produced onto Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 substrates and Ti 6 Al 4 V coatings have been also produced onto Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate. Actually industrial machinery made of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, that due to use has been damaged, needs repair and it will be easily repairable through this technique leading to a reduction in costs and repair times. In the present thesis, coatings based on Ti 6 Al 4 V and Stainless Steel 316 L have been successfully obtained by means of Cold Gas Spray Technologies onto three different light alloys (Ti 6 Al 4 V, Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31) improving their properties with respect to wear and corrosion resistance. Two different powder morphologies (spherical and irregular) of each spraying material have been tested onto the three substrates. Coatings have been obtained under the conditions of two different design of experiments, each one developed for the different used cold gas spray guns (KINETIC 8000 and KINETIC 4000) From the obtained coatings and its properties it can be said that: Irregular powders reach higher in flight velocities than the spherical ones due to drag coefficient, and despite both powders have the same hardness, the deposition efficiencies of the spherical powders are higher. Irregular powders are more oxidized due to production process (gas atomization vs. hydride-dehydride and water atomization) and this reduces the DE. Comparing both systems, spherical Ti 6 Al 4 V and irregular Ti 6 Al 4 V spraying powders, higher deposition efficiencies are obtained with spherical powder, arriving to 140 % higher on the optimal spraying conditions. As the spraying temperature and pressure increases, deposition efficiency does it also because more particles are reaching its critical velocity. In addition, porosity reduces because particles are more ductile due to the temperature and they are able to deform more closing the existing pores of the coating. For structural applications where the light alloy structures would undergo to wear and corrosion processes, coatings must be thick and dense. Fully dense coatings have been obtained using He as propellant, gas protecting the substrates against corrosion, but He is more than 4 times expensive than N 2. When spraying powder on substrate with the same or similar nature, as it happened with Ti 6 Al 4 V spraying powder and Titanium or Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate, <b>microfusions</b> are produced due to impact, making strong the bond between particles and substrate, but when spraying powder and substrate has different nature and properties (hardness, ductility, thermal conductivity, crystal structure, deformation mechanism), as it has been seen with Ti 6 Al 4 V as spraying powder and Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 as substrates, mechanical bonding is produced by anchoring. No fusion zones are founded. The obtained results of cavitation test, have helped to identify experimentally CGS bonding mechanisms as a function of particle/substrate nature. The order in bonding strength is Ti, Ti 6 Al 4 V, Al- 7075 -T 6 and finally AZ 31. These results are in accordance to those obtained with adhesion tests. Concerning to corrosion resistance, the obtained Ti 6 Al 4 V coatings onto the three substrates, using He as propellant gas, are fully resistant to corrosion. After 24 hours testing, no electrolyte has reached substrate surface showing fully resistance and ensuring the accomplishment of ASTM D- 1411 standard. SS 316 L coatings onto Al- 7075 -T 6 and AZ 31 substrates, using N 2 as propellant gas, are fully resistant to corrosion, following the same standard as before. Esta tesis se centra en el uso de la tecnología de Cold Gas Spray para proyectar polvos micrométricos sobre diferentes aleaciones ligeras con el fin de obtener un recubrimiento que aumente la resistencia al desgaste y a la corrosión. El creciente interés por parte de la industria en reducir al máximo los costes (consumo de combustible, duración maquinaria, o la seguridad personal) ha fomentado la necesidad de investigar las posibles aplicaciones que las aleaciones ligeras pueden ofrecer. La reducción de peso es una razón por la cual los metales ligeros y sus aleaciones se han asociado con fuertes industrias como el transporte o la industria aeroespacial. Sin embargo, los aspectos de ahorro de peso no debe ocultar el hecho de que los metales ligeros poseen otras propiedades "tecnológicas" como la alta resistencia a la corrosión y alta conductividad eléctrica y térmica del aluminio, la mecanizabilidad de magnesio y la resistencia a la corrosión extrema de titanio. Hay que tener en cuenta que a pesar de estas propiedades de importancia tecnológica, debido a su densidad el aluminio y magnesio tienen una baja dureza y una baja resistencia al desgaste, lo que provoca la necesidad de mejorar sus propiedades superficiales. El objetivo principal ha sido la obtención y optimización de recubrimientos de Ti 6 Al 4 V y de acero inoxidable 316 L sobre aleaciones ligeras a través del uso de técnicas de proyección térmica, concretamente la proyección fría (Cold Gas Spray), que permite obtener recubrimientos densos y sin rastros de oxidación manteniendo la microestructura original de los materiales de partida, tanto los sustratos como los polvos de proyección. Se han obtenido satisfactoriamente recubrimientos de Ti 6 Al 4 V y SS 316 L sobre sustratos de Al- 7075 -T 6, AZ 31 y Ti 6 Al 4 V con eficiencias cercanas al 100 % y porosidades menores al 0, 1 %. Se ha mejorado la resistencia al desgaste en un 300 % con respecto a los sustratos de partida, y la resistencia a la corrosión de los sustratos empleados debido a la formación de recubrimientos completamente densos. También se han obtenido de forma experimental indicios que confirman las teorías de enlace establecidas hasta el momento para el proceso de proyección fría, entre las partículas y el sustrato así como entre las propias partículas depositadas...|$|R

40|$|The oxygen-limiting (hypoxic) {{microenvironment}} of tumors induces metabolic reprogramming {{and cell}} survival, but {{the underlying mechanisms}} involving mitochondria remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 mediates the hyperfusion of mitochondria by inducing Bcl- 2 /adenovirus E 1 B 19 -kDa interacting protein 3 and posttranslational truncation of the mitochondrial ATP transporter outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel 1 in hypoxic cells. In addition, we showed that truncation is associated with increased resistance to drug-induced apoptosis and is indicative of increased patient chemoresistance. We now show that silencing of the tumor suppressor TP 53 decreases truncation and increases drug-induced apoptosis. We also show that TP 53 regulates truncation through induction of the mitochondrial protein Mieap. While we found that truncation was independent of mitophagy, we observed local <b>microfusion</b> between mitochondria and endolysosomes in hypoxic cells in culture and in patients' tumor tissues. Since {{we found that the}} endolysosomal asparagine endopeptidase was responsible for truncation, we propose that it is a readout of mitochondrial-endolysosomal <b>microfusion</b> in hypoxia.

40|$|Measles and canine {{distemper}} viruses (MeV and CDV, respectively) first replicate in lymphatic and epithelial tissues by using SLAM and nectin- 4 as entry receptors, respectively. The viruses may also invade {{the brain to}} establish persistent infections, triggering fatal complications, such as subacute sclerosis pan-encephalitis (SSPE) in MeV infection or chronic, multiple sclerosis-like, multifocal demyelinating lesions {{in the case of}} CDV infection. In both diseases, persistence is mediated by viral nucleocapsids that do not require packaging into particles for infectivity but are directly transmitted from cell to cell (neurons in SSPE or astrocytes in distemper encephalitis), presumably by relying on restricted <b>microfusion</b> events. Indeed, although morphological evidence of fusion remained undetectable, viral fusion machineries and, thus, a putative cellular receptor, were shown to contribute to persistent infections. Here, we first showed that nectin- 4 -dependent cell-cell fusion in Vero cells, triggered by a demyelinating CDV strain, remained extremely limited, thereby supporting a potential role of nectin- 4 in mediating persistent infections in astrocytes. However, nectin- 4 could not be detected in either primary cultured astrocytes or the white matter of tissue sections. In addition, a bioengineered "nectin- 4 -blind" recombinant CDV retained full cell-to-cell transmission efficacy in primary astrocytes. Combined with our previous report demonstrating the absence of SLAM expression in astrocytes, these findings are suggestive for the existence of a hitherto unrecognized third CDV receptor expressed by glial cells that contributes to the induction of noncytolytic cell-to-cell viral transmission in astrocytes. IMPORTANCE: While persistent measles virus (MeV) infection induces SSPE in humans, persistent {{canine distemper}} virus (CDV) infection causes chronic progressive or relapsing demyelination in carnivores. Common to both central nervous system (CNS) infections is that persistence is based on noncytolytic cell-to-cell spread, which, in the case of CDV, was demonstrated to rely on functional membrane fusion machinery complexes. This inferred a mechanism where nucleocapsids are transmitted through macroscopically invisible <b>microfusion</b> events between infected and target cells. Here, we provide evidence that CDV induces such microfusions in a SLAM- and nectin- 4 -independent manner, thereby strongly suggesting the existence of a third receptor expressed in glial cells (referred to as GliaR). We propose that GliaR governs intercellular transfer of nucleocapsids and hence contributes to viral persistence in the brain and ensuing demyelinating lesions...|$|E

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the most}} {{challenging}} tasks of the brain is to constantly update the internal neural representations of existing memories. Animal studies have used invasive methods such as direct <b>microfusion</b> of protein inhibitors to designated brain areas, in order to study the neural mechanisms underlying modification of already existing memories after their reactivation during recall [1 – 4]. Because such interventions are not possible in humans, it is not known how these neural processes operate in the human brain. In a series of experiments we show here that when an existing human motor memory is reactivated during recall, modification of the memory is blocked by virtual lesion [5] of the related primary cortical human brain area. The virtual lesion was induced by noninvasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation guided by a frameless stereotactic brain navigation system and each subject's brain image. The results demonstrate that primary cortical processing in the human brain interacting with pre-existing reactivated memory traces is critical for successful modification of the existing related memory. Modulation of reactivated memories by noninvasive cortical stimulation may have important implications for human memory research and have far-reaching clinical applications...|$|E

In 1998, issues including design, safety and transportation were considered for the MSFC High Performance Antimatter Trap (HiPAT).

40|$|Measles virus (MV) can infect {{the central}} nervous system and, in rare cases, causes {{subacute}} sclerosing panencephalitis, characterized by a progressive degeneration of neurons. The route of MV transmission in neurons was investigated in cultured rat hippocampal slices by using MV expressing green fluorescent protein. MV infected hippocampal neurons and spread unidirectionally, in a retrograde manner, from CA 1 to CA 3 pyramidal cells and from there to the dentate gyrus. Spreading of infection depended on cell-to-cell contact and occurred without any detectable release of infectious particles. The role of the viral proteins in the retrograde MV transmission was determined by investigating their sorting in infected pyramidal cells. MV glycoproteins, the fusion protein (F) and hemagglutinin (H), the matrix protein (M), and the phosphoprotein (P), {{which is part of the}} viral ribonucleoprotein complex, were all sorted to the dendrites. While M, P, and H proteins remained more intracellular, the F protein localized to prominent, spine-type domains at the surface of infected cells.

40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed model for in vitro generation of pp 65 -positive polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs), we demonstrated that PMNLs from immunocompetent subjects may harbor both infectious human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and viral products (pp 65, p 72, DNA, and immediate-early [IE] and pp 67 late mRNAs) {{as early as}} 60 min after coculture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELF) infected with a clinical HCMV isolate (VR 6110) or other wild-type strains. The number of PMNLs positive for each viral parameter increased with coculture time. Using HELF infected with laboratory-adapted HCMV strains, only very small amounts of viral DNA and IE and late mRNAs were detected in PMNLs. A cellular mRNA, the vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 mRNA, which is abundantly present in both infected and uninfected HUVEC, was detected in much larger amounts in PMNLs cocultured with VR 6110 -infected cells than in controls. Coculture of PMNLs with VR 6110 -infected permissive cells in {{the presence or absence}} of RNA, protein, and viral DNA synthesis inhibitors showed that only IE genes were transcribed in PMNLs during coculture. Synthesis of IE transcripts in PMNLs was also supported by the finding that only the copy number of IE mRNA (and not the DNA or the pp 67 mRNA) per infected PMNL increased markedly with time, and the pp 67 to IE mRNA copy number ratio changed from greater than 10 in infected HUVEC to less than 1 in cocultured PMNLs. Fluorescent probe transfer experiments and electron microscopy studies indicated that transfer of infectious virus and viral products from infected cells to PMNLs is likely to be mediated by <b>microfusion</b> events induced by wild-type strains only. In addition, HCMV pp 65 and p 72 were both shown to localize in the nucleus of the same PMNLs by double immunostaining. Two different mechanisms may explain the virus presence in PMNLs: (i) one major mechanism consists of transitory <b>microfusion</b> events (induced by wild-type strains only) of HUVEC or HELF and PMNLs with transfer of viable virus and biologically active viral material to PMNLs; and (ii) one minor mechanism, i. e., endocytosis, occurs with both wild-type and laboratory strains and leads to the acquisition of very small amounts of viral nucleic acids. In conclusion, HCMV replicates abortively in PMNLs, and wild-type strains and their products (as well as cellular metabolites and fluorescent dyes) are transferred to PMNLs, thus providing evidence for a potential mechanism of HCMV dissemination in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{desire for}} fast, {{efficient}} interplanetary transport requires propulsion systems having short acceleration times and very {{high specific impulse}} attributes. Unfortunately, most highly efficient propulsion systems which are within the capabilities of present day technologies are either very heavy or yield very low impulse such that the acceleration time to final velocity is too long to be of lasting interest, One exception, the nuclear thermal thruster, could achieve the desired acceleration but it would require inordinately large mass ratios to reach the range of desired final velocities. An alternative approach, among several competing concepts that are beyond our modern technical capabilities, is a pulsed thermonuclear device utilizing <b>microfusion</b> detonations. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of an innovative magnetic flux compression concept for utilizing <b>microfusion</b> detonations, assuming that such low yield nuclear bursts can be realized in practice. In this concept, a magnetic field is compressed between an expanding detonation driven diamagnetic plasma and a stationary structure formed from a high temperature superconductor (HTSC). In general, {{we are interested in}} accomplishing two important functions: (1) collimation of a hot diamagnetic plasma for direct thrust production; and (2) pulse power generation for dense plasma ignition. For the purposes of this research, it is assumed that rnicrofusion detonation technology may become available within a few decades, and that this approach could capitalize on recent advances in inertial confinement fusion ICF) technologies including magnetized target concepts and antimatter initiated nuclear detonations. The charged particle expansion velocity in these detonations can be on the order of 10 (exp 6) - 10 (exp 7) meters per second, and, if effectively collimated by a magnetic nozzle, can yield the Isp and the acceleration levels needed for practical interplanetary spaceflight. The ability to ignite pure fusion micro-bursts with reasonable levels of input energy is an equally challenging scientific problem. It remains to be seen, however, whether an effective ignition driver can be developed which meets the requirements for practical spaceflight application (namely high power density, compactness, low weight, and low cost). In this paper, system level performance and design issues are examined including generator performance, magnetic flux compression processes, magnetic diffusion processes, high temperature superconductor (HTSC) material properties, plasmadynamic processes, detonation plasma expansion processes, magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, magnetic nozzle performance, and thrust production performance. Representative generator performance calculations based on a simplified skin layer formulation are presented as well as the results of exploratory small-scale laboratory experiments on magnetic flux diffusion in HTSC materials.

Optimal downregulation efficiency was obtained with CD 46 recombinants containing CCP domains 1 and 2, whereas CCP 1, alone and duplicated, induced a slight downregulation. Using persistently infected monocytic/promyelocytic U 937 cells which release very small amounts of infectious virus, and uninfected HeLa cells as contact partners, we then showed that during contact the formation of CD 46 -containing patches and caps precedes CD 46 internalization. Nevertheless, neither substances inhibiting capping nor the fusion-inhibiting peptide Z-d-Phe-l-Phe-Gly-OH (FIP) blocked CD 46 downregulation. Thus, CD 46 downregulation can be uncoupled from fusion and subsequent virus uptake. Interestingly, in that system cell-cell contacts lead to a remarkably efficient infection of the target cells which is only partially inhibited by FIP. The finding that the contact of an infected with uninfected cells results in transfer of infectious viral material without significant (complete) fusion of the donor with the recipient cell suggests that <b>microfusion</b> events and/or FIP-independent mechanisms may mediate the transfer of MV infectivity from cell to cell...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite the {{identification}} of essential processes in which cell fusion plays spectacular roles such as in fertilization and development of muscle, bone, and placenta [1 – 5], there are no identified proteins that directly mediate developmental cell fusion reactions. C. elegans has recently become among the best-characterized models to use for studying developmental cell fusion [5 – 15]. The eff- 1 (epithelial fusion failure) gene encodes novel type I membrane proteins required for epithelial cell fusion. Analysis of eff- 1 mutants showed that cell fusion normally restricts routes for cell migration and establishes body and organ shape and size [5, 8, 9, 11]. Here, we explored cell fusion by using time-lapse confocal and electron microscopy of different organs. We found that ectopic expression of eff- 1 is sufficient to fuse epithelial cells that do not normally fuse. This ectopic fusion results in cytoplasmic content mixing and disappearance of apical junctions, starting less than 50 min {{after the start of}} eff- 1 transcription. We found that eff- 1 is necessary to initiate and expand multiple <b>microfusion</b> events between pharyngeal muscle cells. Surprisingly, eff- 1 is not required to fuse the gonadal anchor cell to uterine cells. Thus, eff- 1 is sufficient and essential for most but not all cell fusion events during C. elegans development...|$|E
40|$|Heavy-ion {{induction}} accelerators {{are being}} developed as fusion drivers for ICF power production in the US Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) program, in the Office of Fusion Energy of the US Department of Energy. In addition, they represent an attractive driver option for a high-yield <b>microfusion</b> facility for defense research. This paper describes recent progress in induction drivers for Heavy-Ion Fusion (HIF), and plans for future work. It presents research aimed at developing drivers having reduced cost and size, specifically advanced induction linacs and recirculating induction accelerators (recirculators). The goals and design of the Elise accelerator being built at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL), as {{the first stage of}} the ILSE (Induction Linac Systems Experiments) program, are described. Elise will accelerate, for the first time, space-charge-dominated ion beams which are of full driver scale in line-charge density and diameter. Elise will be a platform on which the critical beam manipulations of the induction approach can be explored. An experimental program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) exploring the recirculator principle on a small scale is described in some detail; it is expected that these studies will result ultimately in an operational prototype recirculating induction accelerator. In addition, other elements of the US HIF program are described...|$|E
40|$|From 1988 to 1991, the US Department of Energy {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} requirements, designs and costs for a Laboratory <b>Microfusion</b> Facility (LMF). The primary purpose of the LMF would be testing of weapons physics and effects simulation using the output from microexplosions of inertial fusion targets. It does not need a high repetition rate, efficient driver system as required by an electrical generating plant; however there would be so many features in common that the design, construction and operation of an LMF would considerably advance the application of inertial confinement fusion to energy production. The DOE study concentrated particularly on the LMF driver, with design and component development undertaken at several national laboratories. Heavy Ions, although considered a possible LMF driver, did not receive attention until the final stages of this study since its program management was through the Office of Energy Research rather than Defense Programs. However, during preparation of the summary report for the study it was decided that an account of heavy ions was needed for a complete survey of the driver candidates. The conceptual heavy ion LMF driver design created for the DOE report did not receive the level of scrutiny of the other driver concepts and, unlike the others, no cost analysis by an independent contractor was performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{reovirus}} fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins are virus-encoded membrane fusion {{proteins that}} function as dedicated cell-cell fusogens. The topology of these small, single-pass membrane proteins orients {{the majority of}} the protein on the distal side of the membrane (i. e., inside the cell). We now show that ectopic expression of the endodomains of the p 10, p 14, and p 15 FAST proteins enhances syncytiogenesis induced by the full-length FAST proteins, both homotypically and heterotypically. Results further indicate that the 68 -residue cytoplasmic endodomain of the p 14 FAST protein (1) is endogenously generated from full-length p 14 protein expressed in virus-infected or transfected cells; (2) enhances syncytiogenesis subsequent to stable pore formation; (3) increases the syncytiogenic activity of heterologous fusion proteins, including the differentiation-dependent fusion of murine myoblasts; (4) exerts its enhancing activity from the cytosol, independent of direct interactions with either the fusogen or the membranes being fused; and (5) contains several regions with protein-protein interaction motifs that influence enhancing activity. We propose that the unique evolution of the FAST proteins as virus-encoded cellular fusogens has allowed them to generate a trans-acting, soluble endodomain peptide to harness a cellular pathway or process involved in the poorly understood process that facilitates the transition from <b>microfusion</b> pores to macrofusion and syncytiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{power output}} of plasma {{experiments}} and fusion reactors {{is a crucial}} parameter. It is determined by neutron yields that are proportional and {{directly related to the}} fusion yield. The number of emitted neutrons should be known for safety reasons and for neutron budget management. The PF- 1000 is the large plasma facility based on the plasma focus phenomenon. PF- 1000 is operating in the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser <b>Microfusion</b> in Warsaw. Neutron yield changes during subsequent pulses, which is immanent part of this type device and so it must be monitored in terms of neutron emission. The reference diagnostic intended for this purpose is the silver activation counter (SAC) used for many years. Our previous studies demonstrated the applicability of radio-yttrium for neutron yield measurements during the deuterium campaign on the PF- 1000 facility. The obtained results were compared with data from silver activation counter and shown linear dependence but with some protuberances in local scale. Correlation between results for both neutron monitors was maintained. But the yttrium monitor registered the fast energy neutron that reached measurement apparatus directly from the plasma pinch. Based on the preliminary experiences, the yttrium monitor was designed to automatically register neutron-induced yttrium activity. The MCNP geometrical model of PF- 1000 and yttrium monitor were both used for calculation of the activation coefficient for yttrium. The yttrium monitor has been established as the permanent diagnostic for monitoring fusion reactions in the PF- 1000 device...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{comparison of}} two silicon drift detectors (SDD), one made by Amptek, USA, {{and the second}} one by PNDetector, Germany, which are considered for a soft X-ray diagnostic system for W 7 -X. The sensitive area of {{the first one is}} 7 mm 2 × 450 μm and the second one is 10 mm 2 × 450 μm. The first detector is cooled by a double-stage Peltier element, while the second detector is cooled by single-stage Peltier element. Each one is equipped with a field-effect transistor (FET). In the detector from Amptek, the FET is mounted separately, while in the detector from PNDetector, the FET is integrated on the chip. The nominal energy resolution given by the producers of the first and the second one is 136 eV@ 5. 9 keV (at - 50 °C) and 132 eV@ 5. 9 keV (at - 20 °C), respectively. Owing to many advantages, the investigated detectors are good candidates for soft X-ray measurements in magnetic confinement devices. They are suitable for soft X-ray diagnostics, like the pulse height analysis (PHA) system for the stellarator Wendelstein 7 -X, which has been developed and manufactured at the Institute of Plasma Physics and Laser <b>Microfusion</b> (IPPLM), Warsaw, in collaboration with the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP), Greifswald. The diagnostic is important for the measurements of plasma electron temperature, impurities content, and possible suprathermal tails in the spectra. In order to choose the best type of detector, analysis of technical parameters and laboratory tests were done. Detailed studies show that the most suitable detector for the PHA diagnostics is the PNDetector...|$|E
40|$|Achievement of {{inertial}} fusion {{ignition and}} energy {{gain in the}} proposed U. S. National Ignition Facility {{is a prerequisite for}} decisions to build next-step U. S. inertial fusion facilities for either high yield or high pulse-rate. There are a variety of target and driver options for such next-step inertial fusion test facilities, and this paper discusses possible ways that the NIF, using a 1. 8 MJ glass laser in both direct and indirect-drive configurations, can provide target physics data relevant to several next-step facility options. Next step facility options include the Engineering Test Facility (ETF), which needs several-Hz pulse-rates for testing relevant to Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) development. An option for high yield, called the Laboratory <b>Microfusion</b> Facility (LMF), does not require such high pulse-rates, but may still benefit from driver technologies capable of much higher shot rates than possible with glass lasers. A high-pulse-rate driver could also be used for a combined ETF/LMF facility, driving multiple target chambers with a common driver. Driver technologies that could support high-pulse rates for next-step options include heavy-ion and light-ion accelerators, diode-pumped solid-state lasers (DPSSL), and krypton-flouride gas lasers. The NIF could be used to provide important data for IFE in generic areas of target chamber damage and materials responses, neutron activation and heating, tritium recovery and safety, and in performance tests of prototypical IFE targets and injection systems. In the study of ignition in both direct and indirect-drive, the NIF would explore generic ICF fuel capsule implosion physics common to all driver and target options for next-step facilities. In the following, we point out specific ways in which the NIF could be used to study target physics specifically relevant to the above-mentioned driver options for such next-step facilities, as well as how the NIF laser system itself could be relevant to the DPSSL option...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate system level performance and design issues associated with magnetic flux compression devices for aerospace power generation and propulsion. The proposed concept incorporates the principles of magnetic flux compression for direct conversion of nuclear/chemical detonation energy into electrical power. Specifically a magnetic field is compressed between an expanding detonation driven diamagnetic plasma and a stator structure formed from a high temperature superconductor (HTSC). The expanding plasma cloud is entirely confined by the compressed magnetic field at the expense of internal kinetic energy. Electrical power is inductively extracted, and the detonation products are collimated and expelled through a magnetic nozzle. The long-term development of this highly integrated generator/propulsion system opens up revolutionary NASA Mission scenarios for future interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft. The unique features of this concept with respect to future space travel opportunities are as follows: ability to implement high energy density chemical detonations or ICF <b>microfusion</b> bursts as the impulsive diamagnetic plasma source; high power density system characteristics constrain the size, weight, and cost of the vehicle architecture; provides inductive storage pulse power with a very short pulse rise time; multimegajoule energy bursts/terawatt power bursts; compact pulse power driver for low-impedance dense plasma devices; utilization of low cost HTSC material and casting technology to increase magnetic flux conservation and inductive energy storage; improvement in chemical/nuclear-to-electric energy conversion efficiency and the ability to generate significant levels of thrust with very high specific impulse; potential for developing a small, lightweight, low cost, self-excited integrated propulsion and power system suitable for space stations, planetary bases, and interplanetary and interstellar space travel; potential for attaining specific impulses approaching 10 (exp 6) seconds, which would enable missions to the outer planets within ten years and missions at interstellar distances within fifty years...|$|E
