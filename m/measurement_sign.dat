When the arriving eastward train stopped at this location, the arriving head-end train crew would disembark and the outgoing crew would board the locomotive. This new crew would then advise the train crew in the caboose by radio that they were on board. The caboose crew would acknowledge this message and advise the new head-end crew if sixty pounds of air pressure was displayed in the caboose air pressure gauge. If this number had been attained, then the caboose crew member would direct the head-end crew to start the train brake testing process which was done at every station during these years. The caboose crew would also note the location of the caboose in relation to a <b>measurement</b> <b>sign</b> and communicate that information to the local yard office and from there to the dispatcher.|$|E

In this study, we compared immunoregulatory markers on blood leukocytes from patients with Gram-negative or Gram-positive sepsis or septic shock, and compared this to blood from patients with severe virosis or healthy controls. To this end, blood from 32 patients with sepsis, including ten cases with shock, and 12 patients with severe virosis were analysed by flow cytometry for the expression levels of monocyte HLA-DR, CD 11 c, CD 14 and CD 40, and for frequencies of CD 163 (+) -suppressive monocytes, HLA-DR(+) or CD 40 (+) -activated T cells and Tregs.

The BPAF is a systems based checklist of physiological <b>measurements,</b> <b>signs,</b> and symptoms designed to structure and document the assessment of a patients physical condition by nursing staff. Initially the BPAF was refined using extensive literature review and expert opinion to improve the comprehensiveness and clarity for its intended purpose. As a result the content validity of the BPAF was supported. Inter-rater reliability between both expert-expert and novice-expert pairings was assessed. A total of 68 assessments were conducted by pairs of qualified nurses with patients on general medical and surgical wards and a nursing-led unit in one London Hospital. Reliability of the dichotomous data items of the BPAF was found to be generally good (kappa > 0. 6) with only one item showing a poor reliability (kappa < 0. 20). Reliability for continuous items such as pulse and respiratory rate was surprisingly low with evidence of large variation between raters in addition to systematic bias. With relatively little teaching, novice assessors were able to use the BPAF and achieve good inter-rater reliability with expert assessors although this was lower than the reliability of the expert diads. The utilisation of the BPAF to fulfil intended purpose was assessed by examining completed assessments and the outcome in terms of nurses' actions in light of new abnormal findings. Both were found to be fair, showing that the BPAF does affect the actions of nurses although it could be utilised more...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Measurement</b> {{of vital}} <b>signs</b> in hospitalized {{patients}} {{is necessary to}} assess the clinical situation of the patient. Early warning scores (EWS), such as the modified early warning score (MEWS), are generally calculated 3 times a day, but these may not capture early deterioration. A delay in diagnosing deterioration is associated with increased mortality. Continuous monitoring with wearable devices might detect clinical deterioration at an earlier stage, which allows clinicians to take corrective actions. OBJECTIVE: In this pilot study, the feasibility of continuous monitoring using the ViSi Mobile (VM; Sotera Wireless) and HealthPatch (HP; Vital Connect) was tested, and the experiences of patients and nurses were collected. METHODS: In this feasibility study, 20 patients at the internal medicine and surgical ward were monitored with VM and HP simultaneously for 2 to 3 days. Technical problems were analyzed. Vital <b>sign</b> <b>measurements</b> by nurses were taken as reference and compared with vital signs measured by both devices. Patient and nurse experiences were obtained by semistructured interviews. RESULTS: In total, 86 out of 120 MEWS measurements {{were used for the}} analysis. Vital <b>sign</b> <b>measurements</b> by VM and HP were generally consistent with nurse measurements. In 15 % (N= 13) and 27 % (N= 23) of the VM and HP cases respectively, clinically relevant differences in MEWS were found based on inconsistent respiratory rate registrations. Connection failure was recognized as a predominant VM artifact (70 %). Over 50 % of all HP artifacts had an unknown cause, were self-limiting, and never took longer than 1 hour. The majority of patients, relatives, and nurses were positive about VM and HP. CONCLUSIONS: Both VM and HP are promising for continuously monitoring vital signs in hospitalized patients, if the frequency and duration of artifacts are reduced. The devices were well received and comfortable for most patients...|$|R
