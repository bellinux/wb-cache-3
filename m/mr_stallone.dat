2500|$|In 2006, Trekweb and TrekToday {{announced}} that Avery Brooks {{would take a}} role in the film Rambo. Brooks himself later said this was not the case. He said [...] "I've met <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stallone,</b> many years ago — I have great respect for <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stallone,</b> always did. However, Rambo is not in my future." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tom Huddleston of Time Out London {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} five stars, commenting that the film [...] "would have made a perfect vehicle for, say, a Chuck Norris or even a Jean-Claude Van Damme. But these two redoubtable, {{enormously}} watchable old-school heroes deserve better." [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, commenting that it [...] "defies those who wrote off the abilities of its stars to cut the muscular mustard in today's youth-orientated cultural climate. These supposedly old dogs have plenty of life—but their effectiveness relies on the foundation of a smart script that plays to their strengths and the audience's perception of their star personas." [...] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said in his review: [...] "Mikael Hafstrom, the director, pushes the suspense buttons efficiently, and the plot twists are disguised well enough for the not-very-demanding crowd this film will draw. The scenes with <b>Mr.</b> <b>Stallone</b> and Mr. Schwarzenegger are a little disappointing — it's their first pairing as top-billed co-stars, yet the script never gives them the kind of memorable exchange that makes fans howl with delight. But all in all, Escape Plan does what it sets out to do." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, Ingalls {{was named}} when Sylvester Stallone was sued for divorce by his wife, Sasha, [...] "who claimed {{the star of}} Rocky used {{community}} funds for a vacation for himself and actress Joyce Ingalls." [...] Earlier that year, gossip columnist Liz Smith had written: [...] "Sylvester ("Sly") Stallone and his Paradise Valley co-star Joyce Ingalls are {{what one might call}} a real hot item. <b>Mrs.</b> <b>Stallone</b> knows all about it and is definitely not happy." ...|$|R

40|$|Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Programme for the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans {{has been}} criticized for several of its evaluations, and also for the {{approach}} used to perform these evaluations. Some critics have claimed that failures of IARC Working Groups to recognize study weaknesses and biases of Working Group members have led to inappropriate classification of a number of agents as carcinogenic to humans. The authors of this Commentary are scientists from various disciplines relevant to the identification and hazard evaluation of human carcinogens. We examined criticisms of the IARC classification process to determine the validity of these concerns. Here, we present the results of that examination, review the history of IARC evaluations, and describe how the IARC evaluations are performed. We concluded that these recent criticisms are unconvincing. The procedures employed by IARC to assemble Working Groups of scientists from the various disciplines and the techniques followed to review the literature and perform hazard assessment of various agents provide a balanced evaluation and an appropriate indication of the weight of the evidence. Some disagreement by individual scientists to some evaluations is not evidence of process failure. The review process has been modified over time and will undoubtedly be altered in the future to improve the process. Any process can in theory be improved, and we would support continued review and improvement of the IARC processes. This does not mean, however, that the current procedures are flawed. The IARC Monographs have made, and continue to make, major contributions to the scientific underpinning for societal actions to improve the public's health.
