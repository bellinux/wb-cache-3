40|$|Context: Determining stellar {{characteristics}} such as the radius, mass or age is crucial {{for the study of}} stellar evolution, exoplanetary systems or the characterisation of stellar populations in the Galaxy. Asteroseismology is currently the most promising tool to accurately determine these characteristics. However, a key question is how to reduce the model dependence of asteroseismic methods. Method: We extend the SOLA inversion technique to new global characteristics in addition to the mean density (see Reese et al. 2012). We apply our methodology to the acoustic radius and an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative. The results from SOLA inversions are compared with estimates based on the small and large frequency separations for several test cases, including differing <b>mixing-lengths,</b> and {{the presence or absence of}} non-adiabatic effects or turbulent pressure.

40|$|Context. Determining stellar {{characteristics}} such as the radius, mass or age is crucial when studying stellar evolution or exoplanetary systems, or when characterising stellar populations in the Galaxy. Asteroseismology is the golden path to accurately obtain these characteristics. In this context, a key {{question is how to}} make these methods less model-dependent. Aims: Building on the previous work of Daniel Reese, we wish to extend the Substractive Optimally Localized Averages (SOLA) inversion technique to new stellar global characteristics beyond the mean density. The goal is to provide a general framework in which to estimate these characteristics as accurately as possible in low-mass main-sequence stars. Methods: First, we describe our framework and discuss the reliability of the inversion technique and possible sources of error. We then apply this methodology to the acoustic radius, an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative and the mean density, and compare it to estimates based on the average large and small frequency separations. These inversions are carried out for several test cases including various metallicities, different <b>mixing-lengths,</b> non-adiabatic effects, and turbulent pressure. Results: We observe that the SOLA method yields accurate results in all test cases whereas results based on the large and small frequency separations are less accurate and more sensitive to surface effects and structural differences in the models. If we include the surface corrections of Kjeldsen et al. (2008, ApJ, 683, L 175), we obtain results of comparable accuracy for the mean density. Overall, the mean density and acoustic radius inversions are more robust than the inversions for the age indicator. Moreover, the current approach is limited to relatively young stars with radiative cores. Increasing the number of observed frequencies improves the reliability and accuracy of the method.

40|$|Stellar {{convection}} is customarily {{described by}} <b>Mixing-Length</b> Theory, which {{makes use of}} the <b>mixing-length</b> scale to express the convective flux, velocity, and temperature gradients of the convective elements and stellar medium. The <b>mixing-length</b> scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scale height, and the proportionality factor (the <b>mixing-length</b> parameter) must be determined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun. No strong arguments exist {{to suggest that the}} <b>mixing-length</b> parameter is the same in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing length parameter. We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of stellar convection that determines the properties of stellar convection as a function of the physical behaviour of the convective elements themselves and of the surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a conventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i. e. the Bernoulli equation for a perfect fluid, but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame co-moving with the convective elements. In our formalism the motion of stellar convective cells inside convectively-unstable layers is fully determined by a new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent formalism. We obtain an analytical, non-local, time-dependent sub-sonic solution for the convective energy transport that does not depend on any free parameter. The theory is suitable for the outer convective zones of solar type stars and stars of all mass on the main sequence band. The predictions of the new theory are compared with those from the standard <b>mixing-length</b> paradigm for the most accurate calibrator, the Sun, with very satisfactory results.

40|$|Stellar models {{generally}} use simple parameterizations {{to treat}} convection. The {{most widely used}} parameterization is the so-called <b>mixing-length</b> theory where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, α, the <b>mixing-length</b> parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate α using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated α is not always appropriate, and {{that in many cases}} it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate α for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the <b>mixing-length</b> parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between α and stellar properties, and we find that α increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of α are likely to have large systematic errors.

Our ANN was trained using 60, 000 different 0. 8 M_ stellar models. With this approach we identify the models which reproduce CG Cyg B's position in the HR diagram. We observe a correlation between the model's initial metal and helium abundance which, in most cases, does not agree with a helium to metal enrichment ratio ΔY/ΔZ= 2. Moreover, we identify a correlation between the model's initial helium/metal abundance and both its age and <b>mixing-length</b> parameter. Additionally, every model found has a <b>mixing-length</b> parameter below 1. 3. This means that CG Cyg B's <b>mixing-length</b> parameter is clearly smaller than the solar one.

A second-order approximation is used for spatial discretization and a semi-implicit Lagrangian–Eulerian scheme is used for time discretization.

40|$|The α Cen {{binary system}} is a {{well-known}} stellar system with very accurate observational constraints to structure of its component stars. In addition to the classical non-seismic constraints, there are also seismic constraints for the interior models of α Cen A and B. These two types of constraint give very different values for {{the age of the}} system. While we obtain 8. 9 Gyr for the age of the system from the non-seismic constraints, the seismic constraints imply that the age is about 5. 6 - 5. 9 Gyr. There may be observational or theoretical reasons for this discrepancy, which can be found by careful consideration of similar stars. The α Cen binary system, with its solar type components, is also suitable for testing the stellar mass dependence of the <b>mixing-length</b> parameter for convection derived from the binaries of Hyades. The values of the <b>mixing-length</b> parameter for α Cen A and B are 2. 10 and 1. 90 for the non-seismic constraints.
