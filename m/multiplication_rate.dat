50|$|While {{temperature}} enhances susceptibility, {{the actual}} infection source and {{mode of transmission}} are very poorly understood. This is primarily due to the bacteria’s slow <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> and long incubation period, making specific infection period identification difficult. The incubation period itself may range from ten months to {{four years in the}} nine-banded armadillo, compared to three to six years in humans. The long life of armadillos is particularly useful in the study of chronic effects of leprosy as well as the propagation of M. leprae outside of humans.

50|$|A medical {{autoclave}} is {{a device}} that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects. This means that all bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores are inactivated. However, prions, such as those associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, may not be destroyed by autoclaving at the typical 134 °C for three minutes or 121 °C for 15 minutes. Although a wide range species of archaea, including Geogemma barosii, can survive at temperatures above 121 °C, no archaea {{are known to be}} infectious or pose a health risk to humans; in fact their biochemistry is so vastly different from our own and their <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> is far too slow for microbiologists to worry about them.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{uncontrolled}} {{power excursion}} accident, a sudden power spike in the reactor exceeds reactor design specifications {{due to a}} sudden increase in reactor reactivity. An uncontrolled power excursion occurs due to significantly altering a parameter that affects the neutron <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> of a chain reaction (examples include ejecting a control rod or significantly altering the nuclear characteristics of the moderator, such as by rapid cooling). In extreme cases the reactor may proceed to a condition known as prompt critical. This is especially a problem in reactors that have a positive void coefficient of reactivity, a positive temperature coefficient, are overmoderated, or can trap excess quantities of deleterious fission products within their fuel or moderators. Many of these characteristics {{are present in the}} RBMK design, and the Chernobyl disaster was caused by such deficiencies as well as by severe operator negligence. Western light water reactors are not subject to very large uncontrolled power excursions because loss of coolant decreases, rather than increases, core reactivity (a negative void coefficient of reactivity); [...] "transients," [...] as the minor power fluctuations within Western light water reactors are called, are limited to momentary increases in reactivity that will rapidly decrease with time (approximately 200% - 250% of maximum neutronic power for a few seconds {{in the event of a}} complete rapid shutdown failure combined with a transient).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{timber and}} Christmas tree {{industries}} are important {{components of the}} Pacific Northwest economy. A goal of both industries is to produce high quality trees with high growth rates. Accomplishing this requires increased genetic quality of the trees grown. Tissue culture provides the most promise for propagating these superior genotypes. Douglas-fir has been tissue cultured previously, however, <b>multiplication</b> <b>rates</b> were low and success with mature material was limited. Recent research found that a double-phase tissue culture system significantly increases <b>multiplication</b> <b>rates</b> of fruit and nut trees. A doublephase system consists of the conventional solid layer overlaid by a liquid layer. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} study was to test a double-phase micropropagation system of Douglas-fir, particularly mature clones. Preliminary experiments were performed on juvenile Douglas-fir to test media and media components while waiting to obtain mature material. Preliminary experiments concluded that 1) Dunstan B- 2 medium provides better <b>multiplication</b> <b>rates</b> compared to SEM medium; 2) activated charcoal is a beneficial addition to the medium; 3) a low hormone liquid phase may be superior to a high hormone liquid phase and to no liquid phase; and 4) there does not appear to be a significant difference between 0. 25 %, 1 %, and 2. 5 % activated charcoal addition to the solid medium. In the final experiments using mature shoots, hormone-free doublephase medium stimulated more growth than single-phase or other double-phase media. This indicates that double-phase culture has potential for improving micropropagation of Douglas-fir...|$|R

50|$|The Chernobyl reactor was a RBMK type. The {{disaster}} {{was caused}} by a power excursion that led to a steam explosion, meltdown and extensive offsite consequences. Operator error and a faulty shutdown system led to a sudden, massive spike in the neutron <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate,</b> a sudden decrease in the neutron period, and a consequent increase in neutron population; thus, core heat flux increased rapidly beyond the design limits of the reactor. This caused the water coolant to flash to steam, causing a sudden overpressure within the reactor pressure vessel (RPV), leading to granulation of the upper portion of the core and the ejection of the upper plenum of said pressure vessel along with core debris from the reactor building in a widely dispersed pattern. The lower portion of the reactor remained somewhat intact; the graphite neutron moderator was exposed to oxygen-containing air; heat from the power excursion in addition to residual heat flux from the remaining fuel rods left without coolant induced oxidation in the moderator and in the opened fuel rods; this in turn evolved more heat and contributed to the melting of more of the fuel rods and the outgassing of the fission products contained therein. The liquefied remains of the melted fuel rods, pulverized concrete and any other objects in the path flowed through a drainage pipe into the basement of the reactor building and solidified in a mass, though the primary threat to the public safety was the dispersed core ejecta, vaporized and gaseous fission products and fuel, and the gasses evolved from the oxidation of the moderator.|$|E
40|$|Variation in the <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> {{of blood}} stage malaria parasites is often {{positively}} correlated with {{the severity of the}} disease they cause. The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii yoelii has strains with marked differences in <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> and pathogenicity in the blood. We have used genetic analysis by linkage group selection (LGS) to identify genes that determine differences in <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate.</b> Genetic crosses were generated between genetically unrelated, fast- (17 XYM) and slowly multiplying (33 XC) clones of P. y. yoelii. The uncloned progenies of these crosses were placed under <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> selection in blood infections in mice. The selected progenies were screened for reduction in intensity of quantitative genetic markers of the slowly multiplying parent. A small number of strongly selected markers formed a linkage group on P. y. yoelii chromosome 13.

Clumped explants were cultured on MS supplemented with 30 g/l sucrose and various combination of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP) and-naphthalene 1 acetic acid (NAA) in solid or liquid cultures. Liquid cultures required 5. 0 mg l BAP to significantly (P< 0. 05) 1 increase the <b>multiplication</b> <b>rate</b> by 2 - or 5 -fold compared to 7. 5 mg l in solid cultures. When plantlets from 1 optimal treatments were transferred to liquid medium with high concentration (7. 5 - 15 mg l) of NAA there was no root development.
