5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased <b>muscle</b> <b>tone,</b> a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced <b>muscle</b> <b>tone,</b> squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} that overeating {{and lack of}} <b>muscle</b> <b>tone</b> is {{the main cause of}} a beer belly, rather than beer consumption. A 2004 study, however, found a link between binge drinking and a beer belly. But with most overconsumption, it is more a problem of improper exercise and overconsumption of carbohydrates than the product itself. Several diet books quote beer as having an undesirably high glycemic index of 110, the same as maltose; however, the maltose in beer undergoes metabolism by yeast during fermentation so that beer consists mostly of water, hop oils and only trace amounts of sugars, including maltose.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 0.5% to 10% {{of individuals}} with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, {{although there is no}} good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor <b>muscle</b> <b>tone,</b> poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and <b>muscle</b> <b>tone.</b> The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased <b>muscle</b> <b>tone</b> of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

5|$|Gross {{movement}} – such as locomotion and {{the movement}} of arms and legs – is generated in the motor cortex, divided into three parts: the primary motor cortex, found in the prefrontal gyrus and has sections dedicated to the movement of different body parts. These movements are supported and regulated by two other areas, lying anterior to the primary motor cortex: the premotor area and the supplementary motor area. The hands and mouth have a much larger area dedicated to them than other body parts, allowing finer movement; this has been visualised in a motor cortical homunculus. Impulses generated from the motor cortex travel along the corticospinal tract along the front of the medulla and cross over (decussate) at the medullary pyramids. These then travel down the spinal cord, with most connecting to interneurons, in turn connecting to lower motor neurons within the grey matter that then transmit the impulse to move to muscles themselves. The cerebellum and basal ganglia, play a role in fine, complex and coordinated muscle movements. Connections between the cortex and the basal ganglia control <b>muscle</b> <b>tone,</b> posture and movement initiation, and are referred to as the extrapyramidal system.|$|E

40|$|Two healthy {{dogs were}} anaesthetized to undergo {{elective}} orthopaedic procedures. After premedication with methadone and acepromazine, general anaesthesia was induced with midazolam and S-ketamine. Immediately after anaesthetic induction, seizures occurred in both dogs. In the first dog the syndrome {{was characterized by}} tonic and clonic motor activity, muscular hypertone, hypersalivation, urination, defecation and hyperthermia. In the second dog muscular twitches of the temporal and masseter regions were observed, followed by increased skeletal <b>muscles</b> <b>tone,</b> hypersalivation, spontaneous urination and increase in body temperature. Recoveries from anaesthesia were uneventful and no seizures were observed. Considering the temporal association between anaesthetic induction and occurrence of seizures, {{and the fact that}} other causative factors could not be identified, it is hypothesized that S-ketamine played a role in determining the convulsive phenomena observed in these patients. S-ketamine might carry the potential for inducing seizures in otherwise healthy dogs, despite the concomitant use of GABA-ergic drugs...|$|R

5000|$|Exercises of 6-12 reps cause {{hypertrophy}} of the sarcoplasm in slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers, {{contributing to}} overall increased muscle bulk. This {{is not to}} be confused with myofibril hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both however can occur to an extent during this rep range. Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of <b>muscle</b> firmness or <b>tone,</b> it is not. [...] Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing actin and myosin cross filaments thereby increasing <b>muscle</b> firmness or <b>tone.</b> The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.|$|R
40|$|Background: Chondrodysplasia punctata (CDP) is a rare, {{heterogeneous}} congenital skeletal dysplasia, {{characterized by}} punctate or dot-like calcium deposits in cartilage observed on neonatal radiograms. A number of inborn metabolic diseases {{are associated with}} CDP, including peroxisomal and cholesterol biosynthesis dysfunction and other inborn errors of metabolism such as: mucolipidosis type II, mucopolysacharidosis type III, GM 1 gangliosidosis. CDP is also related to disruption of vitamin K-dependent metabolism, causing secondary effects on the embryo, as well as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), chromosomal abnormalities that include trisomies 18 and 21, Turner syndrome. Case Report: This article presents clinical data and diagnostic imaging findings of two newborn babies with chondrodysplasia punctata. Children presented with skeletal and cartilage anomalies, dysmorphic facial feature, <b>muscles</b> <b>tone</b> abnormalities, skin changes and breathing difficulties. One of the patients demonstrated critical stenosis of spinal canal with anterior subluxation of C 1 vertebra relative to C 2. The aim {{of this article is}} to present cases and briefly describe current knowledge on etiopathogenesis as well as radiological and clinical symptoms of diseases coexisting with CDP. Conclusions: Radiological diagnostic imaging allows for visualization of punctate focal mineralization in bone epiphyses during neonatal age and infancy. Determining the etiology of chondrodysplasia punctata requires performing various basic as well as additional examinations, including genetic studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe current {{trend in}} the conception, {{development}} and implementation of maintenance gymnastics programs is to pay special attention to training the small, deep, muscle groups related to the spine. This type of workout that can be called the “core stabilizer” is intended to facilitate the conscious activation of deep stabilizer muscles. This will allow control over the spine's correct position, with a direct effect on improving balance and coordination while performing movements. We started this study from the premise that the application of standard Pilates techniques in maintenance gymnastics programs will lead to significant improvement in balance and coordination in the execution of motor acts. The present study consisted of a six-month experiment involving two groups of adult subjects, practitioners of maintenance gymnastics programs in the “Carol Davila” University of Medicine and Pharmacology. Both groups followed a program of <b>muscle</b> <b>toning</b> exercises using weights, elastic bands and gymnastic balls. The independent variable consisted in teaching and practical implementation of abdominal contraction techniques with the spine in neutral position, specific to Pilates concept, for the experimental group. We applied initial and final tests regarding two components of the coordinative capacity - balance and coordination to both the experimental and the control groups...|$|R
