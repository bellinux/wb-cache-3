5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut {{is that of a}} soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence.

John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.|$|E

5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France.

5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> {{departure from}} the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound.

Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance art <b>marks</b> <b>a</b> {{cultural}} rebirth at {{the close}} of the Middle Ages and rise of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E
