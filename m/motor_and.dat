5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to implement new high-power slim-hole <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> bits into field gas well drilling applications. Development of improved <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> bits is critical because rotating time constitutes the major cost of drilling gas wells. Conventional motors drill most formations 2 to 3 times faster than rotary continuous coring systems due to greater power transfer to the drill bit. New high-power <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> large-cutter TSP bits being developed by Maurer Engineering, Inc. (MEI) drill 2 to 3 times faster than conventional motors. These slim-hole high-power <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> bits, which are ready for field testing on this DOE project, should reduce drilling costs by 20 to 40 percent in many areas. The {{objective of}} Phase I is to design, manufacture and laboratory test improved high-power slim-hole <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> large-cutter TSP bits. This work will be done in preparation for Phase II field tests. The objective of Phase II will be to field test the high-power <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> bits in Amoco`s Catoosa shallow-test well near Tulsa, OK, and in deep gas wells. The goal will be to drill 2 to 3 times faster than conventional <b>motors</b> <b>and</b> to reduce the drilling costs by 20 to 40 percent over the intervals drilled...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with getting}} the motor patented, Peck and Brown {{arranged}} {{to get the}} motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrent {{with the issue of}} the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the <b>motor)</b> <b>and</b> Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> related power system — something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} <b>motor</b> <b>and</b> phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
