This species is morphologically close to Paragus quadrifasciatus Meigen, 1822.

40|$|The <b>plum</b> <b>mealy</b> <b>aphid</b> Hyalopterus pruni Geoffr. {{is one of}} {{the main}} pest of the plum orchard at the S. D. Banu Maracine. An {{important}} link for controling this pest is the knowledge of the biological cycle, in order to establish the best moment for the treatments. The <b>plum</b> <b>mealy</b> <b>aphid</b> is an migratory species, with an holocyclic, dioecious development. This species produce damages in the plum orchard from Europe, Asia and northern Africa. The main host plant is the plum tree or other species belonging to the Prunus genra and as secondary host the <b>plum</b> <b>mealy</b> <b>aphid</b> prefere different graminaceae species as: Phragmites, Calamagrostis, Agrostis, etc. The research regarding the biology and ecology of the <b>plum</b> <b>mealy</b> <b>aphid</b> has been made at the Didactical Station Banu Maracine, Craiova, in a plum orchard, Stanley variety. During the 3 years of research the period for layings eggs has oscilated between 23 days in 2004 and 31 days in 2002. The development of the fundatrix, has been framed between 24 days in 2004 and 29 days in 2003. In 2002 the development of the fundatrix has been completed after 26 days. During the climatic conditions of 2002 - 2004, there has been developed 4 generations of wingless aphid (2002 and 2004), respectively 5 generations in 2003. These 4, 5 generations have phased from the second or third decade of April untill the second half of July. From our observations regarding the development on the secondary host plants, it come out that the first generation has completed it development, function the climatic conditions, in 7 to 11 days. There has been phased 8 - 9 generations of winged and wingless form, untill September and even October. The last generation has ensured the appearance of the sexuparae form, which has migrated in the plum orchard and give birth to the sexuale forms. The laying of hibernating eggs, begun in October, phasing to the first decade of November...|$|R

40|$|Aphidius transcaspicus Telenga, a <b>mealy</b> <b>plum</b> <b>aphid</b> (Hyalopterus pruni Geoffroy) {{parasitoid}} {{from the}} Mediterranean, was recently introduced into Hawaii {{for control of}} invasive aphids. Under laboratory conditions the parasitoid successfully attacked several important aphid pests in Hawaii, including the melon aphid Aphis gossypii Glover, the banana aphid Pentalonia nigronervosa (Coquerel), the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the corn leaf aphid Rhopolosiphum maidis (Fitch), and the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch. It could not successfully parasitize the turnip aphid Lipaphis pseudobrassicae Kalt or the black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii (Boyer de Fonscolombe). Field cage tests with P. nigronervosa and M. persicae also showed that A. transcaspicus successfully attacked both host species under semi-natural conditions, and preferred M. persicae over P. nigronervosa...|$|E
40|$|During 2009 - 2010, aphid {{parasitoid}} wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) {{on stone}} fruit trees were investigated in Khorasan Razavi province, North East of Iran. In this survey, eight species from six genera, were reared from 26 associations (Aphid-host plant-parasitoid) in different localities in Khorasan Razavi province. Aphidius transcaspicus (62 %) {{was the most}} abundant species of aphid parasitoids, in strict association with Hyalopterus spp. ITS 2 rDNA sequence analyses confirmed classical studies. In phylogenetic analyses, our specimen, A. transcaspicus Mashhad 1, made a single clade with other populations of this species. A. transcaspicus showed a good control potential on Hyalopterus pruni Geoffroy (Hom: Aphididae) on plum and apricot. So {{it can be used}} as a biocontrol agent against the <b>mealy</b> <b>plum</b> <b>aphid</b> in Khorasan Razavi geographical climates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} the parasitoid guild of the <b>mealy</b> <b>plum</b> <b>aphid</b> Hyalopterus pruni on common reed (Phragmites australis) in different types of habitats in central Poland. The investigations were carried out in selected areas of the Salted Kujawy Region (central-northern Poland). To compare the parasitoid guilds of H. pruni from common reed in different types of habitats, species composition, number, domination structure and the percentage of parasitization (effectiveness) were evaluated. The primary parasitoid guild of H. pruni on common reed in central Poland comprises three aphidiine braconids, mainly Praon volucre and P. abjectum. The number of the primary parasitoid species and their effectiveness in the aphid colonies were very low. Hence, common reed {{did not seem to be}} a good reservoir of the H. pruni parasitoids, but it may play a role as a place of dispersion of these insects, beneficial to orchards. A very low number of the hyperparasitoids were observed in the aphid colonies...|$|E

50|$|The {{viviparous}} wingless {{females of}} B. cardui have an oval or pear-shaped body and grow to {{a length of}} from 1.8 to 2.5 mm. The colour may be green, yellowish, reddish or brown. The abdomen has a dark, shining patch on the dorsal surface, a fact which distinguishes this species from the otherwise similar <b>plum</b> leaf curl <b>aphid</b> (Brachycaudus helichrysi). Nymphs often have pinkish blotches on a dark green background.|$|R
50|$|Several {{species of}} aphid {{transmit}} the virus including the plum-thistle aphid (Brachycaudus cardui), the <b>plum</b> leaf curl <b>aphid</b> (Brachycaudus helichrysi) {{and the green}} peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Winged <b>aphids</b> can transmit <b>plum</b> pox within an orchard, and over short distances (200-300 meters) to trees in nearby orchards. Unlike some other viruses, like barley yellow dwarf virus, PPV is not persistent in the aphid and is transferred from the mouthparts of the aphid between plants. Long distance spread usually {{occurs as a result}} of the movement of infected nursery stock or propagative materials. Once a plant is infected the virus is systemic and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells from all parts of the plant.|$|R
