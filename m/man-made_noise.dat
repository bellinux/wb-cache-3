When they were fired on 1 July 1916, the Lochnagar and Hawthorn Ridge mines were the largest ever detonated and the sound of the blast was considered the loudest <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> in history. Reports suggested that the sound was heard in London and beyond. The mine detonations on {{the first day of the}} Somme were surpassed on 7 June 1917 by the mines fired at the start of the Battle of Messines.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{potential}} for both natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>noise,</b> numerous techniques continue to be developed {{to deal with the}} interference. The first is to not rely on GPS as a sole source. According to John Ruley, [...] "IFR pilots should have a fallback plan in case of a GPS malfunction". Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) is a feature included in some receivers, designed to provide a warning to the user if jamming or another problem is detected. The U.S. military has also deployed since 2004 their Selective Availability / Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) in the Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR). In demonstration videos the DAGR was shown to detect jamming and maintain its lock on the encrypted GPS signals during interference which caused civilian receivers to lose lock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{artillery}} fire was lifted {{half an hour}} before dawn, and as they waited in the silence for the offensive to begin, some of the troops reportedly heard a nightingale singing. Starting from 3.10 a.m. on 7 June 1917, the mines at Messines were fired within the space of 20 seconds. The joint explosion ranks among the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time and surpassed the mines {{on the first day of}} the Somme fired 11 months before. The sound of the blast was considered the loudest <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> in history. Reports suggested that the sound was heard in London and Dublin, and at Lille University's geology department, the shock wave was mistaken for an earthquake. Some eyewitnesses described the scene as [...] "pillars of fire", although many also conceded that the scene was indescribable.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph S. Wisniewski {{wrote that}} [...] "green noise", as marketed by {{producers}} of ambient sound effects recordings, is [...] "supposedly the background {{noise of the}} world."

These studies revealed that seismic electric signals (SES) activities exhibit a scale invariant feature with an exponent α_DFA≈ 1 over all scales investigated (around five orders of magnitude). Here, we study what happens upon significant data loss, which {{is a question of}} primary practical importance, and show that the DFA applied to the natural time representation of the remaining data still reveals for SES activities an exponent close to 1. 0, which markedly exceeds the exponent found in artificial (<b>man-made)</b> <b>noises.</b> This, in combination with natural time analysis, enables the identification of a SES activity with probability 75...|$|R
50|$|Early sonobuoys {{had limited}} range, limited battery life and were {{overwhelmed}} by {{the noise of the}} ocean. They first appeared during world war II, in which they first were used in July 1942 by RAF Coastal Command under the code name 'High Tea', the first squadron to use them operationally being No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. They were also limited by the use of human ears to discriminate <b>man-made</b> <b>noises</b> from the oceanic background. However, they demonstrated that the technology was viable. With the development of better hydrophones, the transistor and miniaturization, and the realization that very low frequency sound was important, more effective acoustic sensors followed. The sonobuoy went from being an imposing six feet tall, two feet diameter sensor to the compact suite of electronics it is today.|$|R
2500|$|The four mines at La Boisselle were detonated at [...] on 1 July 1916, {{the first}} day on the Somme. The {{explosion}} of the Lochnagar mine was initiated by Captain James Young of the 179th Tunnelling Company, who pressed the switches and observed that the firing had been successful. The two charges of the Lochnagar mine created a single, vast, smooth sided, flat bottom crater measuring some 220 feet (67 metres) diameter excluding the lip, and 450 feet (137 metres) across {{the full extent of the}} lip. It had obliterated between 300 and 400 feet (91 and 122 metres) of the German dug-outs, all said to have been full of German troops. At the time, the Lochnagar mine, along with the Y Sap mine, were the largest mines ever detonated. The sound of the blast was considered the loudest <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> in history up to that point, with reports suggesting it was heard in London. They would be surpassed a year later by the mines in the Battle of Messines. The Lochnagar mine lay on the sector assaulted by the Grimsby Chums, a Pals battalion (10th Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment). The infantry of the British 34th Division, which was composed of Pals battalions from the north of England, attacked the positions on either side of La Boisselle, of Reserve Infantry Regiment 110 of the German 28th Reserve Division, mainly recruited from Baden.|$|E

5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or <b>man-made</b> <b>noises.</b> The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|R
50|$|According to reciprocity, the {{efficiency}} of an antenna used as a receiving antenna is identical to {{the efficiency}} as defined above. The power that an antenna will deliver to a receiver (with a proper impedance match) is reduced by the same amount. In some receiving applications, the very inefficient antennas may have little impact on performance. At low frequencies, for example, atmospheric or <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> can mask antenna inefficiency. For example, CCIR Rep. 258-3 indicates <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> in a residential setting at 40 MHz is about 28 dB above the thermal noise floor. Consequently, an antenna with a 20 dB loss (due to inefficiency) would have little impact on system noise performance. The loss within the antenna will affect the intended signal and the noise/interference identically, leading to no reduction in signal to noise ratio (SNR).|$|E

50|$|Such low {{frequency}} transmissions require specialized equipment - usually custom made. In countries {{where it is}} allowed, maximum radiated power is usually limited to 1 Watt (0 dBW or 30 dBm), but even this can be extremely difficult to achieve from practical equipment and antennas. Reception also poses problems due to considerable natural and <b>man-made</b> <b>noise</b> and interference (QRN and QRM).|$|E
50|$|In {{communication}} systems, {{noise is}} an error or undesired random disturbance of a useful information signal.

Noise is also typically distinguished from distortion, which is an unwanted systematic alteration of the signal waveform by the communication equipment, for example in the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SINAD) and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).|$|R

In this study, potential acoustic and behavioral changes produced by boat traffic on gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) were assessed. Time of day, seasonal day, tide, sea state, maximum number of whales per scan, and total number of moving boats per scan were correlated (Spearman rank correlation r= 0. 356, n= 52 a. 01). A significant correlation was observed between maximum number of whales per scan and total number of moving boats per scan (r= 0. 4568). Estimates of behavioral reactions included changes in: swimming speed, swimming direction, and successive breathing intervals (blows). The blow intervals for all gray whales were not distributed normally. There was a significant difference (Kruskal-Wallis p<. OOOI) in blow intervals among classes (mothers, calves, mother-calve pairs, and single adults). Blow intervals of all classes pooled were significantly different in {{the presence or absence of}} boats (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p=. 0006). Acoustically, ten signals were identified for gray whales in this lagoon. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of each signal included signal duration (sec.), peak frequency (Hz), and bandwidth (Hz). Changes in the measured characteristics of the signals or differences in calling rates were monitored as indicators of disturbance to gray whale behavior. Most signals ceased in the presence of whale-watching boats. As the area's first acoustic assessment of boat-noise disturbance, this work provides baseline information to establish guidelines for the extensive lagoon-based whale-watching industry...|$|R
5000|$|Station 4QG/4RN {{has seen}} several power {{increases}} since its commencement, both {{to increase its}} coverage area and to ameliorate increasing levels of <b>man-made</b> radio <b>noise</b> and night-time skywave interference levels.

Note that until about 1930, Australia identified transmitter power in terms of DC input to the final RF amplifier which is typically about 3 {{times greater than the}} power into the antenna. Thus the documentation of the day will invariably state 500 Watts. Early in 1926 the [...] "big transmitter" [...] was commissioned with a transmitter power of about 1700 Watts (DC input 5,000 Watts). Power was increased to 2.5 kW in 1932/1933 and again to 3.5 kW in 1946/1947. Power was increased to 10 kW in 1948/1949 and finally to 25 kW in mid 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|An RF {{amplifier}}, {{often called}} the low-noise amplifier (LNA).

They center on the practice of delaying or shutting down the use of air-guns if a whale or dolphin is sighted nearby. An MMO will implement these regulations in the field.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cognitive radio (CR) systems make {{efficient}} use of the frequency spectrum by opportunistically exploiting unoccu-pied or under–utilized frequency bands. However, the frequency bands used by CR systems are expected to suffer from various forms of noise and interference with non–Gaussian distributions, such as narrowband and co–channel interference caused by the primary user and other CRs, respectively, and <b>man–made</b> impulsive <b>noise.</b> To mitigate {{the harmful effects of}} non–Gaussian noise and interference, we propose a robust Lp–norm metric for CR systems that employ the popular combination of bit– interleaved coded modulation (BICM) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). For the considered CR system we provide an approximate upper bound and an asymptotic closed–form approximation for the bit error rate (BER). Our results show that the proposed Lp–norm metric can achieve large performance gains compared to the conventional L 2 –norm metric in non–Gaussian noise and interference. I...|$|R
30|$|Spectrum sensing for {{cognitive}} radio has {{to cope with}} several impairments like fading, shadowing, and presence of noise. Usually, the noise {{is assumed to be}} white and Gaussian, but in real-life situations, this {{does not need to be}} the case. In particular, one has to consider the presence of impulsive <b>noise,</b> both <b>man-made</b> and natural. <b>Man-made</b> impulsive <b>noise</b> occurs most commonly due to large electrical discharges. The impulses caused by such discharges have typically short duration and may vary in strength and frequency. The sources of the impulses are for instance spark ignition systems of engines, electrical machinery, discharge lighting and so on. The electromagnetic pulses may have durations of 5 to 10 ns and may occur at rates up to several hundred pulses per second [9]. For sake of simplicity, we model the impulsive noise in this paper using Bernoulli-Uniform distribution [10]. It is straightforward to extend the results to other distributions. The required knowledge is the probability that impulse occurs.|$|R
40|$|Noises {{are usually}} {{assumed to be}} Gaussian so that many {{existing}} signal processing techniques can be applied with no worry. However, in many real world natural or <b>man-made</b> sys-tems, <b>noises</b> are usually heavy-tailed. It is increasingly desirable {{to address the problem}} of finding an opportune filter function for a given input noise in order to generate a desired output noise. By filtering theory, the probability density function of the output noise can be expressed by the integral of the product of the den-sity of the input noise and the filter function. Adopting Mellin transformation rules, the Mellin transform of the unknown fil-ter is determined by the Mellin transforms of the known density of the input noise and the desired density for the output noise. Finally, after the inversion, the Mellin–Barnes integral represen-tation of the filter function is derived. The method is applied to compute the filter function to convert a Lévy noise into a Gaus-sian noise...|$|R
