5|$|Diane quickly {{weakened}} as {{a tropical}} storm over the mountainous terrain of central North Carolina. The associated area of precipitation expanded and spread away from the center {{to the north and}} northeast. The weakening system turned to the north and recurved toward the northeast through Virginia after a ridge built in from the west. It did not interact <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> non-tropical westerlies, and as a result it remained a distinct tropical cyclone over land. Convection redeveloped as the storm approached the Atlantic coast once again. Diane passed through the Mid-Atlantic states, exiting New Jersey on August 19 into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City. Paralleling the southern coast of New England, the storm later accelerated east-northeastward, becoming extratropical on August 21. Passing south and east of Newfoundland, the remnants of Diane accelerated and restrengthened slightly while moving to the northeast. Late on August 23, the storm dissipated between Greenland and Iceland.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} <b>much,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

25|$|The {{legend of}} Unan and Ngoor {{probably}} {{dates back to}} the Iron Age, with Unan being the woman and Ngoor the man. Although not the first human couple that the supreme deity Roog (or Koox) had created, like the legend of Jambooñ and Agaire (see the Point of Sangomar), they form a fundamental part of Serer mythology. The legend agrees pretty <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> general consensus that a female was created first then a male. But in this narrative, it attempts to place Unan and Ngoor as the first human couple.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{countries}} outside New Zealand {{began to}} export kiwifruit. In Italy, the infrastructure and techniques required to support grape production were {{adapted to the}} kiwifruit. This, coupled with being {{very close to the}} European kiwifruit market, led to Italians becoming the leading producer of kiwifruit in the early 2000s. The growing season of Italian kiwifruit does not overlap <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New Zealand or the Chilean growing seasons, therefore direct competition between New Zealand or Chile was not much of a factor.|$|E

25|$|Goethe's book {{provides}} {{a catalogue of}} how colour is perceived {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in Remarks on Colour.|$|E
25|$|Later that month, India {{played a}} two Test home series against Pakistan. Dravid didn't {{contribute}} <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat. India lost the First Test but won the Second Test in Delhi riding on Kumble's historic 10-wicket haul. Dravid played {{his part in}} the 10-wicket haul by taking a catch to dismiss Mushtaq Ahmed who was Kumble's eighth victim of the innings. The Indo-Pak Test series {{was followed by the}} 1998–99 Asian Test Championship. Dravid couldn't do <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat as India went on to lose the riot-affected First Test of the championship against Pakistan at the Eden Gardens. India went to Sri Lanka to play the Second Test of the championship. Dravid scored his fourth hundred of the season at Colombo in the first innings of the match. He also effected a brilliant run out of Russel Arnold during Sri Lankan innings fielding at short leg. On the fourth morning, Dravid got injured while fielding at the same position when the ball from Jayawardene's pull shot hit him below his left eye through the helmet grill. He didn't come out to bat in the second innings due to the injury. The match ended in a draw as India failed to qualify for the Finals of the championship.|$|E

His seven-wicket haul including a five-for in the second innings of the final Test match earned him the Man of the Match award. He played an important role for India in lifting the ICC Champions Trophy 2013. He was the highest wicket taker of the tournament with 12 wickets which won him the Golden Ball. He made 33* with bat and took 2 wickets in the final against England.|$|E

25|$|Another run {{out three}} overs later saw Vincent {{back in the}} pavilion, having added 37, before Hamish Marshall was bowled through the gate for 8 by Yadav, {{and all of a}} sudden New Zealand were 115 for 4, and {{patience}} was required from Styris and McMillan. They played that role well, only hitting 16 runs in boundaries between them yet adding 87 together, setting the stage for hard hitting from wicket-keeper McCullum. Styris, once again, was the highest scorer of the New Zealand innings. After playing himself in, McCullum first hit a six off Agarkar to end the 44th over, before unleashing himself in the 46th. He was caught off a no-ball and dropped off the next delivery, and then smashed the remaining five balls for eighteen, with three fours and one six. Having added 28 in total, he then was caught by Kaif, but the pace was set. New Zealand notched up 31 runs in the final three overs, not bothering <b>much</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loss of wickets, and ended with 278 for 9.|$|E
