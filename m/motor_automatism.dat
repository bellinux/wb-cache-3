In this case, no clinical manifestations occurred until the orbitofrontal discharge had spread to the opposite orbitofrontal and both mesial temporal areas. Unresponsiveness or arrest of activity were the initial manifestations of complex partial seizures in both cases. The 2 cases from the literature with long-term seizure-free follow-up had little impairment of awareness and displayed vigorous <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms.</b> Interictal epileptiform activity was bifrontally synchronous in 1 case. Ipsilateral frontotemporal discharges were seen in both. Invasive ictal epileptiform activity appeared maximal in the ipsilateral orbitofrontal region in both patients. No consistent electrographic or clinical pattern characterized these 4 cases. Seizures of orbitofrontal origin may be characterized by either unresponsiveness associated with oroalimentary automatisms or limited alteration of awareness and associated with vigorous <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms.</b> Invasive monitoring of the orbitofrontal cortex should be considered in nonlesional cases with complex partial seizures that show nonlocalizing ictal patterns and interictal frontal or frontotemporal epileptiform discharges.

40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of temporo-limbic hyperperfusion and extratemporal hypoperfusion was observed during complex partial seizures (CPS) in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). To investigate the clinical correlate of perfusion changes in TLE, we analyzed focal seizures of increasing severity using voxel-based analysis of ictal SPECT. We selected 26 pre-operative pairs of ictal-interictal SPECTs from adult mesial TLE patients, seizure-free after surgery. Ictal SPECTs were classified in three groups: motionless seizures (group ML, n= 8), seizures with <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms</b> (MA) without dystonic posturing (DP) (group MA, n= 8), and seizures with DP {{with or without}} MA (DP, n= 10). Patients of group ML had simple partial seizures (SPS), while others had CPS. Groups of ictal-interictal SPECT were compared to a control group using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). In ML group, SPM analysis failed to show significant changes. Hyperperfusion involved the anteromesial temporal region in MA group, and also the insula, posterior putamen and thalamus in DP group. Hypoperfusion was restricted to the posterior cingulate and prefrontal regions in MA group, and involved more widespread associative anterior and posterior regions in DP group. Temporal lobe seizures with DP show the most complex pattern of combined hyper-hypoperfusion, possibly related both to a larger spread and the recruitment of more powerful inhibitory processes...|$|R

40|$|Partial seizures, {{the most}} {{frequent}} type of epilepsy at all ages, remain a distinct yet relatively understudied disorder in early life. Their true incidence has not been defined, despite an extremely unfavorable long-term prognosis. They differ from partial seizures presenting later in life in several important aspects and are prone to misdiagnosis because of the difficulties inherent in recognizing subtle seizure manifestations and in assessing level of consciousness in very young patients. Most seizures are symptomatic of assorted prenatally acquired hemispheric insults; perinatal damage and tu-mors are less common. Video-electroencephalographic studies indicate {{that the majority of}} ictal events consist of behav-ioral arrest, stereotyped <b>automatisms,</b> and <b>motor</b> phenomena. Oroalimentary and gross <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms</b> are frequent, whereas highly organized gestural and behavioral sequences are extremely rare. Lateralized or asymmetric tonic, clonic, and occasional myoclonic motor manifestations characterize the majority of episodes. Pure behavioral arrest is much less common. These seizure patterns imply immaturity of systems responsible for inhibiting access to motor pathways and for organizing motor expression. Ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges are often focal or lateralized but lack age-specific features. Although as a rule partial seizures persist, some individuals display generalized or mixed seizure disorders in later life.

AIMS. To review the research to date on NLD, and to discuss whether the term 'procedural learning disorder' (PLD) would be more suitable to refer to NLD. DEVELOPMENT: A considerable amount of research suggests a neurological correlate of PLD with dysfunctions in the 'posterior' attention system, or the right hemisphere, or the cerebellum. Even if {{it is said to}} be difficult the delimitation between NLD and other disorders or syndromes like Asperger syndrome, certain characteristics contribute to differential diagnosis. Intervention strategies for the PLD must lead to the development of <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms</b> and problem solving strategies, including social skills. CONCLUSIONS: The basic dysfunction in NLD affects to implicit learning of routines, automating of motor skills and cognitive strategies that spare conscious resources in daily behaviours. These limitations are partly due to a dysfunction in non-declarative procedural memory. Various dimensions of language are also involved: context comprehension, processing of the spatial and emotional indicators of verbal language, language inferences, prosody, organization of the inner speech, use of language and non-verbal communication; this is why the diagnostic label 'PLD' would be more appropriate, avoiding the euphemistic adjective 'non-verbal'...|$|R
40|$|Recent reports {{indicate}} that walking capabilities in spinal cord damaged persons significantly improve – as compared to conventional rehabilitation therapy – after intensive training of aided (Laufband) treadmill-stepping. 5 – 8 In the present report, follow up investigations on two collectives of spinal cord injured (sci) persons are described who had undergone (Laufband) treadmill therapy either {{during a period of}} renewed rehabilitation months or years after spinal cord injury (35 chronic patients) or during their first postacute rehabilitation period (41 acute patients). Among the initially chronic patients, 20 from 25 still wheelchair-bound before the onset of (Laufband) treadmill therapy, ie not capable of raising from the wheelchair and walking without help by other persons, became independent walkers after therapy.

40|$|Background Neonatal {{seizures}} or fits {{are signs}} of central ner- vous system (CNS) diseases, metabolic disorders, or other dis- eases disrupting the CNS. Neonatal seizures are poorly classi- fied, under-recognized and often difficult to treat. It {{is important to recognize}} the type of neonatal seizures that might be the only sign of a CNS disorder. Objective To recognize the type and etiology of neonatal sei- zures in several hospitals in Jakarta. Methods This was an observational case series study on full-term and preterm infants who had seizures during hospitalization in Cipto Mangunkusumo, Harapan Kita, and Fatmawati Hospitals between January-June 2005. Neonatal seizures were defined as seizures occurring in the first 28 days of life of a term infant or 44 completed weeks of the infant’s conception age of preterm infant. Results There were 40 neonates who born within the study period and had seizures. Girls were outnumbered boys. Most neonates were full-term with birth weight of more than 2500 grams. Analy- ses were done on 38 neonates with epileptic and non-epileptic seizures, while the other two who had mixed clinical manifestation were not included. Most seizures occurred in the first 3 days of life (23 / 38). The most common type was focal clonic (12 / 14) followed by general tonic (11 / 24) and <b>motor</b> <b>automatism</b> or subtle (10 / 24). The most common etiology was hypoxic ischemic encephalopa- thy (HIE) (19 / 38) followed by metabolic disturbances, mainly hy- pocalcaemia (11 / 38). Conclusion Common types of seizures in neonates were focal clonic, general tonic, and <b>motor</b> <b>automatism</b> (subtle).

Over the past month she has also had “blank spells” during which her husband noticed her to be unresponsive.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} assess {{functional}} skills of older adults, both timed up and go (TUG) test and gait speed (GS) test are well validated concerning their predictive capacities. However, the question remains unclear which one of these tests represents better the whole physical performance of older adults. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the more representative test, between TUG and GS, of the whole motor control quality. To study links between locomotion capacities and arm function, we measured, in a population of frail aged patients, the locomotion tests and the mean arm maximal velocity developed during a speed accuracy trade-off. This arm movement consisted in reaching the hand toward a target in a virtual game scene. We plotted the different couples of variables obtained on graphs, and calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between each couple. The Pearson correlation between GS and hand maximal velocity was significant (r = 0. 495; p = 0. 046). Interestingly, we found a non significant Pearson correlation between timed up and go score (TUG) and hand maximal velocity (r = - 0. 139; p = 0. 243). Our results suggest that GS score is more representative of the whole motor ability of frail patients than the TUG. We propose that the relative complexity of the TUG motor sequence could be involved in this difference. For a few patients with <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms</b> deficiencies, this <b>motor</b> sequence complexity could leads to a dual task perturbation. In this way, we conclude that GS should be preferred over the TUG with older adults. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) can be {{conceptualized as}} a network disease. The network {{can be characterized}} by inter-regional functional connectivity, i. e. blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlations between any two region pairs. However, functional connectivity is not constant over time, thus computing correlation {{at a given time}} and then at some later time could give different results (non-stationarity). We hypothesized (1) that non-stationarities can be induced by epilepsy (e. g. interictal epileptic activity) increasing local signal variance and that (2) these transient events contribute to fluctuations in connectivity leading to pathological functioning, i. e. TLE semiology. We analyzed fMRI data from 27 patients with TLE and 22 healthy controls focusing on EEG-confirmed wake epochs only to protect against sleep-induced connectivity changes. Testing hypothesis (1), we identified brain regions where the BOLD signal variance was significantly greater in TLE than in controls: the temporal pole - including the hippocampus. Taking the latter as the seed region and testing hypothesis (2) we calculated the time-varying interregional correlation values (dynamic functional connectivity) to other brain regions and found greater connectivity variance in the TLE than the control group mainly in the precuneus, the supplementary and sensori-motor and the frontal cortices. We conclude that the highest BOLD signal variance in the hippocampi is highly suggestive of a specific epilepsy-related effect. The altered connectivity dynamics in TLE patients might help to explain the hallmark semiological features of dyscognitive seizures including impaired consciousness (precuneus, frontal cortex), sensory disturbance and <b>motor</b> <b>automatisms</b> (sensorimotor cortices, supplementary motor cortex). Accounting for the non-stationarity and state-dependence of functional connectivity are a prerequisite in the search for potential connectivity-derived biomarkers in TLE...|$|R
