5000|$|The typical {{paradigm}} for classical conditioning involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus (which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response) with another previously neutral stimulus (which does not normally evoke the response). Following conditioning, the response occurs {{both to the}} unconditioned stimulus and to the other, unrelated stimulus (now {{referred to as the}} [...] "conditioned stimulus"). The response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response. The classic example is Ivan Pavlov and his dogs. Pavlov fed his dogs <b>meat</b> <b>powder,</b> which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the <b>meat</b> <b>powder.</b> <b>Meat</b> <b>powder</b> is the unconditioned stimulus (US) and the salivation is the unconditioned response (UR). Pavlov rang a bell before presenting the <b>meat</b> <b>powder.</b> The first time Pavlov rang the bell, the neutral stimulus, the dogs did not salivate, but once he put the <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> in their mouths they began to salivate. After numerous pairings of bell and food, the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come, and began to salivate when they heard the bell. Once this occurred, the bell became the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response (CR). Classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species. For example, it is seen in honeybees, in the proboscis extension reflex paradigm. and recently, it was demonstrated in garden pea plants.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Chicken meat in two {{different}} forms (chicken meat and chicken <b>meat</b> <b>powder)</b> were added into white flour and whole wheat blend baguette bread formulations for protein enrichment and finally developing new and healthy snacks. The chicken meat and powder levels were 10 % for white flour baguette, and 15 % for whole wheat blend. The dried baguette samples were packaged under 100 % N 2, and physical, chemical, microbiological and sensorial properties were evaluated during 3 months of storage. Protein content of chicken <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> added samples were found statistically higher than chicken meat added samples. Hardness of the snacks was significantly affected from type of chicken meat, such as values were higher for chicken meat added samples than chicken <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> added samples. Lipid oxidation of the snacks was determined by TBA analysis, and TBA value for whole wheat mixture snack with 15 % of chicken meat was the highest among all during storage. The highest overall acceptance score was obtained from white flour snack with 10 % chicken meat.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lyophilized <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> with iron-fortified {{wheat flour}} {{can be used}} to produce an infant {{porridge}} with bioavailable iron, but its acceptability and safety are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the acceptability and safety of porridges containing lyophilized <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> and iron-fortified wheat flour. METHODS: Peruvian mothers' input was used to develop porridges without (no meat) and with <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> (low or high chicken liver, low or high chicken thigh). Acceptability was determined by maternal hedonic scoring, 9 -day infant intake, and videotape analysis of how well infants liked each porridge. Dry and cooked porridges and meat ingredients were tested for microorganisms; meats were tested for pesticides. RESULTS: Mothers gave higher acceptability scores to the no-meat porridge, followed in order by low and high quantities of <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> (e. g., mean +/- SD "taste"scores were 4. 5 +/- 0. 9 for the no-meat, 3. 7 +/- 1. 1 for the low-liver, and 3. 3 +/- 1. 1 for the high-liver porridges, p =. 0001). Infants' porridge intake did not differ: 61. 4 +/- 47. 1 g of no-meat, 62. 1 +/- 44. 9 g of low-thigh, and 67. 5 +/- 42. 0 g of low-liver (p =. 7), as supported by the video analysis. Microbiologic safety was acceptable except for marginally acceptable molds and yeasts in dry ingredients. No pesticide residues were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Despite mothers' clear preference for no-meat porridges, infants consumed equal amounts of porridges with and without meat. Thus, if mothers can be convinced to feed the meat-containing porridges to the infants despite their own preferences, the infants will consume these porridges. The mold and yeast content of the porridge ingredients must be reduced. Peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|That {{all events}} are equally associable and obey common laws {{is a central}} {{assumption}} of general process learning theory. A continuum of preparedness is denned which holds that organisms are prepared to associate certain events, unprepared for some, and contraprepared for others. A review of data from the traditional learning paradigms shows that the assumption of equivalent associability is false: in classical conditioning, rats are prepared to associate tastes with illness even over very long delays of reinforcement, but are contraprepared to associate tastes with footshock. In instrumental training, pigeons acquire key pecking {{in the absence of}} a contingency between pecking and grain (prepared), while cats, on the other hand, have trouble learning to lick themselves to escape, and dogs do not yawn for food (contra-prepared). In discrimination, dogs are contraprepared to learn that different locations of discriminative stimuli control go-no go responding, and to learn that different qualities control directional responding. In avoidance, re-sponses from the natural defensive repertoire are prepared for avoiding shock, while those from the appetitive repertoire are contraprepared. Language acquisition and the functional autonomy of motives are also viewed using the preparedness continuum. Finally, it is speculated that the laws of learning themselves may vary with the preparedness of the organism for the associa-tion and that different physiological and cognitive mechanisms may covary with the dimension.

40|$|Consumption of {{the green}} flesh kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa, Hayward variety) is known to relieve {{constipation}} and provide relief from symptoms of digestive dysfunction, but the effect is poorly researched and a credible explanation and mechanism has not been documented. This body of work aimed to increase {{the understanding of the}} effects of kiwifruit on the digestion process. 	There is some evidence that the mechanism {{may be due to the}} proteolytic properties of actinidin, a unique protease in kiwifruit. Actinidin has a wide pH-dependent reactivity between pH 2. 5 - 6 with an optimum at pH 3. 0 - 3. 5; equivalent to low acid conditions more associated with hypochlorhydria than the pH range of 1. 5 - 2. 5 normally associated with efficient gastric hydrolysis of protein. It was hypothesised that in vitro and in vivo the digestion of protein would be facilitated by the presence of the kiwifruit protease, particularly when pH exceeded normal fasting gastric pH. A sequence of studies to measure the effects of lyophilised kiwifruit (KFI), rich in actinidin, on the digestion of protein was undertaken to test this hypothesis. 	Initially, proof of principle of the kiwifruit enzyme activity in vitro was investigated. Then, the practicality and reliability of a stable isotope technique to measure the rate of gastric protein-digestion in vivo was tested in three studies that compared the effect on gastric emptying dynamics of a protein meal with and without the protease. In vitro, homogenised freeze-dried <b>meat</b> <b>powder</b> (the protein) was incubated with a series of dilutions of hydrochloric acid (pH 1. 3 - 6. 4), pepsin (0 - 1. 2 % w/w) and KFI (0 - 0. 8 % w/w). Simulated gastric digestion involved incubation at 37 ºC for 60 minutes, after which the pH was adjusted to 6. 4, and simulated duodenal incubation continued for a further 120 minutes. The degree of protein hydrolysis was determined using the Kjeldahl technique. The addition of KFI to the gastric milieu was associated with an increase in the proportion of protein substrate hydrolysed, but only when the concentration of pepsin was sub-optimal for efficient protein hydrolysis and pH of the digestate was elevated above normal fasting gastric pH of > 2. 5 but 6. 0, this step required a method of measuring the change in the extent of hydrolysis of protein as a result of its passage through the stomach only. A literature review highlighted many of the problems associated with measuring in vivo factors likely to influence gastric protein-digestion efficiency, including fasting gastric pH, pepsin concentrations and post-prandial gastric re-acidification capacity. The complexity of measuring any of these factors, combined with limited resources, led to testing the feasibility of measuring an individual's gastric protein-digestion efficiency through an adaptation of the carbon- 13 octanoic acid breath test (13 C-OABT), as a proxy for protein digestion efficiency. 	In the first study, eleven healthy participants aged 58 – 80 agreed to consume, on two separate occasions one week apart, a three egg white, one yolk omelette with 100 mg of 13 C labelled octanoic acid with and without the addition of 2. 160 g of KFI (the treatment) taken in capsule form. On each occasion, two expired breath samples were collected from each participant before they commenced the meal and nine more postprandial over three hours. The rate of appearance of 13 CO 2 on the breath, an accepted measure of gastric emptying, is expressed as Tlag (time to maximum rate of detection of isotope on the breath) and T 1 / 2 (time at which 50 % of the isotope is retained in the stomach). The difference in these parameters between the two test meals was hypothesised to reflect the change in gastric protein-digestion efficiency due to the effect of KFI. Recruitment of participants was not difficult and the procedure was well tolerated. Based on the findings of the in vitro study, the hypothesis tested was that for participants with normal digestion, treatment would have little or no effect on the rate of protein hydrolysis and would therefore record little or no change in the rate of gastric emptying between control and treatment; whereas protein digestion, for participants with diminished gastric acidification, would be enhanced by the treatment and this would reflect in a one-way change in the dynamics of gastric emptying. 	Of the eleven participants, gastric emptying parameters increased for seven and decreased for four. The inter-individual variability bought into question the reliability of the test method and the measures were repeated four months later with six participants from the first study. Variation in repeat measures in the control condition Tlag and T 1 / 2 did not exceed 13 % and with the addition of KFI to the meal variation was slightly more at 20 – 24 %. Again the pattern of some participants exhibiting accelerated gastric emptying and some recording delayed gastric emptying as a result of treatment, was observed. 	A third and final in vivo study undertaken in China, employed a non-dispersive infrared spectrometer to measure isotope ratios, as opposed to the isotope ratio mass spectrometer used in the two earlier studies. It was hypothesised that neither the participant's ethnicity nor the equipment used to measure gastric emptying would significantly alter the measures when compared to studies in New Zealand. Parameters measured in the twelve volunteers were closely aligned to those of the first study and measures of differences of Tlag and T 1 / 2 with and without treatment were combined (n = 22) into a small meta-analysis. Treatment with KFI increased Tlag by 7 minutes (95 % CI [0, 19], p = 0. 060) and T 1 / 2 by 10 minutes (95 % CI [0, 14], p = 0. 027). However for the 16 / 22 participants not consuming proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the effect was more marked: Tlag was increased by 14 % or 11 minutes (95 % CI [4, 18], p = 0. 050) and T 1 / 2 was increased by 10 % or 13 minutes (95 % CI [4, 23] p = 0. 027) = 0. 050) and T 1 / 2 was increased by 10 % or 13 minutes (95 % CI [4, 23] p = 0. 027). Multiple regression showed that the percentage increase in Tlag with KFI treatment was positively predicted by body weight and negatively predicted by consumption of PPIs. 	Despite trial design shortcomings, the combination of three small in vivo studies, involving 58 individual meals and the collection and analysis of 580 breath samples, indicated KFI had a significant and delaying effect on gastric emptying times (Tlag and T 1 / 2). This may indicate that for the majority of participants in these studies, KFI improved gastric digestion efficiency, as peptide products of protein hydrolysis are known to delay gastric emptying. As a result it was hypothesised that the inter-individual variability in response to treatment reflected the underlying gastric protein-digestion efficiency of the individual trial participants, but this hypothesis should be tested in future studies. 	While the novel test method employed in this study requires considerable further research to confirm the validity of the findings, what has emerged from this body of work is evidence that the protease content of the fruit is the likely active ingredient; that the stomach is the likely site of activity and that the effect is likely to be associated with existing gastric protein digestion inefficiency due to sub-optimal peptic hydrolysis...|$|E

This survey-based study, conducted in 2001 on a representative sample of 444 Lebanese adults aged 24 to 54, collected data on their daily food intakes and majorly consumed food products with the aim of characterizing food consumption patterns in Lebanon. Accordingly, food items which were found to contribute the most to the average daily intakes were selected and the final food basket we adopted consisted of 17 products: bread, rice, fresh cow meat, fresh chicken <b>meat,</b> fresh milk, <b>powdered</b> milk, labneha yoghurt, orange, bananas, apples, watermelon, lettuce, tomato, cucumber, potato and white cheese. The selected food basket and its constituents are consistent with the items identified in the FAO balance sheets as major components of food supply in Lebanon for the 2004 / 2007 period.|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{and protein}} {{oxidation}} decreases the shelf-life of foods and {{may result in}} formation of end-products potentially detrimental for health. Consumer pressure to decrease the use of synthetic phenolic antioxidants has encouraged identification of alternative compounds or extracts from natural sources. We have assessed whether inclusion of dried vegetable powders improves the oxidative stability of turkey <b>meat</b> patties. Such <b>powders</b> are not only potentially-rich sources of phenolic antioxidants, but also may impart additional health benefits, as inadequate vegetable consumption is {{a risk factor for}} heart disease and several cancers. In an accelerated oxidation system, six of eleven vegetable powders significantly (p < 0. 05) improved oxidative stability of patties by 20 %– 30 % (spinach < yellow pea < onion < red pepper < green pea < tomato). Improved lipid oxidative stability was strongly correlated with the decreased formation of protein carbonyls (r = 0. 747, p < 0. 01). However, improved lipid stability could not be ascribed to phenolic acids nor recognized antioxidants, such as α- and γ-tocopherol, despite their significant (p < 0. 01) contribution to the total antioxidant capacity of the patties. Use of chemically complex vegetable powders offers an alternative to individual antioxidants for increasing shelf-life of animal-based food products and may also provide additional health benefits associated with increased vegetable intake...|$|R

40|$|Forty-eight {{crossbred}} male pigs, weighing 5. 5 ± 0. 05 kg {{were fed}} extruded rice with either an animal protein supplement like whey <b>powder,</b> <b>meat</b> and bone meal, blood meal and fish meal (RAP) or 20 g oat hulls/kg extruded rice (RAPOH). The diets contained similar concentrations of digestible energy (14. 4 MJ/kg) and available lysine (0. 80 g/MJ DE). The pigs were offered their respective diets ad libitum for three weeks. Occurrence of diarrhoea was visually assessed three times daily and pigs showing clinical signs of diarrhoea {{were treated with}} antibiotics until the clinical signs disappeared. Blood samples {{were taken from the}} jugular vein on days 7 and 14 for urea and creatinine analyses. Faecal samples were also collected for estimation of dry matter, energy digestibility and biogenic amines content. Results showed that oat hulls decreased the number of pigs with post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and the number of antibiotic treatments. Due to the dilution effect of oat hulls, the digestibilities of DM and GE were significantly decreased (P< 0. 001). Oat hull inclusion decreased plasma urea concentration (P= 0. 016) suggesting a decrease in ammonia production in the large intestine. This decrease was also supported by a decrease in the biogenic amines concentration. The results suggest that insoluble NSP in a highly digestible carbohydrate diet based on extruded rice for weaner pigs reduced PWD, although reductions in digestibility were also noted. The protective effect of oat hulls was most likely due to the modification of the intestinal microbiota away from a predominantly protein fermenting populations to a biota having more saccharolytic bacteria...|$|R
40|$|When {{the rainy}} season {{transforms}} dry vegetation to fresh, green fodder, farmers know that their cattle, sheep and goats will gain weight and produce more milk. But livestock production and profitability in Africa today depend on more than {{a good source of}} feed. In the humid and sub humid zones of West and Central Africa, there have been major changes in the climate affecting animal production {{that have nothing to do}} with rainfall. The political and economic climate has changed dramatically as a result of structural adjustment, devaluation, and reduced government intervention and price control. The region is poised to take further advantage of what is already proving to be a real to producers to increase the quantity and quality of their production. Consumer demand for fresh and processed meat, for milk, eggs and processed dairy products is waiting to be satisfied. In the past, that demand has been met by imported <b>meat,</b> milk <b>powder</b> and butter oil, but cheap imports are no longer available and the region has to look to its own production capacity. Are those who decide the policies which affect livestock production sufficiently well-informed to guide the sector to 'greener pastures'? As a contribution to meeting the needs of the region, CTA sponsored and organized a seminar on Livestock development policies in the humid and sub-humid zones of sub-Saharan Africa. The seminar was held in Abidjan, Cote d'lvoire, 5 - 9 February 1996, and was attended by participants from 17 countries in West and Central Africa and representatives of international organizations and European countries. undervalued. If an animal is fed on food which has cost no money to obtain, and if it is consumed by the owner's family who do not have to part with money before they can eat, where is that animal going to figure in the cash columns of a national budget? Nevertheless, livestock is an integral part of a nation's economy Participants at the Abidjan seminar called for an inventory of livestock resources, production and utilization for each country and for the region as a whole. The formats and database structures should be standardized to facilitate international comparisons and exchange of information. Such information, coupled with regional cooperation to reduce delays and difficulties at border crossings, should lead to better trading conditions and to a more sustainable and productive use of land resources. seminar on Livestock development policies in the humid and sub-humid zones of sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the quality of data {{obtained}} from control laboratories measuring meat and bone meal (MBM) in feed, IRMM has developed concepts and starting materials for the possible production of reference materials in this field. The measurements to be verified are both qualitative and quantitative to their nature. Two main routes have been tested for the development of such materials, namely dry-mixing of bulk materials and direct gravimetric preparation of individual samples. The first approach consisted of addition of known amounts of <b>meat</b> and bone <b>powders</b> to a maize powder and subsequent 3 -dimensional mixing. The resulting powder was then split up in different sample containers and checked for homogeneity. The second approach consisted of a production with exactly known masses of meat and bone meal powder added to a standard background matrix of maize powder prepared directly in each jar. The latter samples could only be used in single-shot analysis. The existing official method (as described in Annex VI of Commission Regulation EC 152 / 2009) based on sedimentation and light microscopy was used for evaluation of materials as well as NIR microscopy and PCR. This chapter describes the concept, raw materials, the two different approaches for preparation and analytical results. The results are promising in so far that the best set of results obtained for the samples prepared by direct gravimetric preparation were within 10 % of the known target with a precision of ± 11 % RSD using the official EU-method. Possible routes for future material preparation and measurement developments are also discussed. JRC. D. 2 -Standards for Innovation and sustainable Developmen...|$|R
40|$|Serine proteases have wide {{application}} in leather, food, <b>meat</b> and soap <b>powder</b> industries, among others. There {{are a lot}} of methodologies to obtain them in large quantities but most of them are expensive or contaminating. We then propose an economical and environmentally friendly method in which proteases are separated from a crude fresh bovine pancreas homogenate using precipitation with polyacrylate, a commercially available negatively charged and weak polyelectrolyte. The zymogens of the serine proteases were activated prior to precipitation by the addition of trypsin. The proteases were precipitated by adding polyacrylate at pH 4. 50 to the pancreas homogenate. Under these conditions, serine proteases are positively charged and form non-soluble complexes with the negatively charged polyacrylate. The purity of proteases was increased 5 -fold with a recovery of 33 % under the best conditions tested. The volume of the final product was decreased to 5 % of the feedstock, in order to concentrate the sample up to 20  times. The proposed method removed up to 96 % of the contaminant proteins.

50|$|The Kiowa were a nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} {{society which}} mostly relied directly upon food {{available from the}} surrounding wilderness. The food hunted and gathered by the Kiowa was largely identical {{to that of other}} plains Indians such as the Comanche. The most important food source for the Kiowa and all other great plains nations is the American bison or buffalo. Before the introduction of horses bison were hunted on foot and required the hunter to get {{as close as possible to}} their target before rushing quickly in and shooting it with arrows or lancing it. Occasionally the skins of wolves or coyotes were worn to hide their approach towards the bison herds. Hunting bison became far easier after the Kiowa acquired horses. Bison were hunted on horseback with bows and arrows, as well as long lances used to pierce the heart of the animals. Bison meat was eaten roasted, boiled, and dried. Dried meat was prepared into pemmican which was eaten while the people were on the move. Pemmican is made by grinding dried lean <b>meat</b> into a <b>powder,</b> then mixing a near equal weight of melted fat or tallow and sometimes berries; the pemmican was then shaped into bars and kept in pouches until ready to eat. Certain parts of the bison were sometimes eaten raw. Other animals hunted to supplement their main diet of bison included deer, elk, pronghorn, wild mustang, wild turkey, and bears. During times of scarce game, the Kiowa would eat small animals such as lizards, waterfowl, skunks, snakes, armadillos, and other animals that could be found and eaten. The Kiowa's horses, mules, and camp dogs were eaten during desperate situations when no other sources of food were available. Longhorn cattle and horses from American and Mexican ranches were also eaten during hard times.|$|R
