25|$|The entity {{claims a}} unique {{tradition}} that unlike {{the rest of}} the state national guards, also includes the early American period that preceded the creation of the Thirteen Colonies. This claim is reflected in its first Coat of Arms which depicts the defeat of the British in the second Battle of San Juan and the patch worn by the 295th Regiment, designed by John Roqueña in 1953, which features a man wearing a <b>morion.</b> The first coat of arms of the PRNG featured a lion guarding a tower on top of an isle located in the middle of a blue field representing the ocean, the beast representing the militia guarding San Juan, three sailboats that represent the defeated British float in 1798, and a sheep next to a red book representing Puerto Rico as seen in the coat of arms. Since its early days, the units stationed in Puerto Rico used a yellow and red patch that features a guerite, similar to those at El Morro.|$|E
25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, <b>morion,</b> amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} kieselguhr and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E

60|$|Exerting all the {{strength}} that I had been gradually collecting, I hurled him {{back with a}} force that almost drove him from the saddle, and rising in my stirrups I rained blow after blow upon his <b>morion</b> ere he could recover.|$|E

60|$|Sailor-fashion, {{he had no}} armor on but a light <b>morion</b> and a cuirass, so he was not {{too much}} {{encumbered}} to prevent his springing to his legs instantly, and setting to work, cutting and foining right and left at every sound, for sight there was none.|$|E
60|$|There {{were three}} or four men in <b>morions</b> behind Don Miguel, and Lord Julian {{realized}} the position.

2500|$|Unlike the Portuguese, Dutch troops wore armor, which {{consisted}} of breastplates and <b>morions.</b> Their primary weapons were matchlock muskets, pikes and spears, but Queiroz states that the Dutch used flintlock muskets in addition to matchlocks during the siege.

60|$|For myself I {{singled out}} the blustering Ramiro, and I {{let him know}} it by a {{swinging}} blow of my mace upon his <b>morion.</b> It was a most finely-tempered piece of steel, for my stroke made no impression on it, though Ramiro winced and raised his stout sword to return the compliment.|$|E
60|$|He {{took her}} hand and went away, leaving the clergyman still there; but he lingered only for a report from Mrs. Bowen, which Imogene hurried to get.

50|$|In 1992, French explorers led by Franck Goddio {{excavated}} {{the sunken}} San Diego with its treasure. Because {{of the large}} number of artifacts found with it (over 34,000), this was hailed as a great archaeological discovery. The artifacts included Chinese porcelain, celadon ware, Japanese katanas, Spanish <b>morions,</b> Portuguese cannons and Mexican coins. An MV San Diego warship museum has been constructed on Fortune Island to display and interpret many of the artifacts. This was the island reached by Morga and the other survivors of the San Diego.|$|R
50|$|As {{long as the}} Sonnefeld Monastery owned Frohnlach, it {{gave its}} {{residents}} the lands for the farming. In return, they farmed them to deliver the tithes and provided the compulsory labor. The pitchforks of the place would be merged with the arms of Frohnlach. In 1508, for its defense, Frohnlach had 25 able-bodied men who were armed with 25 <b>morions</b> Sturmhauben, 12 rollers Gollers, 19 breastplates, 3 pairs of arm-guards, 28 pikes, 5 halberds, 2 guns and 25 knives. Frohnlach must have possessed the municipal rights around 1400, because in 1467 and in the following years, the people of Frohnlach resisted the restrictions of their trading rights.|$|R
60|$|Here the Countess and Wayland {{found the}} {{gate at the}} end of this avenue, which opened on the Warwick road, guarded by a body of the Queen's mounted yeomen of the guard, armed in {{corselets}} richly carved and gilded, and wearing <b>morions</b> instead of bonnets, having their carabines resting with the butt-end on their thighs. These guards, distinguished for strength and stature, who did duty wherever the Queen went in person, were here stationed under the direction of a pursuivant, graced with the Bear and Ragged Staff on his arm, as belonging to the Earl of Leicester, and peremptorily refused all admittance, excepting to such as were guests invited to the festival, or persons who were to perform some part in the mirthful exhibitions which were proposed.|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey Vickars {{had been}} {{somewhat}} severely wounded upon {{the last day}} of the struggle in the cellar, a Spanish officer having beaten down his guard and cleft through his <b>morion.</b> Lionel was unwounded, but the fatigue and excitement had told upon him greatly, and soon after they arrived at Bergen Captain Vere advised both of them to return home for a few months.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then we {{discussed}} it afterward. We {{had a long}} discussion. And then he read us the 'Legend of Pornic,' {{and we had a}} discussion about that.

60|$|Again {{he swung}} his sword in that {{favourite}} stroke of his; but this time I caught the edge upon my mace, and ere he could recover I aimed a blow straight at his face.

6000|$|... "But the galleon is upon us!" [...] cried Vigitello. And so, indeed, it was, {{creeping}} up slowly under that faint breeze, her tall bulk loomed now above them, her prow ploughing slowly forward at an acute {{angle to the}} prow of the galeasse. Another moment and she was alongside, and with a swing and clank and a yell of victory from the English seamen lining her bulwarks her grappling irons swung down to seize the corsair ship at prow and stern and waist. Scarce had they fastened, than a torrent of men in breast-plates and <b>morions</b> poured over her side, to alight upon the prow of the galeasse, and not even {{the fear of the}} lantern held above the powder barrel could now restrain the corsairs from giving these hardy boarders the reception they reserved for all infidels. In an instant the fighting platform on the prow was become a raging, seething hell of battle luridly illumined by the ruddy glow from the lights aboard the Silver Heron. Foremost among those who had leapt down had been Lionel and Sir John Killigrew. Foremost among those to receive them had been Jasper Leigh, who had passed his sword through Lionel's body even as Lionel's feet came to rest upon the deck, and before the battle was joined.|$|R
6000|$|Now scarce the dawning {{day began}} to spring, [...] As at a signal given, {{the streets with}} clamours ring: [...] At once the crowd arose; {{confused}} and high, [...] Even from the heaven was heard a shouting cry, [...] For Mars was early up, and roused the sky. [...] The gods came downward to behold the wars, [...] Sharpening their sights, and leaning from their stars. [...] The neighing of the generous horse was heard, [...] For battle by the busy groom prepared: [...] Rustling of harness, rattling of the shield, [...] Clattering of armour, furbished for the field. [...] Crowds to the castle mounted up the street; [...] Battering the pavement with their coursers' feet: [...] The greedy sight might there devour the gold [...] Of glittering arms, too dazzling to behold: [...] And polished steel that cast the view aside, [...] And crested <b>morions,</b> with their plumy pride. [...] Knights, with a long retinue of their squires, [...] In gaudy liveries march, and quaint attires. [...] One laced the helm, another held the lance; [...] A third the shining buckler did advance. [...] The courser pawed the ground with restless feet, [...] And snorting foamed, and champed the golden bit. [...] The smiths and armourers on palfreys ride, [...] Files in their hands, and hammers at their side, [...] And nails for loosened spears and thongs for shields provide. [...] The yeomen guard the streets in seemly bands; [...] And clowns come crowding on, with cudgels in their hands.|$|R
