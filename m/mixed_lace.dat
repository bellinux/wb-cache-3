5000|$|Tape lace is {{made with}} a {{straight}} tape which is bent into the shape required and sewn into position. Various needle lace fillings {{may be used to}} fill the gaps. The tape is usually machine made. This type of lace is also known as mixed tape lace, or <b>mixed</b> <b>lace,</b> as it uses more than one technique: one in making the tape, and a different technique for the fillings and joins.|$|E
5000|$|Bobbin tape lace is {{bobbin lace}} where {{the design is}} formed {{of one or more}} tapes curved so they make an {{attractive}} pattern. The tapes are made {{at the same time as}} the rest of the lace, and are joined to each other, or themselves, using a crochet hook. [...] The tapes are made curved, and by hand, using bobbin lace techniques. This should be distinguished from <b>mixed</b> tape <b>lace,</b> which is made using an existing straight tape, often machine made.|$|R
40|$|The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, Teaching, Assessment (hereafter CEFR) and {{the related}} {{documents}} are the current realities of ELT professionals, mainly in Europe, {{as part of the}} practices in their field of study. Although it is labeled as “common” and “European”, the CEFR is an internationally recognized framework worldwide. In this sense, this study aims to uncover whether the CEFR and the other related European documents such as the European Language Portfolio (hereafter ELP), as a course in M. A. classes, have reflected certain degree of effectiveness in relation to students’ expectations. Herein, students’ self-reflection forms and achievement test-retest scores were analyzed. Accordingly, the <b>mixed</b> method <b>laced</b> with both qualitative and quantitative data was implemented. The learners’ test-retest scores as achievement criteria constituted the quantitative part of the study. On the other hand, the qualitative part was composed of the learners’ self-reflection forms for the course and discussion-based self- assessment reports. The results of the study revealed the fact that the CEFR as an M. A course was internalized better on condition that the lecture was followed by self-study, self- reflection, discussion-based self-assessment as a part of review process and test-retest practices respectively, when applied whole and complete...|$|R
5000|$|The band {{started in}} 1984 as a loose {{collective}} of around eight members called the Brotherhood VIP. VIP stood for [...] "Vagabonds in Power", {{taken from a}} Fela Kuti record of the same name. They were a collective of rappers, dancers, graffiti artists, and DJ's who were black, white, Muslim and Jewish. The group included Aston Harvey, later known as DJ Hasty of the Freestylers, a Muslim Tanzanian MC named Sir Yes and a producer named Secretgrooves. In later interviews, founding member Lorenzo (Laurence Knopf, later called Mr Shylok) told the press the name had referred to the collective's ideal of [...] "brotherhood between races". The Brotherhood VIP were a regular feature at North London underground hip hop jams and blues parties in the original 80s underground scene. Their <b>mix</b> tapes <b>laced</b> with rap circulated until 1989, when the original line up amicably parted ways. 1990 saw The Brotherhood, now including DJ/Producer Son of Funk (Jason Roth, later known as DJ Diablo, part of Roots Manuva's [...] "Banana Clan" [...] and featured in DJ MK's The Funhouse), continue to record demo tracks, assisted by production from Secretgrooves who had formed a new group called VIP with Sir Yes. In turn Lorenzo (Mr Shylok) helped out on production of VIP's demo tracks.|$|R
