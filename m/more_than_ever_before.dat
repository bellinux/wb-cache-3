25|$|The {{basic concept}} behind interventional {{radiology}} is to diagnose or treat pathologies, {{with the most}} minimally invasive technique possible. Minimally invasive procedures are currently performed <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>before.</b> These procedures are often performed with the patient fully awake, {{with little or no}} sedation required. Interventional Radiologists and Interventional Radiographers diagnose and treat several disorders, including peripheral vascular disease, renal artery stenosis, inferior vena cava filter placement, gastrostomy tube placements, biliary stents and hepatic interventions. Images are used for guidance, and the primary instruments used during the procedure are needles and catheters. The images provide maps that allow the Clinician to guide these instruments through the body to the areas containing disease. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient, peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery times, as well as hospital stays. To be a trained interventionalist in the United States, an individual completes a five-year residency in radiology and a one- or two-year fellowship in IR.|$|E

2500|$|<b>More</b> <b>than</b> <b>ever</b> <b>before</b> we {{have access}} to {{information}} {{that allows us to}} reflect on the causes and consequences of our actions. At the same time we are faced with dangers related to unintended consequences of our actions and by our reliance on the knowledge of experts.
