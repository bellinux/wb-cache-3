5|$|The koala is {{classified}} with wombats (family Vombatidae) and several extinct families (including <b>marsupial</b> tapirs, <b>marsupial</b> lions and giant wombats) in the suborder Vombatiformes within the order Diprotodontia. The Vombatiformes are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods (kangaroos and wallabies) and possums. The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal, and the koala's lineage was possibly {{the first to}} branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{are also}} widely {{distributed}} among host taxa, which include <b>marsupial</b> and placental mammals, birds, reptiles such as snakes, iguanas and lizards, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|Africa {{separated}} from Antarctica around 160million years ago, {{followed by the}} Indian subcontinent, in the early Cretaceous (about 125 million years ago). About 66 million years ago, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a tropical to subtropical climate, complete with <b>marsupial</b> fauna and an extensive temperate rainforest.|$|E
5000|$|Taxonomically, the {{two primary}} {{divisions}} of Marsupialia are American <b>marsupials</b> (Ameridelphia) and Australian <b>marsupials</b> (Australidelphia). The order Microbiotheria (which {{has only one}} species, the monito del monte) is found in South America, but {{is believed to be}} more closely related to Australian <b>marsupials.</b> DNA evidence supports a South American origin for <b>marsupials,</b> with Australian <b>marsupials</b> arising from a single Gondwanan migration of <b>marsupials</b> from South America to Australia. There are many small arboreal species in each group. The term [...] "opossum" [...] is used to refer to American species (though [...] "possum" [...] is a common diminutive), while similar Australian species are properly called [...] "possums".|$|R
50|$|Along {{with their}} {{habitats}} in woody forests and behind sand dunes, indigenous <b>marsupials</b> patrol domestic lawns nightly. The animals chew off any {{growth in the}} grass from the previous night. Fire risk is reduced by this frequent trimming, and the soil remains fertilized and conditioned by fecal matter the <b>marsupials</b> leave behind. Many farmers have found that using the <b>marsupials</b> to aid their plants works great. They allow the <b>marsupials</b> to come in at night and trim grasses in their gardens. This also reveals weeds or other shrubs, making extraction of unwanted plants easier. The <b>marsupials</b> leave vegetables and fruits alone while focusing only on eating grass. While this may be beneficial to crop farmers, others are frustrated with constant efforts to keep <b>marsupials</b> out of their grass cattle pastures. Expensive fencing and repair to keep <b>marsupials</b> out of pastures has caused much controversy.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that trichromacy may also be quite general among <b>marsupials.</b> A study conducted regarding trichromacy in Australian <b>marsupials</b> suggests the medium wavelength sensitivity, MWS, cones of the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) and the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata) are features coming from the inherited reptilian retinal arrangement. The possibility of trichromacy in <b>marsupials</b> potentially has another evolutionary basis than that of primates. Further biological and behavioural tests may verify if trichromacy is a common characteristic of <b>marsupials.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>marsupial</b> fauna of Australia and the placental mammals of the Old World {{have several}} strikingly similar forms, {{developed}} in two clades, isolated from each other. The body {{and especially the}} skull shape of the thylacine (Tasmanian wolf) converged with those of Canidae such as the red fox, Vulpes vulpes.|$|E
5|$|UA 8699 was {{discovered}} in a joint study by Stony Brook University and the University of Antananarivo (UA) {{and placed in the}} collections of the latter as specimen 8699. It was found at a locality named MAD93-95 in the Anembalemba Member of the Maevarano Formation, which is Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The locality is in the Mahajanga Basin of northwestern Madagascar. Several other mammals have been recovered from similarly aged Madagascar deposits, but most are also known from very limited material. These include the gondwanathere Lavanify, an indeterminate multituberculate, and a few other indeterminate teeth, as well as a nearly complete skeleton representing an otherwise unknown mammalian lineage. In a 2001 Nature paper, David Krause announced the discovery of UA 8699 and argued for <b>marsupial</b> affinities of the specimen. Because the specimen is so fragmentary, he refrained from assigning a new scientific name to the tooth. Two years later, Alexander Averianov, David Archibald, and Thomas Martin favored a placental interpretation in a paper in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, noting that the specimen was essentially similar to the zhelestid Lainodon. In a 2006 review of some of the Cretaceous vertebrates of Madagascar, Krause and colleagues continued to consider the specimen as a <b>marsupial</b> and announced that an upcoming paper by Case would make the case for <b>marsupial</b> affinities more fully.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} indicates that mammals did not explosively diversify across the K–Pg boundary, despite the environment niches made available by the extinction of dinosaurs. Several mammalian orders have been interpreted as diversifying immediately after the K–Pg boundary, including Chiroptera (bats) and Cetartiodactyla (a diverse group that today includes whales and dolphins and even-toed ungulates), although recent research concludes that only <b>marsupial</b> orders diversified after the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Marsupials</b> {{probably}} {{existed in}} Australia {{at least from}} the early Paleocene (...) , although the earliest found undoubted fossils of Australian <b>marsupials</b> are from the late Oligocene [...]|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the front pouch, which contains multiple nipples for the protection and sustenance of their young, <b>marsupials</b> have other common structural features. Ossified patellae are absent in most modern <b>marsupials</b> (though {{a small number of}} exceptions are reported) and epipubic bones are present. <b>Marsupials</b> (and monotremes) also lack a gross communication (corpus callosum) between the right and left brain hemispheres.|$|R
25|$|The living Metatheria are all <b>marsupials</b> (animals with pouches). A few fossil genera, {{such as the}} Mongolian late Cretaceous Asiatherium, may be <b>marsupials</b> {{or members}} of some other metatherian group(s).|$|R
5|$|A fragmentary molar, {{preserving}} two cusps, {{is identified}} as from a multituberculate. Although multituberculates are common in nearly contemporaneous deposits in Laurasia, this tooth {{is one of the}} few records from Gondwana; a few fragmentary remains, the multituberculate affinities of some of which are disputed, are also known from South America (Argentodites), Africa (Hahnodon), and Australia (Corriebaatar). Another fragmentary tooth, UA 8699, is recognizable as a tribosphenic lower molar. Krause identified it in 2001 as a <b>marsupial,</b> but in 2003 a group led by Alexander Averianov instead argued that the tooth was placental and related to zhelestids (a primitive group possibly related to ungulates). Both placentals and marsupials are mostly known from Laurasia during the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups thought {{to be related to}} them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both <b>marsupial</b> and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought to be related to xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other mammals}} have been {{recorded}} from the late Cretaceous of Madagascar, mostly {{on the basis of}} isolated teeth. A possible second gondwanathere is represented by a tooth that is larger and lower-crowned than those of Lavanify, and a yet lower-crowned tooth may also be of a gondwanathere. A lower molar, UA8699, may be of a <b>marsupial</b> or a placental and a molar fragment is referable to Multituberculata. Finally, an as-yet-undescribed mammal is known from a fairly complete skeleton. None of these mammals is related to the living mammals of the island, many of which belong to unique groups (see List of mammals of Madagascar). The fauna also contains crocodyliforms, dinosaurs, and other animals.|$|E
50|$|Although Maelestes was a eutherian, {{it was not}} a placental mammal. The {{presence}} of an epipubic bone suggests that it could not expand its torso the same way placentals can, forcing it to give birth to small, relatively undeveloped young like modern <b>marsupials.</b> Like modern <b>marsupials,</b> it might have had a pouch, though there is no evidence for this and many <b>marsupials</b> like shrew opossums lack pouches.|$|R
50|$|As <b>marsupials,</b> these moles {{are even}} more distantly related to true Talpidae moles than golden moles, both of which belong to the eutheria, or placental mammals. This means {{that they are more}} closely related to such {{existing}} Australian <b>marsupials</b> as kangaroos or koalas, and even to a lesser extent to American <b>marsupials,</b> such as opossums, than they are to placental mammals, such as golden or Talpidae moles.|$|R
40|$|Australian <b>marsupials</b> {{have been}} {{distinct}} from eutherlans for about 130 million years (McKenna, 1969). Adaptive radiation {{during this time}} has resulted In considerable variety In ecological niche and anatomical features of <b>marsupials.</b> The relationship of the urinary and genital tracts {{to each other and}} the relatively undeveloped state of young, (born after a short gestation period) are among the major features distinguishing <b>marsupials</b> from eutherlans (Tyndale-Blscoe, 1973) ...|$|R
5|$|The first {{successful}} efforts at conserving the species were {{initiated by the}} establishment of Brisbane's Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Sydney's Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became the first to successfully breed koalas and {{earned a reputation as}} the foremost contemporary authority on the <b>marsupial.</b> In 1934, David Fleay, curator of Australian mammals at the Melbourne Zoo, established the first Australian faunal enclosure at an Australian zoo, and featured the koala. This arrangement allowed him to undertake a detailed study of its diet in captivity. Fleay later continued his conservation efforts at Healesville Sanctuary and the David Fleay Wildlife Park.|$|E
5|$|This {{evidence}} that giant reptiles had lived on Earth {{in the past}} caused great excitement in scientific circles, and even among some segments of the general public. Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that {{was found in the}} same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a <b>marsupial,</b> but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro mahabo is a mammal {{from the}} middle Jurassic (about 167 million years ago) of Madagascar. The only species of the genus Ambondro, it is known from a fragmentary lower jaw with three teeth, {{interpreted}} as the last premolar and the first two molars. The premolar consists of a central cusp {{with one or two}} smaller cusps and a cingulum (shelf) on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth. The molars also have such a lingual cingulum. They consist of two groups of cusps: a trigonid of three cusps at the front and a talonid with a main cusp, a smaller cusp, and a crest at the back. Features of the talonid suggest that Ambondro had tribosphenic molars, the basic arrangement of molar features also present in <b>marsupial</b> and placental mammals. It is the oldest known mammal with putatively tribosphenic teeth; {{at the time of its}} discovery it antedated the second oldest example by about 25 million years.|$|E

50|$|<b>Marsupials</b> are any {{members of}} the {{mammalian}} infraclass Marsupialia. All extant <b>marsupials</b> are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species {{is that most of}} the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known <b>marsupials</b> include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, the quokka, and the Potoroo.|$|R
5|$|Krause {{wrote that}} UA 8699 {{was the first}} <b>marsupial</b> to be {{identified}} from Madagascar and the first from the Mesozoic of any part of Gondwana. Marsupials {{date back to the}} Eocene in Australia and Africa and to the Paleocene in South America; although Cretaceous marsupials have been recorded there, none of the records are unambiguous. Marsupials were certainly present in the Northern Hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. He interpreted UA 8699 as evidence that marsupials must already have colonized the southern continents by the late Cretaceous, presumably having reached Madagascar through South America and Antarctica. By the late Cretaceous, boreosphenidans must already have been in the process of replacing archaic mammals like gondwanatheres on the southern continents, as suggested by the presence of Deccanolestes, a placental, in the Cretaceous of India.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} {{has changed}} significantly {{since the first}} taxonomic classification of lemurs by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. One {{of the greatest challenges}} has been the classification of the aye-aye, which has been a topic of debate up until very recently. Until Richard Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus Daubentonia) was a primate, rodent, or <b>marsupial.</b> However, the placement of the aye-aye within the order Primates remained problematic until very recently. Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus Daubentonia as a specialized indriid, a sister group to all strepsirrhines, and as an indeterminate taxon within the order Primates. Molecular tests have now shown Daubentoniidae is basal to all Lemuriformes, and in 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others ignored addressing higher-level taxonomy by defining lemurs as monophyletic and containing five living families, including Daubentoniidae.|$|E
5|$|The only {{carnivore}} in the Moluccas is the Malayan civet (Musang), {{which he}} supposes {{has been introduced}} by accident as it is kept for its musk. The Celebes Babirusa is, oddly, found on Bouru, which he supposes it reached partly by swimming, citing Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology to confirm this ability. The other mammals are <b>marsupial,</b> so, he presumes, true natives. In contrast to the few mammals, {{there are at least}} 265 bird species, more than all of Europe, which had 257, but of these just three groups – parrots, kingfishers and pigeons – make up nearly a third, compared to only a twentieth of the birds of India. Wallace suggests this is because they came from New Guinea, which has a similar lack of some groups, and adds that many New Guinea birds have not reached the Moluccas, implying that the islands have been isolated for a long time.|$|E
50|$|Because newborn <b>marsupials</b> must {{climb up}} to their mother's nipples, their front limbs are much more {{developed}} {{than the rest of}} their bodies at the time of birth. This requirement has been argued to have resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in <b>marsupials</b> compared to placentals. <b>Marsupials</b> must develop grasping forepaws during their early youth, making the transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers, as some groups of placental mammals have done, far more difficult. However, several <b>marsupials</b> do possess atypical forelimb morphologies, such as the hooved forelimbs of the pig-footed bandicoot, suggesting that the range of forelimb speciation is a lot less limited than usually assumed.|$|R
25|$|Modern mammals (class Mammalia) {{are divided}} into Monotremes, <b>Marsupials,</b> and Placentals. The {{subclass}} Prototheria (Monotremes) comprises the five species of egg-laying mammals: platypus and four echidna species. The infraclasses Metatheria (<b>Marsupials)</b> and Eutheria (Placentals) together form the subclass Theria.|$|R
40|$|Defluorination {{activity}} in liver subcellular fractions {{was investigated in}} species of rodent, <b>marsupials</b> and monotremes. The defluorination {{activity in}} the mouse and rat was {{compared with that of}} two Australian <b>marsupials,</b> the brushtail possum and tamar wallaby to dtermine the species related differences in fluoroacetate sensitivity. The results indicated that there are clear species differences in the subcellular distribution of defluorination activity in all species, the <b>marsupials</b> possessed a certain amount of defluorination ability in their mitochondrial fractions. The nuclear fractions generally contained a consistent amount of defluorination activity across the four species, indicating the need for further investigation. The single playpus and echidna samples also exhibited a similar distribution of defluorination activity in the liver subcellular fractions. These results clearly localise the fluoroacetate defluorination activity in liver cytosol and provide further insight into the fluoroacetate detoxication ability of Austrlian <b>marsupials</b> and montoremes. The enzyme kinetic study revealed that the Australian <b>marsupials</b> living outside the range of fluoroacetate-containing plants appear to have a lower ability to detoxify fluoroacetate than rodents have. This suggests that <b>marsupials</b> may be more disadvantaged in there metabolic detoxication of some xenobiotics than previously thought...|$|R
5|$|UA 8699 (University of Antananarivo {{specimen}} 8699) is {{a fossil}} mammalian tooth from the Cretaceous of Madagascar. A broken lower molar about 3.5mm (0.14in) long, {{it is from}} the Maastrichtian of the Maevarano Formation in northwestern Madagascar. Details of its crown morphology indicate that it is a boreosphenidan, a member of the group that includes living marsupials and placentals. David W. Krause, who first described the tooth in 2001, interpreted it as a <b>marsupial</b> on the basis of five shared characters, but in 2003 Averianov and others noted that all those are shared by zhelestid placentals and favored a close relationship between UA 8699 and the Spanish zhelestid Lainodon. Krause used the tooth as evidence that marsupials were present on the southern continents (Gondwana) as early as the late Cretaceous and Averianov and colleagues proposed that the tooth represented another example of faunal exchange between Africa and Europe at the time.|$|E
5|$|Viviparous mammals {{are in the}} {{subclass}} Theria; {{those living}} today are in the <b>marsupial</b> and placental infraclasses. Marsupials have a short gestation period, typically shorter than its estrous cycle and gives birth to an undeveloped newborn that then undergoes further development; in many species, this takes place within a pouch-like sac, the marsupium, located {{in the front of}} the mother's abdomen. This is the plesiomorphic condition among viviparous mammals; the presence of epipubic bones in all non-placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy. Even non-placental eutherians probably reproduced this way. The placentals give birth to relatively complete and developed young, usually after long gestation periods. They get their name from the placenta, which connects the developing fetus to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake.|$|E
5|$|Fossorial creatures live in {{subterranean}} environments. Many fossorial mammals {{were classified}} under the, now obsolete, order Insectivora, such as shrews, hedgehogs and moles. Fossorial mammals have a fusiform body, thickest at {{the shoulders and}} tapering off at the tail and nose. Unable {{to see in the}} dark burrows, most have degenerated eyes, but degeneration varies between species; pocket gophers, for example, are only semi-fossorial and have very small yet functional eyes, in the fully fossorial <b>marsupial</b> mole the eyes are degenerated and useless, talpa moles have vestigial eyes and the cape golden mole has a layer of skin covering the eyes. External ears flaps are also very small or absent. Truly fossorial mammals have short, stout legs as strength is more important than speed to a burrowing mammal, but semi-fossorial mammals have cursorial legs. The front paws are broad and have strong claws to help in loosening dirt while excavating burrows, and the back paws have webbing, as well as claws, which aids in throwing loosened dirt backwards. Most have large incisors to prevent dirt from flying into their mouth.|$|E
40|$|Superior {{learning}} for fear-relevant stimuli is typically {{indicated in the}} laboratory by faster acquisition of fear responses, greater learned fear, and enhanced resistance to extinction. Three experiments investigated the speed, magnitude, and robustness of UK children’s (6 - 10 years; N = 290; 122 boys, 168 girls) vicariously learned fear responses for three types of stimuli. In two experiments, children were presented with pictures of novel animals (Australian <b>marsupials)</b> and flowers (fear-irrelevant stimuli) alone (control) or together with faces expressing fear or happiness. To determine learning speed the number of stimulus-face pairings seen by children was varied (1, 10, or 30 trials). Robustness of learning was examined via repeated extinction procedures over 3 weeks. A third experiment compared the magnitude and robustness of vicarious fear {{learning for}} snakes and <b>marsupials.</b> Significant increases in fear responses were found for snakes, <b>marsupials</b> and flowers. There was no indication that vicarious learning for <b>marsupials</b> was faster than for flowers. Moreover, vicariously learned fear was neither greater nor more robust for snakes compared to <b>marsupials,</b> or for <b>marsupials</b> compared to flowers. These findings suggest that for this age group stimulus fear relevance may have little influence on vicarious fear learning...|$|R
