40|$|Macroscopic {{particles}} (> 500 mu m), including marine snow, large migrating zooplankton, {{and their}} fast-sinking fecal pellets, represent primary vehicles of organic carbon flux {{from the surface}} to the deep sea. In contrast, freely suspended microscopic particles such as bacteria and protists do not sink, and they contribute the largest portion of metabolism in the upper ocean. In bathy- and abyssopelagic layers of the ocean (2, 000 - 6, 000 m), however, microscopic particles may not dominate oxygen consumption.

40|$|In {{order to}} give {{a basis for the}} {{structure}} and correlation analysis of fine particle (dusty) plasma and colloidal suspensions, thermodynamic treatment of mixtures of macroscopic and microscopic charged particles within the adiabatic response of the latter is extended to include the case where the system is finite and weakly inhomogeneous. It is shown that the effective potential for <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particles</b> is composed of two elements: mutual Yukawa repulsion and a confining (attractive) Yukawa potential from their `shadow' (the average charge density of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particles</b> multiplied by the minus sign). The result clarifies the relation between two approaches hitherto taken where either a parabolic one-body potential is assumed or the average distribution is assumed to be flat with finite extension. Since the satisfaction of the charge neutrality is largely enhanced by the existence of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particles,</b> the assumption of the flat electrostatic potential and therefore flat average distribution of <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particles</b> in the domain of their existence is expected to be closer to reality than the assumption of the parabolic potential in that domain.

40|$|Purpose: Microdosimetric {{quantities}} such as lineal energy {{are generally}} considered to be better indices than linear energy transfer (LET) for expressing the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of high charge and energy particles. To calculate their probability densities (PD) in macroscopic matter, it is necessary to integrate microdosimetric tools such as track-structure simulation codes with <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particle</b> transport simulation codes. Methods: As an integration approach, the mathematical model for calculating the PD of microdosimetric quantities developed based on track-structure simulations was incorporated into the <b>macroscopic</b> <b>particle</b> transport simulation code PHITS (Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System). The improved PHITS enables the PD in macroscopic matter to be calculated within a reasonable computation time, while taking their stochastic nature into account. Applications: The microdosimetric function of PHITS was applied to biological dose estimation for charged-particle therapy and risk estimation for astronauts. The former application was performed in combination with the microdosimetric kinetic model, while the latter employed the radiation quality factor expressed as a function of lineal energy. Conclusion: Owing to the unique features of the microdosimetric function, the improved PHITS has the potential to establish more sophisticated systems for radiological protection in space {{as well as for the}} treatment planning of charged-particle therapy...|$|E
