6000|$|Meanwhile I {{continued}} my investigations, and by and by, {{peering into}} an empty barrel received {{one of the greatest}} shocks I had ever experienced. Down {{at the bottom of the}} barrel was a big brown-and- yellow <b>mottled</b> <b>owl,</b> one of a kind I had never seen, standing with its claws grasping a dead pigeon and its face turned up in alarm at mine. What a face it was!--a round grey disc, with black lines like spokes radiating from the centre, where the beak was, and the two wide-open staring orange-coloured eyes, the wheel-like head surmounted by a pair of ear-or horn-like black feathers! For a few moments we stared at one another, then recovering myself I shouted, [...] "Father--an owl!" [...] For although I had never seen its like before I knew it was an owl. Not until that moment had I known any owl except the common burrowing-owl of the plain, a small grey-and-white bird, half diurnal in its habits, with a pretty dove-like voice when it hooted round the house of an evening.|$|E

This exhibit includes fruit bats, slender loris, slow loris, civets, leopard cats, hedgehogs, barn <b>owls,</b> <b>mottled</b> wood <b>owls,</b> fishing owls, and great horned owls. There is also an aquarium, dino park, butterfly park and tortoise house.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>mottled</b> wood <b>owl</b> (Strix ocellata) is {{a species}} of large owl found in India. They are found in gardens and thin {{deciduous}} forests adjacent to dry thorn forests or farmland. They are easily detected by their distinctive tremulous eerie calls at dawn and dusk. The characteristic call is a duet of {{the male and female}} while other notes include a low hoot and a screech. Their large size, lack of [...] "ear" [...] tufts and the concentric barring on the face make them easy to identify.|$|R

50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1849 by John Cassin as Ciccaba virgata. In 1999, Wink and Heidrich transferred {{it to the}} genus Strix, but this is still contested by some authorities.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> is a {{medium-sized}} owl with adults reaching 280 to 355 mm in length. Females are considerably larger than males; the <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> shows the greatest degree of sexual dimorphism of any species of owl. The crown, nape and back are mottled in several shades of darkish brown, the facial disc is pale brown and the throat, breast and belly are off-white with distinctive vertical brown streaks. The large eyes are brown, the beak is greyish-yellow or greyish-blue, and {{the legs and}} feet are greyish-yellow. There is a darker form of the bird with a buff breast and belly. Mottled owls produce a range of calls which include a hoot used in maintaining territory boundaries, and various whistles, screeches and hisses.|$|E
60|$|Nocturnal animals supply another {{illustration}} of the same rule, in the dusky colours of mice, rats, bats, and moles, and in the soft <b>mottled</b> plumage of <b>owls</b> and goatsuckers which, while almost equally inconspicuous in the twilight, are such as to favour their concealment in the daytime.|$|R
50|$|Eight {{percent of}} bird species in India {{occur in the}} Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary. Among the 227 bird species found in Mudumalai, 110 species are insectivores, 62 are carnivores, 23 species are fishivores, 12 species are omnivores and 20 species are granivores. These include the unique near {{threatened}} black-and-orange flycatcher. Regional endemics include Malabar trogon and Malabar grey hornbill. Some rare birds of prey like the rufous-bellied eagle can occasionally be seen in this sanctuary. Other predatory birds include crested hawk-eagle, crested serpent eagle, changeable hawk eagle, black eagle, Oriental honey-buzzard, Jerdon's baza, Bonelli's eagle, crested goshawk, besra, <b>mottled</b> wood <b>owl</b> and brown hawk owl, and several minivets.|$|R

50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> breeds between February and May in Colombia and in September to November in Argentina. It usually nests {{in a hole}} in a tree but {{may also}} choose an empty nest built by another species.

5000|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> has a {{very wide}} range {{and the number of}} {{individual}} birds has been estimated to be somewhere between five hundred thousand and five million. It is listed by the IUCN as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] on the basis that, though its numbers may be decreasing slightly, they are not doing so at such a rate as would justify putting the bird in a more vulnerable category.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix virgata) is a {{medium-sized}} owl found in Central and South America from Mexico to Brazil and Argentina. The head and back are mottled brown and the underparts whitish, with vertical {{bars on the}} chest and throat. The eyes are dark and the head is round {{and they do not}} have ear tufts. They are territorial and found in dry forests and jungles up to 2500 m above sea level.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> is {{native to}} Central and South America. Its range extends from Mexico south to Argentina and Brazil and it is found at {{elevations}} up to about 2500 m. It inhabits a variety of wooded habitats including rainforest, woodland verges, dry thorn forest, pine/oak woodland and plantations and also open countryside with scattered trees. In some parts of its range it is common and it is often found close to human habitations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> is nocturnal {{and spends}} {{the day in}} dense {{vegetation}} where it may be mobbed by other birds. Its large eyes are adapted for sight at low levels of light, and its hearing is also acute. It is a predator and at night often perches on a branch beside a glade or {{at the edge of}} woodland on the lookout for prey. When it detects a small moving object, it swoops down from its perch on silent wings and pounces on its target, which may be a small mammal, a bird, reptile or amphibian or a large beetle, grasshopper or other insect.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that the structural components of vegetation have impact over the distribution of owl species in a fragment of a semi-deciduous seasonal forest. This paper also determined which vegetation variables contributed to the spatial distribution of owl species. It was developed in the Perobas Biological Reserve (PBR) between September and December 2011. To conduct the owl census, a playback technique was applied at hearing points distributed to cover different vegetation types in the study area. A total of 56 individual owls of six species were recorded: Tropical Screech-Owl (Megascops choliba), Black-capped Screech-Owl (Megascops atricapilla), Tawny-browed Owl (Pulsatrix koeniswaldiana), Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium brasilianum), <b>Mottled</b> <b>Owl</b> (Strix virgata) and Stygian Owl (Asio stygius). The results suggest that the variables of vegetation structure have impact on the occurrence of owls. The canopy height, the presence of hollow trees, fallen trees and glades are the most important structural components influencing owl distribution in the sampled area...|$|E
40|$|During April and May of 1989, mottled owls, Ciccaba virgata, {{were exposed}} to tape {{recordings}} of conspecific calls in Tikal National Park, Guatemala. Their responses were counted {{and the relationship between}} calling and certain parameters (such as weather, light, and time of night) was evaluated. The owls were quite responsive to broadcast of conspecific vocalizations throughout the study period. Wind was the only factor, of those tested, that affected the potential to hear an owl call. The high rate of response (40 %) under a variety of conditions suggests that broadcast of taped calls {{can be used as a}} census tool for this species. During the 1990 breeding season, seven <b>mottled</b> <b>owl</b> nests were found in cavities of live trees. Mean clutch size was 2. 14. Five of these nests fledged a total of nine young, which left the nest at between 27 and 33 days of age. Mean home range size was 22. 9 ha (85 % harmonic mean) for four radio-tagged breeding males, and the density of this population was 7. 5 breeding adults per sq km. The owls were quite vocal, and four distinct calls were heard. The diet was found to consist primarily of beetles and other insects, with cricetid rodents taken regularly as well. A large sexual size dimorphism, not previously described for this species, was observed...|$|E
