40|$|A {{membrane}} permeation-controlled transfermal {{delivery system}} (MC-TDS) of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), a model drug, was prepared from polyvinyl alcohol aqueous gel containing the drug, a membrane consisting of ethylenevinyl acetate copolymer membrane and acrylic adhesive (EV-a). The permeability of ISDN through the EV-a membrane was 2. 5 {{times higher than}} that through excised hairless rat skin. The ratio of plasma concentration of ISDN after application of MC-TDS on stripped (damaged) skin relative to intack skin was lower than that after application of Frandol tape-S, a marketed ISDN TDS, {{which suggests that the}} EV-a membrane might work as a control membrane for overall delivery rate of <b>ISDN</b> <b>to</b> the body. When MC-TDS stored at 30 °C for 13. 5 - 48 h was applied to the damaged skin, however, the initial plasma concentration of ISDN was very much higher than the expected therapeutic level and was not controlled by the EV-a membrane. The initial high plasma concentration of ISDN after application of the stored MC-TDS on the damaged skin was due <b>to</b> <b>migration</b> of <b>ISDN</b> from the reservoir to the adhesive during storage at 30 °C. The migration of drugs into the adhesive might be an important problem in developing efficient MC-TDS...|$|R

A review of the ISDN concept is provided which serves as the foundation for assessing the significance of <b>ISDN</b> <b>to</b> the military and its value in meeting the particular requirements associated with C 3 I telecommunication networks.

5000|$|Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{is a set}} of {{communication}} standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book. [...] Prior <b>to</b> <b>ISDN,</b> the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, network {{migration}} models study {{competition between}} emerging and incumbent technologies {{by considering the}} resulting increase in revenue and associated cost of <b>migration.</b> We propose <b>to</b> advance the science in the existing network migration models by considering additional critical factors, including (i) synergistic relationships across multiple technologies, (ii) reduction in operational expenditures (OpEx) {{as a reason to}} migrate, and, (iii) implications of local network effects on <b>migration</b> decisions. <b>To</b> this end, we propose a novel agent-based migration model considering these factors. Based on the model, we analyze the case study of network <b>migration</b> <b>to</b> two emerging networking paradigms, i. e., IETF Path Computation Element (PCE) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN).
