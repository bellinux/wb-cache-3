5|$|A {{separate}} highway {{bore the}} M-134 designation in the Lower Peninsula {{from the late}} 1920s to the late 1930s. The current highway's immediate predecessors {{were included in the}} original M-4 in the state. That designation was renumbered to the current M-134 moniker in 1939. Since the trunkline number was finalized, it was extended eastward to end south of Goetzville in the 1950s, with a further extension to De Tour in the 1950s. The western section was <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the lakeshore in the 1960s. The last change came when M-134 was extended to Drummond Island in 1989.|$|E

Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the European model of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E

5|$|Armed {{with an air}} gun, Huseby {{threatened}} a cabin attendant and told the captain to proceed as planned to Fornebu. He claimed (falsely) to have placed explosives on board. His demands were to make a political statement and talk to Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke. The plane landed at 15:30 at Fornebu and was surrounded by the police. After one hour, Huseby released 70 hostages in exchange for having the aircraft being <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the terminal building. Thirty minutes later, Huseby released the remaining passengers. He drank throughout the incident, and at 17:30, after he consumed the plane's beer supply, he surrendered his weapon in exchange for more beer.

Godsal was the last to leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|As Gert {{was several}} {{days away from}} Bermuda, the NHC advised {{residents}} there to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm, Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the size and strength of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September19, about two days prior to its closest approach. As Gert <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September20, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away. Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them to emergency shelters. Police workers advised 700families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships away, while hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ida {{moved over}} the Yucatán Channel on November8, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch for areas between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Mexico Beach, Florida.

The hurricane watch was also modified to encompass a smaller area, between Grand Isle and Pascagoula. A hurricane warning was also issued from Pascagoula to Indian Pass. During the afternoon of November9, all hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued and the tropical storm warning was modified to include areas between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Aucilla River. As Ida became extratropical, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings on the storm on November10.|$|E

5|$|As Krovanh was {{approaching}} the Philippines, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau cautioned {{the residents of}} the island against strong winds and warning ships in the Bashi Channel. After the typhoon entered the South China Sea, sea warnings were issued for areas offshore Hainan. Additional warnings were issued and expanded as Krovanh <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the Chinese coast. In preparation for the storm, shipping routes across the Qiongzhou Strait were suspended, while security measures for river dykes and reservoirs were strengthened in both Hainan and Guangdong. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Observatory issued a Standby Signal No.1 on August23, which was upgraded to a Strong Wind Signal No.3 at around noon the following day. All warning signals in Hong Kong were discontinued on August25. In Guangzhou, 15flights were cancelled in anticipation of Krovanh, stranding 500passengers.|$|E
5|$|Huseby's demands were {{to talk to}} Prime Minister Kåre Willoch and Minister of Justice Mona Røkke, {{both from}} the Conservative Party. He also wanted to hold a press conference at Fornebu. Huseby was {{unsatisfied}} with his treatment after he left prison. He demanded to receive guarantees for a better treatment and economic security from the authorities. Assisted by a psychologist, the police negotiated with Huseby. One hour after the plane landed, 70 passengers were let out of the plane. The first group were those passengers who had or claimed they had transfers to other flights. In exchange, the aircraft was <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the terminal building. The passengers were {{picked up by a}} bus and transported to the domestic terminal, where they were questioned by the police. The remaining passengers were let out thirty minutes later.

5|$|In 1438, {{another of}} John Manners' sons, Robert, {{inherited}} the castle and the estates. The lands {{had fallen in}} value considerably over the preceding years, {{as a result of}} the wars with the Scots, the feuding with the Herons and the poverty of the lands. Robert's son, another Robert Manners, inherited the property in 1464, and passed the castle onto his son, George, on his death in 1495. George inherited the title of Baron de Ros from his mother's side of the family and the castle was abandoned as a residence by the family around the end of the 15th century when the Manners <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the royal court.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the club's owners {{announced}} a modernisation of Stamford Bridge {{with plans for}} a state-of-the-art 50,000 all-seater stadium. Work began on the East Stand in 1972 but the project was beset with problems and was never completed; the cost brought the club close to bankruptcy, culminating in the freehold being sold to property developers. Following a long legal battle, {{it was not until}} the mid-1990s that Chelsea's future at the stadium was secured and renovation work resumed. The north, west and southern parts of the ground were converted into all-seater stands and <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the pitch, a process completed by 2001.|$|E
5|$|On July10, PAGASA issued {{their final}} {{advisory}} on Tropical Depression Gorio {{as it moved}} out of their area of responsibility. Hampered by an unfavorable upper-level environment, the depression barely intensified into a tropical storm early on July11. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the JMA named the system Soudelor reporting peak winds of 65km/h, (40mph). Later that day the JTWC reported that Soudelor had weakened into a depression; however they re-upgraded it to a tropical storm as it <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Hainan Province. Shortly before landfall in Leizhou Peninsula, China, the JTWC downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. After moving back over water in the Gulf of Tonkin, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the depression. The JMA, however, continued to monitor Soudelor until it made landfall near Fangchenggang, China several hours later.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Tarawa {{commenced}} on 20 November. In her first offensive {{action of the}} war, Marylands guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore battery with five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead of the landings. Maryland <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, Maryland provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover {{the progress of the}} Marines' assault, with Maryland providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi’s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 the United States also introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the congregation, making more room for the choir. The baptismal font was relocated from the chapel to the front, opposite the ambo. The tabernacle, which had been where the baptismal font is now, and the crucifixion scene were moved to the chapel, creating a chapel for adoration. The restoration works were directed by Franz Josef Hamm from Limburg. The new cross above the altar was created by a group of young people in preparation for confirmation. During the restoration the organ had to be taken apart. The parish decided not to restore it, but to have a new organ built.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical cyclone, the depression was in an area not favorable for significant strengthening, due to land interaction and wind shear. It was tracking steadily northeastward, and as it <b>moved</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the coastline, {{the center of the}} depression was difficult to locate. However, the overall organization briefly improved, and in one forecast the depression was predicted to attain tropical storm status. Early on June4, convection weakened significantly, leaving the center partially exposed. Continued wind shear brought most of the associated thunderstorm activity onshore southwestern Mexico while the center of the depression remained just offshore. Late on June4, the circulation accelerated away from the deep convection as it passed a short distance south of Acapulco. Early on June5, the circulation dissipated, and later that night the remnants moved inland.|$|E
