50|$|A World Area Forecast Centre (WAFC) is a {{meteorological}} centre {{that provides}} real-time meteorological information broadcasts for aviation purposes. These broadcasts are supervised by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) {{in order to}} fulfill requirements of the ICAO Annex 3 covering meteorological information which is necessary for flights. The role of the WAFCs is to provide <b>meteorological</b> <b>messages</b> with worldwide coverage for pilot briefing. They are usually part of the Pre-Flight Information Bulletin (PIB).|$|R
50|$|The Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN) is a {{worldwide}} system of aeronautical fixed circuits provided, {{as part of}} the Aeronautical Fixed Service, for the exchange of messages and/or digital data between aeronautical fixed stations having the same or compatible communications characteristics. AFTN comprises aviation entities including: ANS (Air Navigation Services) providers, aviation service providers, airport authorities and government agencies, to name a few. It exchanges vital information for aircraft operations such as distress messages, urgency messages, flight safety <b>messages,</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>messages,</b> flight regularity messages and aeronautical administrative messages.|$|R
50|$|STANAG 6022 - Adoption of a Standard Gridded Data <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Message</b> is a NATO Standardization Agreement for gridded {{meteorological}} data for operational use in Artillery fire control systems, NBC Automated Warning, Reporting and Prediction Systems (NBC AWRAPS), and various computer-based Battlefield (or Tactical) Decision Aids (BDAs). The message format {{is referred to}} as METGM.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the common}} {{corrections}} depended on meteorological data. For this reason, each Coast Artillery fort or fire command maintained its own meteorological station which transmitted an hourly <b>meteorological</b> <b>message</b> to the entire command whenever firing was anticipated. This message included a series of five- and seven-digit data blocks that reported on the temperature at a given altitude, followed by the wind speed, direction, and ballistic density of the air at each of 11 different altitude bands, running from the surface up through 30,000 ft. The higher altitude readings were needed for firings of the 12-inch coast defense mortars, which sent their shells on very high trajectories.|$|E
5000|$|STANAG 6022 is {{the latest}} step [...] in {{artillery}} meteorological messaging, which provides for gridded meteorological data. This means that instead of using a single Radiosonde ascent capturing local data over a short time period, and circulating that information using older formats, such as the Standard Computer <b>Meteorological</b> <b>message</b> (METCM) under STANAG 4082, it provides a grid of data in four dimensions - vertical, two horizontal and time. The METGM is compiled from many data sources in Weather Analysis Centres (WACs). The data is no longer directly human readable in ASCII text, like METCM was, and thus {{it can not be}} distributed by voice. Data communications are used transfer the METGM to a fire control computer. A METGM approach can thus reduce or remove the need for local data acquisition for some communities.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{becoming}} {{the focus of}} widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre <b>meteorological</b> phenomena to <b>messages</b> from extraterrestrial beings. Many crop circles have been found near ancient sites such as Stonehenge, a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire. They have also been found near mounds of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves, also known as tumuli barrows, or barrows and chalk horses, or trenches dug and filled with rubble made from brighter material than the natural bedrock, often chalk. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Many [...] New Age groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.|$|R
5000|$|Also pictured {{below is}} the {{deflection}} board, used to correct {{for any of}} the factors #6 through #9 above. The Model 1905 board is shown in the two images at right below. This device had a movable T-square and also a movable brass frame (or platen), both of which could be slid back and forth independently across three scales that ran across its base. The protractor-like portion of the platen carried the multiplying scale, which was sometimes used if the battery had missed the chance to fire at the proper interval and was forced to wait until the next interval. [...] Also affixed {{to the base of the}} board was a truncated arc (the wind arc and scale, at the left side of the board, which was used to set up the board for the wind speed and direction reported in the <b>meteorological</b> <b>message</b> (see above).|$|E
50|$|The range {{correction}} {{board is}} pictured below. This was a tabletop device (that resembled a 1940s-vintage wide-carriage mechanical adding machine, without the operating arm on the side) {{that was used}} to figure out the individual corrections that might be required for factors #1 through #7 above and to cumulate these. The result from the range correction board was fed to a slide rule-like device called a percentage corrector to obtain the corrections (if any) to be sent to the gun/s. The range correction board made use of a paper chart that was rolled onto its working surface and offered non-standard curves from which corrections could be read off. This chart had to be specific to the combination of gun, power charge, and projectile in use at the time. Values for the individual factors (#1 through #7 above) had to be obtained by plotting room personnel from battery officers or from the hourly <b>meteorological</b> <b>message.</b>|$|E

40|$|AIS Application-Specific Messages (ASMs) {{transmitted}} in binary format will {{be increasingly}} used to digitally communicate maritime safety/security information between participating vessels and shore stations. This includes time-sensitive metrological and hydrographic (met/hydro) information that is critical for safe vessel transits and efficient ports/waterways management. IMO recently published a new Safety-of-Navigation Circular (SN. 1. /Circ. 289) that includes a number of <b>meteorological</b> and hydrographic <b>message</b> applications and data parameters. While there are no specific display standards for AIS ASMs on shipborne or shore-based systems, IMO Has also issued general guidance for the presentation/display of ASMs (SN. 1 /Circ. 290). It includes specific mention of conforming to the e-Navigation concept-of-operation. For any new IHO S- 57 or S- 100 -related product specifications dealing with dynamic met/hydro information, IHO and its Member States should use the same data content fields and parameters that are defined in IMO SN. 1 /Circ. 289. Also, {{there is a need}} to consider the implications of IMO guidance regarding the presentation/display of AIS ASMs on ECDIS...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the next several days, we will have the {{opportunity}} to conceptualize a research agenda which will be appropriate for a region as well as significant for the social sciences. This is an unusual opportunity since research problems for the social scientists are usually a part of some one else's agenda, either governmental policy agencies or by implications derived from other scientific endeavors. For example, meteorological agencies have often asked the question "Why do people ignore our warnings?" but are seldom content to listen to distinctions which point out the difference between meteorological forecasts and warning messages. Nor do they formulate the question "How can <b>meteorological</b> agencies issue <b>messages</b> in such a way in which people will give attention to them?" In other agendas, questions are often phrased so tat they imply technological answers, rather than "social" solutions. For example, the question of "what can be done to prevent flooding?" usually evokes answers about building more dams and levees when part of the answer might emerge if the question were raised "what is the most efficient and rational use a society can made of flood prone lands?...|$|R
40|$|Water and ice {{detection}} over {{road and}} runway surfaces {{is important to}} improve traffic safety and to reduce maintenance costs. An innovative low cost capacitive sensor was developed to estimate the dry, wet, or icy state of surfaces. The reliability and repeatability of the indications of the sensor were investigated in a previous work based on simulations and experiments in laboratory, together with a preliminary short test in the field. This work {{is devoted to the}} study of the indications of 4 sensors (standard or bituminized) during continuous data acquisition in the field (at the Turin Airport) lasted 8 months. The indications of different sensors were highly correlated. As one important problem when measuring in the field is due to dirt and salt spread over the road, a preliminary study on the effect of different salt concentrations in the water covering the surface of the sensor was performed. Both simulations and laboratory tests showed that the sensor is not affected by the presence of salt in the water. Considering data measured in the field, the estimated condition of the road provided by the sensors was found to be consistent with the METAR (<b>METeorological</b> Aerodrome Report) <b>message</b> of the Turin Airport, for the whole period of investigation. Correlation was found between data from the sensors and rain, fog, and snowfall. The beginning formation of ice identified by the sensor was found to be in some agreement with the indication of a mathematical model of ice prediction from meteorological data. The possibility of using the indications of the sensor together with weather data to train an algorithm providing a more precise prediction of ice formation is discussed. ...|$|R
