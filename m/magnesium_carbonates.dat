5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E

However, {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide exhausted by mankind as compared to the amount which can be used for carbon sequestration with calcium or magnesium is very low. Moreover, variation on the Solvay process will most probably add an additional energy step, which will increase carbon dioxide emissions.|$|E

25|$|Mineral {{sequestration}} aims to trap {{carbon in}} the form of solid carbonate salts. This process occurs slowly in nature and is responsible for the deposition and accumulation of limestone over geologic time. Carbonic acid in groundwater slowly reacts with complex silicates to dissolve calcium, magnesium, alkalis and silica and leave a residue of clay minerals. The dissolved calcium and magnesium react with bicarbonate to precipitate calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> a process that organisms use to make shells. When the organisms die, their shells are deposited as sediment and eventually turn into limestone. Limestones have accumulated over billions of years of geologic time and contain much of Earth's carbon. Ongoing research aims to speed up similar reactions involving alkali carbonates.|$|E

Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates,</b> pyrite, and quartz.

2500|$|Steam engines have {{considerably}} less thermal efficiency than modern diesels, requiring constant maintenance and labour {{to keep them}} operational. Water is required at many points throughout a rail network, making it {{a major problem in}} desert areas, as are found in some regions of the United States, Australia and South Africa. In places where water is available, it may be hard, which can cause [...] "scale" [...] to form, composed mainly of calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide and calcium sulfate. Calcium and <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonates</b> tend to be deposited as off-white solids on the inside the surfaces of pipes and heat exchangers. This precipitation is principally caused by thermal decomposition of bicarbonate ions but also happens in cases where the carbonate ion is at saturation concentration. The resulting build-up of scale restricts the flow of water in pipes. In boilers, the deposits impair the flow of heat into the water, reducing the heating efficiency and allowing the metal boiler components to overheat.|$|E

40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} process of basic <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was investigated. Firstly, Basic <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> was prepared from magnesite, and {{the characteristics of}} the product were detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Subsequently, the {{thermal decomposition}} process of basic <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> in air was studied by thermogravimetry-differential thermogravimetry (TG-DTG). The results of XRD confirm that the chemical composition of basic <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> is 4 MgCO(3) center dot Mg(OH) (2) center dot 4 H(2) O. And the SEM images show that the sample is in sheet structure, with a diameter of 0. 1 - 1 mu m. The TG-DTG results demonstrate that there are two steps in the thermal decomposition process of basic <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate.</b> The apparent activation energies (E) were calculated by Flynn-Wall-Ozawa method. It is obtained from Coats-Redfern's equation and Malek method that the mechanism functions of the two decomposition stages are D 3 and A 1. 5, respectively.

The fundamental difficulty to nucleate anhydrous <b>magnesium</b> <b>carbonate</b> remains when using this non-aqueous solution.
