25|$|Reptiles {{at the zoo}} include American <b>crocodile,</b> <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile,</b> boa constrictor, fer de lance, and crotalus durissus.|$|R
2500|$|The American {{crocodile}} {{is sometimes}} {{confused with the}} smaller, Central American <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile,</b> a smaller species that is native to Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|Green iguana- Iguanas {{are common}} in the zoo and found in several enclosures, {{including}} that of the gibbons and of the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{species are}} {{important}} for conservation; for example, the zoo has bred the rare Mexican wolf, {{as well as the}} endangered <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to various large mammals, {{including}} cougars, jaguars, ocelots, white-nosed coatis, and Baird's tapirs. There is a small population of <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodiles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recently, the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} into the Rio Grande (Rio Bravo in Mexico). Several newspaper outlets on the Mexican {{side of the border}} report of reptiles inhabiting the river appearing not to be the American alligator which is native to Texas, but the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> which is native to Tamaulipas from San Fernando southward. Crocodiles have been seen in the cities of Matamoros, Reynosa and as far north as Nuevo Laredo. The sightings have prompted several municipal police departments to put up signs warning people about entering the river.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the most}} famous animals in Centla are the <b>Morelet</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreleti) and the {{alligator}} gar, known as pejelagarto, a fish that already existed during the age of dinosaurs.|$|R
50|$|In Belize, {{there are}} 2 species of {{crocodilians}} that roam around the waters, the American <b>Crocodile</b> and <b>Morelet's</b> <b>Crocodile.</b> Although {{both of these}} species are not particularly aggressive, they are found as a danger to humans. The American Crocodile can grow up to 6.4 m (21 ft), on average being about 4 m (13 ft). They are usually found in the swamps and lowlands of Belize. <b>Morelet's</b> <b>Crocodile,</b> which is smaller than the American can grown up to 4 m (13 ft) but the average size is 2.5 m (8 ft). These crocodiles are mostly seen {{along the coast of}} Northern and Central Belize in freshwater.|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreletti). The most {{endangered}} crocodile in Mexico has reproduced {{well in the}} Guadalajara Zoo. Many young crocodiles born to the zoo's reproductive couple Juanito and Rosita {{have been}} released in the Centla swamps, one of the Morelet's crocodiles' original habitats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreletii), {{also known}} as the Mexican crocodile, is a modest sized crocodilian found only in fresh waters of the Atlantic regions of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. It usually grows to about 3 m in length. It is a Least Concern species.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> - This {{endangered}} crocodile {{species has}} been bred in the park, {{and some of}} the young have been returned to the Centla Swamps in the Mexican state of Tabasco, where they originally thrived. The two main breeding crocodiles are reportedly named Juanito and Margarita.|$|R
25|$|Local {{wildlife}} {{includes the}} following species, {{some of which are}} highly endangered: jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Felis concolor), ocelot (Leopardus wiedii), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), red brocket deer (Mazama americana), howler monkey (Alouatta pigra), red snook (Petenia splendida), <b>Morelet's</b> <b>Crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreletii) and the ocellated turkey (Agriocharis ocellata).|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{has long}} been {{threatened}} by habitat destruction and illegal hunting. Both of these factors have significantly lowered their populations. It was hunted for its hide during the 1940s and 1950s because high quality leather {{can be made from}} their skins. Crocodile leather {{can be used to make}} wallets, coats and shoes.|$|R
40|$|Spotlight {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} from 1992 to 1997 {{to determine the}} population status of <b>Morelet’s</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Crocodylus mor-eletii, in northern Belize. A total of 754 crocodiles were observed and 481. 9 km surveyed (1. 55 /km). Encounter rates were highest in non-alluvial (8. 20 /km) and alluvial (6. 11 /km) lagoons, and considerably lower in most rivers and creeks (0. 95 /km), and coastal mangrove habitats (0. 24 /km). The population sex ratio was significantly male biased (1 female: 5. 3 males), although {{the reasons for this}} are unclear. Comparisons with survey data from 1979 to 1980 suggest substantial population recovery has occurred following legal protection in 1981. At present there are no immediate threats to the continued survival of <b>Morelet’s</b> <b>crocodile</b> in Belize. Conservation actions should address the creation of additional protected areas in anticipation of future regional development...|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> was {{discovered}} in Mexico in 1850 and named after the French naturalist who made the discovery, Pierre Marie Arthur Morelet (1809-1892). It was long confused with the American and Cuban crocodiles because of similar characteristics and an ambiguous type locality. It was not generally accepted as a separate species until the 1920s.|$|R

5000|$|... 78 {{different}} species of reptiles and amphibians have been documented in Shipstern Conservation & Management Area. They include salamanders, frogs, toad, iguanas, snakes and the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreletii). Due to overharvesting, the Mexican musk turtle (Staurotypus triporcatus) has probably disappeared from the area. Other turtles, among which the scorpion mud turtle (Kinosternon scorpioides), the furrowed wood turtle (Rhinoclemmys areolata) or the white-lipped mud turtle (Kinosternon leucostomum), are still fairly common.|$|R
25|$|The American {{crocodile}} is saltwater-tolerant {{and have}} thus been capable of colonizing {{a multitude of}} islands within the Caribbean islands and on some coastal Pacific islands as well. They coexist with the rather smaller spectacled caiman within Central America. The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile's range are two species smaller than this species on average: the critically endangered Cuban crocodile, along with the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> in southern Mexico and Guatemala.|$|R
5000|$|Surveys of Rio Bravo {{have yielded}} over 70 mammal species (greater than 50% bats) and 392 bird species (25% {{of which are}} nearctic migrants). [...] Detailed {{inventories}} of fish and invertebrates {{have not yet been}} undertaken. Twenty-two vegetation types are encompassed by the boundaries of the conservation area, and support 230 tree species.Species of conservation concern found within the conservation area include the yellow-headed amazon, <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile,</b> and the Central American river turtle.|$|R
50|$|Blue Creek Rainforest Preserve {{is a small}} {{rainforest}} {{nature preserve}} in southern Belize, near the Guatemalan border. It is home to iguana, termite, Bothrops asper, and other snake species, Bufo marinus, lizards, tarantula, leafcutter ants, several species of bats, <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile,</b> jaguarundi, jaguar, tapir, and others. Its habitat consist of lush rainforest, waterfalls, lakes, ponds, lagoons, rivers, and streams. It is named after the Blue Creek Village, which {{is located in the}} area. It also has many biodiversities.|$|R
50|$|The Guadalajara Zoo {{is noted}} for its {{diversity}} of species, especially birds. There are many species of mammals as well, including some endangered species from Mexico and elsewhere: Bengal tigers, jaguars, lions (including rare white lions), leopards (including black panthers), orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, African elephants, white rhinoceroses, three species of <b>crocodiles</b> (Nile <b>crocodile,</b> <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> and American crocodile), Aldabra giant tortoises, giraffes, American bison, American black bears, red kangaroos, Komodo dragons, reticulated pythons, green anacondas, monocled cobras (including albine specimens), golden eagles, ostriches, cassowaries, and more.|$|R
50|$|The reef {{system is}} {{home to more than}} 65 species of stony coral, 350 species of mollusk and more than 500 species of fish. There are {{numerous}} species that live in or around the reef system that are endangered or under some degree of protection, including the following: sea turtles (green sea turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, leatherback turtle, and the hawksbill turtle), the queen conch, the West Indian manatee, the splendid toadfish, the American <b>crocodile,</b> the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>Crocodile,</b> the Nassau grouper, elkhorn coral, and black coral.|$|R
25|$|The park houses {{many species}} of {{crocodiles}} such as the gharial, the marsh crocodile, the salt water crocodile and the American spectacled caiman. Except the Cuban crocodile, the park has all other six major varieties, namely, Indo-Pacific or the salt water crocodile, swamp crocodile, Nile crocodile of Africa, Orinoco <b>crocodile,</b> <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> and American crocodile. The eight enclaves for crocodiles comprise about 220 individuals, including 125 adult specimens belonging to the six varieties. This includes two pairs of adult fresh water crocodiles. Many of the species also breed here.|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet’s</b> <b>crocodile</b> {{is small}} {{compared}} to most other crocodiles. The males can become larger than the females. The average adult <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> is about 2.1 m, with a typical length range of 1.5 to 2.7 m (the lower measurement representing the mean total length of a female at sexual maturity which is attained at roughly 7-8 years {{of age in the}} wild). Almost all crocodiles in excess of 2.5 m are males and at this advanced stage of maturity, the male goes through a significant change in skull osteological morphology as the skull appears to increase in broadness and robustness. Large adult males can attain a length of 3 m, anything in excess of this is considered exceptionally rare for this species however the species has a maximum reported length of 4.5 m, with two other outsized specimens reportedly measuring 4.1 and 4.3 m, respectively. Body mass in this species is often around 38 - 58 kg, however this may include possibly overweight captive specimen and average adult body mass in wild adults from Belize was posited as approximately 27.7 kg. The weight of a large 3 m wild male crocodile is estimated to average 83.9 kg in although mass is likely much more in outsized individuals. Overall, this species is similar in appearance and morphology to the Cuban and the larger American crocodiles in appearance.|$|R
50|$|Reptile House, Bat House and Insect House - The Reptile House {{is home to}} {{species such}} as black mambas, {{crocodile}} monitors, bearded dragons, poison dart frogs, and rhinoceros iguanas. The reticulated pythons, and anacondas are particularly large specimens. The park achieved the first UK breeding for <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodiles</b> in 2007 and with 12 eggs hatching successfully. The Insect House is home to leaf-cutter ants, scorpions and tarantulas and other species of invertebrates. The Bat House holding Seba's short-tailed bats, Egyptian fruit bats and Turkish spiny mice are in the Reptile Courtyard. and nearby are enclosures for white-handed gibbons and siamangs.|$|R
5|$|Crocodilians are {{opportunistic}} predators {{that are}} at their most dangerous in water and {{at the edge of}} water. Eight species are known to attack humans and may do so to defend their territories, nests, or young; by mistake, while attacking domestic animals such as dogs; or for food, as larger crocodilians can take prey as big as or bigger than humans. The species on which there is most data are the saltwater crocodile, the Nile crocodile, and the American alligator. Other species which have sometimes attacked humans are the black caiman, the <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile,</b> the mugger crocodile, the American crocodile, the gharial, and the freshwater crocodile.|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> has a {{very broad}} snout with 66 to 68 teeth when they are fully mature. They are dark grayish-brown in color with dark bands and spots on {{the body and the}} tail. This is similar to other crocodiles, like the American <b>crocodile,</b> but the <b>Morelet</b> is {{somewhat}} darker. Juvenile crocodiles are bright yellow with some dark bands. The crocodile’s iris is silvery brown. They have four short legs, giving them a rather sprawling gait, and a long tail, which is used for swimming. The hind feet of the crocodiles are webbed. They have very explosive capabilities because of their strong muscles and are fast runners.|$|R
50|$|<b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodile</b> can {{be found}} in {{freshwater}} habitats in Central America and along the Gulf of Mexico stretching through Belize, Guatemala, and to Mexico. The Belizean pine forests are an example of the type of ecoregion in which they occur.In their freshwater habitats, they prefer isolated areas that are secluded. This species of crocodile can mainly be found in freshwater swamps and marshes, which are located inland, and in large rivers and lakes. Both of these habitats are forested to help add cover.The Morelet can also be found along the coast in brackish waters and the grassy savannas on the Yucatán Peninsula. These crocodiles become much more distributed during the rainy seasons when flooding occurs and it is easier for them to move elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The site's bird life, <b>Morelet's</b> <b>crocodiles,</b> {{lepidoptera}} and odonata {{have been}} examined, along with adjacent waterways {{further down the}} Canal and along the Haulover Creek. Overall, about 50 birds were recorded. Meerman also includes incidental notes on plants and mammals encountered. Results from studies suggest that sites adjacent to the current reserve, namely the Haulover Creek and Burdon Canal between Jones and Northern Lagoon, contain higher biodiversity than the reserve itself. The land cover of the reserve and surrounding area has been mapped and is shown on large scale colour air photos held by the Forest Department. The reserve's vegetation is almost entirely Red Mangrove, with a belt of mixed freshwater swamp species such as Bullet Tree around Fabers Lagoon.|$|R
5000|$|The {{park and}} {{adjacent}} buffer zone (known as [...] "Eco-región Lachuá") is {{noted for its}} high biodiversity. With 120 species of mammals (50% of mammal species found in Guatemala), 30-40 species of reptiles, 177 bird species (40% of bird species in Guatemala), and 36 fish species it is a sanctuary for a varied fauna population. These include fish like the diadromous tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), an ample variety of biogegraphically endemic Cichlid species, reptiles like <b>Morelet's</b> <b>Crocodile</b> (Crocodylus moreletii), Orangebelly Swamp Snake (Tretanorhinus nigroluteus); and mammals, like the Jaguar (Panthera onca), Cougar (Puma concolor), Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii), the White-lipped Peccary (Tayassu pecari), Spotted Paca (Agouti paca), Red Brocket (Mazama americana), and Spix's Disk-winged Bat (Thyroptera tricolor), and various monkeys species including the endangered Guatemalan Black Howler (Alouatta pigra).|$|R
