Aiming at the vibration problem of passenger cars, {{this paper presents}} an optimal method for powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> which bases on energy decoupling method. Firstly, a six-freedom dynamic model of powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> of passenger cars is established. Then, an optimal process of <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is conducted by using the theory of energy decoupling with maximizing decoupling rate of the six-freedom <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> as objective. The theory of energy decoupling and the elastic theory are applied to optimize the design of powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> in Matlab software. Powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is implemented by ADAMS software. At last, optimal results of Matlab and ADAMS are compared.

30|$|The design {{strategies}} for powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> {{play an important}} role in the reduction of vehicular vibration and noise. As stiffness and damping elements connecting the transmission system and vehicle body, the rubber mount exhibits better vibration isolation performance than the rigid connection. This paper presents a complete design process of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. Based on the 6 -degrees-of-freedom vibration coupling model of the powertrain <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> an optimization algorithm is used to extract the best design parameters of each mount, thus rendering the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured, and the optimal parameters are used to design the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Subsequently, vibration simulation analysis is applied to the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> considering both transmission and road excitations. According to the results of finite element analysis, the topological structure of the metal frame of the front mount is optimized to improve the strength and dynamic characteristics of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Finally, the vibration bench test is used to verify the availability of the optimization design with the analysis of acceleration response and vibration transmissibility of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The results show that the vibration isolation performance of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> can be improved effectively using the vibration optimal decoupling method, and the structural modification of the metal frame can well promote the dynamic characteristics of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|The vehicle engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> which {{consists}} of several mounts connecting the engine to the vehicle structure, not only supports {{the weight of the}} engine but also isolates the noise, vibration and the transmitted forces to the vehicle structure. At present conventional elastomeric mounts are widely used in engine <b>mounting</b> <b>systems</b> for commercial vehicles. However, these mounts cannot fulfill the conflicting characteristic requirements for the best isolation concerning both road and engine induced vibrations. Therefore, to improve the noise and vibration isolation of commercial vehicles it is necessary to go beyond traditional passive isolators and use semi-active or active vibration control systems due to their capabilities of addressing the conflicting requirements in different road and engine conditions. The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to first develop mathematical and computational models of elastomeric engine mounts for heavy trucks and investigate the nonlinear behavior of dynamic stiffness and damping of the mounts, and finally use the developed models to design and analyze an adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is referred to a <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> where actuators, sensors and controller are optimally incorporated in the conventional elastomeric <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The developed computational model of the engine mounts is implemented in Matlab/ Simulink and used in a 3 D engine model with which vibration dynamics analysis under different engine and realistic road inputs is conducted. Moreover, the possibility and advantages of using active engine mounts have been studied by incorporating actuators into the above mentioned 3 D engine model with conventional <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> for heavy trucks. Simulations of the engine vibration dynamics under similar engine and road excitations have been done for the adaptronic <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> and compared to the results from the conventional engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> The results of simulations of engine vibration dynamics and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure have shown good potential for vibration isolation improvement in heavy trucks by using adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{computational}} models for commercial vehicle engine vibration dynamics are presented. The first model is conventional elastomeric engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour {{of the dynamic}} stiffness and damping of the engine mounts as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric mounts making the engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> an adaptronic one. Parameter optimization of the proposed adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> has been done. Computational models are implemented in Matlab /Simulink with GUI suitable for engine vibration dynamics analysis under different engine excitations and realistic road inputs. Simulations of engine vibration and transmitted forces to the vehicle structure are presented which are obtained by using both computational models for the same inputs of engine and road excitations. Comparison of the obtained results for adaptronic <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> (AMS) to the corresponding results of conventional <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> (CMS) demonstrates up to % 24 reduction in {{the magnitude of the}} transmitted force to the vehicle structure achieved with adaptronic engine <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> that includes two actuators with forces not exceeding 50 (N) ...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete design {{process of the}} <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. According to the actual state of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system,</b> the 6 -DOF vibration model is established. The natural frequency and vibration mode are obtained using eigenvalue analysis. Considering the low-frequency vibration decoupling rate as the objective function, the design parameters (including mount hardness, thickness, and stiffness in all directions) that render the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured are extracted, and the optimal parameters are used to design the <b>mounting</b> <b>system.</b> Subsequently, the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is simulated and analyzed to study the vibration response. The torsional excitation of the shafting is calculated as the transmission excitation using the equivalent model, and the road excitation is simulated using the sinusoidal scanning signal based on the data of acceleration measured by the actual vehicle. A comprehensive analysis shows that the strength and dynamic characteristics of the front mount should be improved, and hence, topology optimization {{is applied to the}} metal frame. Finally, the vibration bench test of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> is carried out to extract the acceleration signals in time domain and frequency domain of the upper and lower parts of the mounts. The data is analyzed and the vibration transmissibility is calculated using the corresponding root-mean-square values of acceleration. The results showed that the design process of the <b>mounting</b> <b>system</b> could well improve the vibration isolation performance.|$|R
