5|$|Karnataka has 11 ports, {{including}} the New Mangalore Port, a <b>major</b> <b>port</b> and ten minor ports, of which three were operational in 2012. The New Mangalore port was incorporated as the ninth <b>major</b> <b>port</b> in India on 4 May 1974. This port handled 32.04 million tonnes of {{traffic in the}} fiscal year 2006–07 with 17.92 million tonnes of imports and 14.12 million tonnes of exports. The port also handled 1015 vessels including 18 cruise vessels during the year 2006–07. Foreigners can enter Mangalore through the New Mangalore Port with the help of Electronic visa (e-visa). Cruise ships from Europe, North America and UAE arrive at New Mangalore Port to visit the tourist places across Coastal Karnataka.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSince early 2000 s, China's <b>major</b> <b>ports</b> {{developed}} {{port facilities}} rapidly. Within {{a very short}} period, China succeeded to construct independent port system which does not rely on the nearby countries ports. To the contrary, neighboring countries' <b>major</b> <b>ports</b> with China confronted new challenge due to the Chinese progressive ports policy. Various measures are being introduced and practiced {{to cope with the}} challenge. However, the future prospect of the neighboring countries' <b>major</b> <b>ports</b> with China is not bright. In this paper, the anticipated prospect of the competition between Chinese ports and neighboring countries' <b>major</b> <b>ports</b> is to be suggested. For the appraisal criteria on the prospect toward Premier Port status, four elements, which are composed of geographical advantages, scale of container volumes, cost advantage, and national port policy, were selected, and used. As the result of the assessment, the port of Shanghai was evaluated as holding the highest probability toward Premier Port rather than any other East Asian <b>major</b> <b>ports.</b> Finally, it was recommended that the neighboring countries <b>major</b> <b>ports</b> with China which are confronted with the challenge from the Chinese ports, would be better to transform their strategies from current competition and quantity oriented policy to cooperation and value oriented policy...|$|R

The population grew in eight years from 5,000 to 150,000, sustained by public services provided on a competitive basis by private enterprise, and court systems, schools and a university founded by the local community.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} as a <b>major</b> <b>port</b> saw it become {{a target for}} the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant that much of the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E

5|$|Operation Paravane was a British {{air raid}} of World War II that inflicted heavy {{damage on the}} German {{battleship}} Tirpitz. The attack was conducted on 15 September 1944 by 21 Royal Air Force heavy bombers, which flew from an airfield {{in the north of}} the Soviet Union. The battleship was struck by one bomb, and further damaged by several near misses. This damage rendered Tirpitz unfit for combat, and she could not be repaired as it was no longer possible for the Germans to sail her to a <b>major</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic bomb on a <b>major</b> <b>port.</b> Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E

5|$|After the military, {{the second}} largest and most {{important}} industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the Virginia Port Authority (VPA) is a Commonwealth of Virginia owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three <b>major</b> <b>port</b> facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, Norfolk International Terminals (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and {{is home to the}} world's largest and fastest container cranes. Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million TEUs and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Between 1822 and 1848 Bute {{played a}} central role in the {{creation}} of the Cardiff Docks. The idea was first put forward to Bute by one of his staff in 1822, who suggested that, with the right investment, Cardiff could be transformed into a <b>major</b> <b>port</b> for exporting coal and iron. The existing seaport, used by the Glamorganshire Canal, was small and inefficient. The new port would then deliver a direct return to Bute from shipping rates, improve the value of his lands in Cardiff itself and increase the value of the royalties he could charge on his coal fields. Initially Bute opposed plans for docks put forward by the local ironmasters, but then changed his mind and pushed forward with his own scheme shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a <b>major</b> <b>port</b> {{and a large}} provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. In 1338 there was a successful French attack on Southampton, burning various buildings down and damaging the castle. Edward III responded by improving the quality of the town defences, including building walls along the old ditch and bank defences, and particularly focusing on improving {{the west side of the}} town, but little work appears to have been done to improve the castle itself. By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E

5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a <b>major</b> <b>port</b> {{and a large}} provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000. The raising of money through murage grants began again in 1321, possibly paying for the stone towers of the Bargate and some of the semi-circular wall towers. Work also appears to have begun on some stone walling to the south and west of the town, construction may have begun at the South Gate and a wooden barbican was constructed near the western docks. Later investigations by the Crown would suggest that some of the monies raised in these murage grants had been misspent, however, contributing to the poor standard of town defences, which included large gaps in the walled circuit.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Devonport was the {{headquarters}} of Western Approaches Command until 1941, and Sunderland flying boats were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. It was an important embarkation point for US troops for D-Day. The city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe, {{in a series of}} 59 raids known as the Plymouth Blitz. Although the dockyards were the principal targets, much of the city centre and over 3,700 houses were completely destroyed and more than 1,000 civilians lost their lives. This was largely due to Plymouth's status as a <b>major</b> <b>port.</b> Charles Church was hit by incendiary bombs and partially destroyed in 1941 during the Blitz, but has not been demolished. It has been designated as an official permanent monument to the bombing of Plymouth during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Tara {{was one of}} {{the deadliest}} Pacific hurricanes on record. The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1961 Pacific hurricane season, Tara formed on November10 about 230mi (365km) off the coast of Mexico. It strengthened to reach maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) before making landfall in the Mexican state of Guerrero near Zihuatanejo. Hurricane Tara dissipated on November12, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to locations inundated by 10days of precipitation. Damage was light in the <b>major</b> <b>port</b> city of Acapulco, though further west along the coast, the effects of Tara were much worse. The city of Nuxco in Tecpán de Galeana municipality received the most damage and deaths from the hurricane.
