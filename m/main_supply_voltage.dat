40|$|The use of Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) {{is growing}} rapidly {{worldwide}} {{not only because}} of its small size, but also because it saves more energy compared to the standard incandescent light bulb. In this thesis, an improved phase-controlled dimmable electronic ballast for CFLs is developed. The theory behind this dimmable ballast is based on the detection of dimming signal from the rectified <b>main</b> <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> A phase angle is used as a dimming signal generated from a slightly modified conventional triac dimmer. Normally, this phase angle will appear in both rectified cycles, which have double the frequency of the mains. However, in this thesis, only alternating cycles are selected to extract the dimming signal as it can provide a more stable and consistent phase difference detecting mechanism. Moreover, a closed-loop control is implemented in this controller. This allows the intensity of the CFLs to change from 100 % to 5 % smoothly and linearly without noticeable fluctuation in brightness. The key concept of this closed-loop control is to monitor the fluorescent lamp current using a sensing resistor network. To reduce the complexity of the system {{and the size of the}} ballast, an IC controller is designed, simulated, fabricated and measured with good experimental results. Moreover, the whole dimmable CFL ballast can function properly without power factor correction circuit, which can significantly reduce the production cost and the size of CFL...|$|E

40|$|A {{successive}} approximation analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is presented operating at ultra low <b>supply</b> <b>voltages.</b> The circuit is realized in a 0. 18 m CMOS technology. Neither low-V T devices nor voltage boosting techniques are used. All voltage levels are between <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> (VDD) and ground (VSS). A passive sample-and-hold stage and an capacitor-based digital-to-analog converter (DAC) {{are used to}} avoid application of opamps, since opamp operation requires higher values for the lowest possible <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> The ADC has a signal-to-noiseand -distortion ratio (SNDR) of 51. 2 dB and 43. 3 dB for <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> of 1 V and 0. 5 V, at sampling rates of 150 kS/s and 4. 1 kS/s and power consumptions of 30 W and 0. 85 W, respectively. Proper operation is achieved down to a <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> of 0. 4 V...|$|R
40|$|Operating an {{integrated}} circuit at the prescribed nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> is not preferable for reliable circuit operation under temperature fluctuations. In this work a design methodology based on optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is proposed. Circuits display temperature variation insensitive delay, power, {{power delay product}} (PDP) characteristics when operated at a <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> 40 % to 55 % lower than the nominal <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> (VDD = 1. 0 V) in a 65 nm Deep Sub Micron (DSM) CMOS technology. The proposed design methodology of optimizing the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for temperature variation insensitive circuit performance is therefore, particularly attractive in low power applications with relaxed speed requirements. A new circuit technique is proposed in this work for simultaneously reducing the sub threshold &gate oxide leakage power in domino logic circuits...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic power {{consumed}} in CMOS gates goes down quadratically with the <b>supply</b> <b>voltage.</b> By maintaining a high <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for gates {{on the critical}} path and by using a low <b>supply</b> <b>voltage</b> for gates off the critical path {{it is possible to}} dramatically reduce power consumption in CMOS VLSI circuits without performance degradation. Interfacing gates operating under multiple <b>supply</b> <b>voltages,</b> however, requires the use of level converters, which makes the problem modeling difficult. In this paper we develop a formal model and develop an efficient heuristic for addressing the use of two <b>supply</b> <b>voltages</b> for low power CMOS VLSI circuits without performance degradation. Power consumption savings up to 25 % over and above the best known existing heuristics are demonstrated for combinational circuits in the ISCAS 85 benchmark suite. 1...|$|R
