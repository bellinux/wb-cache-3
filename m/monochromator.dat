25|$|Common {{detector}} setups utilize a <b>monochromator</b> and a photomultiplier {{for filtering}} and detecting.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{the setup}} of a {{fluorescence}} assay involves a light source, which may emit many different wavelengths of light. In general, a single wavelength {{is required for}} proper analysis, so, in order to selectively filter the light, it is passed through an excitation <b>monochromator,</b> and then that chosen wavelength is passed through the sample cell. After absorption and re-emission of the energy, many wavelengths may emerge due to Stokes shift and various electron transitions. To separate and analyze them, the fluorescent radiation is passed through an emission <b>monochromator,</b> and observed selectively by a detector.|$|E
25|$|YB66 {{is used as}} a soft-X-ray <b>monochromator</b> for {{dispersing}} 1–2 keV {{synchrotron radiation}} at some synchrotron radiation facilities. Contrary to thermoelectric applications, high thermal conductivity is desirable for synchrotron radiation monochromators. YB66 exhibits low, amorphous-like thermal conductivity. However, transition metal doping increases the thermal conductivity twice in YNb0.3B62 as compared to undoped YB66.|$|E
50|$|A <b>monochromator's</b> {{adjustment}} range might cover the visible spectrum and {{some part of}} both or either of the nearby ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) spectra, although <b>monochromators</b> are built for {{a great variety of}} optical ranges, and to a great many designs.|$|R
40|$|Cryogenically cooled silicon <b>monochromators</b> {{have found}} wide {{application}} at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) and other third-generation synchrotron radiation facilities. Currently, 17 insertion device beamlines at the APS are implementing cryogenic, silicon double-crystal <b>monochromators</b> (DCM) {{at the first}} optical element. Recently, several silicon crystal <b>monochromators</b> internally cooled with liquid nitrogen have been tested on the sector 1 -ID undulator beamline at the APS. Rocking curves at various energies were measured simultaneously in first and third order from a Si(111) DCM in the Bragg reflection geometry at a fixed undulator gap of 11. 1 mm. The crystal exhibited a sub-arc second thermal broadening of the rocking curve over a first order energy range from 6. 0 to 17. 0 keV up to a maximum incident power of 561 W in a 2. 5 V x 2. 0 H mm{sup 2 } beam. It has been demonstrated that cryogenic silicon <b>monochromators</b> can handle the highest power beams from hard x-ray undulators at the APS without significant thermo-mechanical distortion...|$|R
40|$|Three {{water-cooled}} pin-post <b>monochromators,</b> {{to be used}} on a wiggler beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), {{were built}} with the heat exchanger engineered to provide very high heat transfer. The geometry of the heat exchanger as well as calculated data on the heat transfer will be presented. Before using the <b>monochromators</b> on the beamline, they were checked by x-ray diffraction topography. Reflections (333) and (220) in Bragg case were utilized. In all crystals, similar patterns of strain in the diffracting silicon layers were revealed, which {{can be attributed to}} the geometry of the heat exchangers, the bonding technology, and the thickness of the top layer. Conclusions about construction of future pin-post <b>monochromators</b> have been drawn...|$|R
25|$|If, otherwise, the {{analyzer}} is oriented {{at a small}} angle (detuning angle) {{with respect}} to the <b>monochromator</b> then X-rays refracted in the sample by a smaller angle will be reflected less, and X-rays refracted by a larger angle will be reflected more. Thus the contrast of the image is based on different refraction angles in the sample.|$|E
25|$|In {{wavelength}} dispersive analysis, the single-wavelength radiation {{produced by}} the <b>monochromator</b> is passed into a photomultiplier, a detector similar to a Geiger counter, which counts individual photons as they pass through. The counter is a chamber containing a gas that is ionised by X-ray photons. A central electrode is charged at (typically) +1700 V {{with respect to the}} conducting chamber walls, and each photon triggers a pulse-like cascade of current across this field. The signal is amplified and transformed into an accumulating digital count. These counts are then processed to obtain analytical data.|$|E
25|$|The Rowland circle {{geometry}} {{ensures that}} the slits are both in focus, but {{in order for the}} Bragg condition to be met at all points, the crystal must first be bent to a radius of 2R (where R is the radius of the Rowland circle), then ground to a radius of R. This arrangement allows higher intensities (typically 8-fold) with higher resolution (typically 4-fold) and lower background. However, the mechanics of keeping Rowland circle geometry in a variable-angle <b>monochromator</b> is extremely difficult. In the case of fixed-angle monochromators (for use in simultaneous spectrometers), crystals bent to a logarithmic spiral shape give the best focusing performance. The manufacture of curved crystals to acceptable tolerances increases their price considerably.|$|E
50|$|In hard X-ray and neutron optics, crystal <b>monochromators</b> {{are used}} to define wave {{conditions}} on the instruments.|$|R
3000|$|The PL {{emission}} and PL excitation spectra {{were measured}} using single-grating (1200  grooves/mm) registration <b>monochromators</b> MDR- 23 (linear dispersion 0.5  mm/nm) and DFS- 12 (linear dispersion 1  mm/nm) equipped with FEU- 100 and FEU- 79 photomultipliers, respectively. The MDR- 2 single-grating (1200  grooves/mm, linear dispersion 0.25  mm/nm) and double-prism DMR- 4 (dispersion is from 0.5 to 0.05  mm/nm) <b>monochromators</b> {{were used as}} exciting ones.

25|$|Diffraction {{gratings}} {{are often}} used in <b>monochromators,</b> spectrometers, lasers, wavelength division multiplexing devices, optical pulse compressing devices, and many other optical instruments.|$|R
25|$|Crystal interferometry, {{sometimes}} {{also called}} X-ray interferometry, {{is the oldest}} but also the most complex method used for experimental realization. It consists of three beam splitters in Laue geometry aligned parallel to each other. (See figure to the right) The incident beam, which usually is collimated and filtered by a <b>monochromator</b> (Bragg crystal) before, is split at the first crystal (S) by Laue diffraction into two coherent beams, a reference beam which remains undisturbed and a beam passing through the sample. The second crystal (T) acts as a transmission mirror and causes the beams to converge one towards another. The two beams meet at {{the plane of the}} third crystal (A), which is sometimes called, the analyzer crystal, and create an interference pattern the form of which depends on the optical path difference between the two beams caused by the sample. This interference pattern is detected with an X-ray detector behind the analyzer crystal.|$|E
500|$|A tangent bar {{mechanism}} {{was used}} to adjust the <b>monochromator.</b> [...] The mechanism was highly sensitive and required a skilled operator. Only two Model B prototypes were made. [...] One was sold: in February 1941, to the University of California Chemistry department in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|As {{advertised in}} the 1941 News Edition of the American Chemical Society, the Beckman Spectrophotometer used [...] an autocollimating quartz crystal prism for a <b>monochromator,</b> [...] capable of {{covering}} a {{range from the}} ultraviolet [...] (200 millimicrons) to the infrared (2000 millimicrons), with a nominal bandwidth of 2 millimicrons or less {{for most of its}} spectral range. The slit mechanism was continuously adjustable from [...]01 to 2.0mm and claimed to have less than 1/10% of stray light over most of the spectral range. [...] It featured an easy-to-read wavelength scale, simultaneously reporting % Transmission and Density information.|$|E
40|$|An extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) spectrophotometer for measurements of solar radiation at wavelengths ranging from 140 to 1850 A {{will be included}} in the payload of each of the three Atmosphere-Explorer (AE) missions, AE-C, -D, and -E. The instrument consists of 24 grating <b>monochromators,</b> 12 of which can be telecommanded either to execute 128 -step scans each covering a relatively small section of the total spectrophotometer wavelength range or to maintain fixed (command-selected) wavelength positions. The remaining 12 nonscan <b>monochromators</b> operate at permanently fixed wavelengths and view {{only a small fraction of}} the solar disk except for one viewing the whole sun in H Lyman alpha. Ten of the 12 scan-capable <b>monochromators</b> also view the entire solar disk since their primary function is to measure the total fluxes independent of the distribution of sources across the solar disk...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} mosaic crystals is in <b>monochromators</b> for x-ray and neutron radiation. The mosaicity enhances the reflected flux, {{and allows for}} some phase-space transformation.|$|R
40|$|An {{introduction}} to monochromatization of synchrotron radiation {{in the energy}} range of 5 – 30 keV is presented for applications involving nuclear resonant scattering. The relevant relationships of the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction are used to explain basic con-cepts of monochromatization. These relations are combined with ray-tracing techniques to design high-energy-resolution <b>monochromators.</b> Transmission-optimized and energy-resolution-optimized designs that achieve high energy resolutions (106 < E=D E < 108) are discussed separately. Practical silicon <b>monochromators</b> of both types are presented {{for a variety of}} nuclear resonances in this energy range. 1...|$|R
500|$|The Model D spectrophotometer, {{using the}} {{experimental}} RCA phototube, was shown at MIT's Summer Conference on Spectroscopy in July 1941. The paper that Cary and Beckman presented there {{was published in}} the Journal of the Optical Society of America. In it, Cary and Beckman compared designs for a modified self-collimating quartz Fery prism, a mirror-collimated quartz Littrow prism, and various gratings. [...] The Littrow prism was a half-prism, which had a mirrored face. Use of a tungsten light source with the quartz Littrow prism as a <b>monochromator</b> was reported to minimize light scattering within the instrument.|$|E
500|$|The first {{prototype}} Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, {{was created}} at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. [...] It used a tungsten light source {{with a glass}} Fery prism [...] as a <b>monochromator.</b> Tungsten was used for incandescent light filaments because it was strong, withstood heat, and emitted a steady light. Types of light sources differed {{in the range of}} wavelengths of light that they emitted. [...] Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile headlamps. An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a vacuum tube photocell were used to detect wavelengths.|$|E
500|$|Modern {{forensic}} chemists rely {{on numerous}} instruments to identify unknown materials {{found at a}} crime scene. [...] The 20th century saw many advancements in technology that allowed chemists to detect smaller amounts of material more accurately. [...] The first major advancement in this century came during the 1930s with the invention of a spectrometer that could measure the signal produced with infrared (IR) light. [...] Early IR spectrometers used a <b>monochromator</b> and could only measure light absorption in a very narrow wavelength band. [...] It {{was not until the}} coupling of an interferometer with an IR spectrometer in 1949 by Peter Fellgett that the complete infrared spectrum could be measured at once. [...] Fellgett also used the Fourier transform, a mathematical method that can break down a signal into its individual frequencies, {{to make sense of the}} enormous amount of data received from the complete infrared analysis of a material. [...] Since then, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) instruments have become critical in the forensic analysis of unknown material because they are nondestructive [...] and extremely quick to use. [...] Spectroscopy was further advanced in 1955 with the invention of the modern atomic absorption (AA) spectrophotometer by Alan Walsh. [...] AA analysis can detect specific elements that make up a sample along with their concentrations, allowing for the easy detection of heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium.|$|E
40|$|Thermal (load/unload) induced {{strain in}} first silicon <b>monochromators,</b> {{simulated}} using a nearly perfect (110) crystal (maintained in a partial vacuum and initially at temperatures greater than 600 °C), is observed using white synchrotron radiation section topography (WSRST). The effects of quenching show an initial deterioration in (pendellösung fringe) perfection, followed by 〈 110 〉-dislocation production. By {{this means a}} direct observation of point defect creation and its temperature dependence are observed. WSR section topographs of operational Si- and Ge-WSR-crystal <b>monochromators,</b> previously exposed to thermal (load/unload) quenching are also compared...|$|R
25|$|The common {{feature of}} <b>monochromators</b> is the {{maintenance}} of a symmetrical geometry between the sample, the crystal and the detector. In this geometry the Bragg diffraction condition is obtained.|$|R
50|$|Lasers produce light {{which is}} much more {{monochromatic}} than the optical <b>monochromators</b> discussed here, but only some lasers are easily tunable, and these lasers are not as simple to use.|$|R
2500|$|... "Sequential" [...] spectrometers have {{a single}} variable-geometry <b>monochromator</b> (but usually with an {{arrangement}} for selecting from a choice of crystals), a single detector assembly (but usually {{with more than one}} detector arranged in tandem), and a single electronic pack. The instrument is programmed to move through a sequence of wavelengths, in each case selecting the appropriate X-ray tube power, the appropriate crystal, and the appropriate detector arrangement. The length of the measurement program is essentially unlimited, so this arrangement is very flexible. Because there is only one <b>monochromator,</b> the tube-sample-crystal distances can be kept very short, resulting in minimal loss of detected intensity. The obvious disadvantage is relatively long analysis time, particularly when many elements are being analysed, not only because the elements are measured in sequence, but also because {{a certain amount of time}} is taken in readjusting the <b>monochromator</b> geometry between measurements. Furthermore, the frenzied activity of the <b>monochromator</b> during an analysis program is a challenge for mechanical reliability. However, modern sequential instruments can achieve reliability almost as good as that of simultaneous instruments, even in continuous-usage applications.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{analyzer}} {{is perfectly}} {{aligned with the}} <b>monochromator</b> and thus positioned to {{the peak of the}} rocking curve, a standard X-ray radiograph with enhanced contrast is obtained because there is no blurring by scattered photons. Sometimes this is referred to as [...] "extinction contrast".|$|E
2500|$|In {{wavelength}} dispersive analysis, {{the fluorescent}} X-rays emitted by the material sample are directed into a diffraction grating <b>monochromator.</b> The diffraction grating used {{is usually a}} single crystal. By varying the angle of incidence and take-off on the crystal, a single X-ray wavelength can be selected. The wavelength obtained is given by Bragg's law: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Monochromators</b> {{are often}} {{calibrated}} in units of wavelength. Uniform rotation of a grating produces a sinusoidal change in wavelength, which is approximately linear for small grating angles, so such an instrument {{is easy to}} build. Many of the underlying physical phenomena being studied are linear in energy though, and since wavelength and energy have a reciprocal relationship, spectral patterns that are simple and predictable when plotted {{as a function of}} energy are distorted when plotted as a function of wavelength. Some <b>monochromators</b> are calibrated in units of reciprocal centimeters or some other energy units, but the scale may not be linear.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} parametric x-radiation (PXR) {{generated by}} Silicon and Lithium Fluoride <b>monochromators,</b> {{including the first}} observation of PXR from Lithium Fluoride. Parametric x-radiation may {{be described as the}} Bragg scattering of virtual photons associated with relativistic electrons as they pass through single crystal <b>monochromators.</b> As the photons interact with the crystal lattice they produce x-rays which meet the Bragg condition lambda = 2 dsintheta sub B, where theta sub B is the angle between the electron beam and the crystal plane. PXR data were collected from Silicon and Lithium Fluoride crystals using a SiLi detector. The locations of the energy peaks are compared to the locations predicted by theory and the intensity ratios between the peaks are also compared to the theoretical ratios. The PXR energy observed was as predicted by theory for Silicon and Lithium Fluoride <b>monochromators.</b> The observed peak intensity ratios for Silicon were not in agreement with intensity ratios predicted by theory. Intensity ratios observed from Lithium Fluoride were in agreement with the predicted value. jg p 2 NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R

2500|$|High energy ultrashort pulses can be {{generated}} through high harmonic generation in a nonlinear medium. [...] A high intensity ultrashort pulse will generate an array of harmonics in the medium; a particular harmonic of interest is then selected with a <b>monochromator.</b> [...] This technique {{has been used to}} produce ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray regimes from near infrared Ti-sapphire laser pulses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{infrared}} spectrum {{of a sample}} is recorded by passing a beam of infrared light through the sample. When {{the frequency of the}} IR {{is the same as the}} vibrational frequency of a bond or collection of bonds, absorption occurs. Examination of the transmitted light reveals how much energy was absorbed at each frequency (or wavelength). This measurement can be achieved by scanning the wavelength range using a <b>monochromator.</b> Alternatively, the entire wavelength range is measured [...] using a Fourier transform instrument and then a transmittance or absorbance spectrum is generated using a dedicated procedure.|$|E
