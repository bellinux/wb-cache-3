One study that evaluated a number of treatment approaches found that only music therapy had significant positive outcomes where the others showed little improvement in participants (Rosner,Kruse & Hagl, 2010). Furthermore, a pilot study, which consisted of an experimental and control group, examined the effects of music therapy on mood and behaviors in the home and school communities. It was found that there was a significant change in grief symptoms and behaviors with the experimental group in the home, but conversely found that there was no significant change in the experimental group in the school community, despite the fact that <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the Depression Self-Rating Index and the Behavior Rating Index decreased (Hilliard, 2001). Yet another study completed by Russel Hilliard (2007), looked at the effects of Orff-based music therapy and social work groups on childhood grief symptoms and behaviors. Using a control group that consisted of wait-listed clients, and employing the Behavior Rating Index for Children (BRIC) and the Bereavement Group Questionnaire for Parents and Guardians (BP) as measurement tools, it was found that children who were in the music therapy group showed significant improvement in grief symptoms and also showed some improvement in behaviors compared to the control group, whereas the social work group also showed significant improvement in both grief and behaviors compared to the control group. The study concludes with support for music therapy as a medium from bereavement groups for children (Hilliard, 2007).|$|E

5000|$|In {{criminal}} populations, psychopathy {{assessments are}} often used in threat assessment to determine if inmates are fit for early release or solitary confinement. Thus, it is often beneficial to inmates to appear less psychopathic (less callous or manipulative, more empathetic, etc.) {{in order to receive}} a more positive assessment or judgment. Although the PPI has a validity scale built into it, the measure was designed using populations in which no real [...] "stakes" [...] were involved, which may have resulted in the measure being prone to manipulation by the taker when {{there is a need to}} appear [...] "less" [...] psychopathic. One study that explored this used a social desirability scale as well as a few direct questions about participants' honesty and motivation, given after completing the PPI. The data showed that participants who were instructed to be [...] "faking good" [...] (intentionally trying to create a positive impression) had lower <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the PPI and higher scores on the social desirability scale than those who were given no instructions or told to be honest in their answers. Despite the validity scales built into the PPI being able to indicate when such response distortion was occurring in many of the cases, a significant number of misclassifications were observed. Thus, the researchers concluded that the PPI was vulnerable to manipulation by respondents consciously attempting to present themselves in a positive light, which could limit its utility in criminal populations or any situations in which users have a significant motivation to appear well-adjusted. The study has not yet been replicated using the revised form of the scale, the PPI-R, however.|$|E

METHOD: Participants were 575 consecutive outpatients affected by mood disorder or anxiety disorder. Patients completed the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI) and the Symptom Checklist 90 -Revised. RESULTS: Women had higher <b>mean</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> the Global Severity Index (1. 52 +/- 0. 76 vs. 1. 33 +/- 0. 79), higher perception of negative responses from others (1. 84 +/- 1. 59 vs. 1. 46 +/- 1. 35) and higher perception of pain severity (3. 31 +/- 1. 73 vs. 2. 88 +/- 1. 63) than men.
