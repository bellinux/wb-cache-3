5|$|In 2010, {{a genetic}} study was made basing on the {{evolutionary}} history of common elands. Located in the sub-Saharan savanna biome of east and southern Africa, the study used methods like analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals {{to learn more}} about various topics, such as the phylogeography, genetic diversity, demographic history of the species. The conclusions strongly supported the presence of a longer-standing population in the south and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in the east. It is believed that today their extinction from these parts could be due to colonization. The similarity of dates obtained from <b>more</b> <b>studies</b> indicates a significant event c. 200 ka, which had brought a great change in the genetic history of the species.|$|E

5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform <b>more</b> <b>studies,</b> improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E

25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study. This activation not only affects aging, but affects a hormone known as GnRH, which has shown new anti-aging properties when injected into mice outside the hypothalamus, while causing the opposite effect when injected into the hypothalamus. It'll be some time before this can be applied to humans in a meaningful way, as <b>more</b> <b>studies</b> on this pathway are necessary to understand the mechanics of GnRH's anti-aging properties.|$|E

25|$|Many <b>more</b> <b>studies</b> {{illustrate}} the problem. One meta-study {{was conducted by}} the psychiatry department of Oxford University at Warneford Hospital in the United Kingdom. Twenty surveys were analyzed, providing results for 6,743 adult refugees from seven countries. In the larger studies, 9% were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and 5% with major depression, with evidence of much psychiatric co-morbidity. Five surveys of 260 refugee children from three countries yielded a prevalence of 11% for post-traumatic stress disorder. According to this study, refugees resettled in Western countries could be about ten {{times more likely to}} have PTSD than age-matched general populations in those countries. Worldwide, tens of thousands of refugees and former refugees resettled in Western countries probably have post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E
25|$|Most recently, MREs {{have been}} {{developed}} using the Dietary Reference Intake, created by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). The IOM indicated servicemembers (who were classified as highly active men {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30) typically burn about 4,200 Calories (kcal) a day, but tended to only consume about 2,400 Calories a day during combat, entering a negative energy balance. This imbalance occurs when servicemembers fail to consume full portions of their rations. Although manipulations to the food items and distribution of macronutrients to help boost the amount of kilocalories per MRE have been made, <b>more</b> <b>studies</b> are showing many servicemembers still do not meet today's standards of daily consumption, often trading and discarding portions of the ration. Researchers continue to study the habits and eating preferences of servicemembers, making constant changes that encourage servicemembers to eat the entire meal and thus get full nutritional value.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} {{are not able to}} proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. Adult stem cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. <b>More</b> <b>studies</b> need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E

25|$|To {{assess what}} current {{knowledge}} of social immune systems suggested about whether social immunity was a bypoduct or driver of complex group living, Meunier delineated 30 different mechanisms of social immunity found in eusocial insects {{and looked for}} counterparts to these in presocial and solitary insects. Supporting the hypothesis that social immunity was a driver and not a by-product of complex group living, 10 mechanisms had counterparts in presocial insects and 4 in solitary species (though this {{does not imply that}} some mechanisms may evolve as a byproduct). Evidence that social immunity mechanisms are selected for at least somewhat due to collective benefits is lacking though – possibly due to the difficulty in isolating the immune benefits from the other benefits that social immunity mechanisms often bestow (e.g. allogrooming inhibits the establishment of ectoparasites, but also improves the accuracy of nest mate recognition due to the sharing and thus homogenization of chemical signatures between group members), and the difficulty in experimentally separating direct fitness from indirect fitness, potentiated in eusocial taxa where sterile/non-reproductive individuals predominatee. <b>More</b> <b>studies</b> on presocial taxa would allow for phyletic analyses to recover the actual path of evolution that different mechanisms of social immunity took.|$|E
