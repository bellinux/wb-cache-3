40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{dynamics of}} outflows driven by magnetic explosion {{on the surface}} of a compact star is investigated through special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We adopt, as the initial equilibrium state, a spherical stellar object embedded in hydrostatic plasma which has a density ρ(r) ∝ r^- α and is threaded by a dipole magnetic field. The injection of magnetic energy at the surface of compact star breaks the equilibrium and triggers a two-component outflow. At the early evolutionary stage, the magnetic pressure increases rapidly around the stellar surface, initiating a <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> outflow. A strong forward shock driven outflow is then excited. The expansion velocity of the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> outflow is characterized by the Alfvén velocity on the stellar surface, and follows a simple scaling relation v_ mag∝v_ A^ 1 / 2. When the initial density profile declines steeply with radius, the strong shock is accelerated self-similarly to relativistic velocity ahead of the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> component. We find that it evolves according to a self-similar relation Γ_ sh∝ r_ sh, where Γ_ sh is the Lorentz factor of the plasma measured at the shock surface r_ sh. Purely hydrodynamic process would be responsible for the acceleration mechanism of the shock driven outflow. Our two-component outflow model, which is the natural outcome of the magnetic explosion, can provide {{a better understanding of the}} magnetic active phenomena on various magnetized compact stars.

The dynamo-generated galactic magnetic fields themselves can drive radial flows at a rate of order 0. 1 M ⊙ yr − 1. These radial flows can contribute to the saturation of the dynamo action together with other nonlinear effects. We also present arguments, and an illustrative computation, to support the view that in the inner regions of barred galaxies the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> mass accretion rate may be substantially larger than the above estimate due to deviations of magnetic field from axial symmetry.

40|$|An {{accretion}} disk around a rotating magnetized star {{is subjected to}} magnetic torques which induce disk warping and precession. These torques arise generically from interactions between the stellar field and the induced surface currents on the disk. Applying these new effects to weakly magnetized (B ∼ 10 7 - 10 9 G) neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamical warping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of relativistic frame dragging and the magnetic torques. Under quite general conditions, the magnetic warping torque can overcome the “Bardeen-Petterson ” viscous damping and makes the modes grow. The modes are confined to the inner region of the disk, and have frequencies close to {{the sum of the}} Lense-Thirring frequency and the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> precession frequency evaluated at the inner disk radius. Since the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> precession is retrograde (and opposite to the Lense-Thrring precession), the mode frequency can have a non-monotonic dependence on the mass accretion rate. This may explain several observed features of low-frequency (10 - 60 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three parts. In the first part, we study the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> precession of warped disks. An accretion disk around a rotating magnetized star is subjected to the magnetic torques that induce warping and precession of the disk. We study the global hydrodynamical warping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of the magnetic torques, relativistic frame dragging, and the classical precession due to oblateness of the neutron star. We apply our analysis to two types of accreting systems: low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and accreting X-ray pulsars. We argue that some features of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in LMXBs and milli-Hertz QPOs in accreting X-ray pulsars {{can be explained by}} the <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> precession of warped disks. The second part is related to the hydrodynamically-driven mechanism for asym-metric supernova explosions / neutron star kicks.

40|$|The {{assumption}} that observed mass outflow from a star {{is due to}} a <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven</b> wind implies an upper bound on the surface magnetic field strength from regions where the wind originates. Evidence is reported that corroborates Rosendhal's observation of an abrupt change in the velocity-gradient-luminosity relationship for B 8 and later supergiants. The smallest upper bounds correspond to later spectral types, for which radiation would be a relatively inefficient mechanism for driving wind; these winds may in fact be <b>magnetically</b> <b>driven.</b> Be stars are prime candidates for magnetically accelerated winds due to large rotation rates and small mass loss rates. Observed flows can be driven by 0. 1 - 10 gauss surface fields. Intense field in fast rotators can lead to dramatic mass loss rates and large terminal velocities; sigma Ori E may be such an object. Finally, the effect of magnetic acceleration on the dispersal of solar nebula is considered. The increased velocities allow the wind to disperse a mass of 90 times the initial outflowing mass in the wind...|$|R
