5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, Bedell {{had decided to}} run for {{political}} office. In 1972, he ran against Wiley <b>Mayne,</b> a Republican incumbent in Iowa's 6th congressional district. <b>Mayne</b> was a staunch supporter of Richard Nixon and secured victory along with the President in a year favorable to the Republicans. <b>Mayne,</b> however, would politically suffer after Watergate (he was one of only a few Republicans to vote against impeaching the President on the judiciary committee.) The damage had already been done, and Bedell defeated <b>Mayne</b> in a 1974 rematch.|$|E

Pretending to have come across the disorientated officer purely by chance, Diamond and Johnny drop Ross off at his home. Later, Williams is brought before the hijackers' wealthy ringleader, Miles (Ferdy <b>Mayne),</b> who warns her not to betray the gang to the authorities.|$|E

50|$|In the {{historical}} novel The Grove of Eagles by Winston Graham, {{which is set}} in Cornwall some years after <b>Mayne's</b> death, there are several references to him. One character, a Catholic member of the prominent Arundell family of Tolverne, says bitterly that his Protestant brother, {{who was one of}} the jurors at <b>Mayne's</b> trial, will burn in Hell for his share in <b>Mayne's</b> death. In fact the brother, filled with guilt for his share in the execution, has not only converted to the Roman Catholic faith but is risking his life by sheltering other priests.|$|R
5|$|After {{getting one}} {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel allowed a single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent <b>Mayne</b> and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} a four-story {{structure}} covered with zinc panels on the exterior {{with a total of}} , including a three story tall atrium. Plans for zinc on the exterior were later changed to stainless steel due to costs. Designed by <b>Mayne</b> and the DLR Group, the building was to be built using concrete and steel with a goal of earning Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for sustainability, with large amounts of natural lighting designed to help secure that distinction. On the outside many security measures were incorporated into the design. The building was to include six courtrooms, administrative offices, and space for the offices of the U.S. Marshals Service. Despite security concerns as a federal building, the architect and judge Michael Robert Hogan sought to have an open feel to the structure. Hogan, the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, was the primary government official tasked with working with the architect to design the courthouse.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, started to come back in the third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took out most of his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew <b>Mayne</b> and Ed Ulinski sat out most of the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's passes in the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a pileup in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} second preseason game, played against the Baltimore Colts in 100-degree heat in Toledo, Ohio. Browns placekicker Lou Groza opened the scoring with an 18-yard field {{goal in the}} first quarter, and a {{touchdown}} by fullback Ollie Cline later in the period put the Browns up 10–0. Baltimore responded {{in the second quarter}} with a touchdown pass by quarterback Y. A. Tittle to receiver Jake Leicht. Cline ran for another touchdown soon thereafter, however, once more giving the Browns a 10-point lead. Colts receiver Lamar Davis caught a 25-yard touchdown pass {{at the end of the}} second quarter. Cleveland led 17–14 at halftime. Neither team scored again until the fourth quarter, when Baltimore's Bus Mertes ran for a 38-yard touchdown and secured the 21–17 win. A number of Cleveland players suffered injuries during the game. Graham hurt his hand, Motley strained his back and end Dante Lavelli suffered a broken leg. Lavelli's injury sidelined him for the first seven games of the regular season. During the game, Baltimore players Hub Bechtol and Lew <b>Mayne,</b> a former Brown, tapped a phone line that went from Cleveland's press box to its sideline. This allowed the Colts to listen in on coaches' conversations and anticipate the Browns' play-calling.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland next {{faced the}} Dons in Los Angeles. The Dons, who had handed the Browns their only {{loss of the}} season in October, scored a field goal and {{touchdown}} in the first quarter. The Browns responded with a touchdown run from Motley later in the quarter and led by four points at halftime after Tommy Colella caught a pass from Graham for another touchdown in the second period. Cleveland built on the lead in the third quarter with a long touchdown pass to Lew <b>Mayne.</b> Speedie sealed the victory for the Browns when he intercepted a backward lateral pass by Dons quarterback Chuck Fenenbock and ran it back 12 yards for a touchdown with four minutes left in the game. Los Angeles threatened to score numerous times, but Cleveland's defense held. The Browns forced the Dons to punt three times from within their own 10-yard line. Graham had 240 yards of passing. His two touchdown passes added to his league-leading total of 22 on the season. Tackle Lou Saban continued to handle placekicking duties for the Browns as Groza sat out with an injury.|$|E
5|$|The Browns were {{expected}} to win their November 9 game against the Brooklyn Dodgers by a wide margin; the Dodgers had just one win, and the Browns scored eight touchdowns when the teams played in September. The Dodgers, however, drove 80 yards on their first possession for a touchdown. Placekicker Phil Martinovich missed the extra point. Cleveland responded as Graham passed to Lavelli for a 72-yard touchdown on the second play from scrimmage on its ensuing possession. Groza kicked through the extra point to give the Browns a 7–6 lead. Cleveland scored again on its next possession, this time a 15-yard pass from Graham to Lew <b>Mayne.</b> After the second touchdown, Graham threw two interceptions and the Browns did not advance the ball past the Brooklyn 42-yard line. The Dodgers, meanwhile, threatened to score numerous times, advancing deep into Cleveland territory. One Brooklyn touchdown by Bob Hoernschmeyer was called back because of a holding penalty. Martinovich contributed to the frustration by missing four field goal tries. He also missed the extra point when the Dodgers did score {{in the fourth quarter}} on a long Monk Gafford rush. The Dodgers' missteps gave the Browns a 13–12 victory, extending their lead over the 49ers for {{the best record in the}} AAFC after San Francisco lost to the Yankees.|$|E
