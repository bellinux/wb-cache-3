5|$|Mr. Burns asks Homer to {{help him}} with a speech for a crisis {{shareholders}} meeting. Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make Mr. Burns into a <b>marionette,</b> and the movement of the <b>marionette</b> inadvertently gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. The meeting is a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.|$|E

For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software <b>Marionette</b> was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.|$|E
40|$|This practical-theoretical thesis {{consists}} of two wire-controlled <b>marionettes.</b> The puppets are made of fired clay and other materials. The <b>marionettes</b> come with an original theatre play, {{which is also a}} part of the thesis. The form of the <b>marionettes</b> is inspired by the puppets of Czech folk puppeteers and <b>marionettes</b> from Munich. The accompanying theoretical part focuses on the history of puppetry, types of puppets and their use in art schools. The work also informs about the lives of our foremost puppeteers...|$|R

5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a <b>marionette.</b> And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden <b>marionette</b> whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as {{he does not want}} to be a famous comedian. After imitating a <b>marionette,</b> he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E

50|$|Realizing {{the tragedy}} of his existence, Doctor Hess gives up control of his ship. His body is finally giving out; {{wavering}} {{on the brink of}} death, Doctor Hess relents and thanks the <b>marionettes</b> for helping him to see the truth, then passes away. The girls return the ship to the wormhole, hoping to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Earth before the ship detonates. From Terra 2, the massive shock wave caused by the ship’s destruction registers on the sensors in Faust’s ship, and everyone realizes what the <b>marionettes</b> have done. The wormhole itself, destabilized by the explosion, begins to close, but not before three beams of light shoot out of it and streak towards Terra 2. In his last moments, Doctor Hess, realizing that he had doomed the <b>marionettes</b> to die with him, managed to transfer the essences of the <b>marionettes</b> into the memory of the ship, which were then broadcast back to Terra 2 when the ship was destroyed. Otaru, crushed by his failure to protect his <b>marionettes,</b> is discovered by Lorelei and Faust, who take him to a hidden cave where the first three female clones have finally awakened. The essences of the <b>marionettes</b> have been transferred into the three babies, and the <b>marionettes</b> fulfill their wish to become human.|$|R
5|$|Geppetto {{discovers that}} his wish has come true, and {{is filled with}} joy. However, {{on his way to}} school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who {{convince}} him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a <b>marionette</b> who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.|$|E
5|$|A second {{victim is}} found, {{this time a}} man whose eyes have been removed by forced surgery. Again, they {{discover}} the eyes were obtained from organ donation, and they find a connection to a woman called Amanda (Anja Savcic), a ballerina who had committed suicide. They also note the care that the culprit performed the work, and speculate that the person {{they are looking for}} is showing some compassion for his victims, calling for emergency help and using the serum to hope that they are given the proper care in time. They find that Amanda's alleged cremated remains are bogus, and that her body had been stolen before it could be cremated. They start to trace connections to Amanda, finding she was in a depression counseling support group. Though there are several possible suspects, Olivia's intuition leads her to a man named Roland David Barrett (Mark Ivanir), who was noted to have become enamored with Amanda at the meetings. At Roland's home, he has recovered the corpse and surgically replaced the organs in her body. Using a makeshift set of ropes and pulleys, Roland engages Amanda's body in a <b>marionette</b> act to make her perform like a ballerina, promising her he will bring her back to life.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the couple's {{popularity}} resulted in their being invited {{to set up a}} children's theater in line with the government's socialist restructuring policy. Her husband arranged for the theater in the Mamonovski Passage to be dedicated to puppet productions. By focusing on children's productions, the Efimovs avoided government pressure to perform communist-oriented themes. Simonovich-Efimova developed glove puppets and shadow puppets to re-enact fables and fairy tales based on the works of Krylov and Hans Christian Andersen. They included adaptations of traditional themes such as the Mena stories, Baba Yaga, Shrovetide, and Nikolay Nekrasov's Peasant Children. In a second theater, they staged <b>marionette</b> productions. The Effimovs put on twenty shows per month for the next eight months, while simultaneously performing with their traveling theater. The theater in the Mamonovski Passage then closed, marking their last engagement in a permanent location. For the next six years, the couples' main means of support came from the traveling theater. Between 1916 and 1924, sometimes assisted by their son Adrian, the couple staged around 600 performances. They were able to help people forget the famines and violence of the times. Simonovich-Efimova performed in children's hospitals and mental asylums, contributing to her family's history of philanthropy.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a <b>marionette</b> and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

25|$|The Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: Òpira dî pupi) is a <b>marionette</b> {{theatrical}} {{representation of}} Frankish romantic poems {{such as the}} Song of Roland or Orlando furioso {{that is one of}} the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorî (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this <b>marionette</b> art is the puppet theatres of Palermo. The Sicilian <b>marionette</b> theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E
