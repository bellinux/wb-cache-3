40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an effort to demonstrate the technology readiness of a long-life <b>multipropellant</b> resistojet for space station auxiliary propulsion. Experiments were performed to evaluate the compatibility of grain-stabilized platinum tubes at temperatures up to 1400 deg C in environments of CO 2, CH 4, NH 3, H 2 O, and H 2. All samples tested showed extrapolated lifetimes in excess of 10, 000 hr based on 10 percent mass loss as end-of-life. However, samples tested in an ammonia atmosphere at 1400 deg C showed severe pitting, which raised concerns about the compatibility of grain-stabilized platinum with ammonia-containing atmospheres.

40|$|The {{propulsion}} {{functions for}} the U. S. Space Station Freedom (SSF) are accomplished by two separate systems, the Primary Propulsion System and the Supplemental Reboost System (SRS). The Primary Propulsion System includes self-contained hydrazine modules for station reboost, attitude control and contingency maneuvers. These Propulsion Modules contain reboost and attitude control thrusters, propellant storage, thermal conditioning and electronic controls.

There are several electrothermal concepts which offer {{a range of}} characteristics and benefits. Resistojets are the highest thrust to power option and are currently operational at mission average values of specific impulse, I sub sp approximately 295 sec.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests were {{conducted}} to explore {{the characteristics of a}} water vaporizer intended for application to resistojet propulsion systems. A laboratory model of a forced-flow, once-through water vaporizer employing a porous heat exchange medium was built and characterized over a range of flow rates and power levels of interest for application to water resistojets. In a test during which the vaporizer was rotated about a horizontal axis normal to its own axis, the outlet temperature and mass flow rate through the vaporizer remained steady. Throttlability to 30 percent of the maximum flow rate tested was demonstrated. The measured thermal efficiency of the vaporizer was near 0. 9 for all tests. The water vaporizer was integrated with an engineering model <b>multipropellant</b> resistojet. Performance of the vaporizer/thruster assembly was measured over a narrow range of operating conditions. The maximum specific impulse measured was 234 s at a mass flow rate and specific power level (vaporizer and thruster combined) of 154 x 10 exp - 6 kg/s and 6. 8 MJ/kg, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The <b>multipropellant</b> {{resistojet}} thruster design {{initially was}} characterized for {{performance in a}} vacuum tank using argon, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and hydrogen, with gas inlet pressures ranging from 13. 7 to 310 kPa (2 to 45 psia) over a heat exchanger temperature range of ambient to 1200 C (2200 F). Specific impulse, the measure of performance, had values ranging from 120 to 600 seconds for argon and hydrogen respectively, with a constant heat exchanger temperature of 1200 C (2200 F). When operated under ambient conditions typical specific impulse values obtained for argon and hydrogen ranged from 55 to 290 seconds, respectively. Performance measured with several mixtures of argon and nitrogen showed no significant deviation from predictions obtained by directly weighting the argon and nitrogen individual performance results. Another aspect of the program investigating transient behavior, showed responses depended heavily on the start-up scenario used. Steady state heater temperatures were achieved in 20 to 75 minutes for argon, and in 10 to 90 minutes for hydrogen. Steady state specific impulses were achieved in 25 to 60, and 20 to 60 minutes respectively...|$|E
40|$|Resistojets for the Space Station require {{long life}} and <b>multipropellant</b> capability. The choice of {{available}} materials {{to meet these}} requirements is limited. Dispersion-strengthened platinum was selected. Past results indicated {{that it should be}} suffieiently inert in candidate propellant environments and should be capable of operating at moderate temperatures for extended periods. A series of propellant compatibility tests was done with platinum strengthened with either yttria or zirconia. Data presented included the results of 1000 -hr tests in CO 2, H 2, ammonia (NH 3), N 2, steam, hydrazine (N 2 H 4), and methane (CH 4); and 2000 -hr tests in H 2 and NH 3. The platinum samples were tested at 1400 C in CO 2, H 2, NH 3, N 2, steam, and N 2 H 4; at 500 C in CH 4; and at 800 C in N 2 H 4. The mass-loss results indicated material life, exptrapolated from experimental mass-loss data, in excess of 100 000 hr in all environments except steam and N 2 H 4, where it was greater than or = 45000 hr. Generally, on the basis of mass loss, there were no compatibility concerns in any of the environments considered. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the effect of propellants on the material surface and to evaluate material stability...|$|E
40|$|Resistojets are {{candidates}} for space station auxiliary propulsion, {{and should be}} characterized by both long life and <b>multipropellant</b> operations, requirements limited by available materials. Grain stabilized platinum is examined {{for use as a}} resistojet thruster material. Use of platinum in other applications indicates it can be used at moderately high temperatures for extended periods of time. Past results indicate that grain-stabilized platinum should be sufficiently inert in candidate propellant environments. Therefore, compatibility of platinum-yttria (P/Y 2 O 3) and platinum-zirconia (Pt/ZrO 2) with carbon dioxide, methane, hydrogen and ammonia is examined. A series of 1000 hr tests in CO 2, H 2, and NH 3 is conducted at 1400 C and a series of 1000 hr tests in CH 4 is conducted at about 500 C. Scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy and depth profiling analysis are then used {{to determine the effects of}} propellants on the material surface, to evaluate possible material contamination and to evaluate grain growth. The results indicate that there is carbon deposition on the surface of the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 in both the CO 2 and CH 4 environments. In the H 2 environment, the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 specimen surfaces are roughened. After exposure to the NH 3 environment, the Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are roughened and pitted over the entire heated area with some pitted areas along the grain boundaries. SEM photos show grain growth in cross-sectional views of all the Pt/Y 2 O 3 samples and the Pt/ZrO 2 samples, except that tested in methane. Mass loss measurements indicate that Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 would last in excess of 200, 000 hr in each propellant environment. However, in NH 3 both Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are severely pitted, with voids up to 50 percent into the material. Pt/Y 2 O 3 and Pt/ZrO 2 are not recommended for high temperature service in NH 3...|$|E
