2500|$|From 1982, Conservative policy {{began to}} move towards a more {{flexible}} position on Northern Ireland. In November 1985, Gow was persuaded by the speeches his cousin Nicholas Budgen made to resign as Minister of State in HM Treasury over {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Irish Agreement. Despite his disagreement with government policy, he used his resignation speech to underline his personal devotion to Thatcher, describing her as [...] "the finest chief, the most resolute leader, the kindest friend that any member of this House could hope to serve." [...] The Anglo-Irish Agreement would ultimately lead to devolved government for Northern Ireland, power sharing in the province and engagement with the Republic. After his resignation from the government, Gow became chairman of the parliamentary Conservative backbench committee on Northern Ireland. He was a leading opponent of any compromise with republicans and his tactics in this regard caused concern to the Northern Ireland Secretary Jim Prior and other MPs - “He [...] co-ordinated the Tory backbench opposition to Mr Prior's Northern Ireland Assembly bill in the early 1980s. His activities were said to have startled other Tory MPs and led to a complaint from an enraged <b>Mr</b> <b>Prior</b> to Mrs Thatcher.” ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{would be}} very unlike a historian, to refuse this great {{minister}} the praise he so justly deserveth, of having treated, through the whole course of so great a negotiation, with the utmost candour and integrity; never once failing in any promise he made, and tempering a firm zeal to his master's interest, with a ready compliance to what was reasonable and just. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior,</b> whom I have formerly mentioned, resided likewise now at Paris, with the character of minister plenipotentiary, and was very acceptable to that court, upon the score of his wit and humour.[29] ...|$|E

6000|$|When the Queen {{received}} {{an account of}} this good disposition in the States General, immediately orders were sent to <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior,</b> to inform the ministers of the French court, [...] "That Her Majesty had now some hopes of the Dutch complying with her measures; and therefore she resolved, as she had always declared, whenever those allies came to themselves, {{not to make the}} peace without their reasonable satisfaction." [...] The difficulty that most pressed, was about the disposal of Tournay and Condé. The Dutch insisted strongly to have both, and the French were extremely unwilling to part with either.|$|E
6000|$|In June, one {{thousand}} seven hundred and eleven, <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior,</b> {{a person of}} great distinction, not only {{on account of his}} wit, but for his abilities in the management of affairs, and who had been formerly employed at the French court, was dispatched thither by Her Majesty with the foregoing demands. This gentleman was received at Versailles with great civility. The King declared, that no proceeding, in order to a general treaty, would be so agreeable to him as by the intervention of England; and that His Majesty, being desirous to contribute with all his power towards the repose of Europe, did answer to the demands which had been made, ...|$|E
60|$|The Queen {{judged the}} former would suffice, for {{completing}} the barrier of the States. <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior</b> was therefore directed {{to press the}} Marquis de Torcy effectually on this head, and to terminate all that minister's objections, by assuring him of Her Majesty's resolutions to appear openly {{on the side of}} the Dutch, if this demand were refused. It was thought convenient to act in this resolute manner with France, whose late success, against Holland, had taught the ministers of the Most Christian King to resume their old imperious manner of treating with that republic; to which they were farther encouraged by the ill understanding between Her Majesty and the allies.|$|E

60|$|April 1. The Duke of Buckingham's house {{fell down}} {{last night with}} an earthquake, and is half {{swallowed}} up; won't you go and see it?--An April fool, an April fool, oh ho, young women. Well, don't be angry. I will make you an April fool no more till the next time; we had no sport here, because it is Sunday, and Easter Sunday.

6000|$|I {{never have}} discoursed with any {{reasonable}} man upon this subject, {{who did not}} allow {{that there was no}} remedy left us, but to lessen the importation of all unnecessary commodities as much as it was possible; and likewise either to persuade our absentees to spend their money at home, which is impossible; or tax them at five shillings in the pound during their absence, with such allowances, upon necessary occasions, as it shall be thought convenient: or, by permitting us a free trade, which is denied to no other nation upon earth. The three last methods are treated by <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior,</b> in his most useful treatise, added to his list of absentees.[128] ...|$|E
60|$|Besides, the {{politics}} of the French ran at this time very opposite to those of Britain: They thought the ministers here durst not meet the Parliament without a peace; and that, therefore, Her Majesty would either force the States to comply with France, by delivering up Tournay, which was the principal point in dispute, or would finish her own peace with France and Spain, leaving a fixed time for Holland to refuse or accept the terms imposed on them. But the Queen, who thought the demand of Tournay by the States to be very necessary and just, was determined to insist upon it, and to declare openly against France, rather than suffer her ally to want a place so useful for their barrier. And <b>Mr.</b> <b>Prior</b> was ordered to signify this resolution of Her Majesty to Mons. de Torcy, in case that minister could not be otherwise prevailed on.|$|E
