25|$|The Ngarrindjeri's {{traditional}} {{areas are}} {{claimed to have}} extended from Mannum, South Australia downstream through <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge</b> and Victor Harbor and along the coast through Goolwa to Cape Jervis, including Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert but {{this is based on}} an amalgamation of the territories of several distinct groups. For example, asserting territorial extent over the region from Encounter Bay to Cape Jervois appropriates or subsumes the area well documented as being that of the Ramindjeri, without substantive evidence to support such a claim, and despite evidence to the contrary.|$|E
25|$|Heathcock {{was born}} in <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge</b> in South Australia in 1901, one of seven {{children}} of railway engineer Frederick John Rayney and his wife Emily Melissa (nee Soar). She was interested in Aboriginal culture from childhood, where she befriended many Aboriginal people in the region. She trained to be a nurse {{from the age of}} 16, training at the Adelaide General Hospital and later the Lameroo Hospital. She fell ill during this time, and had a lung removed. After she recovered she went to work at Point McLeay Mission.|$|E
25|$|By way of {{contrast}} {{and due to}} a shared dreaming, {{the relationship between the}} Ngarrindjeri and the Walkandi-woni (the people of the warm north-east wind), their collective name for the various groups living along the River as far as Wentworth in New South Wales, was of significant mutual importance and the groups regularly met at Wellington, Tailem Bend, <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Mannum or Swan Reach to exchange songs and conduct ceremonies. Quarrels with the Walkandi-woni were not unknown and in 1849 the Rev George Taplin recorded a fight between 500 Ngarrindjeri and up to 800 Ngaiawang who shared a border with them at Mannum.|$|E

500|$|Dunstan {{was born}} on 21 September 1926 in Suva, Fiji to Francis Vivian Dunstan and Ida May Dunstan (née Hill) [...] (Australian parents of Cornish descent). His parents had moved to Fiji in 1916 after his father took up a {{position}} as manager of the Adelaide Steamship Company. He spent the first seven {{years of his life}} in Fiji, starting his schooling there. Dunstan was beset by illness, and his parents sent him to South Australia hoping that the drier climate would assist his recovery. He lived in <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge</b> for three years with his mother's parents before returning to Suva for a short period during his secondary education. During his time in Fiji, Dunstan mixed easily with the Indian settlers and indigenous people, something that was frowned upon by the whites on the island.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, {{the first}} major {{developments}} {{in regard to the}} state's population growth occurred. Adelaide's population was set to increase to 1.3 million and the MATS plan and water-storage schemes were in planning to accommodate this. These were summarily rejected by the Dunstan Government, which planned to build a new city 83kilometres from Adelaide, near <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge.</b> The city, to be known as Monarto, was to be built on farmland {{to the west of the}} existing town. Dunstan was very much against allowing Adelaide's suburbs to further sprawl, and thus Monarto was a major focus of his government. He argued that the new South Eastern Freeway would allow a drive of only 45 minutes from Adelaide, that the city was not far from current industry, and that water could be readily supplied from the River Murray. The government hoped that Adelaide would not sprawl into the Mount Lofty Ranges to the east and that the bureaucracy would be dispersed from the capital. In contrast, public servants feared being forced into the rural settlement. Critics—of which there were many—derided the project as [...] "Dunstan's Versailles in the bush". Environmental activists aired fears of the effects of Monarto on the River Murray, which was already suffering from pollution and salinity problems. Later on, it was noticed that there was hard bedrock underneath the ground, raising drainage problems.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1965, The Mustangs renamed {{themselves}} as The Masters Apprentices (deliberately omitting the apostrophe), Bower supplied the name because [...] "we are apprentices to {{the masters of}} the blues—Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Jimmy Reed, Elmore James and Robert Johnson". By early 1966 they {{were one of the}} most popular beat bands in Adelaide, regularly selling out concerts in the city, as well as making visits to outlying towns of <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge,</b> Mount Gambier and Whyalla.

Pomberuk (Ngarrindjeri for crossing place), {{on the banks of the}} River Murray in <b>Murray</b> <b>Bridge</b> was the most significant Ngarrindjeri site. All 18 lakinyeri (tribes) would meet there for corroborees. Around [...] further down the river was Tagalang (Tailem Bend), a traditional trading camp where lakinyeri would gather to trade ochre, weapons and clothing. In the 1900s, Tailem Bend was assigned as a government ration depot supplying the Ngarrindjeri.|$|E
