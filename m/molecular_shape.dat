2500|$|In {{his book}} Sensing the World, Moreland Perkins argues that qualia {{need not be}} {{identified}} with their objective sources: a smell, for instance, bears no direct resemblance to the <b>molecular</b> <b>shape</b> that gives rise to it, nor is a toothache actually in the tooth. He is also like Hobbes {{in being able to}} view the process of sensing as being something complete in itself; as he puts it, it is not like [...] "kicking a football" [...] where an external object is required—it is more like [...] "kicking a kick", an explanation which entirely avoids the familiar Homunculus Objection, as adhered to, for example, by Gilbert Ryle. Ryle was quite unable even to entertain this possibility, protesting that [...] "in effect it explained the having of sensations as the not having of sensations." [...] However, A.J. Ayer in a rejoinder identified this objection as [...] "very weak" [...] as it betrayed an inability to detach the notion of eyes, indeed any sensory organ, from the neural sensory experience.|$|E

We hypothesized that a random combinatorial library of synthetic poly-N-substituted glycine oligomers, or peptoids, could represent a random “shape library” in antigen space, {{and that some of}} these peptoids would be recognized by the antigen-binding pocket of disease-specific antibodies. We synthesized and screened a one bead one compound combinatorial library of peptoids, in which each bead displayed an 8 -mer peptoid with ten possible different amines at each position (108 theoretical variants). By screening one million peptoid/beads we found 112 (approximately 1 in 10, 000) that preferentially bound immunoglobulins from human sera known to be positive for anti-HIV antibodies. Reactive peptoids were then re-synthesized and rigorously evaluated in plate-based ELISAs. Four peptoids showed very good, and one showed excellent, properties for establishing a sero-diagnosis of HIV. These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing sero-diagnostic assays for infectious diseases from libraries of random <b>molecular</b> <b>shapes.</b> In this study we sought a proof-of-principle that we could identify a potential diagnostic antibody ligand biomarker for an infectious disease in a random combinatorial library of 100 million peptoids.

40|$|The self {{assembly}} of phospholipid molecules in the bilayer form was considered {{in terms of}} equivalent <b>molecular</b> <b>shapes</b> representing intermolecular forces. The equivalent size of each phospholipid headgroup was approximated by the net atomic volume plus {{the volume of the}} associated water molecules, which was derived from water/hydrocarbon partitioning experiments. The equivalent lengths of unsaturated acyl chains were derived from the retention time data from chromatographic measurements. The spontaneous curvature of various phospholipid monolayers was calculated from their equivalent <b>molecular</b> <b>shapes,</b> and the energy required to flatten them to the bilayer plane was calculated, using the known bending modulus. With increasing bending energy, the mixtures showed increasing susceptibility to phospholipase A 2, facilitated lipid transfer rate by phospholipid exchange proteins, permeability to carboxyfluorescein, incorporation of human erythrocyte proteins, and calcium transport by Ca-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum in reconstituted vesicles. When the calculation was applied to known lipid compositions of nine cellular membranes, the protein/lipid ratio and phospholipid/cholesterol ratio were found to have a positive and a negative correlation, respectively, with the latent bending energy of the phospholipids. The energy expense in conforming to a bilayer phase may be an important physical parameter regarding the activity and the biogenesis of membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{generalized}} van der Waals {{equation of}} state for anisotropic liquids in porous media consists of two terms. One of them {{is based on the}} {{equation of state}} for hard spherocylinders in random porous media obtained from the scaled particle theory. The second term is expressed in terms of the mean value of attractive intermolecular interactions. The obtained equation is used for the investigation of the gas-liquid-nematic phase behavior of a molecular system depending on the anisotropy of molecule shapes, anisotropy of attractive intermolecular interactions, and porosity of a porous medium. It is shown that the anisotropic phase is formed by the anisotropy of attractive intermolecular interactions and by the anisotropy of <b>molecular</b> <b>shapes.</b> The anisotropy of <b>molecular</b> <b>shapes</b> shifts the phase diagram to lower densities and higher temperatures. The anisotropy of attractive interactions widens significantly the coexistence region between the isotropic and anisotropic phases and shifts it to the region of lower densities and higher temperatures. It is shown that, for sufficiently long spherocylinders, the liquid-gas transition is localized completely within the nematic region. For all the considered cases, the decrease of the porosity shifts the phase diagram to the region of lower densities and lower temperatures. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
