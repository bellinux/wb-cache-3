25|$|During {{his time}} in Gajabahu’s court, the Parākramabāhu did two things of significance. The first was to enmesh the court of Gajabahu {{in a web of}} espionage and the other was to marry one of his sisters called Bhaddavati, to King Gajabahu. Through this marriage, Parākramabāhu managed matters that Gajabahu II {{completely}} trusted him, as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the royal family. Nevertheless, he retained the entirety of Bhaddavati’s dowry for himself, and entered into secret negotiations with Gajabahu’s general, Gokanna. Gajabahu eventually grew suspicious of Parākramabāhu’s activities, and Parākramabāhu departed Rajarata in secrecy by night and returned to Dakkhinadesa.|$|E
25|$|All in all, Bannerman made six {{trips to}} England, and {{he enjoyed the}} actual touring of the Mother Country just as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> playing cricket there; indeed, many of his most memorable {{experiences}} occurred in places where his contribution on the field was negligble. He played {{in three of the}} most historically important matches of his era - the match with the M.C.C. in 1878 that the Australians won in less than a day, that first-ever Test in 1880 and the Ashes-igniter at the Oval in 1882, in which he had one of the better games amongst the batsmen, scoring nine for a strike-rate of 10.34 in the first innings, and a boundary-less thirteen from an hour and ten minutes in the second, holding up one end while Massie launched his famous assault from the other.|$|E
25|$|As a batsman Jupp {{struck the}} happy medium between {{enterprise}} and caution. He watched the ball {{so well that}} when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better worth watching. He possessed {{a wide variety of}} strokes, and can drive or out with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s spun the ball as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> and, with a wicket to help him, he could make it turn to a pronounced degree. One of the secrets of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point.|$|E

500|$|Woodfull {{performed}} {{poorly in}} the Tests, with 228 runs at 28.50, {{but it was}} sufficient for an Australian triumph as Bradman and Ponsford each averaged over 90 and Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly each took over 25 wickets. [...] Woodfull was criticised by Robinson for his relatively defensive captaincy, tending to bat opponents out of the match instead of going directly for victory from the off. Woodfull relied on O'Reilly and Grimmett, using only three specialist bowlers as he sought to reinforce the batting line-up. However, he was effective in curtailing leading English batsmen Wally Hammond. When Woodfull was captaining Australia, Hammond only averaged half as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> when another player was captaining Australia.|$|E
500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made {{in the face of}} universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E

[...] William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the film a B minus and wrote, [...] "It's a decent enough stab at being what the old movie was to its time, following the same basic plot, full of respectful references to its model, updated with a gallery of fairly imaginative special effects." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars and noted that the film had [...] "taken its title so seriously that the plot stands still along with it", but also stated that it was [...] "an expensive, good-looking film that is well-made by Scott Derrickson".

[...] Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote that the film was [...] "a deadly funny movie; nearly every scene is broken off with a punch line. But Parker's sense of comedy is organic; he never lets the jokes elbow the characters, or the music, out of the spotlight." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "... Parker has loosened up quite a bit here, not forcing the action as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the similar Fame and bringing a surprisingly loony touch to characters like Jimmy's Elvis-obsessed father." [...] Time magazine reviewer Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "The film offers no message, no solutions, only a great time at the movies." ...|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the primary}} historiographical {{questions}} surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda {{and the reasons for}} its failure. His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern absolute monarchy as exemplified by the Tudor dynasty. More recently, Richard's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents, and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy {{that he was able to}} achieve as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Yet his actions were too extreme, and too abrupt. For one, the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation, and so help Richard's popularity with the Commons in parliament. However, this promise was never fulfilled, as the cost of the royal retinue, the opulence of court and Richard's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been, without offering commensurate benefits. As for his policy of military retaining, this was later emulated by Edward IV and Henry VII, but Richard's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country. As Simon Walker concludes: [...] "What he sought was, in contemporary terms, neither unjustified nor unattainable; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{injuring}} {{his knee}} in a festival match {{at the beginning}} of the tour at East Molesey, Johnston attributed the injury to a lack of attention to detail. His new boots had spikes that were longer than usual, and the physiotherapist had failed to strap his ankle before the match. His knee soon failed. Johnston missed the first six first-class matches, and with it a month of cricket. He returned against the Minor Counties in late May and took 3/20 in an innings win. He staked his claim for selection in the final two tour matches before the Tests; he took 4/65 and 3/49 against Sussex and then led the way in a win over Hampshire, <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> five years earlier, taking [...] 5/75 and 4/21. He had taken 20 wickets at 13.35 in his four tour matches and was duly selected to play in the First Test at Trent Bridge. He was economical but unpenetrative, conceding 36 runs in 36 overs without taking a wicket in a rain-affected draw. Between Tests, he removed Hutton in both innings of a match against Yorkshire, but it came at a cost; he ended with 4/186. He took match figures of 4/161 in the Second Test but England held on for a draw with three wickets in hand, as a recurrence of the knee injury while fielding intervened again. He then had an operation to remove cartilage in his right knee; this allowed him more leg movement but also destabilised his knee. The same surgeon had operated on Compton's knee. After missing another month of cricket, Johnston returned with a remodelled action, and hauls of 4/51, 6/63 and 6/39 against Surrey, Glamorgan and Essex respectively, saw Johnston return for the Fifth Test at The Oval. Although the pitch was helpful for spin, a total of 74 overs in the match yielded 3/146, as Johnston was unable rekindle the form of 1948 following his knee injury. Compton and Edrich batted cautiously to ensure the victory that saw England reclaim the Ashes 1–0. He managed only seven Test wickets at 49.00, but his first-class form remained strong. After the Tests, Johnston took match figures of 11/73 and 9/124 in consecutive matches against Kent and the South of England; Australia won both by an innings. He ended with 75 wickets at 20.54 for the entire tour. His injuries were considered a major factor in Australia's loss of the series.|$|E

2500|$|But {{there was}} another cause for the rupture. Hazlitt had {{reviewed}} Wordsworth's The Excursion in 1814, [...] approvingly, but with serious reservations. Wordsworth's poetry was appreciated by few at that time. The Excursion was notoriously demeaned by the influential Francis Jeffrey in his Edinburgh Review criticism beginning with the words, [...] "This will never do", while Hazlitt's account was later judged {{to have been the}} most penetrating of any written at the time. Still, Wordsworth was unable to tolerate less than unconditional acceptance of his poetry, and he resented Hazlitt's review as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> Jeffrey's. Their relations deteriorated further, and by 1815 they were bitter enemies.|$|E
2500|$|Boulez {{gave various}} reasons for {{conducting}} as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> He gave his first concerts for the Domaine Musical because its financial resources were limited: [...] "I told myself that, being much less expensive, I {{would have a}} go myself." [...] He {{also said that the}} best possible training for a composer was [...] "to have to play or conduct his own works and to face their difficulties of execution"—yet on a practical level he sometimes struggled to find time to compose around his conducting commitments. The writer and pianist Susan Bradshaw thought this was deliberate and related to a sense of being overshadowed as a composer by Stockhausen, who from the late 1950s was increasingly prolific. The French litterateur and musicologist Pierre Souvchinsky disagreed: [...] "Boulez became a conductor because he had a great gift for it".|$|E
2500|$|Many of his {{original}} circle of students had studied or were studying at the Conservatoire. [...] Among the most notable in later life were Vincent d'Indy, Ernest Chausson, Louis Vierne, and Henri Duparc. [...] This group became increasingly tight-knit in their mutual esteem and affection between teacher and pupils. [...] d'Indy relates that independently but unanimously each new student came to call their professor Père Franck, [...] "Father Franck". [...] On the other hand, Franck experienced some tensions in his faculty life: he tended to teach composition as <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> organ performance and improvisation; he was considered unsystematic in his teaching techniques ("Franck never taught by means of hard and fast rules or dry, ready-made theories"), with an offhand attitude towards the official texts and books approved by the Conservatoire; and his popularity among some students provoked some jealousy among his fellow professors and some counter-claims of bias {{on the part of}} those professors when judging Franck's pupils for the various prizes, including the Prix de Rome. [...] Vallas says that Franck, [...] "with his simple and trusting nature was incapable of understanding [...] [...] [...] how much back-chat of the nastier kind there could be even in a Conservatoire whose atmosphere he himself always found kindly disposed towards him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{tours of}} the USA {{followed}} in support of Kiln House, but the second, in early 1971, was blighted by Spencer's bizarre departure from the group, when he disappeared one afternoon in Los Angeles, and was later discovered to have joined the religious cult the Children of God. After an uncomfortable time finishing the tour, during which Peter Green was asked {{to come back and}} help out, Californian Bob Welch was recruited to replace Spencer, without an audition as such, after a brief period getting to know the band. Welch's contrasting attitudes towards Kirwan, on the one hand their difficult personal relationship, and on the other, Welch's respect for Kirwan's musicianship, were a point of focus during the 18 months they were together in Fleetwood Mac. In 1999, Welch stated: [...] "He was a talented, gifted musician, almost equal to Pete Green in his beautiful guitar playing and faultless string bends." [...] In a later interview, Welch said: [...] "Danny wasn't a very lighthearted person, to say the least.
