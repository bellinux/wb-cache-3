40|$|A {{number of}} {{reinforced}} concrete slabs {{have been exposed}} to blast and impact loading in order to access modes of slab behaviour under these extreme dynamic loadings. Two sizes of specimens were used; small scale slabs modelled the large slabs at 1 : 2. 5 scale. Impact loads were produced by a free falling hammer impacting coaxially onto a cylindrical bar of steel placed at rest in the centre of the slab. The steel bar was instrumented with electrical strain gauges which recorded the stress pulses produced by the impact. Blast loads were produced using explosive charges made of Plastic Explosive PE 4. In most cases the charge used was hemispherical in shape and was placed centrally above the slab at close range standoffs, i. e. up to 10 times the radius of the charge. Additional blast tests were conducted in order to monitor the transient and spatial pressure distribution across the slab by using the pressure gauges placed in replica steel slab. Transient deflections of the slabs under both types of load were obtained using long stroke displacement transducers, whilst transient strains in the steel reinforcement of the slabs were obtained using electrical resistance strain gauges bonded to the steel bars at mid span point. A rotating prism high speed camera was used to film the damage on some of the small scale specimens at rates of up to 10, 000 pictures per second. The Hopkinson pressure bar tests were used to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the concretes used at high rates of loading. Differeent concrete mixes were used for the 1 : 1 and 1 : 2. 5 scale slabs. An analytical function of the spatial and transient blast pressure distribution based on the detonation pressure of PE 4 was established. This is in close agreement to experimentally measured results. The nature of the local and overall failure are discussed, and the time sequence of the slab failure is established for the case of explosive loading. The crack pattern that occurs soon after the explosion in area of local failure has been established from the high speed films whilst the overall deflected shape was obtained from the displacement vs time records. After test scab sizes and slab perforations were used to establish a relation between the slab thickness, amount of explosive and the slab damage in respect to scabbing and perforation. The displacement records and the shape of after test damage provided the basis for comments on "gravity neglected - the ultimate strength" <b>modelling</b> <b>law</b> that was employed in this research...|$|E

It analyses {{the structure of}} the <b>Model</b> <b>Law</b> and its various institutes while taking into account the relevant jurisdiction. The cooperation and coordination process between the courts and insolvency administrators is seen as a particularly promising area.

The <b>Model</b> <b>Law</b> and both Regulations are compared based on the comparison of individual institutions by analysing their conceptual and substantive differences and by outlining different functions in practice. The limits of national legislation are demonstrated by comparing the laws of the states which have not adopted the <b>Model</b> <b>Law</b> (Czech Republic, Germany, France and China), with the opportunities offered by the <b>Model</b> <b>Law.</b> The Czech and Ukrainian Laws of the international insolvency de lege lata are compared with the hypothetical status that would have arisen when the <b>Model</b> <b>Law</b> is applied in both countries, including practical examples.
