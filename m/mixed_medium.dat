40|$|The {{growth of}} three microalgae species, viz., Nannochloropsis oculata, Tetraselmis chui and Chaetoceros muelleri which are {{commonly}} used in aquaculture, was investigated using three different inorganic nutrient media: (i) Modified Guillard's f/ 2 <b>medium</b> (ii) Rix <b>Mix</b> <b>medium</b> and (iii) BFRI medium. Each microalgae species was cultured for 24 days in small- scale with initial inoculation density of 17 xl 04 cell /ml in the three media with triplicates. N. oculata cultured in modified Guillard's f/ 2 medium showed superior growth with a mean peak density of 221 ± 4. 24 x 104 cell/ ml, to Rix <b>Mix</b> <b>medium</b> (141 ± 10. 54 xl 04 cell/ml) and BFRI medium (47 ± 4. 94 x 104 cell/ml) on the 16 th day of culture at stationary phase. Considering the increase in cell density for 20 days of culture in Rix <b>Mix</b> <b>medium,</b> C. muelleriwas significantly (P< 0. 05) highest than in other two media. N. oculata cultured in BFRI medium resulted in the poorest growth with a mean peak increase in density of 84 ± 9. 19 x 104 cell/ml in 12 days of culture. However, {{with an increase in}} cell density, growth of T. chui (182 ± 6. 26 x 104 cell/ml) was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in BFRI medium than in modified Guillard's f/ 2 medium. The {{results of the present study}} suggest that N. oculata and C. muelleri can be grown very well in both the modified Guillard's f/ 2 <b>medium</b> and Rix <b>Mix</b> <b>medium.</b> Better growth of T. chui can be obtained while culturing either in BFRI and Rix <b>Mix</b> <b>medium.</b> These three nutrient media used in the present study may be useful for microalgae species culture for establishing green-water culture for suitable target zooplankton, and fish and crustacean larvae in marine and brackishwater hatcheries...|$|R

He used different elements like steel, wood, cement, stone, iron, bronze etc.in the making of his sculptures. Abstract expressionism was his preferred method to communicate with the spectators of his creation. He always wanted to portray the truthful aspect of nature, only by painting them in greater form than the reality truly is, by using different vivid and vibrant colors to show exclusively the colors only but not the shapes in details.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{silhouette}} animation as invented by Reiniger is subdivision of cutout animation (itself {{one of the}} many forms of stop motion). It utilises figures cut out of paperboard, sometimes reinforced with thin metal sheets, and tied together at their joints with thread or wire (usually substituted by plastic or metal paper fasteners in contemporary productions) which are then moved frame-by-frame on an animation stand and filmed top-down with a rostrum camera - such techniques were used, albeit with stylistic changes, by such practitioners as Noburō Ōfuji in the 1940s and Bruno J. Böttge in the 1970s.http://ottawa.awn.com/archives/ottawa76.html Michel Ocelot's television series Ciné si (Cinema If, 1989) was a little different, combining cutouts and cels and also, more occasionally, live-action and clay animation (this series is better known as Princes et princesses, the feature film version mentioned below). This was also the first {{silhouette animation}} to successfully make characters appear to speak for themselves (traditionally, either intertitles or voice-over narration had been used) as the <b>mixed</b> <b>medium</b> made accurate lip syncing possible.http://www.heeza.fr/description.php?lang=2&path=64&sort=Article&page=0&id=296 Traditional animation {{can also be used to}} imitate silhouette animation, as seen regularly in Be-PaPas' Shōjo Kakumei Utena (Revolutionary Girl Utena, 1997).|$|E
