Throughout the 19th century Galveston remained Texas' dominant metropolis and the communities around the bay were strongly tied economically and culturally to the city though, as Houston began to develop, so did the Bay Area's ties to it. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad further spurred growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{succeeded in}} its bid {{to join the}} United States in 1845, {{one of the key}} causes of the {{subsequent}} Mexican-American War.

The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson (GH) Railroad, begun in 1857, further spurred more growth in the region.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Uematsu {{decided the}} band should produce {{an album of}} Final Fantasy arrangements. The trio arranged, interpreted, and sequenced ten battle themes from various Final Fantasy titles, with Uematsu as producer; the album was {{released}} eponymously on February 19, 2003. To celebrate the success, Uematsu decided to organize a concert in tribute to the album; Uematsu and Fukui served as the keyboardists, while Sekito was the guitarist. They needed <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> perform the arrangements live, however, and as such, several other members from Square Enix joined. Keiji Kawamori joined to play the bass guitar, Michio Okamiya to play the guitar, and Arata Hanyuda to play the drums. Since then, The Black Mages have released two additional albums, with all six members participating. The group performed concerts to promote both of these albums, and also participated in video game music-themed concerts.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority {{announced}} plans to renovate the train station. This, along the village's plans to revitalize the entire village of Sloatsburg, was thought to give the bland train station a more traditional look. This would include adding a roof to protect commuters and visitors from the elements, such as rain or snow, handicap-accessible ramps for wheelchairs, better lighting, more seats for people to wait, and a heated shelter. (A shelter exists, but is not heated). The village also wants to use a $50,000 grant from the state to construct a large municipal parking lot near the station. This would get <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> use the station, as because {{with the lack of}} facilities, the station is under-used. The preliminary design was made by Jeff Livingston, an architect on the Sloatsburg Revitalization Committee.|$|E

5|$|Statutory {{conspiracy}} {{consists of}} an agreement between two or <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> commit a criminal offence, under section 5(1) and (2) of the 1977 Act. For statutory conspiracies, there must be three elements: an agreement, to pursue a course of conduct which involves the commission of a crime, where {{the parties to the}} agreement intended to commit the crime. Even if the parties later decide not to go through with the plan, since the actus reus is to reach an agreement, they can still be charged. There are certain categories of agreement which cannot amount to a criminal conspiracy, however; an agreement between a husband and wife is not a conspiracy, under section 2(2)(a) of the 1977 Act, and neither is an agreement with a person under the age of criminal responsibility, or with the intended victim of the crime.|$|E
5|$|While {{tropical}} cyclones {{may well}} seriously damage settlement, total destruction encourages rebuilding. For example, the destruction wrought by Hurricane Camille on the Gulf coast spurred redevelopment, greatly increasing local property values. Research {{indicates that the}} typical hurricane strike raises real house prices {{for a number of}} years, with a maximum effect of between 3 percent to 4 percent three years after occurrence. However, disaster response officials point out that redevelopment encourages <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> live in clearly dangerous areas subject to future deadly storms. Hurricane Katrina is the most obvious example, as it devastated the region that had been revitalized after Hurricane Camille. Many former residents and businesses do relocate to inland areas away from the threat of future hurricanes as well.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public to book for a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

5|$|The highest {{attendance}} {{recorded at}} Old Trafford was 76,962 for an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town on 25 March 1939. However, {{this was before}} the ground was converted to an all-seater stadium, allowing many <b>more</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> fit into the stadium. Old Trafford's record attendance as an all-seater stadium currently stands at 76,098, set at a Premier League game between Manchester United and Blackburn Rovers on 31 March 2007. This is also the Premier League's record attendance. Old Trafford's record attendance for a non-competitive game is 74,731, set on 5 August 2011 for a pre-season testimonial between Manchester United and New York Cosmos. The lowest recorded attendance at a competitive game at Old Trafford in the post-War era was 11,968, as United beat Fulham 3–0 on 29 April 1950. However, on 7 May 1921, the ground hosted a Second Division match between Stockport County and Leicester City for which the official attendance was just 13. This figure is slightly misleading as the ground also contained many of the 10,000spectators who had stayed behind after watching the match between Manchester United and Derby County earlier that day.|$|E
