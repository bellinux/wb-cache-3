40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} optimality, in a minimax sense, and adaptivity to the <b>margin</b> <b>and</b> to regularity in binary classification. We prove an oracle inequality, under the margin assumption (low noise condition), satisfied by an aggregation procedure which uses exponential weights. This oracle inequality has an optimal residual: (log M/n) κ/(2 κ− 1) where κ is the margin parameter, M the number of classifiers to aggregate and n the number of observations. We use this inequality first to construct minimax classifiers under <b>margin</b> <b>and</b> regularity assumptions and second to aggregate them to obtain a classifier which is adaptive both to the <b>margin</b> <b>and</b> regularity. Moreover, by aggregating plug-in classifiers (only log n), we provide an easily implementable classifier adaptive both to the <b>margin</b> <b>and</b> to regularity. ...|$|R

5|$|Following the 1961 event, FIDE {{abolished}} the automatic {{right of a}} deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, Armenian Tigran Petrosian, a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963–1969. His successor, Boris Spassky from Russia (champion 1969–1972), won games in both positional and sharp tactical style. The next championship, the so-called Match of the Century, saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II, American Bobby Fischer, who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of <b>margins</b> <b>and</b> clearly won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when FIDE did not meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess, especially by extensively preparing openings.|$|E

5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy <b>margins</b> <b>and</b> rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, and cream. The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E
5|$|Inhabiting {{continental}} <b>margins</b> <b>and</b> oceanic waters at {{depths of}} , the {{bigeye sand tiger}} may make vertical and horizontal migratory movements. It feeds on bony fishes and squid, and its sizable eyes and dark coloration suggest that it may spend most of its time in the mesopelagic zone. Reproduction is probably viviparous with oophagous embryos like in other mackerel shark species. This shark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries, though so infrequently that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) cannot yet determine its conservation status.|$|E

They are composed of sheets of papyrus joined together, the individual papyri varying in width from 15cm to 45cm. The scribes working on Book of the Dead papyri took more care over their work than those working on more mundane texts; care was taken to frame the text within <b>margins,</b> <b>and</b> to avoid writing on the joints between sheets.

5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot is {{a predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest <b>margins,</b> <b>and</b> near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures.

Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with turquoise parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.|$|E

McCain reprised his familiar underdog role, which was due {{at least in part}} to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year. McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976. The Republican's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead, compared to Obama's.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1980, {{the cost of}} {{building}} the Auburn Dam was estimated at $1 billion. As of 2007, the cost to build the dam would be about $10 billion. Other projects to improve safety <b>margins</b> <b>and</b> spillway capacity of Folsom Dam, and to increase the capacity of levees in the Sacramento area, were projected to cost significantly less while also providing similar levels of flood protection. Also, the United States National Research Council believes that existing stream-flow records, which only date back about 150 years, are insuffient to justify the construction of a dam as large as Auburn. The amount of water supply that Auburn Dam would actually make available was also in question, because while the American River floods in some years, in other years it barely discharges enough water to fill already-existing reservoirs. This casted doubts that Auburn could deliver enough water to justify its own cost, or the completion of Folsom South Canal, the other major feature of the Auburn-Folsom South Unit Project.|$|E
