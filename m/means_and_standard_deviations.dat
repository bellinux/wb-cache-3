50|$|Stevens (1946) argued that, {{because the}} {{assumption}} of equal distance between categories does not hold for ordinal data, the use of <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for description of ordinal distributions and of inferential statistics based on <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> was not appropriate. Instead, positional measures like the median and percentiles, in addition to descriptive statistics appropriate for nominal data (number of cases, mode, contingency correlation), should be used. Nonparametric methods have been proposed as the most appropriate procedures for inferential statistics involving ordinal data, especially those developed {{for the analysis of}} ranked measurements. However, use of parametric statistics for ordinal data may be permissible with certain caveats {{to take advantage of the}} greater range of available statistical procedures.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, Stevens {{observed}} that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> have no validity, {{but they can}} be used to get ideas for how to improve operationalization of variables used in questionnaires. Most psychological data collected by psychometric instruments and tests, measuring cognitive and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little prima facie evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff & Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008). In particular, IQ scores reflect an ordinal scale, in which all scores are meaningful for comparison only. There is no absolute zero, and a 10-point difference may carry different meanings at different points of the scale.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages: Critics voice {{concerns}} {{that such a}} standardization can be misleading. Since standardizing a variable removes the unit of measurement from its value, a standardized coefficient for a given relationship only represents its strength relative to the variation in the distributions. This invites bias due to sampling error when one standardizes variables using <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> based on small samples. Furthermore, a change of one standard deviation in one variable is only equivalent to a change of one standard deviation in another predictor insofar as {{the shapes of the}} two variables' distributions resemble one another. The meaning of a standard deviation may vary markedly between non-normal distributions (e.g., when skewed or otherwise asymmetrical). This underscores the importance of normality assumptions in parametric statistics, and poses an additional problem when interpreting standardized coefficient estimates that even nonparametric regression does not solve when dealing with non-normal distributions.|$|E
5000|$|A serious {{limitation}} of norm-reference tests {{is that the}} reference group may not represent the current population of interest. As noted by the Oregon Research Institute's International Personality Item Pool website, [...] "One should be very wary of using canned [...] "norms" [...] because it isn't obvious that one could ever find a population of which one's present sample is a representative subset. Most [...] "norms" [...] are misleading, and therefore {{they should not be}} used. Far more defensible are local norms, which one develops oneself. For example, if one wants to give feedback to members of a class of students, one should relate the score of each individual to the <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> derived from the class itself. To maximize informativeness, one can provide the students with the frequency distribution for each scale, based on these local norms, and the individuals can then find (and circle) their own scores on these relevant distributions." ...|$|E

50|$|When a {{probability}} distribution {{is known to}} have a particular shape (e.g., normal, uniform, beta, Weibull, etc.) but its parameters can only be specified imprecisely as intervals, the result is called a distributional p-box, or sometimes a parametric p-box. Such a p-box is usually easy to obtain by enveloping extreme distributions given the possible parameters. For instance, if a quantity is known to be normal with mean somewhere in the interval 7,8 and standard deviation within the interval 1,2, the left and right edges of the p-box can be found by enveloping the distribution functions of four probability distributions, namely, normal(7,1), normal(8,1), normal(7,2), and normal(8,2), where normal(μ,σ) represents a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ. All probability distributions that are normal and have <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> inside these respective intervals will have distribution functions that fall entirely within this p-box. The left and right bounds enclose many non-normal distributions, but these would be excluded from the p-box by specifying normality as the distribution family.|$|E
50|$|The {{test was}} {{developed}} using {{a sample of}} responses from the comparison of 504 sets of results from a trial by students, taken from a larger sample of 950 first year university student responses.The test was then normed on a sample of 1044 males and 1870 females aged between 17 and 69 years, across participants of varying backgrounds, including university students, nurses in training and blue and white collared employees of a major airline, bank, railway workshop and naval dockyard. The scores were subsequently checked for validity against outpatient groups including patients suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, insomniacs, myocardial infarction patients, as well as patients undergoing treatment for sexual, menopausal and depressive disorders. While the test was not normed against samples younger than 17, due to the simplicity of language, {{there has been no}} compelling evidence against the use of the scales for comparison against children as young as 12.The reliability scores of the scales in terms of Cronbach's alpha scores rate the Depression scale at 0.91, the Anxiety scale at 0.84 and the Stress scale at 0.90 in the normative sample. The <b>means</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> for each scale are 6.34 and 6.97 for depression, 4.7 and 4.91 for anxiety and 10.11 and 7.91 for stress, respectively. The mean scores in the normative sample did vary slightly between genders as well as varying by age, though the threshold scores for classifications do not change by these variations. The Depression and Stress scales meet the standard threshold requirement of 0.9 for research, however, the Anxiety scale still meets the 0.7 threshold for clinical applications, and is still close to the 0.9 required for research.|$|E

30|$|One {{possibility}} is that students were never required during their formal course to relate the concepts of <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> to the procedure for conducting an independent samples t-test.

However, learning how to calculate or use a t-test does not necessarily imply a deep {{understanding of how the}} test is related to <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> We speculate that most students {{would have been able to}} tell us that they needed the <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> in order to calculate a t-statistic. However, although the formula for the t-statistic does represent <b>mean</b> <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> in relation to each other, understanding this relationship is not necessary for performing the computation.
