5000|$|If the {{conservation}} of <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> is interpreted as conservation of rest mass, it does not hold true in special relativity. The rest energy (equivalently, rest mass) of a particle can be converted, not [...] "to energy" [...] (it already is energy (mass)), but rather {{to other forms of}} energy (mass) that require motion, such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or radiant energy. Similarly, kinetic or radiant energy can be converted to other kinds of particles that have rest energy (rest mass). In the transformation process, neither the total amount of mass nor the total amount of energy changes, since both properties are connected via a simple constant. This view requires that if either energy or (total) mass disappears from a system, it is always found that both have simply moved to another place, where they are both measurable as an increase of both energy and mass that corresponds to the loss in the first system.|$|E
40|$|Least-squares {{analyses}} {{have been}} performed {{on a set of}} atomic masses using standard and generalized semiempirical mass laws. Presumably because of errors in the assumed form of the standard <b>mass</b> <b>law,</b> its least-squares coefficients can be determined at best to an accuracy of about 10 %, and masses are predicted with an uncertainty of several Mev/c^ 2. The standard <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> has been generalized by addition of shell effect and deformation terms. While the least-squares fitting of the generalized <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> is better than for the standard <b>mass</b> <b>law,</b> it is still not possible to predict atomic masses to an accuracy better than a few Mev/c^ 2. The nuclear deformations and the well depth of the nuclear interaction obtained from the additional mass-law terms are in reasonable agreement with more accurate determinations by other methods. A similar statement applies to the nuclear radius constant as obtained from the least-squares coefficient of the Coulomb energy term. A study has also been made of the effects of additional terms propertional to the absolute value of the isotopic spin, exchange and surface corrections to the Coulomb energy, and the surface correction to the normal isotopic term...|$|E

40|$|In his 1942 {{paper on}} the sound {{insulation}} of single leaf walls, Cremer [(1942). Akust.

Cremer realized that these approximations limited the application of his theory to frequencies greater than twice the critical frequency. This paper removes most of Cremer¿s approximations so that the revised theory can be used down to the critical frequency. The revised theory is used as a correction to the diffuse field limp panel <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> below the critical frequency by setting the nonexistent coincidence angle to 90 °. The diffuse field limp panel <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> for a finite size wall is derived without recourse to a limiting angle by following the average diffuse field single sided radiation efficiency approach. The shear wave correction derived by Heckl and Donner [(1985). Rundfunktech Mitt. 29, 287 ¿ 291] is applied to the revised theory in order to cover the case of thicker walls. The revised theory predicts the general trend of the experimental data, although the agreement is usually worse at low frequencies and depends on the value of damping loss factor used in the region of and above the critical frequency...|$|E

Panel configurations included panels with no treatment and eight combinations of treatments consisting of a fiberglass-septum layer, a foam-foil damping material, and a plywood double wall trim panel. Measured TL of the untreated panel and the panel with a damping layer showed characteristics of the double mass law: at low frequencies the TL followed a <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> trend associated with the average mass of both skin and stiffness, while at higher frequencies the TL followed a <b>mass</b> <b>law</b> trend associated with skin mass only.

Treatment combinations showed that two treatments with the same mass could have TL values different by about 10 dB, while other combinations having weights different by a factor of two could have TL values within a few dB over most of the frequency range.

40|$|In Paper I of {{this series}} we {{presented}} a model to calculate in a synthetic way the evolution of thermal-pulsing AGB stars. The model {{was applied to the}} LMC and values were derived for the minimum core mass for third dredge-up and the dredge-up efficiency. In Paper I mass loss on the AGB was parameterized with a Reimers <b>mass</b> loss <b>law</b> with a best-fit value for the coefficient eta(AGB) of 5. In Paper Il we showed that the best fitting model of Paper I could also reproduce the observed abundance patterns in planetary nebulae (PNe) in the LMC, under the assumption that there is no dredge-up after hot bottom burning (HBB) ceases. To investigate the sensitivity of the results in Papers I and II to the adopted <b>mass</b> loss <b>law</b> we repeat in this paper the analysis of Papers I and II for two recently proposed <b>mass</b> loss <b>laws,</b> viz. that of Vassiliadis & Wood (I 993, VW) and that of Blocker & Schonberner (1993, BS). We find that the BS-law with a scaling factor eta(Bs) = 0. 1 fits all observational constraints equally well as the Reimers law. With a BS <b>mass</b> loss <b>law</b> {{there is no need to}} curtail dredge-up after HBB ceases. For the VW-law no combination of parameters could be found that fits all constraints simultaneously. This is probably due to the extreme luminosity dependence (M approximately L(alpha) alpha = 6) implied by the VW-law. We conclude that synthetic AGB models with <b>mass</b> loss <b>laws</b> that are moderately luminosity dependent (I <alpha less than or similar 4) can be made to fit all presently. available observational constraints...|$|R
