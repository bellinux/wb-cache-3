5000|$|The Dictionary of Occupational Titles {{was first}} {{published}} in 1938 and [...] "emerged in an industrial economy and emphasized blue-collar jobs. Updated periodically, the DOT provided useful occupational information for many years. But its usefulness waned as the economy shifted toward an information and services and away from heavy industry." [...] During the 1990s, the hard-copy book format of the DOT was discarded. An online database known as Occupational Information Network (O*NET) was created in 1998. O*NET classifies jobs in job families (functional areas which include workers from entry level to advanced, and may include several sub-specialties). [...] After the third major revision of O*NET realigned all O*NET occupations to conform to the newly <b>mandated</b> <b>Standard</b> Occupational Classification (SOC)), O*NET officially replaced the DOT, with less than 1,000 listed occupational categories, compared to over 13,000 occupations in the last published DOT.|$|E
50|$|By 1962, the {{transportation}} industry found {{the lack of}} consistency confusing enough to push for federal regulation. The result was the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-387). Beginning in 1967, the act <b>mandated</b> <b>standard</b> time within the established time zones and provided for advanced time: clocks would be advanced one hour beginning at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in April and turned back one hour at 2:00 a.m. on the last Sunday in October. States were allowed to exempt themselves from DST {{as long as the}} entire state did so. If a state chose to observe DST, the time changes were required to begin and end on the established dates. In 1967, Arizona and Michigan became the first states to exempt themselves from DST (Michigan would begin observing DST in 1972). In 1972, the act was amended (P.L. 92-267), allowing those states split between time zones to exempt either the entire state or that part of the state lying within a different time zone. The newly created Department of Transportation (DOT) was given power to enforce the law. As of 2014, the following states and territories are not observing DST: Arizona, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.|$|E

40|$|If the {{children}} are our future, then the state {{has an interest in}} the creation of a productive citizenry from the ranks of its children. Thus, it has a motive for protecting its youngest citizens from those who would do them harm. The latest national incidence study of child abuse and neglect identified over 1. 5 million victims of child abuse or neglect and indicated that 78 % of the perpetrators were parents, 10 % were other relatives, and the remainder were unrelated (Sedlack & Broadhurst, 1996). With the passage of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) of 1974, the federal government took the initiative to establish a model statute for state child protection programs that <b>mandated</b> <b>standard</b> methods for reporting and investigating child abuse and neglect (Costin, Karger & Stoesz, 1996). Some scholars have argued that the vagueness of both the definition of child abuse and the reasonable suspicion reporting threshold cause dramatic over-reporting (Besharov, 1987); in fact, national incidence surveys uncover that all the time nearly 50 % of child maltreatment victims are unknown to Child Protective Services (CPS) agencies (Zellman & Faller, 1996).

40|$|Organizations need {{to protect}} {{information}} assets against cyber crime, denial-of-service attacks, web hackers, data breaches, identity and credit card theft, and fraud. Criminals often try to achieve financial, political, or personal gain through these attacks, so the threats that their actions prompt are insidious motivators for organizations to adopt information systems security (ISS) approaches. Extant ISS research has traditionally examined ISS in E-commerce business organizations. The present study investigates ISS within government, analyzing power relationships during an ISS standards adoption and accreditation process, where a head of state mandates that all government agencies are {{to comply with a}} national de jure ISS standard. Using a canonical action research method, designated managers of ISS services across small, medium, and large agencies were monitored and assessed for progress to accreditation through surveys, interviews, participant observation at round table forums, and focus groups. By 2008, accreditation status across the 89 agencies participating in this study was approximately 33 percentfully accredited, with 67 percent partially compliant. The research uses Clegg's (1989) circuits of power frame-work to interpret power, resistance, norms, and cultural relationships in the process of compliance. The paper highlights that a strategy based on organization subunit size is helpful in motivating and assisting organizations to move toward accreditation. <b>Mandated</b> <b>standard</b> accreditation was inhibited by insufficient resource allocation, lack of senior management input, and commitment. Factors contributing to this resistance were group norms and cultural biases. 24 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the constitutional due process {{impact of the}} vastly opposite and conflicting standards of review in Title IX sexual assault investigations. Thousands of unionized public employees {{are subject to the}} terms and conditions of a public university collective bargaining agreement, which requires a heightened standard of 2 ̆ 2 clear and convincing evidence 2 ̆ 2 to discipline employees. At the same timeperhaps unknowingly-the employee is also held to the strict federally <b>mandated</b> <b>standard</b> of a 2 ̆ 2 preponderance of the evidence, 2 ̆ 2 which has a lower standard of review. In short, under the same facts and within the same Title IX investigation, the employee is subject to two conflicting legal standards. The circumstances and facts revealed that many Title IX sexual assault investigations can lead to: employee discipline, suspension, termination or even a private right of action. With this valuable right at stake for unionized public university employees, the legal conflict surrounding standards of review has manifested {{as one of the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s most pressing social, political, and legal matters of this decade. By examining this constitutionally important case, I define and articulate the historical and legal origins of (1) collective bargaining rights in the public sector; (2) the origins of Title IX from its initial legislative embodiment to its present day form; and (3) the intersection of unionization and due process rights in Title IX sexual assault investigations which result in an unintended constitutional conflict that may challenge at the core the legal permissibility of the manner in which sexual assault investigations are conducted nationwide. At the outset, I use two major research strategies: (1) a qualitative analysis and nationwide data sample of numerous public sector university collective bargaining agreements; and (2) established legal precedent. Data has been collected from interviews, newspapers, legal precedent, case law and published reports. Undoubtedly, this Article challenges the constitutionality of the 2 ̆ 2 preponderance of the evidence 2 ̆ 2 standard. While public institutions and public employee unions grapple with this important issue at the grassroots level, the facts uncovered in this critical research reveals that, upon legal challenge to the U. S. Supreme Court, the now ubiquitous 2 ̆ 2 preponderance of the standard, 2 ̆ 2 ostensibly mandated by the U. S. Department of Education 2 ̆ 7 s 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is, in fact, contrary to federal law and violates the Due Process Clause of the U. S. Constitution. This contention is not made lightly however. For what is at stake for public education institutions, Congress, the courts, labor unions and the like is of utmost legal importance. Yet, in view of the legal precedent revealed in this research, there can be only one reasonable conclusion when the evidence is considered in its totality; the April 2011 Dear Colleague Letter is not binding law. Rather, it is merely suggestive agency guidance cleverly held out to the public as binding law but, in actuality, lacks the necessary constitutional authority sufficient to withstand legal challenge...|$|E

40|$|Hospitals are {{currently}} {{under pressure to}} control the cost of medical care, {{while at the same}} time improving patient health outcomes. These twin concerns are at play in an important and contentious decision facing hospitals—choosing appropriate nurse staffing levels. Intuitively, one would expect nurse staffing ratios to be positively associated with patient outcomes. If so, this should be a key consideration in determining nurse staffing levels. A number of recent studies have examined this issue, however, there is concern about whether a causal relationship has been established. In this paper we exploit an arguably exogenous shock to nurse staffing levels. We look at the impact of California Assembly Bill 394, which mandated minimum levels of patients per nurse in the hospital setting. When the law was passed, some hospitals already had acceptable staffing levels, while others had nurse staffing ratios that did not meet <b>mandated</b> <b>standards.</b> Thus changes in hospital-level staffing ratios from the pre- to post-mandate periods are driven in part by the legislation. We find persuasive evidence that AB 394 did have the intended effect of decreasing patient/nurse ratios in hospitals that previously did not meet <b>mandated</b> <b>standards.</b> However, our analysis suggests that patient outcomes did not disproportionately improve in these same hospitals. That is, we find no evidence of a causal impact of the law on patient safety. ...|$|R
