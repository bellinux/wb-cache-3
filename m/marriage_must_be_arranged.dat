6000|$|There was {{one other}} person who also {{discussed}} it very much at his ease. Sir Francis Geraldine among his friends in London had been congratulated on his safe but miraculous escape. With {{a certain number of}} men he had been wont to discuss the chances of matrimony. Should he die, without having an heir, his title and property would go to his cousin, Captain Geraldine, who was a man some fifteen years younger than himself and already in possession of a large fortune. There were many people in the world whom Sir Francis hated, but none whom he hated so cordially as his cousin. Three or four years since he had been ill, nearly to dying, and had declared that he never would have recovered but for the necessity that he was under to keep his cousin out of the baronetage. It had therefore become imperative on him to marry in order that there might be an heir to the property. And though he had for a few weeks been perfectly contented with his Cecilia, there could be no doubt that he had experienced keenly the sense of relief when she had told him that the engagement must be at an end. Another <b>marriage</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>arranged,</b> but there would be time for that; and he would take care, that on this occasion he would not put himself into the hands of one who was exigeante and had a will of her own. [...] "By Gad," [...] he said to his particular friend, Dick Ross, [...] "I would almost sooner that my cousin Walter had the property than put it and myself into the hands of such a virago." ...|$|E
