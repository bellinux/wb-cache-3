60|$|I have a {{great deal}} of company in my house; {{especially}} in the morning, when nobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may convey an idea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud, or than Walden Pond itself. What company has that lonely lake, I pray? And yet it has not the blue devils, but the blue angels in it, in the azure tint of its waters. The sun is alone, except in thick weather, when there sometimes appear to be two, but one is a <b>mock</b> <b>sun.</b> God is alone--but the devil, he is far from being alone; he sees a great deal of company; he is legion. I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture, or a bean leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumblebee. I am no more lonely than the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south wind, or an April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a new house.|$|E

Of particular interest to modern scientists were the mention of three further <b>mock</b> <b>suns,</b> one {{at the intersection of}} the 22° halo and the upper tangent arc, and two others at 90* to the sun, also at the intersections of an immense but incomplete halo.|$|R

5000|$|Aristotle (Meteorology III.2, 372a14) {{notes that}} [...] "two <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> rose {{with the sun}} and {{followed}} it all through the day until sunset."

60|$|The day {{had been}} brilliantly fine. The bergs had {{absolutely}} duplicated and inverted themselves by reflection, so that the sunlit pinnacles became submarine fires, and refraction stepped in to reverse, and as it were shatter, the floes on the horizon, while three <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> glowed in the heavens at the same time--thus making the beautiful confusion still more exquisitely confounded.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Mock</b> <b>suns,</b> or parhelia, {{are common}} {{appearances}} in northern skies. Sometimes {{two of these}} <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> are seen, {{one on each side}} of their great original, glowing so brightly that either of them, if we could suppose it to have shone in the sky alone, would have made a very respectable sun indeed! Even four of these [...] "sun-dogs"--as they are some times called--have been seen surrounding the sun; one on each side of it, one directly above, and one immediately below, with a ring of light connecting them together, a streak of light passing horizontally and another passing perpendicularly between them, thus forming a luminous cross, in the centre of which was the sun itself. This magnificent spectacle is sometimes enhanced by a second circle of light enclosing the whole, and the edges of several outer circles springing in faint light therefrom until gradually lost, leaving the imagination to call up the idea of an endless series of glories extending over the whole sky.|$|R
60|$|Although {{this was}} the first time that these <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> had been seen by Gregory and some others of the crew of the Hope, little {{attention}} was paid to them at the time, because of the dangerous position into which the brig had been forced. The pack had again closed all around her, obliging her to take shelter in the lee of a small berg, which, from its shape, did not seem likely to be a dangerous protector.|$|R
60|$|It was a bright, clear, warm day. Four <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> encircled and {{emulated}} in brilliancy {{their great}} original. The balmy air {{was beginning to}} melt {{the surface of the}} snow, and the igloos that had stood firm for full half a year were gradually becoming dangerous to walk over and unsafe to sit under. Considerable bustle prevailed in the camp, for a general seal-hunting expedition was on foot, and the men of the tribe were preparing their dog-sledges and their spears.|$|R
60|$|All {{that night}} the storm roared among {{mountains}} with bitter fury; but next day the wind was subdued, and the sun shone brightly on the grey rocks and on the white wreaths of snow. It shone in all the lustre of an unclouded winter sky. Not only did the sun smile upon the scene, but two <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> or parhelia, almost as bright as himself, shone {{on either side of}} him.

'Now, to {{all such}} observers, {{including}} myself, {{it has been}} plain that of late neither {{the look of the}} sky nor the character of the weather has been, as we should say, what it used to be; and those whose eyes were strong enough to look now and then toward the sun have noticed a very marked increase of what some would call a watery look about him, which might perhaps be better expressed as a white sheen or glare, at times developing into solar halo or <b>mock</b> <b>suns,</b> as noted in your paper of the 2d of October last year. A fisherman would describe it as [...] "white and davery-like." [...] So far as my observation goes, this appearance was only absent here for a limited period during the present summer, when we had a week or two of nearly normal weather; the summer before it was seldom absent.|$|R
60|$|She had got {{deep into}} the pack, and was {{surrounded}} on all sides by large bergs, some of these being high, {{like the one that}} has just been described, others low and flat but of great extent. One, not far off, was two miles long, and its glittering walls rose about fifteen feet above the sea. The sky was brighter than usual at the time. This was owing to one of those strange appearances which one sees more of in the Arctic regions than in any other part of the world. The sun shone with unclouded splendour, and around it there were three <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> almost as bright as the sun itself, one on each side and one directly above it. Learned men call these bright spots parhelia. Sailors call them sun-dogs. They were connected together with a ring of light which entirely encircled the sun, but the lower edge of it was partly lost on the horizon.|$|R

5000|$|When Scheiner went to Rome in 1624, friends {{asked him}} to write about his solar observations. At last he had time for {{mathematical}} books, among them Galilei’s Il saggiatore, which contains Galileo's work on sunspots. This was similar to Scheiner's own work (unsurprisingly, since both were observing at the same time) but led to allegations from both of plagiarism by the other, and to a deep enmity between the two scientists.In 1629 and 1630, Scheiner observed a series of <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> (parhelia) and haloes, including a complex display on 24 January 1630. These were described in his book Parhelia, which had an profound influence {{on the work of}} Rene Descartes and later on Christian Huygens. His observations also included an eclipse on April 8, 1633. On June 22, 1633, Galilei received his sentence and had to renounce his claims, despite the protest sounding even from the Aristotelian side. Scheiner’s influence on the trial cannot be proven. The trial files merely contain a small note mentioning that he had opposed the Copernicans. At the time of the trial, Scheiner was still in Rome, staying at the seminary for future priests.|$|R

50|$|Otto Billig made {{an effort}} to provide a {{historical}} context for the apparition in his comments. He notes Nuremberg {{was one of the most}} prestigious cities of the late Middle Ages, a ‘Free and Imperial City’ known for its wealth and nobility. It tried to maintain a neutrality during the furious warring between Catholics and Protestants during the Reformation, but when one Protestant prince was rebuffed when he insisted on financial tributes to fund his battles, the city was besieged and its trade cut off. Though ultimately successful in defending itself, the rebuilding of fortifications in Nuremberg necessitated a new round of taxation and the city suffered hard times in its aftermath. On Good Friday, 1554 another siege happened and one broadsheet publisher described <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> that prognosticated God’s will wanted confession of sinful ways - i.e. the victims brought it on themselves. Another sky apparition followed in July of knights fighting each other with fiery swords, thus warning a coming Day of Judgment. Very similar apparitions of knights fighting in the skies were frequently reported during the Thirty Years' War. Many similar broadsheets of wondrous signs exist in German and Swiss archives and Nuremberg seems the focus of a number of them, presumably because of the hardships and conflicts of the ex-prosperous. Such conditions typically accentuate apocalyptic thought.|$|R
60|$|Early in {{the morning}} Adrian brought me the welcome {{intelligence}} that the wind had changed: it had been south-west; it was now north-east. The sky was stripped bare of clouds by the increasing gale, while the tide at its ebb seceded entirely from the town. The change of wind rather increased the fury of the sea, but it altered its late dusky hue to a bright green; {{and in spite of}} its unmitigated clamour, its more cheerful appearance instilled hope and pleasure. All day we watched the ranging of the mountainous waves, and towards sunset a desire to decypher the promise for the morrow at its setting, made us all gather with one accord {{on the edge of the}} cliff. When the mighty luminary approached within a few degrees of the tempest-tossed horizon, suddenly, a wonder! three other suns, alike burning and brilliant, rushed from various quarters of the heavens towards the great orb; they whirled round it. The glare of light was intense to our dazzled eyes; the sun itself seemed to join in the dance, while the sea burned like a furnace, like all Vesuvius a-light, with flowing lava beneath. The horses broke loose from their stalls in terror--a herd of cattle, panic struck, raced down to the brink of the cliff, and blinded by light, plunged down with frightful yells in the waves below. The time occupied by the apparition of these meteors was comparatively short; suddenly the three <b>mock</b> <b>suns</b> united in one, and plunged into the sea. A few seconds afterwards, a deafening watery sound came up with awful peal from the spot where they had disappeared.|$|R

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of the strong 14 -C variation around AD 775 as one (or several) solar super-flare(s) by, e. g., Usoskin et al. (2013) is based on alleged aurora sightings in the mid AD 770 s in Europe: A "red cross/crucifix" in AD 773 / 4 / 6 from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, "inflamed shields" in AD 776 (both listed in the aurora catalogue of Link 1962), and "riders on white horses" in AD 773 (newly proposed as aurora in Usoskin et al. 2013), the two latter from the Royal Frankish Annals. We discuss the reports about these three sightings in detail here. We can show that all three were halo displays: The "red cross" or "crucifix" is formed by the horizontal arc and a vertical pillar of light (either with the Sun during sunset or with the moon after sunset); the "inflamed shields" and the "riders on white horses" were both two <b>mock</b> <b>suns,</b> especially the latter narrated in form of a Christian adaptation of the antique dioscuri motive. While the latter event took place early in AD 774 (dated AD 773 in Usoskin et al. 2013), the two other sightings have to be dated AD 776, i. e. anyway too late for being {{in connection with a}} 14 -C rise that started before AD 775. We also sketch the ideological background of those sightings and there were many similar reports throughout that time. In addition, we present a small drawing of a lunar halo display with horizontal arc and vertical pillar forming a cross for shortly later, namely AD 806 June 4, the night of full moon, also from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; we also show historic drawings of solar and lunar halo crosses from G. Kirch and Helevius and a modern photograph. Comment: 17 pages with 6 figures Astronomical Notes in pres...|$|R
60|$|Obs. 10. When {{the beam}} of the Sun's Light was {{reflected}} back from the Speculum not directly to {{the hole in the}} Window, but to a place a little distant from it, the common center of that Spot, and of all the Rings of Colours fell in the middle way between {{the beam of}} the incident Light, and the beam of the reflected Light, and by consequence {{in the center of the}} spherical concavity of the Speculum, whenever the Chart on which the Rings of Colours fell was placed at that center. And as the beam of reflected Light by inclining the Speculum receded more and more from the beam of incident Light and from the common center of the colour'd Rings between them, those Rings grew bigger and bigger, and so also did the white round Spot, and new Rings of Colours emerged successively out of their common center, and the white Spot became a white Ring encompassing them; and the incident and reflected beams of Light always fell upon the opposite parts of this white Ring, illuminating its Perimeter like two <b>mock</b> <b>Suns</b> in the opposite parts of an Iris. So then the Diameter of this Ring, measured from the middle of its Light on one side to the middle of its Light on the other side, was always equal to the distance between the middle of the incident beam of Light, and the middle of the reflected beam measured at the Chart on which the Rings appeared: And the Rays which form'd this Ring were reflected by the Speculum in Angles equal to their Angles of Incidence, and by consequence to their Angles of Refraction at their entrance into the Glass, but yet their Angles of Reflexion were not in the same Planes with their Angles of Incidence.|$|R
50|$|In both Cardiff and Leeds Charles Whitmell {{played a}} leading role in the burgeoning {{scientific}} societies. In Cardiff he was an active member of the Chemical and Geological Societies and was a President of the Cardiff Naturalists' Society. Just before leaving Wales he was nominated as the President of the Astronomical Society of Wales.Upon taking up residence in Leeds he was elected President of the Leeds Geological Society and within a year was chosen unanimously as the President of Leeds Astronomical Society. He was also active at a national level, becoming an elected Council member (and later vice-President) of the British Astronomical Association (BAA), a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a member of the Société astronomique de France (Astronomical Society of France).Whitmell had a flair for mathematical analysis of curious and unusual scientific problems and it was this characteristic which dominated his published work. Such titles as 'The Maximum Possible Duration for a Total Solar Eclipse', the 'Transit of the Moon across the Earth's disc as seen from Mars', 'Saturn visible through the Cassini Division', and 'a Martian Sundial' became his 'stock in trade'. He also relished the observation and analysis of rare or extreme events such as the green flash at sunset, halos, rainbows and <b>mock</b> <b>suns.</b> He was a regular correspondent of the popular journal, the English Mechanic, wherein he provided detailed answers to a wide variety of queries on physics, astronomy and mathematics, posed by its readers. He also wrote hundreds of papers on astronomy for journals such as the Journal of the BAA, the Observatory Magazine, the Monthly Notices of the RAS, and the journals of the local scientific societies of which he was a member. For a time he was the editor of the Journal & Transactions of Leeds Astronomical Society and ensured that copies of the Journal were seen by amateur and professional astronomers around the world.|$|R

5000|$|From the {{earliest}} days of its history, the Gay Head Light appears as though it welcomed visiting public. Early photographs depict visitors populating the lighthouse balcony and its surrounding grounds. In 1856, after the installation of the famous Fresnel lens, tourism to the lighthouse increased. Special steamship excursions from the Oak Bluffs Wharf took tourists to the Steamboat Landing dock below the Gay Head Cliffs, where waiting oxcarts provided transport to the lighthouse. Circa 1857, Harper's Magazine published an account of a visit to the lighthouse and its powerful new lens by writer David Hunter Strother: [...] "At night we mounted the tower and visited the look-out gallery that belts the lighthouse at some distance below the lantern. Here we were surprised by a unique and splendid spectacle. The whole dome of heaven, from the centre to the horizon, was flecked with bars of misty light, revolving majestically on the axis of the tower. These luminous bars, although clearly defined, were transparent and we could distinctly see the clouds and stars behind them. Of all the heavenly phenomena that I have {{had the good fortune to}} witness — borealis lights, <b>mock</b> <b>suns,</b> or meteoric showers — I have never seen anything that in mystic splendor equaled this trick of the magic lantern at Gay Head."Public access was also documented by historian Edward Rowe Snow, who mentioned how Principal Keeper, Charles W. Vanderhoop, and his assistant, Max Attaquin, [...] "...probably took one-third of a million visitors to the top of Gay Head Light between 1910 and 1933." [...] After the Gay Head Light was electrified and automated in the mid-1950s - the lighthouse's Principal Keeper, Joseph Hindley, vacated the premises circa 1956, and the light was closed to public access. According to the United States Coast Guard aerial photograph (lower right), and other photographic documentation and research provided by Vineyard Environmental Research, Inst., the following structures were still standing in 1958: the three story Gambrel-style Keeper's house; a large barn; the square, brick, three-story WWII observation tower; a small, so-called guest house or utility building at the edge of the cliffs, and the WWII concrete bunker just below the guest house. Circa 1960, all buildings except the lighthouse and the concrete World War II bunker were razed. Since 1958, the WWII bunker has slowly slid down the face of the clay cliffs toward the beach at the bottom of the cliffs near the ocean, where it exists today in the ocean's intertidal zone at the base of the cliffs.|$|R
