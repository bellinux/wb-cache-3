5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists {{as an example of}} a hate crime against women, and by feminists and government officials as <b>misogynist</b> attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{literary}} critics see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, {{are the most}} powerful characters in the poem—Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar {{can be seen as}} symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's <b>misogynist</b> passage, in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of <b>misogynist</b> tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E

50|$|As part of Islamophobia, Muslims {{were reduced}} to caricatures of <b>misogynists</b> and oppressed women; violent men were thought as {{inclined}} to terrorism.

50|$|In 1900-1905 Spitteler {{wrote the}} {{powerful}} allegoric-epic poem, in iambic hexameters, Olympischer Frühling (Olympic Spring). This work, mixing fantastic, naturalistic, religions and mythological themes, deals with human concern towards the universe. His prose works include Die Mädchenfeinde (Two Little <b>Misogynists,</b> 1907), about his autobiographical childhood experiences, the dramatic Conrad der Leutnant (1898), {{in which he}} show influence from the previously opposed Naturalism, and the autobiographical novella Imago (1906), examining the role of unconscious in the conflict between a creative mind and the middle-class restrictions with internal monologue.|$|R

[...] The prominent journalist Martin Samuel also claimed that Greg Dyke and chair of the FA's inclusion advisory board Heather Rabbatts sent private texts of support to Scudamore, before publicly condemning him for political purposes. Karren Brady, West Ham's vice-chair, said she had known Scudamore for 20 years and he was [...] "categorically not sexist".|$|R
25|$|In 2012, President Biddy Martin began a community-wide {{review of}} the sexual {{misconduct}} and disciplinary policies at the College. This review was sparked by several factors, including a fraternity's T-shirt design that critics alleged was <b>misogynist</b> and allegations of inappropriate handling of a case of sexual assault in an essay by Angie Epifano published in The Amherst Student. In January 2013, a college committee published a report noting Amherst's rate of sexual assault as similar to other colleges and universities, and making recommendations to address the problem.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the film}} had several {{high-profile}} male filmmakers interested in directing, the producers {{opted for a}} female director, hoping to avoid public outcry regarding the depictions of violence against women. Despite signing Harron to the project, the film was mired in controversy before production began, {{due in large part}} to the legacy of the book's release. As Harron began production, the crew had to contend with threats of protest, as the issue of violence in the media became crystallized by the Columbine shootings. Campaigns against the film continued throughout production, the Feminist Majority Foundation condemning the film as <b>misogynist,</b> and the Canadians Concerned About Violence in Entertainment (C-CAVE) convincing restaurant owners to deny Harron permission to film in their establishments.|$|E
25|$|Black female {{artists such}} as Queen Latifah, Missy Elliott, and MC Lyte have made great strides since the hip hop {{industry}} first began. By producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. Though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchise black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. These artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. In this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a <b>misogynist</b> lens but with one that validates women's struggle.|$|E

25|$|Arguments favoring {{discrimination}} against women are explicit in the handbook. Those arguments are not novel but constitute a selection from the long tradition of Western <b>misogynist</b> writings. However, according to Brauner, they are combined to produce new meanings and result in a comprehensive theory. It mixes elements borrowed from Formicarius (1435), Preceptorium divinae legis (1475) and Lectiones super ecclesiastes (1380).Kramer and Sprenger develop a powerful gender-specific theory of witchcraft based on a hierarchical and dualistic view of the world. Everything exists in pairs of opposites: God and Satan, Mary and Eve, and men (or virgins) and women. Each positive principle in a pair is delineated by its negative pole. Perfection is defined not as the integration or preservation of opposites, but rather as the extermination of the negative element in a polar pair. Because women are the negative counterpart to men, they corrupt male perfection through witchcraft and must be destroyed.|$|E

50|$|McGuinness {{resigned}} as deputy First Minister in January 2017 amid the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, which involved a green energy scheme that Foster set up during her time as Minister for Enterprise and Investment.

McGuinness asked Foster to step aside as First Minister while her involvement in the scheme was investigated, but she refused to step aside or resign and claimed that the voices calling for her resignation were those of <b>misogynists</b> and male chauvinists. Under {{the terms of the}} Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement, the First and deputy First Ministers are equal and, therefore, Foster could not remain in her post as First Minister. McGuinness's resignation caused a snap election to be held.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, Shahla Sherkat founded Zanan (Women) magazine, which covered Iranian women's {{concerns}} and tested political boundaries with edgy reportage on reform politics, domestic abuse, and sex.

It systematically criticized the Islamic legal code and argued that gender equality is Islamic and religious literature had been misread and misappropriated by <b>misogynists.</b> Mehangiz Kar, Shahla Lahiji, and Shahla Sherkat, the editor of Zanan, lead the debate on women's rights and demanded reforms. On August 27, 2006, the One Million Signatures Iranian women's rights campaign was started. It aims to end legal discrimination against women in Iranian laws by collecting a million signatures. The campaign supporters include many Iranian women's rights activists, international activists, and Nobel laureates. The most important post-revolution feminist figures are Mehrangiz Kar, Azam Taleghani, Shahla Sherkat, Parvin Ardalan, Noushin Ahmadi khorasani, and Shadi Sadr.|$|R
