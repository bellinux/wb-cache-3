The first operation {{must make}} the set a group, and the second operation is associative and distributive {{with respect to the}} first operation. It {{may or may not be}} commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first—the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a <b>multiplicative</b> <b>inverse</b> (an element x such that ax = xa = 1), the ring is called a division ring. A field is defined as a commutative division ring.|$|E

Finding multiplicative inverses is an essential step in the RSA algorithm, which is widely used in electronic commerce; specifically, the equation determines the integer used to decrypt the message.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} fast {{algorithm}} for computing <b>multiplicative</b> <b>inverses</b> in GF(2 m) using normal bases. Normal bases have the following useful property: In {{the case that}} an element x in GF(2 m) is represented by normal bases, 2 k power operation of an element x in GF(2 m) {{can be carried out}} by k times cyclic shift of its vector representation. C. C. Wang et al. proposed an algorithm for computing <b>multiplicative</b> <b>inverses</b> using normal bases, which requires (m − 2) multiplications in GF(2 m) and (m − 1) cyclic shifts. The fast algorithm proposed in this paper also uses normal bases, and computes <b>multiplicative</b> <b>inverses</b> iterating multiplications in GF(2 m). It requires at most 2 [log 2 (m − 1) ] multiplications in GF(2 m) and (m − 1) cyclic shifts, which are much less than those required in the Wang's method. The same idea of the proposed fast algorithm is applicable to the general power operation in GF(2 m) and the computation of <b>multiplicative</b> <b>inverses</b> in GF(qm) (q = 2 n) ...|$|R
