5|$|The Yugoslav Navy {{deployed}} three tactical groups (TGs) named Kaštela, Vis and Ploče off {{the coast}} of central Dalmatia from its bases on the islands of Vis and Lastovo. The Kaštela TG was deployed to the sea off Split and north of the islands of Šolta and Brač. It consisted of Koni-class frigate VPBR-31 Split, Končar-class fast attack craft RTOP-401 Rade Končar and RTOP-403 Ramiz Sadiku, Osa-class <b>missile</b> <b>boat</b> RČ-306 Nikola Martinović, Shershen-class torpedo boats TČ-220 Crvena zvezda and TČ-224 Pionir II and two Mirna-class patrol boats, including PČ-176 Mukos. Kaštela TG may have also included an additional Osa-class <b>missile</b> <b>boat.</b> The Ploče TG, deployed to the sea between the mainland and Brač to the east of the Kaštela TG, consisted of three minesweepers: ML-143 Iž, ML-144 Olib and ML-153 Blitvenica. The Vis TG was deployed off the western tip of the island of Hvar. It consisted of a Kotor-class frigate VPBR-34 Pula commanded by Captain Ilija Brčić, one Končar-class fast attack craft, two Osa-missile boats and two Mirna-class patrol craft. The Yugoslav Navy fleet was under overall command of Rear Admiral Nikola Ercegović.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not envisage that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian <b>missile</b> <b>boat</b> led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E

Up until 1 November 2012, Israel however did not take official responsibility for his killing and government spokesman Moshe Fogel and aides to Barak {{declined to comment on}} the issue. According to the report, Barak, who was then a deputy military chief, coordinated the planning by the Mossad, as well as the army's intelligence branch, the air force, navy and the elite Sayeret Matkal commando unit. Mossad intelligence agents watched al-Wazir's home for months before the raid. The Washington Post reported on 21 April that the Israeli cabinet approved al-Wazir's assassination on 13 April and that it was coordinated between the Mossad and the IDF.|$|E

5000|$|The Battle of Latakia, {{between the}} Israeli and Syrian navies, {{took place on}} October 7, {{the second day of}} the war. Five Israeli <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> heading towards the Syrian port of Latakia, sank a Syrian torpedo boat and {{minesweeper}} before encountering five Syrian <b>missile</b> <b>boats.</b> The Israelis used electronic countermeasures and chaff to evade Syrian missiles, then sank all five Syrian <b>missile</b> <b>boats.</b> This revolutionary engagement, the first between <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> using surface-to-surface <b>missiles,</b> proved the potency of small, fast <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> equipped with advanced ECM packages. The battle also established the Israeli Navy, long derided as the [...] "black sheep" [...] of the Israeli military, as a formidable and effective force in its own right. The port of Latakia was the site of another engagement between October 10-11, when Israeli <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> fired into the port, targeting two Syrian <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> spotted maneuvering among merchant ships.

50|$|After losing 3 <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> {{during the}} first Battle of Latakia on October 7, 1973, the Syrian navy refused to engage the Israeli Navy in open battle at sea. Instead, it used its <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> on short forays from harbour mouths to launch missiles, relying on coastal {{batteries}} for defense. To provoke the <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> into open combat, commander of the Israeli Navy <b>missile</b> <b>boats</b> flotilla, Michael Barkai, was dispatched with 7 boats to launch a night attack on Syrian ports. Oil tanks at the ports were marked as secondary targets.|$|R

On 21 May 1999, prior to the commencement of the Kargil War, the Indian Air Force Air HQ assigned a Canberra PR57 aircraft on a photographic mission near the Line of Control, where it took a severe blow from a FIM-92 Stinger infrared homing missile on the starboard engine; the Canberra successfully returned to base using the other engine.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{around the}} islets were renewed in January 2017, {{in light of}} {{deterioration}} of Greco–Turkish relations following Greek refusal to extradite participants of the failed 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt to Turkey.

Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched on the night on [...] 8/9 December 1971.
