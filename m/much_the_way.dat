5|$|Drunken Angel {{is often}} {{considered}} the director's first major work. Although the script, {{like all of}} Kurosawa's occupation-era works, {{had to go through}} forced rewrites due to American censorship, Kurosawa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely. A grittily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster (yakuza) with tuberculosis, it was also the director's first film with Toshiro Mifune, who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one (Ikiru) of the director's next 16 films. While Mifune was not cast as the protagonist in Drunken Angel, his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character, the alcoholic doctor played by Takashi Shimura, who had already appeared in several Kurosawa movies. However, Kurosawa did not want to smother the young actor's immense vitality, and Mifune's rebellious character electrified audiences in <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that Marlon Brando's defiant stance would startle American film audiences a few years later. The film premiered in Tokyo in April 1948 to rave reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kinema Junpo critics poll as the best film of its year, the first of three Kurosawa movies to be so honored.|$|E

25|$|The Hammer {{films are}} a {{series in the}} loosest sense, since there is only tenuous {{continuity}} between the films after the first two (which are carefully connected). Starting with The Evil of Frankenstein, the films are standalone stories with occasional vague references to previous films, <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> the James Bond films form a series. In some of the films, the Baron is a kindly, even heroic figure, while in others he is ruthless and cruel and clearly the villain of the piece.|$|E

25|$|In the SOFAR channel, {{the speed}} of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher index, sound waves will refract towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets {{confined}} in the layer, <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> light can be confined in a sheet of glass or optical fiber. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.|$|E
25|$|Papier-mâché was {{introduced}} into Mexico around the 17th {{century as a}} way to make objects for churches with its use most developed in central Mexico. In Celaya, the creation of these figures became a trade <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> metalwork and pottery did, with the work dominated by certain families. Since this time, the technique has been used to make a wide variety of objects for both ritual, festival and decorative use, mostly by poorer indigenous and mestizo communities. The paper and cardboard used is mostly waste paper, such as old newspapers and boxes, with decorative elements, such as crepe paper being new. Most shapes are created with molds, then painted with acrylics.|$|E

Broccoli asked Wood to create a villain with metal teeth, Jaws, inspired by a brace-wearing henchman named Horror in Fleming's novel.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. You know when a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} {{begins with the}} {{introduction}} of two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica's classmates, and the death of PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus carrying six Neptune High students and a teacher plunges off a cliff, killing all but one passenger. Veronica, {{who was supposed to be}} on the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed and who is responsible. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Felix (a charge he denies). Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica's life returning to <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it had been before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the '09ers. However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. '09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive, and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook, the daughter of baseball legend Terrence Cook who is investigated for the bus accident. Veronica discovers that the town mayor, who years ago coached a little league baseball team, sexually molested several team members, including Cassidy [...] "Beaver" [...] Casablancas. In the finale, it is discovered that Beaver is responsible for the bus accident and Veronica's rape, as well as a plane crash that kills the mayor (Veronica's dad was supposed to be on the plane, so she thinks he is dead). Veronica confronts Beaver on the roof of the Neptune Grand hotel, where he tries to kill her. Logan saves her, but Beaver commits suicide by jumping off the roof.|$|E

[...] Matt Magill was called up from the minors to make a spot start on June 2 but he struggled.

[...] Cobb cautiously did not state {{how long it would take}} to train 100,000 people. He had no idea. In fact it took only a few years and by the 20th anniversary of the citizen training program over half a million people in Seattle and the surrounding suburbs had received training in CPR.|$|E
