5|$|Physical and {{chemical}} characterisations of heavy <b>metals</b> {{need to be}} treated with caution, as the <b>metals</b> involved are not always consistently defined. As well as being relatively dense, heavy <b>metals</b> tend to be less reactive than lighter <b>metals</b> and have much less soluble sulfides and hydroxides. While it is relatively easy to distinguish a heavy metal such as tungsten from a lighter metal such as sodium, a few heavy <b>metals,</b> such as zinc, mercury, and lead, have some of the characteristics of lighter <b>metals,</b> and, lighter <b>metals</b> such as beryllium, scandium, and titanium, have some of the characteristics of heavier <b>metals.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known metals—common <b>metals</b> such as iron, copper, and tin, {{and precious}} <b>metals</b> such as silver, gold, and platinum—are heavy <b>metals.</b> From 1809 onwards, light <b>metals,</b> such as magnesium, aluminium, and titanium, were discovered, {{as well as}} less well-known heavy <b>metals</b> including gallium, thallium, and hafnium.|$|E
5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} <b>metals</b> were formed. They {{believed}} that different <b>metals</b> could be produced by varying {{the quality and quantity}} of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) <b>metals</b> into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.|$|E

50|$|All of the touring {{groups that}} {{participate}} {{can be classified}} as hard rock, and most are considered <b>metal.</b> The bands represent {{a broad range of}} heavy <b>metal</b> and hardcore punk subgenres, including deathcore, metalcore, thrash <b>metal,</b> death <b>metal,</b> groove <b>metal,</b> power <b>metal,</b> progressive <b>metal,</b> alternative <b>metal,</b> nu <b>metal,</b> industrial <b>metal,</b> and more.|$|R
5|$|Aqueous Stannous Chloride {{is used by}} many {{precious}} <b>metals</b> refining hobbyists {{and professionals}} {{as an indicator of}} Gold and Platinum group <b>metals</b> in solutions.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy <b>metals</b> can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy <b>metals</b> are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw <b>metals.</b> Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group <b>metals</b> (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual <b>metals</b> in their pure forms. Compared to other <b>metals,</b> PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
5|$|Heavy <b>metals</b> are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy <b>metals</b> are mainly f-block elements {{and the more}} reactive of the d-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy <b>metals</b> are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block <b>metals</b> and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its solidification, the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen {{is highly}} soluble in many rare earth and {{transition}} <b>metals</b> and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous <b>metals.</b> Hydrogen solubility in <b>metals</b> {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high solubility is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many <b>metals,</b> complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|In biochemistry, heavy <b>metals</b> are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as class B and borderline <b>metals.</b> In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and borderline or ambivalent ions show either class A or B characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A <b>metals,</b> which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 <b>metals,</b> and the lanthanides and actinides. Class B <b>metals,</b> which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition <b>metals.</b> Borderline <b>metals</b> largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition <b>metals</b> (plus arsenic and antimony). The distinction between the class A <b>metals</b> and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to non-metallic properties, when going left to right in the rows. The <b>metals</b> are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali <b>metals,</b> through the less reactive alkaline earth <b>metals,</b> lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition <b>metals,</b> and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition <b>metals.</b> The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory <b>metals</b> and the noble <b>metals,</b> which are subsets (in this example) of the transition <b>metals,</b> are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5000|$|Epica {{performs}} {{a blend of}} symphonic <b>metal,</b> progressive <b>metal,</b> gothic <b>metal,</b> melodic death <b>metal,</b> thrash <b>metal,</b> symphonic black <b>metal</b> and, more rarely, folk <b>metal</b> and power <b>metal.</b> Their former guitarist Ad Sluijter having described the band as [...] "a bridge between power <b>metal</b> and gothic metal." [...] Vocalist Simone Simons has expressed a preference for the group to be described as symphonic <b>metal</b> though {{the founder of the}} group Mark Jansen notes that they do not mind being called gothic <b>metal.</b> Mark Jansen having described the band also as [...] "symphonic death metal" [...] and a bridge between death <b>metal</b> and symphonic <b>metal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kittie {{has been}} put under {{multiple}} genres of music, especially heavy <b>metal</b> genres. Kittie have been categorized as groove <b>metal,</b> nu <b>metal,</b> gothic <b>metal,</b> punk, screamo, alt-punk, heavy <b>metal,</b> extreme <b>metal,</b> thrash <b>metal,</b> hard rock, death <b>metal,</b> and alternative <b>metal.</b> Kittie has often used death <b>metal</b> and black <b>metal</b> vocals in their songs and often had clean singing in those songs as well. On the Spit album, Kittie used screaming, clean singing and rapping. Kittie began as a nu <b>metal</b> band but then abandoned the nu <b>metal</b> style. Kittie have been compared to bands such as Pantera, Slayer and Mudvayne.|$|R

5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} <b>metals</b> with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy <b>metals</b> such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray tubes. In electron microscopy, heavy <b>metals</b> such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy <b>metals</b> such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy <b>metals</b> are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E
5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with <b>metals</b> require varying conditions. Alkali <b>metals</b> cause {{explosions and}} alkaline earth <b>metals</b> display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other <b>metals</b> such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble <b>metals</b> require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Some common uses {{of heavy}} <b>metals</b> {{depend on the}} general {{characteristics}} of <b>metals</b> such as electrical conductivity and reflectivity or the general characteristics of heavy <b>metals</b> such as density, strength, and durability. Other uses depend {{on the characteristics of}} the specific element, such as their biological role as nutrients or poisons or some other specific atomic properties. Examples of such atomic properties include: partly filled d- or f- orbitals (in many of the transition, lanthanide, and actinide heavy <b>metals)</b> that enable the formation of coloured compounds; the capacity of most heavy metal ions (such as platinum, cerium or bismuth) to exist in different oxidation states and therefore act as catalysts; poorly overlapping 3d or 4f orbitals (in iron, cobalt, and nickel, or the lanthanide heavy <b>metals</b> from europium through thulium) that give rise to magnetic effects; and high atomic numbers and electron densities that underpin their nuclear science applications. Typical uses of heavy <b>metals</b> can be broadly grouped into the following six categories.|$|E

5|$|The Earth's {{crust is}} made of {{approximately}} 5% of heavy <b>metals</b> by weight, with iron comprising 95% of this quantity. Light <b>metals</b> (~20%) and nonmetals (~75%) make up the other 95% of the crust. Despite their overall scarcity, heavy <b>metals</b> can become concentrated in economically extractable quantities {{as a result of}} mountain building, erosion, or other geological processes.|$|E
5|$|The alkali <b>metals</b> are all shiny, soft, highly {{reactive}} <b>metals</b> at {{standard temperature}} and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge +1. They {{can all be}} cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen (and {{in the case of}} lithium, nitrogen). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the <b>metals.</b> In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali <b>metals</b> comprise the group 1 elements, excluding hydrogen (H), which is nominally a group 1 element but not normally considered to be an alkali metal as it rarely exhibits behaviour comparable to that of the alkali <b>metals.</b> All the alkali <b>metals</b> react with water, with the heavier alkali <b>metals</b> reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy <b>metals</b> {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy <b>metals,</b> including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy <b>metals</b> are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy <b>metals</b> such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E

25|$|Nu <b>metal</b> bands {{have been}} {{influenced}} by and have used elements of a variety of musical genres, including electronic music, funk, gothic rock, hardcore punk, punk rock, dance music, new wave, jazz, post-punk, symphonic rock and synth-pop. Nu <b>metal</b> bands also are influenced by and use elements of genres of heavy <b>metal</b> music such as death <b>metal,</b> rap <b>metal,</b> groove <b>metal,</b> funk <b>metal,</b> and thrash <b>metal.</b> Some nu <b>metal</b> bands, such as Static-X and Dope, made nu <b>metal</b> music with elements of industrial <b>metal.</b> In contrast with other heavy <b>metal</b> subgenres, nu <b>metal</b> tends to use the same structure of verses, choruses and bridges as those in pop music.|$|R

5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various <b>metals</b> {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many <b>metals</b> can suffer hydrogen embrittlement, and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth <b>metals</b> and transition <b>metals</b> and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous <b>metals.</b> Hydrogen solubility in <b>metals</b> is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of the <b>metals</b> itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided to yield workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process. The oxides (MO2) are reacted with coal and chlorine to form the chlorides (MCl4). The chlorides of the <b>metals</b> are then reacted with magnesium, yielding magnesium chloride and the <b>metals.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{rigorous}} {{definition of}} a nonmetal. They show more variability in their properties than <b>metals</b> do. The following {{are some of the}} chief characteristics of nonmetals. Physically, they largely exist as monatomic gases, with a few having more substantial (but still open-packed) diatomic or polyatomic forms, unlike <b>metals,</b> which are nearly all solid and close-packed; if solid, they generally have a submetallic or dull appearance and are brittle, as opposed to <b>metals,</b> which are lustrous, ductile or malleable; they usually have lower densities than metals; are poor conductors of heat and electricity when compared to metals; and have significantly lower melting points and boiling points than those of <b>metals</b> (with the exception of carbon). Chemically, the nonmetals have relatively high ionisation energy and high electronegativity; they usually exist as anions or oxyanions in aqueous solution; generally form ionic or interstitial compounds when mixed with <b>metals,</b> unlike <b>metals,</b> which form alloys; and have acidic oxides whereas the common oxides of the <b>metals</b> are basic.|$|E
50|$|Kittie {{has been}} {{categorized}} under multiple genres of rock music, especially heavy <b>metal</b> genres, including death <b>metal,</b> nu <b>metal,</b> and alternative <b>metal.</b> Originally a nu <b>metal</b> band, Kittie changed their style later, using elements of genres such as black <b>metal</b> and death <b>metal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Punk <b>metal</b> fuses {{elements}} of heavy <b>metal</b> music with punk rock. The fusion often involves extreme <b>metal</b> genres and hardcore punk. Styles of punk <b>metal</b> include crossover thrash, grindcore, crust punk, metalcore, mathcore, grunge, alternative <b>metal,</b> industrial <b>metal,</b> thrash <b>metal,</b> sludge <b>metal,</b> and subsequent fusions between those styles. Examples of punk <b>metal</b> bands include Suicidal Tendencies, Snot, Dirty Rotten Imbeciles (D.R.I.) and Corrosion of Conformity.|$|R
5|$|Korn are {{identified}} as the pioneers of nu <b>metal</b> music, a form of alternative <b>metal</b> music {{which began in the}} mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative <b>metal</b> and nu <b>metal</b> band, the band has also been labeled as heavy <b>metal,</b> grunge, hard rock, rap <b>metal,</b> funk <b>metal,</b> groove <b>metal</b> and industrial <b>metal.</b> Their debut album mixed <b>metal,</b> funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy <b>metal</b> themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu <b>metal</b> band in the world.|$|R
