40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a new {{theoretical}} model is developed {{to characterize the}} damage of the adhesive joint. Elastic modulus of adhesive joints is an important parameter to represent damage characteristics. Based {{on the fact that}} the thickness of the adhesive layer is very small, it is reasonable to believe that damage will decrease the tension modulus of the adhesive joint while the compression modulus will keep unchanged. Modeling the adhesive joint as an interface with different <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression, and applying integral transform method, we solve the associated nonlinear boundary problem to obtain the nonlinear ultrasonic waves transmitting through the adhesive layer.

This work deals with 2 -D micromechanical analysis of two component adobe masonry (i. e. composite system composed of adobe bricks and mortar joints), focusing {{on the influence of}} different bond configurations and loading schemes. Homogenization is applied by defining a periodic unit cell for each of the investigated bond schemes and by deriving global failure curves, based on failure criteria of both mortar and bricks. Experimental tests showed bi-modularity (i. e. different Young <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> compression and <b>tension)</b> for both mortar and bricks, so this feature of elastic behaviour was taken into account in micromodelling. The results are twofold: for each bond scheme, critical curves in the principal stress plane are derived for the homogenised unit cell, and the relationships between the homogenised elastic moduli and the loading angle is obtained. Micromechanical analysis provided a major difference between homogenised elastic behaviour <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and <b>in</b> compression.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assumption}} of equal tensile and compressive modulus {{necessary to determine}} single fiber axial compressive strength from the elastica loop test is relaxed by deriving a compressive strength equation based on {{the analysis of the}} flexural response of a fiber with different <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression. Previously determined tensile (E 1 t) and compressive (E 1 c) modulus values for different high performance organic fibers with varying degrees of lateral molecular interactions are used to determine fiber compressive strength. The importance of using the bi-moduli equation becomes evident in the case of fibers that lack strong intermolecular interactions, since calculations done with the original loop test equation can result in an overestimation of the compressive strength on the order of 80 %, as seen for the poly-(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) fiber PBO. Kink band angles measured from looped fiber specimens are documented and correlated to the calculated compressive strength values...|$|E

40|$|The {{fracture}} resistance of structures is optimised using the level-set method. Fracture resistance {{is assumed to}} be related to the elastic energy released by a crack propagating in a normal direction from parts of the boundary which are in tension, and is calculated using the virtual crack extension technique. The shape derivative of the fracture-resistance objective function is derived. Two illustrative twodimensional case studies are presented: a hole in a plate subjected to biaxial strain; and a bridge fixed at both ends subjected to a single load in which the compliance and {{fracture resistance}} are jointly optimised. The structures obtained have rounded corners and more material at places where they are in tension. Based on the results, we propose that fracture resistance may be modelled more easily but less directly by including a term proportional to surface area in the objective function, in conjunction with non-linear elasticity where the Young’s <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> is lower than in compression...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} stress model {{based on}} the principle of plasticity to predict the ultimate bending strength of solid timber beams was developed. The model is capable to predict the actual bending strength of timber beams better than the existing stress models. The two main controlling parameters of the model are the ultimate tensile and compressive strengths of the beam material. The proposed model was verified through a series of laboratory experiments using a local hardwood timber, Dark Red Meranti. A number of specimens consisting of 12 beams. 10 tension specimens and 15 compression specimens were tested. The ultimate bending moment from test results were compared against the proposed and existing stress models. A significant non-linear relationship exists between load and deformation of timber in both bending and compression, but the stress-strain relationship is linear <b>in</b> <b>tension.</b> The strain is distributed linearly across the beam section and the neutral axis tends to shift towards the tensional side when the beam is loaded beyond the proportional limit.

A large number of compression and three-point bending tests were carried out on cubic and prismatic specimens, respectively. The identification of significant scatter in experimental data sets due to handcrafted manufacturing motivated the estimation of mechanical parameters at different percentile levels, {{in order to provide}} their characteristic and median values.

The rich variety of phenomena intrinsic to composite interphase have warranted a great deal of experimental and theoretical investigations. From a practical viewpoint, control of processing conditions and thus the failure at the semicrystalline interphase {{is one of the most}} efficient approaches for optimizing the mechanical performance of thermoplastic composites. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of process cooling history under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions on micro- and macro-mechanical properties of carbon fibre-polyetheretherketone (PEEK) composites. The interface shear strength (IFSS) is characterized using both single-fibre fragmentation and pull-out tests. The variation of interphase stiffness and microstructure are evaluated based on the nanoindentation technology, scanning force microscopy (SFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The mechanical properties of the composite materials in terms of the Young's <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression load as well as the viscoelastic behavior in shear load were experimentally determined. Additionally, the electric properties like permittivity, specific conductivity and electric breakdown field strength were evaluated.

With a concentration of 20 vol. % barium titanate particles, an enhancement of the permittivity of 140 % and an increase of the actuation strain of about 100 % with respect to the unmodified material could be achieved. Furthermore, firs t multilayer actuators were manufactured with an automatic spin coating process and their permittivity and strain were measured.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis is principally concerned with the experimental and theoretical behaviour of polypropylene- and high <b>modulus</b> polyethylene-reinforced cements <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and <b>in</b> flexure. Polypropylene-reinforced cement has a proposed application as a thin sheet cladding material and developments in associated thin sheet fibre-reinforced cement technologies are discussed.

A comprehensive theoretical treatment is presented for the complete behaviour in loading-unloading-reloading <b>in</b> direct <b>tension</b> of a cement composite, reinforced by continuous, aligned fibres. The treatment is modified to account for the measured non-linear stress-strain behaviour exhibited by polyolefin fibres. A satisfactory comparison is drawn between theoretical and experimental results for residual strains, reloading moduli and energy absorption during an unloading/reloading cycle. It la argued that an existing approach for the prediction of the flexural load-deflection relationship of a fibre cement composite is inappropriate and an alternative 'crack development' approach is presented, which yields a more realistic comparison with experimental data from flexural tests on polyolefin-reinforced cement composites. The behaviour of specimens under cyclic flexural loading and in reversed flexure through zero is discussed. The theoretical developments are expected to be generally applicable to a range of fibre-reinforced brittle matrix composites...|$|R

The 20 standardized specimens used for the materials testing were machined from third-generation Sawbones femurs. The flexural properties of the specimens were determined using ASTM D 6272 - 02 and the tensile properties were obtained using ASTM D 638 - 02.

30|$|This study {{examined}} how boiling and drying treatments influenced various physical {{properties of the}} tension wood with gelatinous fibers (G-fibers) of a 29 -yearold Zelkova branch. By boiling treatment, tension wood with numerous G-fibers contracted considerably in the longitudinal direction and the longitudinal Young’s modulus decreased {{in spite of the}} water-saturated condition. The drying treatment caused green tension wood and boiled tension wood with numerous G-fibers to shrink longitudinally and increased their longitudinal Young’s moduli. These specific behaviors in tension wood were highly correlated with the proportion of G-fibers in a specimen and were probably caused by the microscopic behavior of cellulose microfibril (CMF) in the gelatinous layers (G-layers). The longitudinal shrinkage of tension wood due to drying suggests the existence of a hygro-sensible, noncrystalline region in the CMF, which is abundant in the G-layer. Furthermore, the noncrystalline region in the CMF softens during boiling treatment, resulting in the reduction of the longitudinal Young’s <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> wood. The longitudinal contraction of tension wood with G-fibers by boiling might be caused by the tensile growth stress remaining in green G-layers. However, no changes were detected in the 004 d-spacing of cellulose crystal in tension wood from the boiling and drying treatments, regardless of the proportion of G-fibers.|$|E

The specific properties of cork, e. g. low density, very low permeability to water, elastic properties and inertness have made it the best sealant for quality wine. Here we studied the relation between compression, tensile and bending stress in cork and the influence of structural characteristics of cork on its mechanical behaviour. The material was sampled from raw cork planks of good quality (class 1) and poor quality (class 4) collected at one industrial mill after post-harvest six-month air stabilization, water boiling and air drying as usually applied in cork industrial processing. The samples had densities ranging 0. 123 - 0. 203 g. cm- 3 and porosities between 0. 5 and 22. 0 %. There are differences between the type of stress and the corresponding direction of stress. For the same direction of stress, the Young <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> is higher then in bending and it is lowest in compression. The bending Young modulii were well correlated with the tensile Young modulii, because while in bending the sample is submitted to both tensile and compression stresses, the fracture occurs in the tensile zone. There {{were no significant differences in}} the mechanical properties of cork samples obtained from cork planks of different quality classes but the density is an important factor and samples with higher density showed overall larger resistance.

40|$|Plasterboard {{components}} {{are widely used}} in current buildings worldwide. Pl asterboards are employed for partitions, wall lining and ceilings. Plasterboards are used for both structural and nonstructural walls. Mechanical properties, e. g. modulus of elasticity or tensile/compressive strength, of plasterboards may assume {{a key role in}} the whole seismic performance of a building. Numerical models of building components which include plasterboard elements, such as internal partitions, require the definition of the mechanical properties of plasterboards. Despite their extensive use, th e lack of a comprehensive test campaign on plasterboards in the current literature is denoted. An extensive test campaign, consisting of 302 tests, is therefore performed aiming at evaluating compression and tension behavior of plasterboards. A set of fiv e plasterboard typologies is selected, considering different board thicknesses and both standard and high- density boards. Both tensile and compression tests are performed according to EN 789. The tests are performed in two different load directions, i. e. p arallel or transversal to the direction of production. Tensile strength of boards is systematically smaller than compressive strength, whereas elastic modulus values in compression and in tension are similar. Regression laws that can be employed to model b oth compression and tension behavior of plasterboards are defined for future implementations of the actual stress -strain relationships in different applications, e. g. FEM analysis of shear stud wall panels. A bilinear stress -strain envelope is adopted for tensile behavior, whereas a model typically used for concrete is selected for compression behavior. An orthotropic behavior is exhibited in case the boards are loaded in tension. The significant influence of board thickness on their mechanical properties i s also highlighted. T he most appropriate probability distribution function is estimated for several mechanical parameters and the corresponding data dispersion is evaluated. The uncertainty associated to each of the four selected parameters is therefore ev aluated considering the corresponding lognormal distribution functions. The dispersion of the data around the median value is significantly influenced by the considered mechanical parameter. In particular, elastic <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> is characterized by a l arge uncertainty, i. e. β values up to 0. 68. Both tensile and compressive strengths show small variability around the mean. Finally, the uncertainty is influenced neither by the direction of loading nor by the thickness of the boards.

The Theological parameters derived from compression, shearing and tension of frozen samples showed that the rheological behaviour of the tissue {{is directly related to the}} degree of structural damage. When tissue was frozen at 2 °C/min, the rheological parameters declined significantly within the range of - 6 to - 9 °C. Precooling caused a more linear increase in the tissue's mechanical strength, reducing the number of volumetric changes and the number of dog-bone-shaped specimens with static cracking. In this way it was possible to calculate a temperature coefficient for each rheological parameter giving the degree of loss through freezing. The highest coefficient was for apparent <b>modulus</b> of elasticity <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> (7. 87 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the sensitivity of the dynamic response of the Hanford double-shell tanks (DSTs) to the assumptions regarding the constitutive properties of the contained waste. In all cases, the waste was modeled as a uniform linearly elastic material. The focus of the study was on the changes in the modal response of the tank and waste system as the extensional modulus (elastic <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> and compression) and shear modulus of the waste were varied through six orders of magnitude. Time-history analyses were also performed for selected cases and peak horizontal reaction forces and axial stresses at the bottom of the primary tank were evaluated. Because the analysis focused on the differences in the responses between solid-filled and liquid-filled tanks, it is a comparative analysis rather than an analysis of record for a specific tank or set of tanks. The shear modulus was varied between 4 x 10 {sup 3 } Pa and 4. 135 x 10 {sup 9 } Pa. The lowest value of shear modulus was sufficient to simulate the modal response of a liquid-containing tank, while the higher values are several orders of magnitude greater than the upper limit of expected properties for tank contents. The range of elastic properties used was sufficient to show liquid-like response at the lower values, followed by a transition range of semi-solid-like response to a clearly identifiable solid-like response. It was assumed that the mechanical properties of the tank contents were spatially uniform. Because sludge-like materials are expected only to exist in the lower part of the tanks, this assumption leads to an exaggeration of the effects of sludge-like materials in the tanks. The results of the study show that up to a waste shear modulus of at least 40, 000 Pa, the modal properties of the tank and waste system are very nearly the same as for the equivalent liquid-containing tank. This suggests that the differences in critical tank responses between liquid-containing tanks and tanks containing sludge-like materials having a shear modulus not exceeding 40, 000 Pa are unlikely to be greater than those due to the uncertainties involved in the definition of the design ground motion or in the properties of the tank-waste system. This is the fundamental conclusion of the study. The study also shows that increasing the waste extensional modulus and shear modulus does not lead to increased mass participation at the impulsive frequency of the liquid-containing system. Instead, increasing the waste stiffness eventually leads to fundamental changes in the modal properties including an increase in the fundamental system frequency...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} level-set {{algorithm}} for topology optimisation and demonstrate its capabilities and advantages {{in a variety}} of settings. The algorithm uses discrete element densities so that interpolation schemes are avoided and the boundary of the design is always well defined. A review of the level-set method for topology optimisation, and a description of the mathematical concepts behind the level-set algorithm are given in the introductory chapters. A compact Matlab implementation of the algorithm provides explicit implementation details for the simple example of compliance minimisation with a volume constraint. The remainder of the thesis presents original results obtained using the level-set algorithm. As a new application, we use topology optimisation to maximise fracture resistance. Fracture resistance is assumed {{to be related to the}} elastic energy released by a crack propagating in a normal direction from parts of the boundary that are in tension. We develop a suitable fracture resistance objective functional, derive its shape derivative and apply the level-set algorithm to simple examples. Topology optimisation methods that involve intermediate density elements are not suitable to solve this problem because the boundary of the design is not well defined. Our results indicate that the algorithm correctly optimises for fracture resistance. As the method is computationally intensive, we suggest simpler objective functionals that could be used as a proxy for fracture resistance. For example, a perimeter penalty could be added to the compliance objective functional in conjunction with a non-linear elasticity law where the Young 2 ̆ 7 s <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> is lower than in compression. The level-set method has only recently been applied to fluid flow problems. We utilise the level-set algorithm to minimise energy dissipation in Stokes flows in both two and three dimensions. The discrete element densities allow the no-slip boundary condition to be applied directly. The Stokes equations therefore need only be solved in the fluid region of the design: this results in significant computational savings compared to conventional material distribution approaches. In order to quantify the computational savings the optimisation problems are resolved using an interpolation scheme to simulate the no-slip boundary condition. This significant advantage of the level-set method for fluid flow problems has not been noted by other authors. The algorithm produces results consistent with those obtained by other topology optimisation approaches, and solves large-scale three dimensional problems with modest computational cost. The first examples of three dimensional periodic microstructure design with the level-set method are presented in this thesis. The level-set algorithm is extended to deal with multiple constraints. This is needed so that materials can be designed with symmetry requirements imposed on their effective properties. To demonstrate the capabilities of the approach, unit cells are designed separately to maximise conductivity and bulk modulus with an isotropy requirement. The resulting materials have properties very close to the relevant Hashin-Shtrikman bounds. The algorithm is then applied to multifunctional material design: unit cells are designed to give isotropic materials that have maximum bulk modulus and maximum conductivity. Cross-property bounds indicate the near-optimality of the microstructures obtained. The design space of the problem is extensively explored with different coefficients of the conductivity and bulk modulus in the objective and different volume constraints. We hypothesise the existence of theoretically optimal single-scale microstructures with the topologies of the computationally optimised microstructures we have found. Structures derived from the Schwartz primitive (P) and diamond (D) minimal surfaces have previously been presented as good multifunctional composites. These structures are elastically anisotropic. Although they have similar conductivity, they have stiffness properties inferior to several of the isotropic optimised microstructures...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} the mechanical response of thermoset polymers under high compressive loads. The study {{is divided into}} two parts. The first part focuses on the behaviour of a powder coating when used in a clamping force joint and how the properties vary when the chemical and physical structure of the coating is changed. The second part discusses the fundamental understanding of the behaviour of thermoset polymers with small thickness-to-width ratio subjected to compressive stresses, the aim being to develop mathematical material models for viscoelastic materials under high compressive loads. In the first part polyester powder coatings were used with variations in molecular weight, number of functional groups of the resin, amount and type of filler and thickness of the coating. The coatings were subjected to conventional tests for coatings and polymers and also to specially designed tests developed to study the behaviour of powder coatings in clamping force joints. The high compressive loads in a clamping force joint put high demands on the relaxation and creep resistance of the coating and the study shows the importance of crosslink density, filler content, and also coating thickness in order to achieve the desired mechanical properties of a coating. A high reactivity of the resin, facilitating a high crosslink density and hence a high Tg, is the most important property of the coating. A film with high crosslink density shows increase in relaxation time and in apparent yield strength under compression, and also an increase in relaxation modulus and storage <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> at temperatures above Tg. Addition of fillers reduces the deformation during compression and tension, but also induces a lower strain at break and hence a more brittle coating. The reinforcing effect of the fillers is pronounced when increasing the crosslink density of the coating, especially in the compression tests. The effect is evident in compression even at low amounts of fillers, where the relaxation time and resistance to deformation are strongly increased. The combination of high crosslink density and addition of fillers is therefore desirable since fillers then can be used moderately in order to achieve a reinforcing effect in compression while minimising embrittlement. The study also showed that increased coating thickness will give rise to defects in the coating, especially voids and blisters due to evaporation of water formed during the curing of the polyester powder coating. These defects will give rise to stress concentrations and increased plastic deformations in the coating, impairing the properties of the clamping force joint. The results from relaxation tests in tension were used to create a micromechanical model. This model was used in finite element modelling to estimate the loss of clamping force in a screw joint and to correlate with the experimental results of the powder coatings. In {{the second part of the}} study a well-defined free radically cured vinyl ester resin was used and studied in six different geometries in order to determine the dependence of apparent mechanical properties on the particular size and shape of a sample when it is subjected to high compressive loads. Variation of the specimen thickness, boundary conditions and loading conditions reveals that the geometry of the sample has a significant effect on the mechanical performance of the polymer. The apparent modulus and the yield strength increase dramatically when the thickness-to-width ratio of the sample is reduced, whereas they decrease when the friction between the sample and the compression plate is reduced. The creep strain rate decreases when the thickness of the material is reduced and it decreases even more when the amount of material surrounding the compressed part of the sample is increased. Creep and strain recovery tests on large specimens were used to develop a mathematical model including non-linear viscoelastic and viscoplastic response of a thermoset vinyl ester. The model was used in FEM calculations where the experimental results were compared with the calculated results in order to model the trends of the material response when varying the sample geometry.

40|$|Full depth {{reclamation}} (FDR) is {{a flexible}} pavement recycling technique {{that has not}} been explored in the state of Arkansas. FDR is unique in that it incorporates the entire flexible pavement section as well as a predetermined portion of the underlying base and sub-base materials with a stabilizer to create a new, stronger stabilized base course. Common stabilization techniques include the addition of asphalt emulsion, asphalt foam, or cement. Using the North Carolina emulsion FDR mix design, the Wirtgen foam FDR mix design, and the Portland Cement Association cement FDR mix design, field materials from four Arkansas highways in the Fayetteville Shale and Brown Dense Shale areas were gathered and used to produced laboratory stabilized FDR samples to determine the potential future use of these mix designs in Arkansas. Initial testing to determine mix properties were performed, which included determination of gradation, Atterberg limits, and sand equivalency testing. Optimal stabilizer contents were determined using the indirect tensile strength test for asphalt emulsion and asphalt foam stabilization and the unconfined compressive strength test was used for the cement stabilized samples. Once the mix designs were validated and optimal contents were determined, performance testing began on new samples produced at optimal stabilization contents from two of the highways to determine material characteristics and to determine if the performance tests are valid for use with FDR materials. For the asphalt emulsion and asphalt foam samples, performance testing included dynamic <b>modulus</b> <b>in</b> indirect <b>tension</b> mode, creep compliance, semi-circular bend, and indirect tensile strength. The cement stabilized samples were tested using the tube suction test and the semi-circular bend test. Results indicated dynamic modulus is a viable testing indicator for rutting and low temperature cracking, while creep compliance may not be suitable for FDR materials. The semi-circular bend test indicated that it is a testing option when using asphalt stabilized materials but another option may be needed for cement stabilization. The indirect tensile strength and tube suction tests are quantifiable moisture susceptibility tests that worked well with the FDR materials...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the effect of multiwall carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) without and with chemical functionalization on the mechanical properties of Bisphenol E cyanate ester resin (BECy) based carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminated composites. BECy with its low viscosity, low moisture uptake and superior mechanical properties is selected for its application in CFRP laminates through the cost-effective Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Moulding (VARTM) process. However, unlike CNT–epoxy–CFRP composites, processing and performance issues such as dispersion of CNTs, chemical bonding with resin, functionalization effects, effects on mechanical properties, etc. for BECy–CNT– CFRP composite system are not well reported. The objective {{of this study is to}} improve the mechanical properties of BECy resin with small additions of CNTs and functionalized CNTs in CFRP laminates. CNTs and fCNTs are infused into BECy using ultrasonication and standard mixing methods. Improvements <b>in</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> and strength <b>in</b> <b>tension,</b> compression, shear, flexure and interlaminar shear strength are analysed. It is observed that addition of 0. 5 wt % CNTs effected for maximum mechanical properties of the resin and 1 wt % CNTs for the mechanical properties of CNT–CFRP nanocomposite. Further, improvements obtained with fCNTs are marginal. Dispersion behaviour and effect of CNTs/ fCNTs in load transfer corroborated with SEM pictures are presented. The enhanced mechanical properties realized in VARTM processing of BECy-CFRP laminate indicate clear advantage of CNT based modification of the process...|$|R
40|$|Material {{and bond}} {{properties}} of frost-damaged concrete were studied experimentally. Tests {{were performed on}} a reference concrete of grade C 35 / 45 and frost-damaged concrete of two damage levels I and II, corresponding to 25 and 50 % reduction in compressive strength caused by freeze-thaw cycles. The level of frost damage was monitored and quantified by ultrasonic measurements, fundamental frequency test and number of freeze-thaw cycles. It was observed that the results from ultrasonic measurements on frost-damaged concrete were more stable and reliable compared to the results from fundamental frequency test; therefore, ultrasonic measurements together with number of freeze-thaw cycles were the basis for frost damage quantification in this study. The behavior of frost-damaged concrete was evaluated in compression by compression and elastic <b>modulus</b> tests, and <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> by splitting tensile and wedge splitting tests. The effect of frost on bond properties between concrete and reinforcement was assessed using pull-out test. Finally, {{the resistance of the}} reference concrete to freeze-thaw attack was evaluated using frost resistance test. The test results showed significant influence of freeze-thaw cycles not only on the compressive strength but, to a larger extent, on the modulus of elasticity and the compressive strain at peak stress. Thus, the shape of the stress-strain curve of frost-damaged concrete in compression was influenced. Regarding the behavior <b>in</b> <b>tension,</b> reduced tensile strength and increased fracture energy were measured. The latter can be explained as the effect of several micro-cracks introduced to concrete due to freeze-thaw cycles prior to mechanical loading. Therefore, the fracture energy measured included not only opening of one crack, but several micro-cracks. This explains the higher dissipated energy. Pull-out tests also showed significant effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the bond capacity of frost-damaged concrete. However, the slip at maximum bond was not considerably influenced by frost...|$|R
