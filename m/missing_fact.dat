It concerns {{the effect of}} technological change on the distributive dynamics of a private property, free market economy. Technological change, Kelso concluded, makes tools, machines, structures and processes ever more productive while leaving human productivity largely unchanged. The result is that primary distribution through the free market economy (whose distributive principle is [...] "to each according to his production") delivers progressively more market-sourced income to capital owners and progressively less to workers who make their contributions through labor.|$|E
40|$|Path queries on a {{knowledge}} graph {{can be used}} to answer compositional questions such as "What languages are spoken by people living in Lisbon?". However, knowledge graphs often have <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> (edges) which disrupts path queries. Recent models for knowledge base completion impute <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> by embedding knowledge graphs in vector spaces. We show that these models can be recursively applied to answer path queries, but that they suffer from cascading errors. This motivates a new "compositional" training objective, which dramatically improves all models' ability to answer path queries, in some cases more than doubling accuracy. On a standard knowledge base completion task, we also demonstrate that compositional training acts as a novel form of structural regularization, reliably improving performance across all base models (reducing errors by up to 43 %) and achieving new state-of-the-art results.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} {{knowledge}} base completion, {{the task of}} recovering <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> based on observed facts, demonstrate the importance of learning embeddings from multi-step relations. Due {{to the size of}} knowledge bases, previous works manually design relation paths of observed triplets in symbolic space (e. g. random walk) to learn multi-step relations during training. However, these approaches suffer some limitations as most paths are not informative, and it is prohibitively expensive to consider all possible paths. To address the limitations, we propose learning to traverse in vector space directly without the need of symbolic space guidance. To remember the connections between related observed triplets and be able to adaptively change relation paths in vector space, we propose Implicit ReasoNets (IRNs), that is composed of a global memory and a controller module to learn multi-step relation paths in vector space and infer <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> jointly without any human-designed procedure. Without using any axillary information, our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on popular knowledge base completion benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge base (KB) {{completion}} aims {{to infer}} missing facts from existing ones in a KB. Among various approaches, path ranking (PR) algorithms have received increasing attention in recent years. PR algorithms enumerate paths between entity pairs in a KB and use those paths as features to train {{a model for}} <b>missing</b> <b>fact</b> prediction. Due to their good performances and high model interpretability, several methods have been proposed. However, most existing methods suffer from scalability (high RAM consumption) and feature explosion (trains on an exponentially large number of features) problems. This paper proposes a Context-aware Path Ranking (C-PR) algorithm to solve these problems by introducing a selective path exploration strategy. C-PR learns global semantics of entities in the KB using word embedding and leverages the knowledge of entity semantics to enumerate contextually relevant paths using bidirectional random walk. Experimental results on three large KBs show that the path features (fewer in number) discovered by C-PR not only improve predictive performance but also are more interpretable than existing baselines...|$|E

We found that AMIE+ reports rules with high support but not necessarily meaningful, while OGFCs capture more meaningful context (see Exp- 3). Both models have relatively high recall but low precision; due to that, they {{have a better chance}} to cover <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> but may introduce errors when hitting false facts.|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{uncertainty}} management scheme in rule-based systems for {{decision making in}} the domain of urban infrastructure. Our aim is to help end users make informed decisions. Human reasoning is prone to a certain degree of uncertainty but domain experts frequently find it difficult to quantify this precisely, and thus prefer to use qualitative (rather than quantitative) confidence levels to support their reasoning. Secondly, there is uncertainty in data when it is not currently available (missing). In order to incorporate human-like reasoning within rule-based systems we use qualitative confidence levels chosen by domain experts in urban infrastructure. We introduce a mechanism for the representation of confidence of input facts and inference rules, and for the computation of confidence in the inferred facts. We also present a mechanism for computing inferences in the presence of <b>missing</b> <b>facts,</b> and their effect on the confidence of inferred facts...|$|R
40|$|Type {{inference}} for Hindley/Milner and variants is {{well understood}} as a constraint solving problem. Recent extensions to Hindley/Milner such as generalized algebraic data types (GADTs) force us to go beyond this approach to inference. In this paper we show how to perform type inference for GADTs using Herbrand constraint abduction, a solving method to infer <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> in terms of Herbrand constraints, i. e. conjunctions of type equations. But typeinference for GADTs is very hard, we {{are the first to}} give example programs with an infinite number of maximal types. We propose to rule out several kinds of ``non-intuitive'' solutions and show that we can construct in this way a complete and decidable type inference approach for GADTs and sketch how to support type error diagnosis.

40|$|Probabilistic {{databases}} (PDBs) {{are usually}} incomplete, e. g., containing only {{the facts that}} have been extracted from the Web with high confidence.

Recently, open-world probabilistic databases (OpenPDBs) were proposed {{to address this issue}} by allowing probabilities of unknown facts to take any value from a fixed probability interval. In this paper, we extend OpenPDBs by Datalog± ontologies, under which both upper and lower probabilities of queries become even more informative, enabling us to distinguish queries that were indistinguishable before. We show that the dichotomy between P and PP in (Open) PDBs can be lifted to the case of first-order rewritable positive programs (without negative constraints); and that the problem can become NPPP-complete, once negative constraints are allowed. We also propose an approximating semantics that circumvents the increase in complexity caused by negative constraints...|$|R

30|$|Overview of results. We {{find the}} following. (1) It is {{feasible}} to discover OGFCs in large graphs (Exp- 1). For example, it takes 211 seconds for OGFC_stream to discover OGFCs over YAGO with 4 million edges and 3000 training facts. On average, it outperforms AMIE+ by 3.4 times. (2) OGFCs {{can improve the}} accuracy of fact checking models (Exp- 2). For example, it achieves additional 30 %, 20 %, and 5 % gain of precision over DBpedia, and 20 %, 15 %, and 16 % gain of F_ 1 score over Wikidata when compared with AMIE+, PRA, and KGMiner, respectively. (3) The ontological closeness osim and threshold β enable trade-offs between discovering cost and effectiveness. With smaller threshold β, while OGFC_stream takes more time to discover OGFCs, these rules can cover more training instances and verify more <b>missing</b> <b>facts</b> that {{are not covered by}} their counterparts induced by larger β. (4) Our case study shows that OFact yields interpretable models (Exp- 3).|$|R

Despite the great effort invested in their creation and maintenance, even the largest (e. g., Yago, DBPedia or Wikidata) remain incomplete.

R-GCNs are related to a recent class of neural networks operating on graphs, and are developed specifically to deal with the highly multi-relational data characteristic of realistic knowledge bases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of R-GCNs as a stand-alone model for entity classification. We further show that factorization models for link prediction such as DistMult can be significantly improved by enriching them with an encoder model to accumulate evidence over multiple inference steps in the relational graph, demonstrating a large improvement of 29. 8 % on FB 15 k- 237 over a decoder-only baseline...|$|R
