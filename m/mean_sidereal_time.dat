50|$|Apparent {{sidereal time}} (local or at Greenwich) differs from <b>mean</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (for the same {{locality}} and moment) by {{the equation of}} the equinoxes: {{this is a small}} difference in right ascension (dRA) parallel to the equator, not exceeding about ±1.2 s, due to nutation, the complex 'nodding' motion of Earth's polar axis of rotation. It corresponds to the current amount of the nutation in (ecliptic) longitude (dψ) and to the current obliquity (ε) of the ecliptic, so that dRA = dψ cos ε.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is {{time by the}} stars. A sidereal {{rotation}} is {{the time}} it takes the Earth to make one revolution with respect to the stars, approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. For accurate astronomical work on land, it was usual to observe <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> rather than solar time to measure mean solar time, because the observations of 'fixed' stars could be measured and reduced more accurately than observations of the Sun (in spite of the need to make various small compensations, for refraction, aberration, precession, nutation and proper motion). It is well known that observations of the Sun pose substantial obstacles to the achievement of accuracy in measurement. In former times, before the distribution of accurate time signals, {{it was part of the}} routine work at any observatory to observe the <b>sidereal</b> <b>times</b> of meridian transit of selected 'clock stars' (of well-known position and movement), and to use these to correct observatory clocks running local <b>mean</b> <b>sidereal</b> time; but nowadays local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is usually generated by computer, based on time signals.|$|R
50|$|The {{first modern}} {{documented}} astrarium clock {{was completed in}} 1364 by Giovanni de' Dondi (1318-1388), a scholar and physician of the Middle Ages interested in astronomy and horology. The original clock, consisting of 107 wheels and pinions, has been lost, perhaps during the sacking of Mantua in 1630, but de' Dondi left detailed descriptions which have survived, enabling a reconstruction of the clock. It displays the <b>mean</b> <b>time,</b> <b>sidereal,</b> (or star), <b>time</b> and the motions of the sun, moon and the five then-known planets Venus, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter. It was conceived according to a Ptolemaic conception of the solar system. De' Dondi was inspired by his father Jacopo who designed the astronomical clock in the Piazzi dei Signori, Padua, in 1344 - {{one of the first}} of its type.|$|R
50|$|Local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> at any {{locality}} {{differs from}} the Greenwich <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> value of the same moment, by an amount that {{is proportional to the}} longitude of the locality. When one moves eastward 15° in longitude, <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> is larger by one sidereal hour (note that it wraps around at 24 hours). Unlike the reckoning of local solar time in time zones, incrementing by (usually) one hour, differences in local <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> are reckoned based on actual measured longitude, to the accuracy of the measurement of the longitude, not just in whole hours.|$|R
5000|$|Here GMST = GAST − eqeq, is the Greenwich <b>mean</b> <b>sidereal</b> <b>time</b> (the angle {{between the}} mean vernal equinox {{and the mean}} Sun in {{the plane of the}} equator). Therefore, GMST is an {{approximation}} to GAST (and [...] is an approximation to EOT); eqeq is called the equation of the equinoxes and is due to the wobbling, or nutation of the Earth's axis of rotation about its precessional motion. Since the amplitude of the nutational motion is only about 1.2 s (18″ of longitude) the difference between EOT and [...] can be ignored unless one is interested in subsecond accuracy.|$|E
5000|$|UT1 is the {{principal}} form of Universal Time. While conceptually it is mean solar time at 0° longitude, precise measurements of the Sun are difficult. Hence, it is computed from observations of distant quasars using long baseline interferometry, laser ranging of the Moon and artificial satellites, {{as well as the}} determination of GPS satellite orbits. UT1 is the same everywhere on Earth, and is proportional to the rotation angle of the Earth with respect to distant quasars, specifically, the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF), neglecting some small adjustments. The observations allow the determination of a measure of the Earth's angle with respect to the ICRF, called the Earth Rotation Angle (ERA, which serves as a modern replacement for Greenwich <b>Mean</b> <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time).</b> UT1 is required to follow the relationship ...|$|E

Eclipsing binary star systems consist of two stars orbiting a common center of mass and oriented so that their plane of orbit is {{in the line of}} sight relative to the observer allowing the stars to eclipse each other. Consistent monitoring of eclipsing binary stars is important for establishing fundamental astronomical parameters, for instance mass and composition of stellar systems, and this application supports effective use of resources in such monitoring programs.

A single multiparameter fit {{has been applied}} to the observed values of delay and delay rate to extract astrometric and geophysical parameters from this decade-long sequence.

40|$|The {{precession}} and nutation of the Earth's equator {{arise from}} solar, lunar, and planetary torques on the oblate Earth. The mean lunar orbit plane is nearly coincident with the ecliptic plane. A small tilt {{out of the}} ecliptic is caused by planetary perturbations and the Earth's gravitational harmonic J(sub 2). These planetary perturbations on the lunar orbit result in torques on the oblate Earth which contribute to precession, obliquity rate, and nutation while the J(sub 2) perturbations contribute to precession and nutation. Small additional contributions to the secular rates arise from tidal effects and planetary torques on the Earth's bulge. The total correction to the obliquity rate is - 0. 024 sec/century, it is an observable motion in space (the much larger conventional obliquity rate is wholly from {{the motion of the}} ecliptic, not the equator), and it is not present in the IAU-adopted expressions for the orientation of the Earth's equator. The effects have generally been allowed for in past nutation theories and some precession theories. For the planetary effect, the contributions to the 18. 6 yr nutation are - 0. 03 mas (milliarcseconds) for the in-phase Delta(psi) plus out-of-phase contributions of 0. 14 mas in Delta(psi) and - 0. 03 mas in Delta(sub epsilon). The latter terms demonstrate that out-of-phase contributions can arise by means other than dissipation. The sum of the contributions to the precession rate is considered and the inferred value of the moment of inertia combination (C-A) /C, which is used to scale the coefficients in the nutation series, is evaluated. Using an updated value for the precession rate, the rigid body (C-A) /C = 0. 003 273 763 4 which, in combination with a satellite-derived J(sub 2), gives a normalized polar moment of inertia C/MR(exp 2) = 0. 330 700 7. The planetary contributions to the precession and obliquity rates are not constant for long times causing accelerations in both quantities. Acceleration in precession also arises from tides and changing J(sub 2) Contributions from the improved theory, masses, ecliptic motion, and measured values of the precession rate and obliquity are combined to give expressions (polynomials in time) for precession, obliquity, and Greenwich <b>Mean</b> <b>Sidereal</b> <b>Time...</b>|$|E

The angular momentum lost by the Earth due to friction induced by the Moons tidal effect is transferred to the Moon, increasing its angular momentum, which means that its moment arm (its distance from the Earth) is increased (for the time being about +3.8 cm/year), which via Keplers laws of planetary motion causes the Moon to revolve around the Earth at a slower rate.

Astronomy, time based upon the rotation of the earth with respect to the distant stars, the sidereal day being the unit of measurement. Traditionally, the sidereal day is described as the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation relative to the stars, and help astronomers to keep them telescops directions on a given star in a night sky. In other words, earth’s rate of rotation determine according to fixed stars which is controlling the <b>time</b> scale of <b>sidereal</b> <b>time.</b> Many reserachers are concerned about how long the earth takes to spin based on fixed stars since the earth does not actually spin around 360 degrees in one solar day.
