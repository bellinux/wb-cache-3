Using the Multi-Component Approach (MCA) [14, 16, 17], the initial problem is firstly split into a system of Radiative Transfer Equations (RTEs), admitting a clearer physical interpretation in terms of forward and diffuse components. The Small Angle Approximation (SAA) is then used to simplify the equations [14, 18]. The SAA can be applied whenever the scattering probability strongly favors forward <b>scattering</b> <b>events</b> at small angles, that is, the phase function is strongly peaked in the forward direction. This condition is generally met by natural waters—such as seawater—where the angular deviation of light rays from their initial directions after a <b>scattering</b> <b>event</b> is usually very small and directed forwards. Finally, the Small Angle Diffusion Approximation (SADA) is applied [14, 17]. This enables a further simplification of the mathematical problem, which can then be explicitly solved.
