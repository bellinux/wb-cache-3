5|$|In October 1908, the Artillery Committee met to {{make its}} {{recommendations}} to the Junta Superior. The Committee concluded the SECN and Schneider proposals were superior to the Ansaldo version, but neither had a marked advantage over the other. The following month, the Naval Construction Committee met to evaluate the proposals. It recommended the SECN design first, followed by Schneider, with Ansaldo last. The Office of the Navy Controller also evaluated the proposals in November, and advised the Junta Superior that only the SECN bid met the design requirements without any legal, administrative, or cost problems. In February 1909, the Navy requested a revised design from SECN to incorporate several alterations, including an increased freeboard to improve seakeeping, an increased height and length of the main belt armor, {{and the addition of}} individual rangefinders for each gun turret. SECN agreed to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> on 20 March, and the company received the contract on 14 April. Due to the constraints imposed by the Spanish economy, the resulting design produced the smallest dreadnought-type battleships ever built. They were also obsolescent before completion due to rapid technological changemost significantly the rise of the superdreadnought battleshipsand lengthy delays in completion of the later units of the class.|$|E

Vornado received permission from the Landmarks Preservation Commission to modify the building to create a space to accommodate two new stores on Fifth Avenue; the project called for cutting new doorways into the facade, rotating the escalators to move them {{farther away from the}} windows, and reducing the vault wall. Vornado hired the original architects, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes.</b> Tenants in the building at the time included Bloomberg L.P., the company of New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, {{as part of}} a {{renovation}} of the Museum of the Chinese Revolution, officials wanted to exhibit Dong's painting again, but they decreed that Lin Boqu, whose white-haired figure was furthest left, must be removed. [...] This was because the Gang of Four, then in control of China, blamed Lin Boqu (who had died in 1960) for opposing the marriage, in the revolutionary days, of Mao with Jiang Qing (one of the Four). [...] Sources differ on what took place regarding the painting: Chang-Tai Hung related that Dong, terminally ill with cancer, could not <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes,</b> so his student Jin Shangyi and another artist, Zhao Yu, were assigned to do the work. [...] The two feared damaging the original canvas, so made an exact replica but for the required changes, with Dong brought forth from his hospital for consultations. [...] According to Andrews, Jin and Zhao created the new version because Dong would not let anyone else alter his painting. [...] Jin later stated that the painting, while effective politically, also shows Dong's inner world.|$|E
500|$|Attorney Manuel Genaro Villota, {{representative}} of the conservative Spanish, said that the city of Buenos Aires {{had no right to}} make unilateral decisions about the legitimacy of the Viceroy or the Council of Regency without the participation of other cities of the Viceroyalty. He argued that such an action would break the unity of the country and establish as many sovereignties as there were cities. His intention was to keep Cisneros in power by delaying any possible action. Juan José Paso accepted his first point, but argued that the situation in Europe and the possibility that Napoleon's forces could conquer the American colonies demanded an urgent resolution. He then expounded the [...] "argument of the elder sister", reasoning that Buenos Aires should take the initiative and <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> deemed necessary and appropriate, on the express condition that the other cities would be invited to comment as soon as possible. The rhetorical device of the [...] "elder sister", comparable to negotiorum gestio, makes an analogy between the relationship of Buenos Aires and other cities of the viceroyalty with a sibling relationship.|$|E

500|$|The {{reform of}} the spoils system of {{political}} patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant Presidency. Grant and all reformed agreed that the prevailing system of appointments was unsound, for it maximized party advantage and minimized efficiency and the nonpartisan interest of good government. Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure. Grant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first United States Civil Service Commission. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. [...] Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December, 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. Chester A. Arthur who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions. [...] However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether patronage, meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labelled corruption.|$|E

Yet some artists are pushing the boundaries of digital image editing to create extremely time-intensive compositions that rival the demands of the traditional arts.

An early proposal would have erected a wall between the workshop where exhibits were being developed and the main visitor areas. [...] Instead, Oppenheimer insisted that the workshop be placed without a wall, right next to the main entrance so that visitors could experience [...] "the way a shop smells when you burn the wood in a saw, or smell the oil from a lathe". Above the workshop was a sign, made by the wife of George Gamow, a physicist, educator, and friend of Oppenheimer who had died just a year before the opening of the Exploratorium. The inscription said [...] "Here Is Being Created the Exploratorium a Community Museum Dedicated to Awareness". [...] (Today, a copy of this motto is inscribed above the main entrance to the new Exploratorium at Pier 15.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack on}} the Jesuits was opened on April 17, 1762, by the Jansenist sympathizer the Abbé Chauvelin, who denounced the Constitution of the Society of Jesus, which was {{publicly}} examined and discussed in a hostile press. The Parlement issued its Extraits des assertions assembled from passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, {{in which they were}} alleged to teach every sort of immorality and error. On August 6, 1762, the final arrêt was proposed to the Parlement by the Advocate General Joly de Fleury, condemning the Society to extinction, but the king's intervention brought eight months' delay and in the meantime a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the French Jesuits would separate from the Society headed by the Jesuit General directly under the pope's authority and come under a French vicar, with French customs, as with the Gallican Church, the Crown would still protect them. The French Jesuits, rejecting Gallicanism, refused to consent. On April 1, 1763, the colleges were closed, and by a further arrêt of March 9, 1764, the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment. At the end of November 1764, the king signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions, for they were still protected by some provincial parlements, as in Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Artois. In the draft of the edict, he canceled numerous clauses that implied that the Society was guilty, and writing to Choiseul he concluded: [...] "If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, you must <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> I propose, or I will do nothing.
