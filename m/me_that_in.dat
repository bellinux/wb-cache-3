5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at the disposal of the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E

No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E

Of this Kelly comments: [...] "If someone had said to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> three years' time she'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers, I wouldn't have believed it [...] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character, but she's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1994, {{two years}} after the {{publication}} of PIHKAL, the DEA raided his lab. The agency requested that Shulgin turn over his license for violating the license's terms, and he was fined $25,000 for possession of anonymous samples sent to him for quality testing. In the 15 years preceding the publication of PIHKAL, two announced and scheduled reviews failed to find any irregularities. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated that, [...] "It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs.

500|$|Shōshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki {{joined her}} court. According to Arthur Waley, Shōshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living {{arrangements}} were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace. She gathered around her talented women {{writers such as}} Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon—the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes. The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: [...] "Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; {{but there is something}} not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed {{it does not seem to}} <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> herself she is really a poet at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Evidence of the {{overlapping}} subject matter between the shows, {{as well as}} the conflict between them, arose when Aaron Sorkin, the creator of Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, asked Lorne Michaels to allow him to observe Saturday Night Live for a week, a request Michaels denied.

Fey said, [...] "it's just bad luck for <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> my first attempt at prime time I'm going up against the most powerful writer on television. I was joking that this would be the best pilot ever aired on Trio. And then Trio got canceled." [...] Fey wound up [...] "beating" [...] Sorkin when Studio 60 was canceled after one season and 30 Rock was renewed for a second. Though 30 Rocks first-season ratings proved lackluster and were lower than those of Studio 60, Studio 60 was more expensive to produce.|$|E

500|$|Chloe is {{characterized}} as a [...] "dynamic fashion guru" [...] by Global BC and a [...] "bad girl" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or they have to make things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are two further cities hosting major institutions, Luxembourg (judicial {{and second}} seats) and Strasbourg (Parliament's main seat). Authorities in Strasbourg and organisations based there also refer to Strasbourg as the [...] "capital" [...] of Europe and Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg are also {{referred}} to as the joint capitals of Europe. In 2010, Vice President of the United States Joe Biden, while speaking to the European Parliament, said: [...] ""As you probably know, some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington, D.C. as the 'capital of the free world.' But it seems to <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this great city, which boasts 1,000 years of history and which serves as the capital of Belgium, the home of the European Union, and the headquarters for NATO, this city has its own legitimate claim to that title." ...|$|E
2500|$|... This {{theory was}} {{forwarded}} at the 2008 Rhodesian Ridgeback World Congress, and contends that an honest {{evaluation of the}} breed's functional history indicates that during its formative development and early use as a breed, the ridgeback was much more a [...] "hunter's/farmer's ox-wagon dog" [...] {{than it was a}} [...] "lion dog". This theory aligns itself with the current FCI classification of the breed, group 6.3 (a special type of scenthound). However, the important distinction in this theory is not that the FCI classification of [...] "scenthound" [...] is accurate, but rather, that placing the Dalmatian and the Rhodesian ridgeback (the only breeds currently in FCI group 6.3), breeds that historically have served as versatile hunting/wagon dogs, should indeed be classified as two examples of the same type of dog, but further asserts that such dogs’ classification makes more sense as a discrete group. This classification theory is generally supported by historical accounts that mirror the one offered by Phyllis Archdale who went to Southern Africa in 1919 and bred ridgebacks there in the 1920s, [...] "Old timers told <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> early days most Dutch transport riders had a Ridgehound as guard to their wagons. They were used to bail up lion and wild pig. Mine did both..." ...|$|E
