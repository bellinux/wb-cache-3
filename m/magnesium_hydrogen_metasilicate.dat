The efficacy of this {{test in the}} diagnostic investigation of pernicious anaemia was {{compared with that of}} serum pepsinogen I. Twenty one patients with pernicious anaemia [...] that is, patients with achlorhydria [...] and 22 with healed duodenal ulcer and normal chlorhydria were studied. <b>Magnesium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> breath test, serum pepsinogen I, serum gastrin, and standard gastric acid secretory tests were performed in all subjects. The mean (SEM) hydrogen peak value was lower in patients with pernicious anaemia than in the duodenal ulcer group (21. 7 (1. 9) v 71. 3 (5. 2) ppm; p = 0. 00005). The hydrogen peak value had a 95. 2 % sensitivity and a 100 % specificity to detect pentagastrin resistant achlorhydria. Mean serum pepsinogen I concentrations were also significantly lower in patients with pernicious anaemia than in the duodenal ulcer group (10. 7 (2. 7) v 123. 6 (11. 8) micrograms/l p = 0. 00005). Sensitivity and specificity to detect pernicious anaemia were both 100 % for pepsinogen I.

In particular, <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate treatment consistently resulted in a good contribution to the stabilization of copper-containing paper [4, 16, 17]. Not only does neutralization take place but a beneficial effect of magnesium ions also seems to occur.

Thirdly, estimates of the activity coefficients are included. These improvements have but a marginal (5 – 10 %) improvement in the fit. However, proceeding with this flexible modelling procedure using the symbolic manipulator, Maple, easily allows the inclusion of all possible species.

50|$|Therefore, water cannot {{extinguish}} <b>magnesium</b> fires. The <b>hydrogen</b> gas produced intensifies the fire. Dry sand is {{an effective}} smothering agent, but only on relatively level and flat surfaces.|$|R
30|$|The {{reasons that}} calcium or <b>magnesium</b> <b>hydrogen</b> {{carbonate}} {{in a mixture}} did not produce clear beneficial effect {{can be found in}} the parameters of the samples and the application method rather than in the alkaline degradation mechanisms. First, partially soluble verdigris made the treatments uncontrollable or negative due to the solution’s large water content, resulting in fluctuation of the data or lower Mw than the untreated sample. The paper substrate utilized in the study was gelatin-sized rag paper. The inhibition of the penetration of alkaline earth salts into the fiber structure by a heavy gelatin size could also have diminished the effect of deacidification treatments (see also discussion on non-aqueous deacidification treatment) since sizing is an important parameter for the permeability of paper [28]. Furthermore, the pH of the colored area of the sample was still around 6.4 before deacidification. This means that few acidic degradation products were accumulated in the sample after pre-aging; hence, only a limited benefit can be expected from washing with diluted deacidification solution.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{degradation}} can {{be defined}} as a process that reduces the ability of soil to produce property or services. Thus, the objective was to study the influence of topography and erodibility in the distribution of the chemical attributes of an Alfissol in degraded areas of Gilbués in the State of Piaui, Brazil. In the chosen area a sampling grid of 1 ha was demarcated, with points spaced at 10 x 10 m, and 121 samples were collected at intersections, in 0 - 0. 20 m depth. Each point was georeferenced as a way to demarcate the area and prepare a topography map. For all samples pH, organic matter, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, <b>magnesium,</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and aluminum were determined. The estimate of erodibility was calculated from the equation proposed by Denardin. Based on the experiment and the results obtained it is concluded that the number of samples used was sufficient to determine the variability of soil in degraded areas of the Gilbués municipality.

Titanium alloy discs were blasted with calcium phosphate particles, then etched {{in a mixture}} of nitric and fluoric acids and rinsed in demineralized water. The titanium alloy disc (cathode) and platinum mesh (anode) were immersed in a supersaturated calcium phosphate electrolyte buffered at pH 7. 4 and connected to a current generator. The microstructure, chemical composition and crystallinity of the electrodeposited coatings were studied as function of time 10 - 120 min, temperature 25 - 80 degrees C, current density 8 - 120 mA/cm(2), <b>magnesium</b> and <b>hydrogen</b> carbonate amounts (0. 1 - 1 mM). Uniform calcium phosphate coatings were obtained in 30 min but coating thickness increased with deposition time. Raising the temperature of electrolyte resulted in more uniform coatings as ionic mobility increased. Low current density was preferable due to hydrogen gas evolving at the cathode, which disturbed the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals on titanium.

In {{the first set}} of experiments, it was attempted to confirm the information presented in the literature that magnesium hydride could be produced by heating at 350 oC for 24 hours under 10 atmospheres of pressure. The results obtained in this study indicated that even a higher temperature heating at 400 oC under 10 bar hydrogen pressure was insufficient for magnesium hydride formation. Heating and grinding time were selected as the most effective parameters by which a full-factorial experimental design methodology was implemented. Statistical analysis results indicated that a combination of grinding and a 50 oC heating was most effective.

From the different techniques used and the known chemical composition of the algal cell wall, {{it was observed that}} biosorption of the metallic cations to the algal cell wall component was a surface process. The binding capacities of the different metal cations were be-tween 1 and 1. 2 mmol metal/g on a dry weight basis. The main chemical groups involved in the metallic cation bio-sorption were apparently carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, and sulfonate. These groups were part of the algal cell wall structural polymers, namely, polysaccharides (alginic acid, sulfated polysaccharides), proteins, and peptidoglycans. The main cadmium cation sequestration mechanism by the algal biomass was apparently chelation, while the nickel cation sequestration mechanism was mainly ion exchange. Lead cations exhibit higher affinity to the algal biomass, and their binding mechanism included a combination of ion exchange, chelation, and reduction reactions, accompa-nied by metallic lead precipitation on the cell wall matrix.

As the secondary Ni/MH batteries negative materials, the AB 5 -type rare-earth-based hydrogen storage alloys and AB 2 -type Zr-based or Ti-based alloys have been commercialized successfully [3]. However, the low capacity of AB 5 -type alloys (the practical value is about 310 mAh g− 1) and the slow activation characteristics of AB 2 -type alloys limit extensive applications [4, 5, 6].

Not long after that, Kohno et al. [9] reported that the maximum discharge capacity of the La 0.7 Mg 0.3 Ni 2.8 Co 0.5 alloy reached 410 mAh g− 1. Pan and his co-workers [10, 11] also acquired the similar results on the La 0.7 Mg 0.3 (Ni 0.85 Co 0.15) 3.5 alloy, namely with PuNi 3 -type structure and the discharge capacity approaching 400 mAh g− 1, which exhibits good application prospect.
