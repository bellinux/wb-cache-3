Small scale farmers {{are very interested in}} manually lever operated knapsack sprayer because of its versatility, cost and design. But this sprayer has certain limitations like it cannot maintain required pressure; it lead to problem of back pain. However this equipment can also lead to misapplication of chemicals and ineffective control of target pest which leads to loss of pesticides due to dribbling or drift during application. This phenomenon not only adds to cost of production but also cause environmental pollution and imbalance in natural echo system. This paper suggests a model of manually operated multi nozzle pesticides sprayer pump which will perform spraying at maximum rate in <b>minimum</b> time.

40|$|Multiple-effect {{evaporators}} {{are widely}} used in dairy industries to concentrate milk, which will be further processed in spray driers to produce powder. Compared to the evaporation stage the drying stage consumes a lot of energy. So, from an energy-saving point of view {{it is important to}} remove as much water as possible in the evaporation stage. In producing milk powder about 90 % of the water removal takes place in the evaporating stage. The operational conditions must be satisfied within the falling film evaporators in order to have continuous production. One of the constraints to the optimisation of the falling-film evaporator is found to be the <b>minimum</b> peripheral <b>flow</b> (Brenmuhl, 1999). Violation of this constraint could cause fouling due to film break-up within the evaporator tubes. Fouling due to film break-up is a major concern in the operation of falling-film evaporators (Brenmuhl, 1999; Winchester, 2000; Paramalingam et al., 2000). Insufficient flow is found to be the cause of film break-up (Hartley & Murgatroyd, 1964; Chung and Bankoff, 1979; Paramalingam, 1999; Hughes & Bott, 1991). To avoid fouling due to film break-up the flow rate along the tubes should not be less than a <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> necessary to sweep off the dry patches. This flow is known as the advancing <b>minimum</b> <b>flow,</b> where the flow can no longer advance to cover a dry area. For the safe operation of falling-film evaporators {{it is also important to}} know the <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> below which film break-up occurs. This <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> is known as the retarding <b>minimum</b> <b>flow,</b> where the flow can no longer support a full film and the film retards leaving a dry area. The purpose of this study is to determine the <b>minimum</b> <b>flows</b> for milk products and for water. To this end two models are used, proposed by Hartley and Murgatroyd (1964) and Hoke and Chen (1992) to predict film break-up and therefore <b>minimum</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

A points system with seven environmental categories was used to arrive at scores indicative of a location's sensitivity and commensurate with the maximum permissible volume of abstraction. The same score is used to estimate the environmentally prescribed <b>flow</b> or <b>minimum</b> <b>flow.</b> This study deals with the applicability of an environmental {{weighting system}} to the quantification of a prescribed <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> using the Whanganui River as a case study. The <b>minimum</b> <b>flows</b> in Whanganui River {{have been subject to}} considerable debate since the construction of a series of intakes on several headwater streams in the early seventies for the purpose of increasing water volumes for the ECNZ power generation at Tokaanu and nine hydroelectric power plant stations on the Waikato River. In 1977, the NZ Canoeing Association requested that a <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> be fixed which in 1983, culminated in a recommendation of 22 m- 3 s- 1 <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> at Te Maire in December and January. A review of these flows was carried out in 1987 and the <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> was increased to 29 m- 3 - 1 from December to May following a Planning Tribunal Hearing in 1989 - 90. The results showed that one of the flow allocation methods was very restrictive to ECNZ operations while strongly favouring the requirements of fisheries and other instream uses. Two other options were examined under the demand conditions in the Whanganui River. They provided for an environmentally prescribed flow which was similar to that proposed by the Planning Tribunal Determination (1990), but each had slightly different abstraction proposals to meet suggested flows. Under New Zealand conditions the technique was found to be useful in identifying the environmental constraints of competing demands for river water. However, in an already regulated flow regime the outcomes were hypothetical but still meaningful...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{agricultural}} and urban demands, environmental demands in the CALVIN model are not represented {{in terms of}} the economic value of deliveries. Instead, environmental demands are represented as monthly <b>minimum</b> instream <b>flow</b> requirements on river and Delta reaches and minimum water supply requirements for refuge areas. These requirements vary by month and year and are intended to represent the minimum acceptable amount of water for environmental uses at their current (pre-CVPIA) levels. This chapter explains CALVIN's approach and assumptions in modeling <b>minimum</b> instream <b>flow</b> requirements, refuge demands, and the associated limitations. <b>MINIMUM</b> INSTREAM <b>FLOW</b> REQUIREMENTS Although <b>minimum</b> instream <b>flow</b> requirements are used throughout the state, CALVIN's aggregated modeling approach limits these flow constraints to those directly applicable to a canal or river reach included on the CALVIN schematic. Many <b>minimum</b> instream <b>flow</b> requirements vary monthly and by year type. Year types (wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, and/or critical) are classified by some type of index. A monthly pattern of flow requirements then corresponds with each year type, and a times series of <b>minimum</b> <b>flows</b> can be constructed from year types for the 1922 - 1993 hydrologic sequence modeled in CALVIN. Other more complex requirements depend on concurrent storage, flow, water quality, or other conditions. These latter relationships cannot be to represented dynamically in CALVIN’s network flow programming formulation. Instead, a pre-determined time series of <b>minimum</b> <b>flows</b> from a simulation of concurrent conditions is used in CALVIN. Because CALVIN is calibrated to match DWRSIM run 514 surface storage and flow conditions, DWRSIM run 514 time series are generally used for these more complex <b>minimum</b> <b>flow</b> requirements.
