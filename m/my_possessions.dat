500|$|With {{the tutor}} ordered {{out of the}} house, Reich was sent to an all-male {{gymnasium}} in Czernowitz. It was during this period that a skin condition appeared, diagnosed as psoriasis, that plagued him {{for the rest of}} his life, leading several commentators to remark on his ruddy complexion. He visited brothels every day and wrote in his diary of his disgust for the women. His father died of tuberculosis in 1914, and because of rampant inflation the father's insurance was worthless, so no money was forthcoming for the brothers. Reich managed the farm and continued with his studies, graduating in 1915 with [...] Stimmeneinhelligkeit (unanimous approval). The Russians invaded Bukovina that summer and the Reich brothers fled, losing everything. Reich wrote in his diary: [...] "I never saw either my homeland or <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> again. Of a well-to-do past, nothing was left." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1282 Louis's eldest brother, Thomas, died, and in {{the summer}} of 1283 his mother followed. This {{provoked}} a succession crisis, since the ruling count of Savoy, Philip, had no sons, and the sons of Thomas, thitherto his heir, were too young to hold the reins of government. In accordance with tradition, Amadeus was recognised as Philip's heir. Louis was promised an apanage, which he did not find sufficient, and the later Savoyard chroniclers Jehan Servion and Jean d'Oronville portray him as fighting his brother for the succession or for a larger share of the inheritance while their uncle was dying. Servion puts into Philip's mouth the following denunciation of Louis's motives, before he gathered together his barons and made them recognise Amadeus as his successor: [...] "I have bestowed upon you more of <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> than you deserve, and you are not in the least grateful. I know you well, for it is always you who complain of things. Your whole being is full of clamor, which makes you unwilling to hold to my will and commandment." [...] It is more probable that [...] "Louis felt inadequately rewarded for his efforts in the wars against the emperor and the dauphin in 1282â€“84", than that he was a person [...] "full of clamor".|$|E
60|$|ASHER. Never in my {{life have}} I {{regarded}} <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> as my own. I am a trustee.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. You {{thought that}} letter had been destroyed. How foolish of you! It is in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then I told Hans {{as much as}} I thought {{advisable}} of {{how this}} horrid little talisman came into <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
60|$|In {{case the}} sale of these Fragments evinces that the public have any curiosity to be {{presented}} with a more copious collection of my unfortunate Aunt's poems, I have other papers in <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> which shall, in that case, be subjected to their notice. It may be supposed they require much arrangement; but I send the following to the press in the same state in which they came into <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> J. F.|$|R
6000|$|... "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand, [...] And cast a wistful eye [...] To Canaan's {{fair and}} happy land, [...] Where <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> lie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I do say it. What have I got in {{the world}} that is worth having? <b>My</b> <b>possessions</b> are ever so many {{thousands}} a year--and a damaged name." ...|$|E
6000|$|Intendant. And how my absurd riches {{encumbered}} [...] 170 [...] me! I {{dared not}} {{lay claim to}} above half <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b> [...] Let me but once unbosom myself, glorify Heaven, and die! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't be uneasy,' said Traddles. 'They {{have come}} into <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> I {{will take care of}} them, under the {{authority}} I mentioned.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: A {{portrait}} of Mr. Wordsworth, correctly and beautifully executed, by an artist then at Stowey; now in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> [Cottle's note.]] ...|$|R
6000|$|The Chair. [...] "Order! Sit down, if you please--both of you. Neither of {{the notes}} {{has been out}} of <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} of <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and {{destroyed}} the confidence of folks who, to serve their ends, would have helped me on. Isn't that a serious thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Time!" [...] cried his daughter, [...] "why, I can pack all <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> in an hour. Go home, sir, and fuss {{around as}} much as you like. I'll join you some time this evening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are to be}} complimented, {{since you}} have {{realized}} {{at least part of}} your aspirations," [...] she said, as she swept a glance round <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b> [...] "Is it fair to ask, are you satisfied with--this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{gazed at}} him in bewildered astonishment. [...] "There are some twenty dollars in <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> which your wife handed me not long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{with the}} key in <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> it was so clear and understandable, I really forgot for the moment {{he was only a}} bird.|$|R
60|$|Limb. Since you won't persuade me, I {{care not}} much; {{here are the}} jewels in <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> and I'll fetch out the {{settlement}} immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "That whoever made {{it had a}} {{good eye}} for the most {{valuable}} locations in this district," [...] I answered, thoughtfully. [...] "He has also shaded with the same tint part of <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> in Crane Valley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he continued, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} half of <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and have {{destroyed}} {{the confidence of}} the people who, to serve their ends, would have helped me on. Isn't that a serious thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very often. You see {{the only}} {{apparent}} {{use of the}} trees on <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> was to keep me busy two years attempting to destroy them, and of late I have chiefly {{had to do with}} minerals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I don't understand," [...] Katharine faltered at last. [...] "That packet has {{not been}} out of <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> and I saw the notes put into it." ...|$|R
60|$|The ticket {{was soon}} in <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> and then I asked the ticket seller {{a number of}} {{questions}} concerning the route and the time I would reach my destination.|$|R
60|$|There {{are only}} two gold coins of Wulfric of Mercia in {{existence}} anywhere. One of them is in the British Museum, {{and the other one}} is in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cortes is in Spain, {{pleading}} his suit. He has wed a {{new wife}} there, Teule. Many {{years ago he}} put me away, giving me in marriage to Don Juan Xaramillo, who took me because of <b>my</b> <b>possessions,</b> for Cortes dealt liberally with me, his discarded mistress.' And she began to weep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{content with}} having {{delivered}} me to all this, {{not content with}} having branded me a murderer, destroyed my good name, filched <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and driven me into the very path of hell, you must further set about usurping my place in the false heart of this woman I once loved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] he cried, [...] "none deny your power. Let it be {{mingled with}} mercy. It is excellent, as an English poet will {{say in a}} few hundred years, to have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant. Take the half of <b>my</b> <b>possessions,</b> but spare my son-in-law." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. I will {{deny the}} whole affair from {{beginning}} to end. I will say that I have never seen this wretched thing, that it was never in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would do}} so gladly," [...] said Lord Glenvarloch, [...] "but the casket which {{contains}} {{it is not in}} <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> It was seized when I was arrested at Greenwich." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you refer}} to the {{contents}} of that letter, it was written and handed to me about three hours ago. It has not been out of <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> since then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had far sooner lose my kingdoms {{than have}} won these fowls, for if I had lost my kingdoms {{they would still}} have passed {{into the hands of}} one of my own race. Now alas! <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and his must come under the hand of strangers, who shall cast down our gods and bring our names to nothing.' ...|$|E
60|$|Steel {{said nothing}} further, and I {{was in no}} mood for conversation. Gaspard's Trail was to be sold on the morrow, and Lane had {{carefully}} chosen his time. The commercial depression was keener than ever, and there is seldom any speculation in Western lands at that time of the year. It was evidently his purpose to buy in <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could have}} shared {{just a little}} of my good fortune with him," [...] I said to Zulime, who really was as stately as a queen. But {{the best of all}} <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> I would not, could not, share with any one--I mean the adoration of my little daughters to whom I possessed the majesty of an emperor.|$|E
6000|$|... "The beans," [...] he remarked, [...] "are in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> There {{are only}} eleven {{of them and}} I have not yet {{made up my mind}} exactly what to do with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{the remains}} of the upper extremities, those which are in <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> consist merely of a {{fragment}} of an ulna and of a radius (Plate III., Figs. 5 and 6).|$|R
6000|$|... "No, but {{he hangs}} {{it up in}} its place in my shed, which is putting it again in <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b> And so all the things which Dorothy uses in the kitchen are bailments." ...|$|R
