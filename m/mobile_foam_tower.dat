40|$|Drainage of a mobile, symmetric, plane-parallel thin {{liquid film}} between two gas bubbles (foam film) is studied. An {{analytical}} {{solution for the}} rate of thinning of such a liquid film with an insoluble surfactant and having both film elasticity and surface viscosity is presented for the first time. Analysis is extended to the more general case of a soluble surfactant and compared with previous analyses. Surfactant material parameters affecting the rate of thinning are identified and grouped into a single dimensionless parameter, the surfactant number which describes {{the transition from a}} mobile to an immobile film. Significant deviation from the Reynolds velocity is found when this dimensionless parameter is small. Since draining foam or emulsion films are generally of nonuniform thickness with a thick region or 'dimple' as the central part and separated from the Plateau border by a thinner 'barrier ring', an analytical solution is not possible. Hence a numerical model was developed. This model simulates the hydrodynamics associated with the drainage of an axisymmetric, dimpled, <b>mobile</b> <b>foam</b> film with an insoluble surfactant. This extends the work of Joye (1994) which was limited to immobile films. Results of the parametric study indicate that the rate of drainage of these films is dependent on surfactant properties viz. elasticity, surface dilatational viscosity, surface shear viscosity and surface diffusivity. These properties are grouped into a single dimensionless parameter which is the same as obtained by our analytical solution for a plane parallel film and which correlates with the rate of drainage of the foam film. This parameter describes the transition from a mobile film to an immobile film. The simulations indicate considerable motion of the interface for draining <b>mobile</b> <b>foam</b> films. Foam texture in a porous medium is governed by the hydrodynamics of individual foam films (lamellae) flowing through pores of varying size. The stability of foam in a particular application depends upon the stability of a lamella in the porous medium, especially as the lamella expands in translating from a small pore (pore throat) to a larger pore (pore body). The numerical simulator developed above is extended to translating foam films to model the effect of various parameters on foam stability. The model predicts that the travelling lamella is unstable only for certain ranges of surfactant properties, porous media geometry and flow conditions, for e. g. gas flow rate and capillary pressure. Simulations show that <b>mobile</b> <b>foam</b> films stretch in going from a pore throat to a pore body and may thin down to the critical thickness and break, under certain conditions. In contrast immobile foam films are very stable due to an entrainment effect which occurs as the film expands in going from a pore throat to a pore body. The critical capillary pressure at which a moving lamella will break is determined as a function of film and porous medium properties. Further the concept of asymmetric drainage of foam films in porous media has been explored...|$|R
40|$|Air was bubbled through {{sea water}} in an all-glass 360 ml <b>foam</b> <b>tower.</b> Bacterial counts, {{fluorescence}} and ultra-violet absorption were determined in the condensed foam fraction collected at intervals over a 4 -hour period. The natural population and pure cultures of bacteria were concentrated from filtered and unfiltered sea-water samples.

Unfiltered sea-water samples, containing particulate organic detritis, gave concentration factors of 16 and 33 in 0 - 5 hr bubbling time for a pure culture of bacteria and the indigenous population, respectively. The bacterial morphology influenced the extent of concentration and there was evidence of some lysis of cells in the collected foam...|$|R

40|$|Fluidized Bed Combustion of coal {{eliminates}} most {{emissions of}} S and N oxides but produces sizable volumes {{of a solid}} residue that EPA may require {{to be placed in}} capped and lined landfills. Fluidized Bed Combustors {{are one of the most}} promising growth markets for Illinois coal and imposing cap and liner requirements may make the technology uneconomic. Fluidized Bed residues are cementlike and when mixed with soil, produce a material as impermeable as the clay liners used at landfills. This project will demonstrate that the residues can be mixed with soils by regular construction equipment and used in place of clays as liner material. The demonstration cap will cover an area of 7 acres and will prevent water infiltration into acid producing material. Baseline studies of Briar Creek indicate that the water is now highly degraded by acid drainage. Construction delays have enhanced the data collected on Briar Creek by allowing monitoring to continue through major seasonal changes without any effects attributable to the FBC ash. Materials needed to place the wells and lysimeters have been obtained. A contractor will build and deliver a <b>mobile</b> <b>foam</b> generator and spray to the field to demonstrate fugitive dust control from FBC fly ash (dust problem is one key barrier to more widespread use of FBC ash) ...|$|R
60|$|Arm in arm, and {{staggering}} {{against the}} wind, Rorie and I won every yard of ground with conscious effort. We {{slipped on the}} wet sod, we fell together sprawling on the rocks. Bruised, drenched, beaten, and breathless, it must have taken us near {{half an hour to}} get from the house down to the Head that overlooks the Roost. There, it seemed, was my uncle's favourite observatory. Right in the face of it, where the cliff is highest and most sheer, a hump of earth, like a parapet, makes a place of shelter from the common winds, where a man may sit in quiet and see the tide and the mad billows contending at his feet. As he might look down from the window of a house upon some street disturbance, so, from this post, he looks down upon the tumbling of the Merry Men. On such a night, of course, he peers upon a world of blackness, where the waters wheel and boil, where the waves joust together with the noise of an explosion, and the <b>foam</b> <b>towers</b> and vanishes in the twinkling of an eye. Never before had I seen the Merry Men thus violent. The fury, height, and transiency of their spoutings was a thing to be seen and not recounted. High over our heads on the cliff rose their white columns in the darkness; and the same instant, like phantoms, they were gone. Sometimes three at a time would thus aspire and vanish; sometimes a gust took them, and the spray would fall about us, heavy as a wave. And yet the spectacle was rather maddening in its levity than impressive by its force. Thought was beaten down by the confounding uproar--a gleeful vacancy possessed the brains of men, a state akin to madness; and I found myself at times following the dance of the Merry Men as it were a tune upon a jigging instrument.|$|R
50|$|The ninots {{and their}} falles are {{constructed}} {{according to an}} agreed-upon theme that has traditionally been a satirical jab at whatever draws {{the attention of the}} fallers (the registered participants of the casals). In modern times, the two-week-long festival has spawned a substantial local industry, to the point that an entire suburban area has been designated the Ciutat fallera (Falles City). Here, crews of artists and artisans, sculptors, painters, and other craftsmen, all spend months producing elaborate constructions of paper and wax, wood and polystyrene <b>foam</b> tableaux <b>towering</b> up to five stories, composed of fanciful figures, often caricatures, in provocative poses arranged in a gravity-defying manner. Each of them is produced under the direction of one of the many individual neighbourhood casals fallers who vie with each other to attract the best artists, and then to create the most outrageous allegorical monument to their target. There are about 750 of these neighbourhood associations in Valencia, with over 200,000 members, or a quarter of the city's population.|$|R

40|$|Foamed {{emulsions}} are {{ubiquitous in}} our daily life but the ageing of such systems is still poorly understood. In this study we investigate foam drainage and measure {{the evolution of the}} gas, liquid and oil volume fractions inside the foam. We evidence three regimes of ageing. During an initial period of fast drainage, both bubbles and drops are very <b>mobile.</b> As the <b>foam</b> stabilises drainage proceeds leading to a gradual decrease of the liquid fraction and slowing down of drainage. Clusters of oil drops are less sheared, their dynamic viscosity increases and drainage slows down even further, until the drops become blocked. At this point the oil fraction starts to increase in the continuous phase. The foam ageing leads to an increase of the capillary pressure until the oil acts as an antifoaming agent and the foam collapses. Comment: Soft Matter 201...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a series of sustainable peptide surfactants (Pepfactants) capable of stabilizing foams and emulsions in a stimuli-responsive manner, based on the reversible formation of a mechanically strong interfacial film. Under conditions where the interfacially adsorbed peptide forms a mechanically strong film state, foam or emulsion stabilization occurs {{as a direct result}} of the film strength. Under conditions where the interfacially adsorbed peptide forms a <b>mobile</b> detergent state, <b>foam</b> or emulsion stabilization is either reduced, or does not occur. Preformed foams or emulsions stabilized by Pepfactants undergo rapid phase coalescence when the film state is converted to the detergent state. Switching between film and detergent states is readily and reversibly achieved by a change in the bulk solution composition, such as a change in pH, or the addition or sequestering of metal ions.
