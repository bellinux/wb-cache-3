40|$|When an aero-acoustic {{source is}} close to a {{reflecting}} wall, results from conventional phased array beamforming techniques are disturbed by the nearby <b>mirror</b> <b>source,</b> which is coherent with the original source. The recalculated source spectrum tends to deviate from the spectrum of the same source obtained in an anechoic environment. A periodic modulation of the spectrum occurs, which is most prominent at low frequencies. In this paper, a number of non-conventional beamforming techniques to correct for this spectral modulation is investigated. First, a technique is discussed which adds the <b>mirror</b> <b>source</b> to the transmission model. It was found that this technique is not very suitable because of its lack of robustness. Then, a more robust beamforming technique is proposed that minimises {{the influence of a}} given <b>mirror</b> <b>source.</b> By this technique, much better results were found. Nevertheless, at low frequencies the method still suffers from lack of robustness. Finally, a modification to this minimisation technique is proposed which preserves the robustness. Using this “controlled minimisation ” technique, the best agreement was found between the recalculated spectra of a source close to a wall and the same source in anechoic conditions. The beamforming techniques were applied to array measurements on a calibratio...|$|E

The impulse response of this channel exhibits {{a transition from}} early separate components followed by a diffuse reverberation tail. Under {{the assumption that the}} transmitter's (or receiver's) position and orientation are picked uniformly at random we derive an exact expression of the mean arrival rate for a rectangular room predicted by the <b>mirror</b> <b>source</b> theory. The rate is quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional to the product of beam coverage fractions of the transmitter and receiver antennas. Making use of the exact formula, we characterize the onset of the diffuse tail by defining a "mixing time" as the point in time where the arrival rate exceeds one component per transmit pulse duration. We also give an approximation for the power-delay spectrum. It turns out that the power-delay spectrum is unaffected by the antenna directivity. However, Monte Carlo simulations show that antenna directivity does indeed play an important role for the distribution of instantaneous mean delay and rms delay spreadComment: Submitted to IEEE Trans.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to design robust Source Coupled Logic (SCL) for implementing ultra low power circuits. In this paper, we propose two different source coupled logic structures and analyze the performance of these structures with STSCL (Sub-threshold SCL). The first design under consideration is DTPMOS as load device which analyses the performance of Dynamic Threshold SCL (DTSCL) Logic with previous source coupled logic for ultra low power operation. DTSCL circuits exhibit a better power - delay Performance compared with the STSCL Logic. It {{can be seen that}} the proposed circuit provides 56 % reduction in power delay product. The second design under consideration uses basic current mirror active load device to provide required voltage swing. Current <b>mirror</b> <b>source</b> coupled logic (CMSCL) can be used for high speed operation. The advantage of this design is that it provides 54 % reduction in power delay product over conventional STSCL. The main drawback of this design is that it provides a higher power dissipation compared to other source coupled logic structures. The proposed circuit provides lower sensitivity to temperature and power supply variation, with a superior control over power dissipation. Measurements of test structures simulated in 0. 18 μm CMOS technology shows that the proposed DTSCL logic concept can be utilized successfully for bias currents as low as 1 pA.

40|$|Two {{complementary}} {{methods have}} been developed that are capable to determine the reflection coefficient of acoustic absorbing materials in situ. The methods are compared with a measurement in the Kundt's tube. The first method {{is based on the}} measurement of the surface impedance [1], [2], [3]. Here a prototype device based on this method is presented that for calibration and impedance determination uses of a well defined sound source [9]. The surface impedance method proves to work best for materials with a not too high reflection coefficient [1]. A second (novel) method is developed for materials with a high reflection coefficient. It uses of a monopole sound source that is placed close by the acoustic reflecting material. A Microflown [8] is placed close to the monopole source in such way that its sensitive direction is aiming at the acoustic reflecting material and its non sensitive direction is aiming at the source. This way it is only measuring the 'mirror source': the reflected image of the monopole sound source. It is therefore called 'the <b>mirror</b> <b>source</b> method'. From the transfer function between the reference velocity sensor inside the monopole source and the Microflown outside the source, the reflection coefficient can be determined. First results of this method are presented. The results of both methods are compared to a Kundt's tube measurement. Traditionally this method works with two pressure transducers but it is also possible to use a combinational pressure and velocity transducer (the PU probe). This PU method is already reported in [1], [5], [6], [7]. The calibration should be very accurate to be able to measure highly reflective materials in a reliable way [5], [9]. In this paper an improved calibration procedure for this method is presented. © (2006) by the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven Department of Mechanical Engineering All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) {{is widely}} used in navigations of flights, {{vehicles}} and travelers nowadays. However, the signals are not always available {{and there are some}} cases where the receptions of the GPS signal can be lost {{because of the presence of}} urban canyons, buildings, tunnels and forests. Another down side for the GPS is that indoor positioning can be really difficult because of the greater signal interference from the indoor. ^ On the other hand, the concept of echolocation has also been used for positioning purposes. Echolocation offers a promising approach to improve the quality of life of people with blindness using the 2 ̆ 2 searching 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 scanning 2 ̆ 2 strategies. Scanning consists of head movement from a person to detect the object while searching relies heavily on information within the echo rather than headmovement. ^ Motivated by the concept of echolocation positioning technique for blinds, we have developed a model system to estimate the geolocation within our designated testing facility, an echo chamber room. The echo chamber is designed to have its surrounding to have the least acoustic impact absorbance to allow the least reduction of refelcted sound waves 2 ̆ 7 intensities. In the room, a sound speaker is used as the sound source to carry the pulse wave we created to represent the 2 ̆ 2 snap 2 ̆ 2 from blinds. During the measurement, the position of our sound source always stays stationary while a sound receiver equipped with 64 measurement microphones is collecting the sound intensities for different sound waves from the source. We have chosen sixteen receiving positions to represent the room due to the limitation of the our cords 2 ̆ 7 length of the receiver. Measurements will be performed one position at a time for the 16 positions. For every microphone, the sound intensities from the source are recorded and displayed in plots at MATLAB with sound intensity (V) on the y axis and time (s) on the x axis. On the data plots, we are to find the first seven major peaks on the y axis and more importantly, the corresponded elapsed time on the x axis. The focuses for our study are on direct sound waves and first order sound waves. The first peak, with the least elapsed time, will be the direct wave which travels directly from the source to the microphone. The second to the seventh peaks are all first order waves which reflect once from the source to the microphone. Since the echo chamber is rectangular shaped that consists of six planes, there are going to be six first order waves. ^ The sound source is set as the origin for the measurement coordinate system. The relative positions of the receiver and the microphones to the source are measured. One simple assumption is made for the study assuming that the travelled distance of a single acoustic wave is going to be the multiplication of the speed of sound and the travelled time because the source is a simple pulse wave. By applying the <b>mirror</b> <b>source</b> method, we are able to develop a preliminary mathematical model to estimate the geolocation within the coordinate system with the data information acquired. For the model, we are capable of estimating the length, width, and height of the room with the known coordinates of the source and receiving points; and the travelled distances for the direct and first order acoustic waves. The average error percentage of the estimation from the preliminary model is around 15 percent compared to the actual measured dimensions. To improve the accuracy of the theoretical model, the method of least square is applied using all the data points to improve the model for better error percentage. ^ Our geolocation estimating system is limited in two conditions: The position of the sound source remains constant; it is applicable for indoor environment. For future development and study, the model can be modified to adapt with non- constant source and greater influences by the outdoor noises. ...|$|E
