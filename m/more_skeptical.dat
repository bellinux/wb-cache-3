5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|Avram Steuerman-Rodion, {{a socialist}} based in Iași, contributed a special series of {{articles}} documenting the growth of Germanophila in that city, and throughout Moldavia region. Titled Scrisori din Iași ("Letters from Iași"), it notably chronicled the conflicts between the enthusiastically Ententist University of Bucharest professors and their <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> University of Iași colleagues. Seara also enlisted contributions from physician Ottoi Călin, {{a member of the}} PSDR Executive Committee and author of its Zimmerwald pacifist manifesto. Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, but, as a practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E

5|$|The Song {{official}} Yu Yunwen was {{in command}} of the army defending the river. The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the Battle of Caishi. The paddle-wheel ships of the Song navy, armed with trebuchets that fired gunpowder bombs, overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet. Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed. The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely arsenic. Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war, characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders. The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the Battle of Fei River in the 4th century. Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18,000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu Yunwen and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400,000 soldiers. Modern historians are <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration. Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang. The conflict was not the one-sided battle that traditional accounts imply, and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin. The Song fleet was larger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset, cavalry, in a naval battle.|$|E
25|$|Reports of dinosaur-like {{creatures in}} Africa caused a minor {{sensation}} {{in the mass}} media, and newspapers in Europe and North America carried many articles on the subject in 1910–1911; some took the reports at face value, others were <b>more</b> <b>skeptical.</b>|$|E

Roosevelt successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass Roosevelt's version of the bill.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have proposed that}} the figure mentioned {{in both of these}} references is one and the same as the Hengist of the Hengist and Horsa accounts, though Horsa is not mentioned in either source. In his work Finn and Hengest, Tolkien argued that Hengist was a historical figure, and that Hengist came to Britain after the events recorded in the Finnsburg Fragment and Beowulf. Patrick Sims-Williams is <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> of the account, suggesting that Bede's Canterbury source, which he relied on for his account of Hengist and Horsa in the Ecclesiastical History, had confused two separate traditions.|$|E
25|$|Knuckles has a serious, {{determined}} personality, {{described as}} keeping cool in combat. However, he sometimes loses his composure and gets in fights with other characters, and is sometimes shy around girls. His favorite food is grapes. His relationship with Sonic is ambivalent: Knuckles enters the series as an antagonist of Sonic and later sees him {{as both a}} friend and a rival, while envying Sonic's adventurous lifestyle. He is depicted as somewhat gullible and very rash, especially when angered. He has often been tricked by Doctor Robotnik, but is stated in one game manual to have become <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> of him.|$|E
25|$|The Viagens {{series is}} notable in the {{development}} of American science fiction of the 1950s for bringing a more realistic attitude to bear on some of the less credible features then commonplace to the genre, reimagining them in terms of the possible. It also leavened the hero-worship, sexism, prudery, ethnocentricity and nationalism then characteristic of the genre with a <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> view of human nature, strong characters of both genders (and of both same-sex and opposite-sex inclinations, though the latter predominate), for whom sex was a normal aspect of life, and an ethnically varied, international cast. De Camp's work helped prepare the field for the works of later, more iconoclastic writers, to the degree that {{when he returned to the}} series in the 1970s his own innovations had themselves come to appear routine and commonplace.|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{alternates}} {{between two}} settings. The first is 1930s Moscow, where Satan {{appears at the}} Patriarch Ponds {{in the guise of}} [...] "Professor" [...] Woland, a mysterious gentleman [...] "magician" [...] of uncertain origin. He arrives with a retinue that includes the grotesquely dressed valet Koroviev; the mischievous, gun-happy, fast-talking black cat Behemoth; the fanged hitman Azazello; the pale-faced Abadonna; and the witch Hella. They wreak havoc targeting the literary elite and its trade union MASSOLIT. Its privileged HQ is Griboyedov's House and is made up of corrupt social climbers and their women (wives and mistresses alike), bureaucrats, profiteers, and, <b>more</b> generally, <b>skeptical</b> unbelievers in the human spirit.|$|R

40|$|Using daily returns, we {{find that}} Bayesian alphas predict future mutual fund Sharpe ratios {{significantly}} better than traditional measures. For investors that believe in managerial skill, Bayesian measures choose funds that subsequently outperform funds chosen by standard single- or four-factor alphas. For investors that are skeptical of managerial skill, Bayesian measures choose funds that subsequently outperform funds chosen by expenses. Over our entire sample period, {{we find that}} priors consistent with a moderate belief in managerial skill dominate the <b>more</b> extreme <b>skeptical</b> or diffuse prior beliefs. Since a model with diffuse prior beliefs in managerial skill best predicts actual future mutual fund cash flows, our results suggest that Bayesian alphas can help investors choose better performing funds...|$|R

Clive Hart argues that [...] "hatever our conclusions about the identity of the dreamer, and no matter how many varied caricatures of him we may find projected into the dream, it is clear that he must always be considered as essentially external to the book, and should be left there. Speculation about the 'real person' behind the guises of the dream-surrogates or about the function of the dream in relation to the unresolved stresses of this hypothetical mind is fruitless, for the tensions and psychological problems in Finnegans Wake concern the dream-figures living within the book itself." ...|$|E

500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland.

He also suggested a [...] "Promethean" [...] project directed at breaking up the Russian Empire — a goal that he later continued to pursue. Meeting with Yamagata Aritomo, he suggested that starting a guerrilla war in Poland would distract Russia, and asked that Japan supply him with weapons. Although Japanese diplomat Hayashi Tadasu favored the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata were <b>more</b> <b>skeptical.</b>|$|E
40|$|Most {{promising}} {{responses to}} skepticism fall into “Moorean” or “rationalist” camps. Mooreans {{believe that some}} apparently circular forms of reasoning allow us to have justification to believe that skeptical hypotheses are false. Rationalists {{believe that we have}} a priori justification to believe that skeptical hypotheses are false. It can seem that anti-skeptics are stuck choosing between fishy circular reasoning and mysterious a priori justification. I present a new difficulty for rationalism by focusing on skeptical scenarios wherein our faculties of a priori reasoning are untrustworthy. In dealing with these scenarios, rationalists end up having to embrace the same sorts of circular reasoning that Mooreans use to deal with <b>more</b> familiar <b>skeptical</b> scenarios. As a result, there is no viable diagnosis of what's wrong with Moorean reasoning that does not also apply to rationalism: both anti-skeptical approaches are in the same boat when it comes to embracing circular reasoning...|$|R
50|$|Another of the {{questions}} that has divided philosophers of language {{is the extent to which}} formal logic can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and understanding of natural languages. While most philosophers, including Frege, Alfred Tarski and Rudolf Carnap, have been <b>more</b> or less <b>skeptical</b> about formalizing natural languages, many of them developed formal languages for use in the sciences or formalized parts of natural language for investigation. Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, Richard Montague and Donald Davidson.|$|R

500|$|The largest {{effect on}} the {{continental}} tradition with respect to science was Martin Heidegger's critique of the theoretical attitude in general which of course includes the scientific attitude. [...] For this reason the continental tradition has remained much <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> {{of the importance of}} science in human life and philosophical inquiry. Nonetheless, {{there have been a number}} of important works: especially a Kuhnian precursor, Alexandre Koyré. [...] Another important development was that of Michel Foucault's analysis of the historical and scientific thought in The Order of Things and his study of power and corruption within the [...] "science" [...] of madness. Post-Heideggerian authors contributing to the continental philosophy of science in the second half of the 20th century include Jürgen Habermas (e.g., [...] "Truth and Justification", 1998), Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker ("The Unity of Nature", 1980), and Wolfgang Stegmüller ("Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschafttheorie und Analytischen Philosophie", 1973–1986).|$|E
500|$|However, {{the speech}} was little noticed, and McGovern backed away from saying {{anything}} publicly {{for over a year}} afterward, partly because of the November 1963 assassination of President Kennedy and partly to not appear strident. Though <b>more</b> <b>skeptical</b> about it than most senators, McGovern voted in favor of the August 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, {{which turned out to be}} an essentially unbounded authorization for President Lyndon B. Johnson to escalate U.S. involvement in the war. McGovern thought the commander-in-chief should be given limited authority to retaliate against an attack; subsequently he said his instinct had been to vote no, but that he had voted yes based on Senator J. William Fulbright's urging to stand behind Johnson politically. Indeed, the day after the resolution vote, McGovern spoke concerning his fears that the vote would lead to greater involvement in the war; Wayne Morse, one of only two senators to oppose the resolution, sardonically noted that this fell into the category of [...] "very interesting, but very belated". This would become the vote that McGovern most bitterly regretted.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{military}} career has attracted comment {{from a number}} of journalists and writers over the years. The claims made by the Church of Scientology were not challenged by some early writers; C.H.

40|$|Evolutionary debunking {{arguments}} {{start with}} a premise {{about the influence of}} evolutionary forces on our evaluative beliefs, and conclude that we are not justified in those beliefs. The value realist holds that there are attitude-independent evaluative truths. But the debunker argues that {{we have no reason to}} think that the evolutionary forces that shaped human evaluative attitudes would track those truths. Worse yet, we seem to have a good reason to think that they wouldn’t: evolution selects for characteristics that increase genetic fitness—not ones that correlate with the evaluative truth. Plausibly, the attitudes and judgments that increase a creature’s fitness come apart from the true evaluative beliefs. My aim in this paper is to show that no plausible evolutionary debunking argument can both have force against the value realist and not collapse into a <b>more</b> general <b>skeptical</b> argument. I conclude that there is little hope for evolutionary debunking arguments. This is bad news for the debunker who hoped that the cold, hard scientific facts about our origins would debunk our evaluative beliefs. And it is good news for the realist...|$|R

"Essence," [...] in metaphysics, {{is often}} {{synonymous with the}} soul, and some existentialists argue that {{individuals}} gain their souls and spirits after they exist, that they develop their souls and spirits during their lifetimes. For Kierkegaard, however, the emphasis was upon essence as [...] "nature."

40|$|Twelve {{years of}} {{reviewing}} administrative decisions {{brings to mind}} The Witching Hour, the current best seller by Anne Rice. 1 In it, a Lucifer-like spirit called Lasher roams through several generations of a New Orleans family. In each generation, a female family member, also a witch, acts as the medium for calling Lasher into being. At various times, depending {{on the nature of}} the witch, his spirit heals and nourishes; at other times it maims and destroys. Always, however, there is a seductive relationship between the spirit and the earthbound witch-they entice, thrill, and eventually take over one another, body and soul. This description is probably as good as any of what administrators and judges do with statutory spirits: New relationships form in each generation and the statutory spirit itself takes on new forms-sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad. Our friends in academia are not innocent bystanders. Invariably, they also join in the seance, successively urging judges to be <b>more</b> adventurous, <b>skeptical,</b> deferential, or restrained-and now more substantive (in Sunstein 2 ̆ 7 s case) and governance-oriented (in Edley 2 ̆ 7 s case) -in calling forth the statutory spirit...|$|R
