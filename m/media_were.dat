5|$|All {{publications}} and <b>media</b> <b>were</b> subjected to censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing}} to cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|ITV Granada was {{interested}} in relocating but negotiations with the developers, Peel <b>Media,</b> <b>were</b> abandoned in 2009 amid a financial dispute. After a change of management at ITV Granada, talks resumed in January 2010 and in December the decision to move to MediaCityUK was announced. A production facility was constructed on Trafford Wharf to house the Coronation Street sets that transferred from Granada Studios in 2013. In March 2013, Granada Reports was broadcast from MediaCityUK signifying {{the completion of the}} initial phase of its migration from the Granada Studios in Quay Street.|$|E
5|$|In the playoffs, Ottawa's fourth placing in the Conference {{meant that}} the first-round playoff series was against the fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins. Some <b>media</b> <b>were</b> expecting the Penguins to win the series for three reasons—the Penguins had won the season series, the Senators' past playoff {{troubles}} and the strong young talent of the Penguins, particularly young star Sidney Crosby. The Senators, however, won easily by a score of four games to one, including a 3–0 shutout win in Game 5. This was the only series where the Senators were the higher-seeded team.|$|E

50|$|TV is {{the main}} medium in Armenia, {{and most of its}} {{channels}} are controlled or friendly with the government, as broadcast media require a license. The print sector is small and in decline, while online <b>media</b> <b>are</b> rising. Russian-language <b>media</b> <b>are</b> widely available. Ownership of the <b>media</b> <b>is</b> often opaque. Public media outlets receive preferential treatment from the authorities, while private <b>media</b> <b>are</b> not financially sustainable and rely heavily on their owners and sponsors, hindering editorial independence.|$|R
5|$|Several of the {{opposition}} candidates, along with their supporters {{and members of the}} <b>media,</b> <b>were</b> arrested.

5|$|The Civil Partnership Act {{came into}} effect on 1 January 2011. It had been {{expected}} that the first ceremonies would not take place until April 2011 due to a three-month waiting period required by law for all civil ceremonies. However, the legislation does provide a mechanism for exemptions to be sought through the courts, and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream <b>media</b> <b>were</b> not present.|$|E
5|$|The foreign <b>media</b> <b>were</b> often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for {{emphasizing}} Amin's self-aggrandizing eccentricities {{and taste}} for excess while downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior.

5|$|The <b>media</b> <b>were</b> {{notified}} of Centaurs sinking on 17 May 1943, but were ordered not {{to release the}} news until it had been announced in the South West Pacific Area's General Headquarters dispatch at midday on 18 May, and in Parliament by Prime Minister John Curtin that afternoon. News of the attack made front pages throughout the world, including The Times of London, The New York Times, and the Montreal Gazette. In some newspapers, the news took precedence over the 'Dambuster' raids performed in Europe by No. 617 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{addressed}} the Parliament of Australia and was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George, {{one of the}} highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also British subjects. Diệm did not engage in substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and {{he spent most of his}} time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his authoritarianism, election fraud and other corrupt practices. The Australian Catholic leadership and <b>media</b> <b>were</b> particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diệm had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the <b>media</b> <b>were</b> allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E

5|$|The Four Kings {{were very}} popular in Cuba, and the Japanese <b>media</b> <b>were</b> proud of the {{reputation}} they were bringing to judo and Japan. Consequently, on January 8, 1912, the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan. There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling. In 1913, Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In El Salvador, the president was assassinated while Maeda was there, and in Panama, the Americans tried to pay him to lose; in response, they kept moving south. In Peru they met Laku, a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military, and invited him to join them. They were then joined by Okura in Chile, and by Shimitsu in Argentina. The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14, 1914.|$|E
5|$|Wembley bosses were {{in dispute}} with {{newsreel}} companies over the broadcast {{rights for the}} 1936 final. Gaumont British Film Company initially had offered £900 to film inside the ground, but this was refused by the authorities who wanted a sum of £1,500. They later backed down {{and said that they}} would accept the initial offer, but the film company was now only willing to pay £500. A solution could not be reached, and the <b>media</b> <b>were</b> banned from inside of the stadium. To get around the ban and be able to report on the match, a number of autogyros were hired to fly the reporters over the stadium giving them a birds–eye view of the match, with the only filming inside Wembley conducted by the official stadium cameraman. Autogyros had been used to film the final in 1935, and also by the Metropolitan police for crowd control.|$|E
5|$|Lack of {{understanding}} of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies. Some news agencies gave the impression {{that most of the}} park was being destroyed. On August 30, an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott, apparently a tourist, incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service (William Mott). In another story, The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out, whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires—a mischaracterization of the policies of both agencies. The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies. Sources quoted by The Washington Post, USA Today, and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated, and one source commented that a September 8, 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts. On the same day, The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang, Vietnam, giving the impression of catastrophe. The fires had been very active in late July. In early August, fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further, {{due to a lack of}} fuel, and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained. When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20, and the fire that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September, the <b>media</b> <b>were</b> again highly critical of the park service and their policies.|$|E
50|$|Why {{do people}} choose {{one form of}} media over another? According to the Galileo Model, there are {{different}} forms of media spread throughout three-dimensional space. The closer one form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to another the more similar the source of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to each other. The farther away from each form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> in space, the least similar the source of <b>media</b> <b>is.</b> For example, mobile and cell phone are located closest in space where as newspaper and texting are farthest apart in space. The study further explained the relationship between self-concept {{and the use of}} different forms of media. The more hours per day an individual uses a form of media, the closer that form of <b>media</b> <b>is</b> to their self-concept.|$|R
40|$|In {{the age of}} information, {{with the}} {{development}} of new technologies, the <b>media</b> <b>are</b> playing more significant roles in political and economic activities in societies. Nowadays, the public are used to get political and social information from different media outlets; the <b>media</b> <b>are</b> deeply influencing people's life and behaviour. We found that the <b>media</b> <b>are</b> not completely free and independent in any society; they are controlled by different powers or groups in different political regimes. In some countries, <b>media</b> <b>are</b> controlled indirectly by private corporations; in other countries, <b>media</b> <b>are</b> controlled directly by the government. In this thesis, we introduce the important role of media for maintaining democracy, the relationship between politics and media, and in what degree the <b>media</b> <b>are</b> influencing political regimes in different countries. We take the United States and People's Republic of China as representatives of democratic regime and authoritarian regime, in order to conduct research more efficiently...|$|R
