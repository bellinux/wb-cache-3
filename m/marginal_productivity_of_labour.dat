In contrast, the capitalist manufacturing sector is defined by higher wage rates {{as compared to the}} subsistence sector, higher marginal productivity, and a demand for more workers. Also, the capitalist sector is assumed to use a production process that is capital intensive, so investment and capital formation in the manufacturing sector are possible over time as capitalists' profits are reinvested in the capital stock. Improvement in the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> in the agricultural sector is assumed to be a low priority as the hypothetical developing nation's investment is going towards the physical capital stock in the manufacturing sector.|$|E
50|$|Initially this {{absorption}} {{takes place}} by getting more {{land under cultivation}} so as to keep the ratio of labour to land constant. For sometime the capital and labour combination remain constant as the output rises from O1 to O3 as given in Figure 2. As resources are not unlimited the good land tends to become scarce and due to inflow of labour the ratio of labour to capital in the sector rises and hence the techniques tend to become increasingly labour-intensive. When the point On is reached all the available land has already been cultivated due to the high intensive labour techniques used and the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> falls below zero. Disguised unemployment starts making an appearance at this point. Under these condition there is no incentive for farmers to or small industries to make an investment in this sector {{even if they have}} the money to invest. Nor will they be interested in introducing labour saving innovations even if they knew about them. Since labour supply is in excess therefore labour as a group is not interested in increasing their efforts.

30|$|Many {{potential}} {{explanations for}} these wage differences exist, including discrimination and differing productivities {{in the same}} jobs caused by imperfect transferability <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market skills required {{in a foreign country}} or lack of language skills. Various studies analyze the effects of immigration for natives, how immigrants adapt to the labour market, and how they perform in terms of wages. The common framework uses the variation to the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> native <b>labour</b> caused by immigration by changes in aggregate wages (Borjas 1992, 2003; Borjas and Katz 2007; Bonin 2005; Card 2001, 2007; Bruecker and Jahn 2011; Suedekum et al. 2012; D’Amuri et al. 2010). Despite differences in productivity and discrimination, imperfect substitutability between migrants and natives is a realistic scenario for persistently lower wages. Comparing the existing studies, estimating wage effects of immigration relies strongly on the nested form of production function, which factors are used as inputs, the assumptions about separability between groups of inputs and a short- or long-run perspective. It is more realistic to assume that capital adjusts in the long run. Borjas (2003) assumes that capital is fixed, whereas in Ottaviano and Peri (2012) capital is supplied perfectly elastic. Furthermore, the main conceptual innovation is the question of the level of substitutability concerning the effect <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> market outcomes for natives and different subgroups.|$|R
40|$|Under the {{pressure}} of the population explosion amconstitutional changes, social and economic conditions in Mauritius went through a process of rapid change after the Second World War. The introduction of universal suffrage unseated the white plantocracy and brought to power the representatives of the urban and rural working classes. This led to fundamen changes in the Government social and economic policy. In 1963, Government fixed the wages and conditions of employment of agricultural and non-agricultural workers in the sugar industry. The first chapter describes the structure of the industry and the organisation of cane production on sugar estates. We study the pattern of land owPership characterised by the high concentration of cane land on millers' estates. The distribution of land will influence the rate of production and the allocation of resources inside the industry and the demand for and supply <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> on estates. In the second chapter we study the Island's social system and its influence on Government labour policy. The forces which led to the Government intervention in the labour market originated in the social structure of the Mauritius plantation economy with its rigid divisions. This accounts for the underdevelopment of industrial relations which prompted direct Government intervention in labour matters. The third chapter concentrates on the impact of Government regulations on the level of wages in the economy. The first part focusses on the importance of the sugar industry as a wage leader. We then study the effect of Government policy on the structure of wages and finally its influence on the distribution of employment. The analysis of the macro-economic structure forms {{an essential part of the}} work. The fourth chapter comprises a detailed quantitative description of the structure of the Island economy, which provides a convenient framework for the study of the effects of wage increases on the Government finances and the Balance of Payments.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the effects <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> force growth on the Ethiopian rural economy during the start of the first {{demographic}} dividend. The study focuses on the sources of rural economic growth: employment generation and productivity levels which lead to improved income and reduction of poverty. The changes in rural employment structure and the level and determinants of household grain production are analysed based on detailed national labour force survey and agricultural sample enumeration covering 6, 5 million households in three regions of the country.   Since 1995, five years after the start of a decline in population growth rate, Ethiopia has entered into the period of the demographic dividend. Moderate decline in the fertility rate and the echo of the baby boom generation of the 1975 / 76 land reform were the major driving forces for the onset of the demographic dividend.   In 2008 the country has a total population of 79 million, the second largest population in sub-Saharan Africa, and 48 percent of the adult population is in the age group 15 - 29. In the rural area the labour force is estimated about 32 million and each year one million people are added in the labour force. 90 percent <b>of</b> the rural <b>labour</b> force is employed in agriculture and the rest is employed in the non-farm service sector. Of those employed in the agricultural sector, 46 % are engaged in elementary occupation (mostly wage labour) while 44 % are semi-skilled self employed smallholders. The rural labour force is not self sufficient in food-grain production due to large family size and low land productivity. Due to the dominance of child-rich households and the young age characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>labour</b> force agricultural production increase was achieved mainly through area expansion. Currently area expansion reached to a stage leading to low <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> household <b>labour.</b> Government strategy is to promote improved technology and commercialization of small scale farming.   However, the child rich households do not have saving to adopt the technology and their preference is to meet basic needs and not to produce for the market.   The conclusion of this study is that small farms cannot be the engine of agricultural growth at a time when labour force growth is characterized by young age and household types of higher consumption requirements. In the rural areas there are not sufficient conditions of drivers of improved technology use and commercialisation: there is lack of asset accumulation, a low per capita production, and a lower degree of urbanization. There is a sequence and timing in rural development. This study suggests a policy of reducing the growing rural labour force through emigration and creation of new urban spaces in rural areas. Urbanization of rural areas through large scale migration <b>of</b> rural <b>labour</b> can reduce household poverty. Household consumption per capita rises as household members move out <b>of</b> the low <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> agricultural activities and engaged in small scale manufacturing and service sectors.

This analytical framework, which leads to the conclusion that an efficient allocation of labour requires sufficient flexibility in the labour market, contrasts sharply with the approach to human labour of the early classical political economists, who studied value not in terms of supply and demand curves, but rather in terms of the cost of production, expressed in terms of human labour.

The existence of an iceberg type cost in transporting consumption goods from one region to the other, together with increasing returns to scale in production, introduces a centripetal force; this is opposed by a centrifugal force associated with congestion costs: agents living in crowded areas suffer a reduction in their level of utility. In equilibrium, different locations of research and manufacturing firms can result. Where transport costs are higher (congestion costs lower), centripetal forces dominate and all economic activities end up concentrated in one region. As transport costs decrease (congestion costs increase), an equilibrium with activities in both regions becomes more likely. research and development, externalities, regional analysis...|$|E

The influential two-sector development models (Lewis, 1954, Rannis and Fei, 1964) theorised non-neoclassical labour markets in the sectors dominated by subsistence family enterprise (such as agriculture). As output was shared among the family members, the family enterprise aimed to produce as much as possible without regard to the <b>marginal</b> <b>productivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> This led to the concepts of `labour surplus ’ and `disguised unemployment ’ both of which referred to people who were employed with low productivity in the subsistence sector and could therefore be transferred to the modern high productivity sector without output loss in the subsistence sector.
