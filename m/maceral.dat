50|$|The {{study of}} {{vitrinite}} reflectance (or VR) {{is a key}} method for identifying the maximum temperature history of sediments in sedimentary basins. The reflectance of vitrinite was first studied by coal explorationists attempting to diagnose the thermal maturity, or rank, of coal beds. More recently, its utility {{as a tool for}} the study of sedimentary organic matter metamorphism from kerogens to hydrocarbons has been increasingly exploited. The key attraction of vitrinite reflectance in this context is its sensitivity to temperature ranges that largely correspond to those of hydrocarbon generation (i.e. 60 to 120°C). This means that, with a suitable calibration, vitrinite reflectance can be used as an indicator of maturity in hydrocarbon source rocks. Generally, the onset of oil generation is correlated with a reflectance of 0.5-0.6% and the termination of oil generation with reflectance of 0.85-1.1%. The onset of gas generation ('gas window') is typically associated with values of 1.0-1.3% and terminates around 3.0%. However these generation windows vary between source rocks with different kerogen types (vitrinite is typically abundant in 'Type III' kerogen-rich source rocks), so a conversion to 'Transformation Ratio' (TR) can be applied to create a kerogen-specific maturity parameter. The vitrinite reflectance value represents the highest temperature that the vitrinite <b>maceral</b> (and source rock) has experienced, and is routinely used in 1D burial modelling to identify geological unconformities in sedimentary sections.|$|E
50|$|As {{one of the}} long-time {{researchers}} on Jurassic coal measure-derived hydrocarbon reservoirs in NW China, Zhao took Turpan-Hami basin as {{the breakthrough}} point to summarize the basic petroleum geological conditions and distributional regularity of oil/gas accumulations. After doing a comprehensive research and assessment on the favorable plays and drilling targets in 1987, he took the responsibility to write the pre-drilling research report to proof the location of drilling the first scientific exploration well (SEW) in onshore China, and he suggested the Shanshan local structural high {{is the best place}} to drill a wildcat in Turpan-Hami basin. In 1989, the well Taican-1 got the commercial oil flow of 25.9 cubic meters per day in the Jurassic interval, which was the first breakthrough, since the exploration activity had long been stopped in 1950s-1960s. Up to date, Turpan-Hami basin has established a medium oil/gas production unit under PetroChina management with the annual production reaching 3 million tons of oil equivalents. Since the discovery of Shanshan oil field, Zhao had been keeping research on the whole Jurassic strata in NW China in particular, and summarized the favorable conditions for coal measure-derived oil/gas accumulations as the followings: ①the Jurassic prototype basin must exist to accumulate abundant and good-quality source kitchen with coal beds and coaly seams dominantly developed where both the oil-prone and gas-prone <b>maceral</b> materials are rich accumulated; ②the successive basin are moderately developed sitting on the Jurassic prototype basin, which is necessary not only to keep the source rock in an appropriate maturation, but also to maintain the reservoir having certain amount of porosity; ③the good association of source rock-reservoir-cap rock are well reserved for late occurrence of oil/gas migration and accumulation and ④certain degree of tectonic compression is needed to push the oil expulsing in quantity from the coal measure source rocks which have strong absorption on the oil and gas. Based on his research, Zhao proposed six favorable regions for doing further exploration in 1995 in NW China, which have been proved by a number of exploration wells and discoveries to be the best regions where traps the major oil/gas accumulations of Jurassic and Jurassic source rock-related in NW China.According to statistics, so far the proved oil and gas reserves discovered in Zhao’s predicted six zones have exceeded 1.5 billion tons of oil equivalents, which has yearly provided more than 15 million tons of oil equivalents. It is also confirmed that there is no oil and gas reserve output outside these 6 zones. Due to his contribution in pushing exploration of Jurassic coal measure-derived oil/gas reservoirs, he won the First Prize of provincial-level Award (CNPC) in 1995, and an award for significant discoveries of Oil & Gas Fields from CNPC in 1997.|$|E

30|$|Variations in {{the radical}} content of iso-rank <b>macerals</b> are {{indicative}} of differences {{in the degree of}} thermal alteration of the botanical precursors, thus suggesting differences in origin pathways.

There are numerous studies on the ESR properties of coal and constituent <b>macerals</b> in the published literature. However, these studies generally address vitrinite-rich northern hemisphere coals (Austen et al. 1966; Retcofsky et al. 1968, 1981; Silbernagel et al. 1984 a, b, 1986; Kwan and Yen 1979; Fowler et al. 1987; Więckowski et al. 2000; Qiu et al. 2007; Liu et al. 2014; Zhou et al. 2017), which {{have been shown to be}} both compositionally and genetically distinct from southern hemisphere counterparts (Plumstead 1961; Falcon 1986 a; Cairncross and Cadle 1988; Falcon and Ham 1988; Hagelskamp and Snyman 1988; Snyman 1989; Cairncross et al. 1990; Taylor et al. 1998; Van Niekerk et al. 2008; O’Keefe et al. 2013).

Coal petrography was utilized to assess the <b>maceral</b> and char formation distribution of the feed coal samples and their packed-bed combustion unit’s products. The <b>maceral</b> distribution of the feed coal fractions differed from the typical run-of-mine Highveld coal petrographic composition; the smallest size fractions (53 mm and 37. 5 mm) having the highest vitrinite content. <b>Maceral</b> distribution was further divided into total reactive <b>maceral</b> particles, total inert <b>maceral</b> particles, and total inertinite particles. The 53 mm and 37. 5 mm feed coal samples had the highest total reactive <b>maceral</b> particle content. Inert char particles dominated in the packed-bed combustion unit samples due to high inertinite <b>maceral</b> group content of the Highveld coals. Unexpectedly, the 53 mm feed coal sample had higher content of total reactive <b>maceral</b> particles and lower content of total inert <b>maceral</b> particles; whereas the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample had high content of reactive <b>maceral</b> particles and high content of total inert <b>maceral</b> particles. This variation in <b>maceral</b> group content lead to the 53 mm feed coal sample being more reactive (producing more devolatilized and porous chars and thus reacting faster with reactant gases) than the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample. This was due to inert <b>maceral</b> particles restricting the 37. 5 mm feed coal sample from fully softening and reacting with reactant gas. This was also this was attributed to variation in volatile propagation of the three particle sizes. This confirms that a feed coal with smaller particle sizes results in different reactivity, char formation, and better heat transfer during combustion than the feed coal with large particle size range. Another important factor that {{plays a role in}} combustion is <b>maceral</b> association; it was observed that <b>maceral</b> distribution has a great influence on the char formation and its reactivity more than coal particle size.

40|$|Petrographic {{investigations}} of tropical peat deposits from the Tasek Bera Basin, Malaysia, show that petrographic methods can contribute valuable information about paleoecological settings of mire deposits. Comparing modern peat-forming environments and the pre-maceral composition of peat samples allows {{the reconstruction of}} paleoecological conditions, such as floral composition, fires, microbial activity, etc., and gives insight into paleodepositional environments. In the past, <b>maceral</b> ratios of coals {{have been used to}} interpret paleodepositional settings of coal deposits.

In the modern peat deposits of Tasek Bera, divergent petrographic results occur in similar depositional environments, hence, poor correlation occurs between the petrography, the degree of decomposition, and the depositional environment. Furthermore, from the time of peat deposition, peat is subject to considerable alteration. During subsequent diagenesis, preservation of structured and strongly altered material, such as inertinite, gelified material or funginite, is favoured and results in biased coal <b>maceral</b> compositions.
