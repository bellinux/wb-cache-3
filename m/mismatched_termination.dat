40|$|A {{controlled}} impedance {{twisted pair}} shielded cable was tested {{to determine the}} frequency response and effects of <b>mismatched</b> <b>termination.</b> It was found that a long length of this cable, about 100 feet, exhibited a frequency sensitive attenuation roll-off greater than 1. 5 db down at 5 MHz. It was also determined that improper termination resulted in losses of 1 / 2 to 1 db within the frequency range of 200 KHz to greater than 1 - 1 / 2 MHz. The test results indicate a possible problem where mismatched connectors are used in video signal cables...|$|E
40|$|Study of {{radiation}} properties of mismatched microstrip termination {{is carried out}} in warm ionized electron plasma medium. Linearised hydrodynamic theory coupled with vector wave technique is used to investigate radiation patterns and radiated power of a microstrip <b>mismatched</b> <b>termination</b> in one component electron plasma media for different plasma to source frequencies. These properties are {{used to compare the}} performance of an open circuit discontinuity with those of matched microstrip termination. Matched terminations are found more suitable for applications at higher frequencies than an open circuit discontinuity in the plasma medium though in free space they are less suitable...|$|E
40|$|The sum over damped modes, which {{provides}} the main {{contribution to the}} transverse wake of the DDS, {{is replaced by a}} Fourier-like integral of a spectral function over the propagation band of the manifolds. We present comparisons to previous calculations, assessment of appropriate domains of applicability, and applications to the SLAC structure with matched and <b>mismatched</b> manifold <b>terminations.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The {{problem of}} designingbroadband mtdtisection stepped rectrmgrdar {{waveguide}} impedance transformers, when the {{input and output}} gnides have different cutoff frequencies but propagate the same mode, is formulated in general terms for direct optimization hy digital computer. The formulation is sufficiently flexible to allow nonideal junction discon-tinuity effects and <b>mismatched</b> <b>terminations</b> {{to be taken into}} account doring optimization, Constraints placed on the width, height, or length of any section need he dictated ordy by considerations for dominant mode propagation and the requirement of small (hut not necessarily negligible) jonction disconthmities. The objective of the present formrdation is a minimax equal-ripple response over a predetermined frequency band satisfying the constraints seleeted for the particular problem. The ripple search strategy to locate the maximum reflection coefficient within the band and the razor search strategy to minimize it, as described by Baodler and Macdonald [8] in another paper, were employed. Con-strained optimum equal-ripple sohrtions to examples previously published by Yoong [2]-[4] Matthaei et al. [4] and Riblet [5] are presented. They demonstrate the considerable improvements made possible hy the present formulation with regard to performance, reduction in number of sections, and physical size. The approach used in this paper should also find appli-cation in the design of broadband microwave matching or equalizing net-works consisting of noncommensurate components and for which exact synthesis techniques may be unavailable.

5000|$|When {{the signal}} path has {{impedance}} discontinuity, {{in other words}} an impedance <b>mismatch,</b> then a <b>termination</b> impedance with the equivalent amount of impedance is placed {{at the point of}} line discontinuity. This is described as [...] "termination". For example resistors can be placed on computer motherboards to terminate high speed busses. There are several ways of termination depending on how the resistors are connected to the transmission line. Parallel termination and series termination are examples of termination methodologies.|$|R
40|$|Sudden {{changes of}} channel {{coefficients}} in a wideband vectored wireline system (such as G. fast) due {{to changes in}} the terminating impedance of lines outside the vectored group can seriously degrade stability and throughput. This letter presents a model that predicts the impact of <b>termination</b> <b>mismatch</b> based exclusively on crosstalk data for the properly-terminated state. Experimental results confirm a tight fit between model and measurements. The model allows analysis of system performance and stability without dedicated crosstalk measurements for mismatch cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{equivalent}} circuit {{representation of the}} dipole modes of the SLAC damped detuned structure (DDS) which is being fabricated at LAC has been analyzed by three different methods. The first two are based upon a modal analysis: in the first, damped modes are found by a first order perturbation in the cell to damping manifold coupling strength; while in the second, preferred when the coupling strength is large (as {{is the case for}} the SLAC structure) they are determined exactly (a time consuming procedure). The third method, which the authors report here, expresses the wake as a modal sum for modes whose frequencies place them outside the propagation bands of the manifolds (a minor contribution) plus a Fourier like integral of a spectral function over the propagation band of the manifolds (the major contribution). They will present comparisons to previous calculations, assessment of appropriate domains of applicability, and applications to the SLAC structure with matched and <b>mismatched</b> manifold <b>terminations...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} main {{properties}} of the time-domain response of a commercial probe for bulk current injection (BCI) excited with impulsive waveforms. To this end, circuit modeling of the injection device and the calibration jig is exploited to quantify the distortion experienced by the input pulse due to the frequency-dependent behavior of the probe. Suitable feeding conditions are then identified to compensate for those effects, and assure injection of impulsive waveforms with desired characteristics. Circuit simulation of a simple setup is then {{used to analyze the}} effects on pulse shape due to cable length, probe positioning, and <b>mismatching</b> at the <b>terminations</b> of the wiring structure interconnecting the equipment under test to auxiliary equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{detecting}} the local similarity between templates {{in a given}} class and a given image using a hierarchically ordered sequential decision rule is examined. It is proposed that the set of templates be partitioned and a 'representative template' be defined {{for each of the}} partitions. Several levels of partitioning are defined. Elimination of <b>mismatching</b> locations and <b>termination</b> of computation can take place at each level of detection. Each level of testing is over a more restrictive subset of the template class than the previous level. Criteria are given for selecting representative templates, the ordering of components of a template vector for error evaluation, and the threshold sequences to be used in deciding about a 'match'. Suboptimal solutions are given satisfying these criteria. Examples showing recognition of linear features in test patterns and photographs obtained by aerial and spaceborne sensors are provided...|$|R
40|$|The silver paste with {{ceramics}} addition as {{end termination}} {{was performed on}} multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) based on ZnO-B 2 O 3 + Zn 0. 95 Mg 0. 05 TiO 3 + 0. 25 TiO(2) ceramic (ZnBO-ZMT) with Ag 95 -PdO 5 internal electrodes. A green sheet was prepared by tape casting using the ZnBO-ZMT' powders. Ag 95 -PdO 5 was attached on the green sheet as an internal electrode. After lamination, the green chips were pre-sintered at 800 degrees C for 1 h, then samples were dipped the external electrodes and were cofired together at 900 degrees C for 2 h. There is no extra curing process, so the production cost may be cut down and thermal shock of the MLCCs may be reduced. To improve the <b>mismatch</b> between end <b>termination</b> and dielectric body during sintering, the silver paste with different amounts of ceramics, e. g., 20, 30 and 40 wt. %, was added in this study. The mechanical and electrical properties of the MLCCs were investigated subsequently. The results showed that end termination with 40 wt. % ceramic addition has good performances on mechanical properties of MLCC, but equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is a little bit}} higher compared to end termination with 20 and 30 wt. % ceramic addition.
