40|$|Few would {{dispute that}} {{dependent}} children suffer hardship when a parent, particularly a sole parent or substitute, is imprisoned. This paper focuses on how some Western Australian criminal law courts {{have dealt with}} hardship suffered by offenders‟ dependent children. It explores how the judiciary in assessing hardship has applied mercy, the exceptional circumstances test, and a recent legislative provision when considering sentencing a <b>mothering</b> <b>person</b> to a prison term. If found, extreme hardship may mitigate the severity of a prison sentence. This paper argues that gendering processes are at work in criminal law, such as gendering that respects the mothering person-child relationship. The paper concludes by suggesting that gendering processes preserving that relationship has implications for promoting deterrence rather than a term of imprisonment...|$|E

Risk Factors: Persons at increased risk for HCV include injection drug users (IDU; including those who injected only one time or many years ago), recipients of blood transfusions or solid organ transplants before July 1992, recipients of clotting factor concentrates before 1987, patients on long-term hemodialysis, children born to HCV-infected <b>mothers,</b> <b>persons</b> with HIV infection, and persons with liver disease. 2 Testing Recommendations: All adults born during 1945 – 1965 should receive one-time HCV testing even if they lack a history of HCV-exposure risk factors. 1 Testing should also be performed for persons with prior and ongoing exposure risk. ...|$|R

40|$|The goal this {{follow-up}} {{study was to}} relate the mother's marital satisfaction to family health status in a low SES. The random sample {{was made up of}} 30 families with children under 7 years old: 15 considered as sick (Group A) and 15 as healthy (Group B). Both group had similar demographic characteristics (age of father and <b>mother,</b> <b>persons</b> per family group and age of children) and SES. Results showed that mothers were those mainly in charge of their family groups. Mothers of Group A were significantly less understanding and more dissatisfied than those of Group B (p <. 05 and p <. 01). Mothers of Group A had significantly more arguments with their partners than those of Group B (p <. 006). Health care was learned less from the child's own mother in group A than in B (p <. 05). Health was considered by mothers of Group A as something that "must be taken care of" more than by those of Group B (p <. 01). The behaviours of mothers in choosing one of the health systems was similar in both groups. Dissatisfied mothers were associated more with sick family members during the 6 month follow-up. It is suggested that the satisfaction of the mother is a factor that needs further investigation because health is managed by mothers is the large majority of families...|$|R
