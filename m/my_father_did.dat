500|$|In his autobiography, King {{says that}} in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic {{candidate}} John F. Kennedy: [...] "I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>did,</b> but I never made one." [...] King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying [...] "Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>did</b> raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If PÃ¡ll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to sit down at my table with his partner as anybody else does with their partner." ...|$|E

We will lie low, and dip under, until the flood has passed and wasted itself over our heads. We are not wanted. In the world to-day we are a belated phenomenon, like April snow. Perhaps {{it is time for}} us to die. If we resist, and try to cling to the fringes, as I have done so far, we are shaken off rudely, or allowed to hang on {{neglected}} and disowned. If we attempt to live apart, as <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>did,</b> we wither early into amiable ghosts.... We will not accept anything cheaper or cruder than our own conscience. We have dedicated ourselves to the truth, to living {{in the presence of the}} noblest things we can conceive. If we can't live so, we won't live at all.|$|E

2500|$|... 'To {{compel the}} people {{to give up their}} goods, (General) Zarrouk put many notables in irons and locked them up; one of them was my {{grandfather}}. Their ordeal lasted I don't know how many days. Then my family took a sheet and wrapped up all their jewels and all their land titles. [...] My father had the task of taking all this to Zarrouk to obtain my grandfather's freedom. He {{made his way to the}} encampment where a number of tents stood. [...] Above one of them flew a flag. [...] This was the tent of General Zarrouk, who took all our fortune and freed his prisoners. Ten days later, my grandfather died from the appalling treatment he had suffered. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> <b>did</b> not escape unscathed either. He was conscripted into Zarrouk's army where he served for nineteen years, the longest and hardest years of his life. [...] He urged me to study. [...] 'I don't want you to be brought down to the level of a beast of burden one day' he said. 'I don't want to see you like me, condemned to wear a uniform all your days.' I assured him I would do my best by devoting myself completely to my studies.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right. I {{choose to}} know about these things; for though <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>did</b> make such a con-found-ed will, that's no reason I shouldn't know how things are going." ...|$|E

Her mother came to him for advice, and he had heard evil things spoken of you in Baslehurst. You will see that I am very frank with you. And I will take some credit to myself too.
