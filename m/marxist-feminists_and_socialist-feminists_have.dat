Auf einer abstrakten Ebene wird versucht die permanente Abwertung der Care-Arbeit durch eine Verknüpfung marxistisch-feministischer und psychoanalytischer Perspektiven analytisch fassbar zu machen. Zunächst wird dabei das Wert-Abspaltungstheorem von Roswitha Scholz im Kontext marxistisch-feministischer Debatten, skizziert und kritisiert und in zweifacher Weise (formanalytisch und psychoanalytisch) re-konzeptualisiert Im Ergebnis wird dabei die Marx'sche Wertform als Wert-Abjektionsform konzipiert, die als soziale Form die strukturierende und konstituierende Kraft der Care-Arbeit darstellt und so deren permanente Abwertung erklärt.

On an abstract level of argumentation <b>and</b> linking <b>marxist-feminist</b> <b>and</b> psychoanalytical perspectives, it explains the permanent devaluation of care-work.

In conclusion the marxist value-form always appears as a value-abjection-form, which as social form is a constitutive and structuring force of care work in patriarchal capitalism and explains their permanent devaluation. The article discusses current analyses and assessments of the contemporary 'multiple crisis' from the perspectives of feminist and neo-Gramscian International Political Economy (IPE). We argue for a conceptual linkage of these approaches in order to analyze the role of gendered subjectivation in currently dominant forms of crisis management. The Troika's policies in Greece are presented as an example for how the - implicitly organized - redistribution of responsibilities for socially necessary care- and reproduction work can be understood as 'subjectivation as crisis management': the displacement of crisis management into the gendered subjects themselves.

40|$|This thesis explores, from {{a feminist}} perspective, some {{implications}} {{on the status}} of women in selected dance forms, and addresses the perceptions of women as 'inferior' and 'subordinate'. One of the intentions behind the work was, indeed, to challenge prevailing perceptions and create an awareness of sexism, capitalism and patriarchy, especially for the uncritical and uninformed who have become its victims. Part 1 offers an analysis of the premises upon which social, political and economic inequality are founded and consolidated, with specific reference to sexual inequality and sexual prejudice. Utilising a <b>Marxist-feminist</b> <b>and</b> semiotic approach, the machinations of the traditional mass media are linked to negative imaging of the female body in support of the sexist, patriarchal, capitalist male manipulator, who benefits from women's subordinate social status. Part 2 addresses the issue of sexual politics, and the implications for dance research and performance. The researcher offers a descriptive analysis of four specific dance forms, which serve to highlight the socialisation and educational processes that shape our perceptions and instruct our lives. A set of questionnaires was sent to fourteen autonomous dance institutions, including those attached to national performing arts councils. The thesis concludes with a summary {{of the results of the}} questionnaires that were distributed amongst female dancers, dance students and choreographers. The researcher questions our culture's preoccupation with the female body image, and posits the urgent need for an assessment of this situation, and an education which will create a better understanding and a more harmonious climate for development. ...|$|R

40|$|The free choice {{ideology}} {{dictates that}} any time a woman makes a choice {{it is an}} act of feminism. The idea that personal choice presupposes the faraway horizons of freedom and its guarantee, as well as the undoubted potentials of women’s empowerment, makes up the central position of the critique in this essay. Our text is divided into two parts. In {{the first part of the}} paper we are going to outline the basic assumptions of neoliberalism, in order to use them as foundations for the argument about its feminist affirmation. We will illustrate the relationship between neoliberalism and feminism by using the example of women's entrepreneurship, which is usually interpreted as a strategy of undeniable emancipation. In the second part of the essay, as a concrete response to ‘neoliberal feminism’, we are going to point to the progressive potential of social reproduction theory <b>and</b> <b>socialist-feminist</b> practice to be further developed out of it. Given the intention of this text is not to exhibit a detailed historical-comparative analysis of feminism, we are merely going to use concrete examples to illustrate the link between feminism and neoliberalism, and to map the shift from early second-wave feminism to identity politics and the cultural turn that swallows up the critique of political economy.   Article received: June 2, 2017; Article accepted: June 16, 2017; Published online: October 15, 2017; Original scholarly paper How to cite this article: Čakardić, Ankica.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{connections}} between midwifery and the ethical demands attendant to poetic practice. Through verse and prose, I unfold a figuration of the midwife that traverses the boundaries between Levinasian heteronomy and Deleuzian heteromorphism, and is a constitutive factor in sites {{of resistance to the}} biomedical territorialisation of the creative body. Chief archival and methodological components that inform the thesis include: a historiography of childbirth - tracing the development of ‘holistic’ and ‘interventionist’ paradigms, and the ideological underpinnings of the phallocratic takeover of the birthing room in certain Western countries; idiographic insights gathered from dialogues with maternal practitioners and mothers, including residents of The Farm in Tennessee - where I participated in a midwifery workshop week; an experiential inquiry into Holotropic Breathwork - to facilitate access to non-ordinary states of consciousness; and a negotiation between <b>Marxist-feminist</b> <b>and</b> poststructuralist articulations of ethico-political agency. Subject matter ranges from a consideration of the ethical import of the placental economy to the bio-intelligent tissue of the psoas, the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from Massachusetts Bay to the legacy of the ‘Twilight Sleep’ movement. Sustained critical attention is devoted to Mina Loy’s “Parturition”, and contemporary poets that have acknowledged Loy as an influence, such as Lara Glenum. I suggest that, despite the absence of a birth attendant on the symbolic level, Loy’s poem resonates with the investments of midwifery, instating a ‘subjectin- process’ that woks through and against abstruse and instrumental discourses, defying both the technocratic erasure of maternal knowing and the fetishistic reduction of labour to an end-product. Art’s capacity for opening up a corporeallycharged zone of between-ness is further elaborated in an essay on Andrei Tarkovsky’s Stalker - through which the treatment of spatiotemporality is aligned with the imperatives of midwifery guardianship. ...|$|R

It has been considered by scholar Beth Miller the least understood of Buñuel's films, and consequently one of the most underrated, due to a [...] "consistent failure to apprehend its political <b>and,</b> especially, its <b>socialist-feminist</b> statement". Buñuel <b>had</b> wanted to make a film of Benito Pérez Galdós' novel Tristana as early as 1952, even though he considered Galdós' book the author's weakest, in Buñuel's words: [...] "of the 'I love you, my little pigeon' genre, very kitsch". After finishing Viridiana and {{in the wake of the}} scandal its release caused in 1962, the Spanish censor flatly turned down this project, and Buñuel had to wait for 8 years before he could receive backing from the Spanish production company Epoca Films. The censors had threatened to deny permission for the film on the grounds that it encouraged duelling, so Buñuel had to approach the subject matter very gingerly, in addition to making concessions to his French/Italian/Spanish producers, who insisted on casting two of the three primary roles with actors not of Buñuel's choosing: Franco Nero and Catherine Deneuve. On this occasion, however, Deneuve and Buñuel had a more mutually satisfactory working relationship, with Deneuve telling an interviewer, [...] "but in the end, you know, it was actually rather a wonderful shoot.

5000|$|In the United States, Eugene V. Debs, one of {{the most}} famous American socialists, led a {{movement}} centered on democratic socialism and made five bids for President, once in 1900 as candidate of the Social Democratic Party and then four more times on the ticket of the Socialist Party of America. The socialist industrial unionism of Daniel DeLeon in the United States represented another strain of early democratic socialism in this period. It favoured a form of government based on industrial unions, but which also sought to establish this government after winning at the ballot box. The tradition continued to flourish in the Socialist Party of America, especially under the leadership of Norman Thomas, and later the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Upon the DSA's founding in 1983, Michael Harrington <b>and</b> <b>socialist-feminist</b> author Barbara Ehrenreich were elected as co-chairs of the organization. Currently philosopher and activist Cornel West is one of several honorary chairs. The organization does not run its own candidates in elections but instead [...] "fights for reforms... that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people." [...] More recently, the US Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont described himself as a democratic socialist but his political positions and admiration for Nordic capitalism correspond with that of a social democrat.In Britain, the democratic socialist tradition was represented in particular by William Morris's Socialist League, and in the 1880s by the Fabian Society, and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP) founded by Keir Hardie in the 1890s, of which George Orwell would later be a prominent member. In the early 1920s, the guild socialism of G. D. H. Cole attempted to envision a socialist alternative to Soviet-style authoritarianism, while council communism articulated democratic socialist positions in several respects, notably through renouncing the vanguard role of the revolutionary party and holding that the system of the Soviet Union was not authentically socialist. During the 1970s and 1980s, prominent democratic socialists within the Labour movement included Michael Foot and Tony Benn, considered by many to have redefined democratic socialism into an actionable manifesto which was, however, voted overwhelmingly against in the General Election of 1983 and referred to as 'The longest suicide note in history'. The modern Labour Party has often referred to itself as a democratic socialist party throughout the 20th century, and explicitly identifies as such in Clause IV of its Rule Book.|$|R
40|$|I {{examine the}} ways the National Association of Black and White Men Together (NABWMT), a U. S. gay male organization, and its {{multi-ethnic}} membership developed and conducted antiracism workshops in the 1980 s and safer sex workshops (targeting gay men with White, Black, Chicano/Latino, Asian, and Two-Spirited/indigenous identities) in the 1990 s to conduct cultural and counterhegemonic forms of education. I draw upon the works of Antonio Gramsci, Stuart Hall, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, and Paul Gilroy on culture, education, and social exclusion. Gramsci and Hall suggest that cultural education is a necessary component for any anti-capitalist struggle. However, hooks, Sandoval, and Gilroy point to the liberal tendency in such cultural work. In paricular, hooks, indicates the expressive salience of gay-ethnic masculinity in developing this liberal tendency. Using qualitative analysis of archival data, I find that these workshops did serve {{as a vehicle for}} organizing selected communities around certain progressive politics. However in the long term, the workshops were not as successful to go beyond the liberal tendency of improving interpersonal relationships regarding racial-ethnicity and gendered sexual identities. Consequently, this paper seeks to augment 2 ̆ 2 multiple intersection 2 ̆ 2 theorizing (such as by Audre Lorde and Cherríe Moraga) to 2 ̆ 2 include 2 ̆ 2 not only gay men of color, or to compare them in relations to standpoint theories by lesbian-of-color, but to highlight also the constitutive aspect of their gay-ethnic masculinity and gendered sexualities as part of a longer history of antiracist movements and emancipatory politics.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{position}} of women teachers in the primary service {{within the context of}} their access to power and decision-making. Use is made of <b>socialist-feminist</b> <b>and</b> labour market theories in order to develop a qualified reserve army of labour thesis which along with an analysis of the various ways in which power can be exercised, serves as a theoretical base to guide empirical research. Empirical study using historical documents and journals to trace the implications of state policy for women within education, allows plausible explanations to be made as to why women teachers in the primary service have minimal access to power and decision-making. It is suggested that women's access to power within the primary education system is obstructed by problems relating to personnel and structure within the school itself, the primary teachers' professional union, and {{at the level of the}} state. In order to overcome these problems, affirmative action is needed to promote the interests of women teachers. This needs to be pursued simultaneously with efforts to alter the power structure within the primary schools. By moving towards a more democratic form of school organisation, present inequalities in the access to, and the exercise of power, can be eliminated wi thin the primary service. To the extent that scope is left for future research to be done, especially within the theoretical context of power, this study should be viewed as being both explorative and suggestive in the issues that it has raised...|$|R
40|$|As the Australian {{population}} ages, {{policy and}} human service {{practice in the}} field of aged care assumes an increasingly important and relevant position. In this monograph I argue that women who are providing care for aged spouses, parents or relatives in their (or their carer 2 ̆ 7 s) own homes, are doing essential, hard and stressful work, work which is unpaid and often unacknowledged, and that the Australian welfare system is now structured around the invisible unpaid labour of such women. The rhetoric of Australian political parties is focussing more and more on the notion of an ideal 2 ̆ 7 family 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 community 2 ̆ 7 and a consequent return to 2 ̆ 7 old values 2 ̆ 7. Coupled with this is a continual demand for economic rationalism, pragmatism and for effective and efficient government: a move which coincides with a more neoconservative approach to welfare. These trends can be summarised as an attempt by the state to withdraw from formal services as much as possible and to minimise the role of government while attempting, at the same time, to maximise so-called family support systems within the informal sector. Increasingly this is becoming a more politically popular and financially expedient alternative for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s policy makers as a way of reducing expenditure on welfare. The <b>socialist-feminist</b> framework I <b>have</b> adopted identifies the relationship between women, the unpaid work they undertake as carers, and the state, which relies on their unpaid care {{in order to maintain the}} current welfare system. The analysis also identifies future issues for Australian women within this complex relationship...|$|R
40|$|During {{the eleven}} years of Margaret Thatcher 2 ̆ 7 s administrations in Britain, playwright Caryl Churchill had {{perhaps the most}} {{productive}} period in her career to date and achieved an unprecedented degree of success. This phenomenon is unusual since Churchill is a self-described <b>socialist-feminist</b> <b>and</b> these were times of increasing conservatism in the theatre, as in society as a whole. This dissertation seeks to explain this apparent contradiction. ^ It begins with a survey of changes in British society during the Thatcher years, including the effects which Thatcher 2 ̆ 7 s policies and attitudes had on women, feminists, the left, and artists (especially theatre workers). Next, it examines Churchill 2 ̆ 7 s collaborative writing strategies against the context formed by an ideology of radical individualism. Three specific plays from the Thatcher Years are then considered {{in terms of the}} society 2 ̆ 7 s influences on them and their potential impact on contemporary culture. Top Girls (1982) is discussed as an attempt to reclaim the term 2 ̆ 2 feminism 2 ̆ 2 from a new breed of conservative business women and return it to the materialist-feminists who were once the core of the British women 2 ̆ 7 s movement. Fen (1983) is examined in terms of regional policy, class and gender issues, and the reconfiguration of 2 ̆ 2 family 2 ̆ 2 in Britain in the 1980 s. Serious Money (1987) was Churchill 2 ̆ 7 s greatest commercial success, and the reasons for its popularity form the basis for the discussion of this play. In each case, considerable attention is given to issues of critical and public reception. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} theme of freedom in Goliarda Sapienza's narrative, {{focusing}} in particular on three works: Lettera aperta (1967), L'arte della gioia (1998, posthumous) and Io, Jean Gabin (2010, posthumous). The analysis concentrates on the interplay between body and power in processes of identity formation; the main aspects taken into consideration are gender, sexuality and political ideology, with specific attention to the power involved in human relationships. This thesis comprises four chapters. The first three develop a close textual analysis of individual works, each one progressing from {{the exploration of the}} internal composition of the self to the analysis of identity in its interpersonal and socio-political dimension. The fourth chapter engages with a comparative analysis of the same works’ narrative structures, accounting for the role of writing in the evolution of Sapienza’s narrative. I identify the pivotal tension of Sapienza's works in the ideal of freedom, and propose to define her narrative as Epicurean and anarchic, characteristics that place it at the intersection of post-structuralist <b>and</b> <b>Marxist-feminist</b> discourses. Overall, I argue in favour of Sapienza's originality and significance within the context of 20 th -century Italian literature. I suggest an affinity between Sapienza's works and the literary legacy of Pirandello and Svevo, as well as certain tenets of postmodern fiction, but also a significant difference, concerning the presence of a tension towards agency and subjectivity, extraneous to the trajectory of the modern and postmodern subject. From a position of marginality and ex-centricity, Sapienza gives voice to a radical aspiration to individual and social transformation, in which writing and literary communication are granted a central role. Her works trace the parable of a strenuous deconstruction of oppressive norms and structures, aimed at retrieving a space of powerful bodily desire, which constitutes the foundation of the process of becoming a subject.

40|$|The Hunger Games have {{captured}} the imagination of millions of youth in the heartlands of capitalism. Set in a post-apocalyptic North America, it presents a powerful allegory of neo-liberal times, in which a tiny, super-wealthy minority located in 'The Capitol' brutally control {{the rest of the population}} in order to exploit their labour intensively whilst keeping them in poverty and subjection. A means to enforce this domination is the yearly 'Hunger Games' - a horrific TV reality show in which a male and a female teenager are chosen from each of 12 districts to battle to the death in a technologically manipulated arena beset with dangers, as punishment for a previous uprising. Katniss Everdeen, the story's young heroine, embodies the way in which such oppression can bear the seeds of its own destruction - from survival in the face of poverty, to resistance, rebellion, and ultimately revolution. This paper analyses the politics and pedagogy of The Hunger Games, examining in particular its portrayal of gender as it interplays with class, race and youth. Drawing on <b>Marxist-feminist</b> theory (Carpenter <b>and</b> Mojab, 2011), it explores The Hunger Games' depiction of capitalist, racist patriarchal social relations; of the learning and consciousness that even the most dire 'limit situations' (Freire, 1972) can enable; and of the potential for individual alienation to develop into collective resistance and rebellion. In particular, the paper highlights the role of women and their socially reproductive labour, both as an absolute necessity for the Capitol, and as an inspiration for the solidarity and revolutionary activity required to overthrow the Capitol's rule. The paper argues that The Hunger Games offers a sophisticated analysis of contemporary society, and of the disposability of youth and other 'excess' populations (Bauman, 2004; Giroux, 2009); of the inseparability of struggles around gender and racial inequalities from those around class exploitation; and of the potential of women's struggles in particular to contribute to the transformation of society. As such, the books and film offer an important pedagogical tool that challenges not only received gender stereotypes under neo-liberalism, but also offers a vision of how young people - male and female - may not be simply duped by neo-liberal ideology and the restricted gender roles that predominate in its popular culture...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This {{literary}} study {{explores the}} female condition in four naturalistic novels, namely, Stephen Crane’s Maggie: A Girl of the Street, Edith Wharton’s The House of Mirth, Kate Chopin’s The Awakening, and Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary. The {{purpose is to}} reconsider the context of “woman” in this genre by extending from dialectical views with positive and negative connotations towards a reimagining of the “female” {{with some degree of}} agency despite claims of “determined conditions” in naturalism. The study’s examination of the heroine’s interplay with “forces” in society illustrates that as exemplified in my chosen novels, these “forces” do not demonstrate total control of an individual’s fate. In exploring the female condition in the novels, the study goes through three steps: namely, examining the condition of the female protagonist in society, analysing the relation between suicide and the role of free will, and investigating the role of the spiritual dimension within the frame of Gaudium et Spes for issues raised in the novels. In relation to the female condition, the study incorporates important issues on female disempowerment and displacement namely, commodification, conspicuous consumption, consumerism, and rugged individualism culled from <b>Marxist-Feminist</b> criticism, Foucault’s <b>and</b> Beauvoir’s concepts on power or free will, and discourses on spirituality within the frame of Gaudium et Spes to clarify issues on marriage, family, human dignity, and self-preservation raised in the novels. It is found that the female protagonist’s non-conformism and defiance of societal “forces” are expressions of willpower that compromises self-preservation and continuity. Despite the socio-cultural disadvantages experienced by the female protagonist, her tragic fate is the result of her choice that suggests a clamour for spiritual regeneration. Her misdirected passions and quest for individuality and self-fulfilment imply a need for something more, which links to the spiritual dimension of her nature. Spirituality within the tradition of Gaudium et Spes highlights the good of the human person with the acknowledgment of divine will, the same aspiration (with emphasis on social awareness) that naturalism conveys for humanity, with its lens however on individual will. Hence, the criticism on naturalism’s reductionist treatment of the non-physical and intense focus on the physical social realities actually point to the same aspiration that Gaudium et Spes projects – the betterment of the human condition and humanity as a whole...|$|R
