40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} effect of <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate,</b> magnesium/pyridoxine {{combination}} and magnesium sulfate on fibroblast morphofunctional characteristics in cell culture of fibroblasts (McCoy line). Material and methods. The study of fibroblasts (McCoy line) {{with the addition of}} magnesium-containing preparations (<b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate,</b> magnesium/pyridoxine combination, magnesium sulphate) to the culture medium was performed using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Results. When adding into the media <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate</b> or magnesium/pyridoxine combination, significant changes in morphofunctional state of fibroblasts were noted, which were absent when adding magnesium sulfate.

40|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP) is {{a manifestation}} of the hereditary syndrome of differentiated or undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (CTD). Genetic defect of synthesis and/or degradation of extracellular matrix is the basis of the CTD. MVP is a frequent manifestation of CTD and often is its the main manifestation, despite of the involvement of other organs and systems. Micronutrient deficiencies, especially magnesium one is the mostly important in CTD manifestations. Pathogenetic pharmacotherapy should be comprehensive. Magnesium drugs must necessarily be included in the treatment regimen. Analysis of domestic and international study data on <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate</b> use in patients with MVP is presented.

40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of hydrates, their multifaceted nature and hydration/dehydration behaviour is still not fully understood. For the example of orotic acid monohydrate and its lithium and magnesium hydrate salts, we show how NMR crystallography, namely a combination of solid-state NMR with a focus here on 1 H Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR experiments and first-principles DFT GIPAW (gauge-including projector augmented wave) calculations, can play a valuable role in the characterization of hydrate systems. Starting from lithium orotate monohydrate, a rigid system with {{a limited number of}} tightly bound water molecules, the general feasibility of this approach was demonstrated. Moving onto more complex hydrate structures, mobility in the orotic acid monohydrate was observed, while for the most complex hydrate, <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate</b> octahydrate, a loss of associated water molecules was observed after an overnight MAS NMR experiment. A combined study by experimental MAS NMR, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed changes after vacuum drying as well as after storage of a vacuum dried sample under ambient conditions. Specifically, TGA showed the vacuum dried sample to correspond to a dihydrate, for which no structure has yet been determined by single-crystal diffraction. An NMR crystallography analysis showed that a combination of putative symmetric and asymmetric dihydrate structures explains the observed changes in the experimental MAS NMR spectra...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} an Integrative Cardiac Wellness Program (ICWP) for cardiothoracic surgery patients on postoperative recovery, bleeding risk, satisfaction and participation in rehabilitation programs. Design: An open label study whereby ICWP participants were compared to a historical control group that received usual care at the same hospital. Methods: Patients enrolled at pre-admission clinics took metabolic supplements (CoQ 10, <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate,</b> alpha lipoic acid, omega 3 fatty acids) three times daily from enrolment until surgery and for 4 weeks afterwards. Between postoperative days 3 - 7, patients received individualised health education from a naturopath followed by a phone call post-discharge. The control group consisted of elective cardiothoracic patients receiving usual care prior to the ICWP commencing. Data was collected from medical records, a survey and interviews. Results: Data from 922 patients were analysed. ICWP participants (n= 337) were well matched with controls (n= 585) for age, gender and history of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and smoking. Multivariate analysis found that CABG ICWP patients had a relative reduction of 42 % for postoperative inotrope (cardiac stimulants) support compared to controls (p<. 0. 001). Similarly, the ICWP valve surgery patients had 40 % relative reduction {{in the incidence of}} postoperative inotrope support compared to controls (p= 0. 02). There {{was no significant difference between}} the treatment and control groups in the incidence of serious bleeding events, defined as return to theatre due to haemorrhage or blood transfusion requirements. ICWP patients gave positive feedback of their experience and there was a 46 % increase in attendance at rehabilitation programs compared to controls (p= 0. 033). Conclusions: The ICWP is safe, improves postoperative heart function, is well accepted by patients and has long-term patient benefits by improving attendance at rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Objective Perioperative {{therapy with}} {{antioxidants}} and metabolic substrates {{has the potential}} to reduce oxidative stress and improve recovery from cardiac surgery, particularly in elderly and high risk cases. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the effect of perioperative metabolic therapy at a biochemical, clinical and economic level in cardiac surgical patients. Methods Patients (n = 117, mean age 65 ᠱ. 0 years, 74 % male) undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and/or valve surgery in 2004 - 2006 were randomised to receive in double blinded fashion, while on the waiting list for surgery (approximately two months) and one month after surgery, either metabolic therapy (coenzyme Q 10, <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate,</b> lipoic acid, omega- 3 fatty acids and selenium) or placebo. Biochemical and clinical outcomes were assessed. Results Cardiac surgery increased oxidative stress and decreased plasma levels of key antioxidants. Metabolic therapy for a mean of 76 ᠷ. 5 days increased antioxidant levels preoperatively so that the adverse effect of surgery on redox status was attenuated. Metabolic therapy reduced plasma troponin I, 24 hours postoperatively from 1. 5 (1. 2 - 1. 8) (geometric mean 95 % CI) 姯L, to 2. 1 (1. 8 - 2. 6) 姯L (P = 0. 003) and shortened the mean length of postoperative hospital stay by 1. 2 days from 8. 1 (7. 5 - 8. 7) to 6. 9 (6. 4 - 7. 4) days (P = 0. 004) and reduced hospital costs. Metabolic therapy was inexpensive and had no clinically significant side effects. Conclusions Perioperative metabolic therapy for cardiac surgery is safe and inexpensive and is associated with improved redox status, reduced myocardial damage, and shortened length of postoperative hospital stay.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that with the}} demographic shift towards an ageing population prevalence of age-related cardiovascular disease will increase. Whether cardioprotective strategies are still effective in elderly {{is a matter of}} debate. We have previously demonstrated that <b>magnesium</b> <b>orotate</b> (MO) was cardioprotective in adult rat hearts subjected to acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. The present study was purported to assess the persistence of the protective effects of MO in old Sprague-Dawley rats. To this aim isolated hearts from old (20 - 24 mo) vs. adult (4 - 6 mo) animals subjected to a protocol of 30 min I/ 120 min R were randomized to receive throughout the postischemic reperfusion: no intervention, MO, MgCl 2 and orotic acid (OA). The effects on functional recovery and infarct size were compared to the ones elicited by CsA (0. 2 μM), the classic mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) desensitizer. In a second group of experiments, cardiac mitochondria were isolated at 15 min of postischemic reperfusion for respiratory function and calcium retention capacity assessment. Acute administration of MO, MgCl 2, but not OA (5 mM each) at the very onset of reperfusion was associated with a significant recovery of left ventricular developed pressure and infarct size reduction in both adult and old animals; protection was comparable to the one elicited by CsA. In mitochondria energized with complex I (but not complex II) substrates isolated from the old animals, all these pharmacological agents protected against the loss of outer mitochondrial membrane integrity, albeit in a lesser degree compared to adult mitochondria. MO, MgCl 2, and CsA also prevented the calcium triggered-opening of the mPTP. In conclusion, magnesium containing-pharmacological agents as well as CsA were effective in protecting mitochondrial function at reperfusion in the aged rodent heart.
