5|$|MOHH {{may have}} been the first hip-hop dance {{convention}}, {{but it is not the}} only one that exists. Urban Dance Camp (UDC) is a six-week-long German-based dance convention held every year in Lörrach, a small town on the border of France and Switzerland. In a report on the event by a local paper, Bettina Kraft, the <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> UDC, <b>estimated</b> that 85% <b>of</b> the participants were from outside of Germany. In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase, a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers, dance crews, and UDC teachers. Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo, Les Twins, I.aM.mE, b-boy Lilou, and b-boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past.|$|R

50|$|Dining {{was still}} served in The large dining room, and dancing was {{scheduled}} for Saturday nights, with music by Bernie Collins, a well-known band leader. The following year the hotel saw 14 conventions booked at the hotel. Rates for a room plus meals were $10 and $12 per day (for a room without a private bathroom). Private baths took up approximately 30% of the hotel, and rates for those rooms were $15 and $18 for singles and $22 to $40 for a double. The <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> the hotel <b>estimated</b> that it would cost $50,000 {{to get to the}} hotel ready for the summer season, that cost involving painting, papering, upholstering, plumbing, and restocking the inventory.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of the Fama and French threefactor model in South Africa for individual securities. We employed a multivariate time series methodology similar to Fama and French. The empirical results contradict the theoretical proposition of the Fama-French model and are inconsistent with the results documented by most studies in the developed and some emerging markets. The size and value premia are very weak when included in the regression model. Furthermore, the Fama and French three-factor model is unable to explain the return-generating process of securities trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. This has important implication for corporate managers, investors as well as fund and portfolio <b>managers</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> cost <b>of</b> equity, rate of return and portfolio allocation.

5|$|All of BA's Concorde fleet {{have been}} grounded, drained of {{hydraulic}} fluid and their airworthiness certificates withdrawn. Jock Lowe, ex-chief Concorde pilot and <b>manager</b> <b>of</b> the fleet <b>estimated</b> in 2004 {{that it would}} cost £10–15million to make G-BOAF airworthy again. BA maintain ownership and have stated {{that they will not}} fly again {{due to a lack of}} support from Airbus. On 1 December 2003, Bonhams held an auction of British Airways Concorde artefacts, including a nose cone, at Kensington Olympia in London. Proceeds of around £750,000 were raised, with the majority going to charity. G-BOAD is currently on display at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York. In 2007, BA announced that the advertising spot at Heathrow where a 40% scale model of Concorde was located would not be retained; the model is now on display at the Brooklands Museum, in Surrey, England.|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 19 - 21, 1979 / Town and Country Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe {{most devastating}} task ever {{given to the}} {{computer}} system <b>manager,</b> is that <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the manpower and time to develop software. Software development has become almost completely {{out of control in}} terms <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the manpower and time needed for the complete job, from interpretation of the requirements to the operational readiness date. Just as the hardware design engineer never reaches the ultimate design and thus never concludes his job, so goes the software designer. The difference is, hardware design managers have grown up in this environment and therefore know the pitfalls and stopping points of producing a good, reliable product. The software design manager is less qualified because the field is relatively new, it is very complex, and computer hardware technology is expanding so rapid that software designers cannot catch up. This paper is designed to provide the software development manager categories and rules <b>of</b> thumb for <b>estimating</b> time and manpower requirements for each category of software development. In addition to establishing the standard milestones such as requirements definition, specification, design, coding, checkout, verification and validation, consideration is given on how to keep the Ford requirement from turning into a Cadillac capability...|$|R
30|$|Management {{strategies}} of fisheries may be established based on biological, sociological, or economic objectives. To achieve the objectives including the maximum long-term catch and socio-economic considerations (e.g., maximizing jobs), the biological approach will {{often lead to}} higher fishing levels and corresponding lower yields. Therefore, fisheries <b>managers</b> require <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> harvest levels that provide maximum long-term yield {{as well as those}} at which the risk of stock depletion is low (Griffiths 1997). For many fish populations, there is insufficient information available to determine optimal harvesting policies. Much attention has therefore been given in the literature to determining biological reference points (BRPs) that can be readily calculated from available information (Quinn and Deriso 1999). These BRPs are usually fishing mortalities or abundance levels (thresholds) and may be specified either as a target for optimal harvesting or a danger zone to be avoided (Leaman 1993).|$|R
40|$|Stock-based {{compensation}} {{creates an}} incentive for <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> companies to maximize {{the value of their}} company’s stock. Prior research has hypothesized that <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> insurers manipulate reserve levels to achieve organizational goals, including minimization of taxes and income smoothing. The current study tests whether the exposure of stock-based compensation held by executives to stock price is associated with the accuracy <b>of</b> reserve <b>estimates.</b> Our findings suggest that insurance companies whose stock-based executive compensation packages are more sensitive to the value of their stock report greater under-reserving errors than other insurers, other things equal...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{hydrological}} forecasts, or outlooks, {{can potentially}} provide water <b>managers</b> with <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> river flows and water resources for a lead time of several months ahead. An experimental modelling tool for national hydrological outlooks {{has been developed}} which combines a hydrological model <b>estimate</b> <b>of</b> subsurface water storage across Britain {{with a range of}} seasonal rainfall forecasts to provide <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> area-wide hydrological conditions up to a few months ahead. The link is made between a deficit in sub-surface water storage and a requirement for additional rainfall over subsequent months to enable sub-surface water storage and river flow to return to mean monthly values. The new scheme is assessed over a recent period which includes the termination of the drought that affected much of Britain in {{the first few months of}} 2012. An illustration is provided of its use to obtain return-period <b>estimates</b> <b>of</b> the ‘rainfall required’ to ease drought conditions; these are well in excess of 200 years for several regions of the country, for termination within a month of 1 April 2012, and still exceed 40 years for termination within three months. National maps of sub-surface water storage anomaly show for the first time the current spatial variability of drought severity. They can also be used to provide an indication of how a drought situation might develop in the next few months given a range of possible future rainfall scenarios...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{introduces}} the authors’ {{approach to the}} study of business success factors for small and medium sized enterprises. The approach is based on the currently dominant practice <b>of</b> <b>estimating</b> the success <b>of</b> an enterprise as its ability to produce profit. The authors have analyzed the success criteria used by <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> Russian small and medium sized enterprises based on the survey carried out among the <b>managers</b> <b>of</b> 212 small and medium sized enterprises in the period of September – November, 2014, and described the correlation between the business success of small and medium sized enterprises and the level of their managers’ social responsibility. To estimate the social responsibility, the authors used the values of average salaries and the proportion between the salaries of average executives and those <b>of</b> their <b>managers.</b> Hence, a nonlinear relation has been established between the business success of a small and medium sized enterprises and the manager's social responsibility...|$|R
