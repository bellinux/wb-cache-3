50|$|Recent {{demographic}} trends {{have placed}} Bosmansdam {{in a rather}} unusual situation. Recent history has seen the numbers of Afrikaans speaking learners {{in areas such as}} Table View (including Parklands and other areas), Milnerton and even Bothasig slowly decline. This has led to Afrikaans <b>medium</b> <b>classes</b> being ceased at both Table View High School and J.G. Meiring High School. Even President High School has been forced to become dual medium. Bosmansdam is now the only High School that offers Afrikaans <b>medium</b> <b>classes</b> in the Milnerton - Table View - Bothasig area (including Edgemead, Richwood and all areas in between). According to legislation regarding feeder areas, this makes all Afrikaans speaking students in these areas a priority for admittance to Bosmansdam. This could result in significant savings to parents in these areas that have to pay for transport to far-away schools such as Jan van Riebeeck High School and Durbanville High School.|$|R

40|$|Whether one {{is talking}} of early, late or partial French {{immersion}} or minority francophone programs in western Canada a fundamental problem that plagues the typical minority francophone or immersion class is the limited opportunitiy {{for the students}} to communicate on social and academic issues using French. What I am proposing is a model that allows unlimited use of French whenever they wish using technology. For many years in western Canada I taught mixed classes of francophone and anglophone students in which the language of instruction was either French or English. The difference in academic performance of both francophone and anglophone students, when the assigned readings were done in either their first or second language of French or English, was understandably remarkable. Whereas the Quebecois students were linguistically secure in the French <b>medium</b> <b>classes,</b> they were reduced to linguistically and socially insecure roles in the English <b>medium</b> <b>classes.</b> The converse was true of the Anglophone students who became subdued and less confident as they moved from classes in which thei...|$|R
