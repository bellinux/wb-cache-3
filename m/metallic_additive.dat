40|$|AbstractAlthough, {{additive}} Manufacturing (AM) {{has been}} {{hailed as the}} “third industrial revolution” by The Economist magazine [April- 2012], the first patent on Stereo-lithography was awarded in 1986. An enabling technology which can build, repair or reconfigure components layer by layer or even pixel by pixel with appropriate materials to match the performance will enhance the productivity thus reduce energy consumption. Innovative product such a metallic composites with negative co-efficient of thermal expansion has already been demonstrated. The capability to form a three-dimensional object directly form digital data reduces many intermediate steps in manufacturing and, therefore, potentially an attractive and economic fabrication method. This is very suitable for low volume manufacturing. The major challenge for design of additive manufacturing machine is on line “Quality assurance” due to its application in low volume manufacturing. Statistical quality control is not applicable due to low volume. Moreover, any new innovative product has to go thorough a long process of certification before adaptation, especially for Aerospace and medical device industry. This paper presents the design methodology for Smart <b>Metallic</b> <b>Additive</b> Manufacturing System (s-AMS). In-situ optical diagnostics and its capability to integrate with the process control is a prudent alternative. The two main groups of AM are powder bed (e. g. Laser Sintering) and pneumatically delivered powder (e. g. Direct Metal Deposition [DMD]) to fabricate components. DMD enables one to deposit different material at different pixels with a given height directly from a CAD drawing. The feed back loop also controls the thermal cycle. New optical Sensors are being developed to control product health and geometry using imaging, cooling rate by monitoring temperature, microstructure and composition using optical spectra. Ultimately these sensors will enable one to “Certify as you Build”. Recently the author and his group have developed a technique to analyze the plasma spectra to predict the solid-state phase transformation, which opens up the new horizon for the materials processing and manufacturing. Flexibility of the process is enormous and essentially it is an enabling technology to materialize many a design. Conceptually one can seat in Houston and fabricate in Haifa.

40|$|Rapid vascularization of {{bone graft}} {{substitutes}} upon implantation {{is one of}} the most important challenges to overcome in order to achieve successful regeneration of large, critical-size bone defects. One strategy for stimulating vascularization during the regeneration process is to create a hypoxic microenvironment by either directly lowering the local oxygen tension, or by applying hypoxia-mimicking factors. Cells compensate for the hypoxic condition by releasing angiogenic factors leading to new blood vessel formation. In the present study, we explored the potential of cobalt ions (Co(2 +)), known chemical mimickers of hypoxia, to stimulate vascularization within a bone graft substitute in vivo. To this end, Co(2 +) ions were incorporated into calcium phosphate (CaPs) coatings deposited on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) particles with their effect on the formation of new blood vessels studied upon intramuscular implantation in goats. PLA particles and CaP-coated particles without Co(2 +) ions served as controls. Pathological scoring of the inflammatory response following a 12 -week implantation period showed no significant differences between the four types of materials. Based on histological and immunohistochemical analyses, both blood vessel area and number of blood vessels in CaP-coated PLA particles containing Co(2 +) were higher than in the uncoated PLA particles and CaP-coated PLA particles without Co(2 +). Analysis of blood vessel size distribution indicated abundant formation of small blood vessels in all the samples, while large blood vessels were predominantly found in PLA particles coated with CaP containing Co(2 +) ions. The results of this study support the use of CaPs containing Co(2 +) ions to enhance vascularization in vivo. In this work, we have investigated the potential of cobalt ions, incorporated into thin calcium phosphate (CaP) coatings that were deposited on particles of poly(lactic acid) (PLA), to induce neovascularization in vivo. Qualitative and quantitative histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that both the number of blood vessels and the total blood vessel area were higher in CaP-coated PLA particles containing cobalt ions as compared to the uncoated PLA particles and CaP-coated PLA particles without the <b>metallic</b> <b>additive.</b> Furthermore, a wider distribution of blood vessel sizes, varying from very small to large vessels was specifically observed in samples containing cobalt ions. This in vivo study will significantly contribute to the existing knowledge on the use of bioinorganics, which are simple and inexpensive inorganic factors that can be used to control relevant biological process during tissue regeneration, such as vascularization. As such, we are convinced that this manuscript will be of interest to the readers of Acta Biomateriali...|$|E

40|$|An {{additive}} manufacturing technique for high-strength oxide ceramics is presented. Based on {{selective laser melting}} (SLM), a new approach has been developed that allows for tool-less manufacturing of complex shaped ceramic components directly from CAD data. Components are built layer by layer in a powder bed. In the new approach, a purely ceramic powder is completely melted by a laser beam.

40|$|CIVINSDiesel {{particulate}} filters (DPF) {{have seen}} widespread growth {{as an effective}} means for meeting increasingly rigorous particle emissions regulations. There is growing interest to exploit passive regeneration of DPFs {{to reduce fuel consumption}} accompanying traditional active regeneration. Incombustible material or ash, mainly derived from <b>metallic</b> <b>additives</b> in the engine lubricant, accumulates in the DPF over time. This ash accumulation increases flow restriction and rise in pressure drop across the DPF. The growth of pressure drop adversely impacts engine performance and fuel economy. This study built upon previous research to evaluate the different effects of regeneration strategy on ash packing and distribution within the DPFs. Since passive regeneration relies on a catalyzed reaction, the interactions of ash with the catalyst will play an important role. Passive regeneration is specifically dependent on exhaust feed gas composition, exhaust conditions including temperature and flow rate, catalyst type and configuration, and the state of DPF loading during prior to passive regeneration. The goal {{of this study is to}} address the long-term effects of regeneration parameters on ash accumulations and the resulting impact of ash on the DPF catalyst performance. Experiments were conducted that focused on pressure drop measurements over the lifetime of diesel particulate filters with different regeneration methods coupled with post mortem ash characterization. These experiments provide indight to how these regeneration methods impact the DPF performance. These results, among few fundamental data of this kind, correlate changes in diesel particlate filter performance with exhaust conditions, regeneration strategy, and ash morphological characteristics. Outcomes are useful in optimizing the design of the combined engine-aftertreatment-lubricant system for future diesel engines, balancing the necessities of additives for adequate engine performance with the requirements for robust aftertreatment systems.
