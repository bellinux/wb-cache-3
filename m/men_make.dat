25|$|In July, {{a warrant}} was issued to the ATF to search NCCF {{headquarters}} for 60 {{machine guns and}} 180 sticks of dynamite. The warrant was based on information provided to agent Thomas Sledge by a 12-year-old girl, Marialice Clark, who was the sister of Linda Clark, a girlfriend of Ed Poindexter. Sledge spelled Clark's name incorrectly in his affidavit as Mary Ellis Clark. Sledge claimed that Clark watched five <b>men</b> <b>make</b> a bomb out of dynamite, including Frank and Will Peak, two cousins of Duane Peak, a 16-year-old {{who would be the}} state's main witness against Rice and Poindexter. The affidavit claimed the men planted the bomb at Components Concepts Corporation, took a photograph of it there, and came back to NCCF headquarters and showed the photograph to Marialice Clark. The Omaha FBI called the Justice Department in Washington because they had an informant in the NCCF chapter and knew there were no machine guns or dynamite located there. The Justice Department ordered the US Attorney in Omaha, J. William Gallup, to rescind the warrant and cancel the raid. An attorney in the criminal division of the DOJ told him that due to the murders of Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in Chicago in December, 1969, the DOJ wanted no more raids on Black Panther houses.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, contradictions {{have arisen}} in the {{discussion}} of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain <b>men</b> <b>make</b> when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.|$|E

500|$|According to Tripp, sexual {{attraction}} is encouraged by [...] "tension and distance" [...] between {{one person and}} another, and is consequently [...] "seldom aroused and never rewarding unless something in the partner or in the situation itself is viewed as resistant to it." [...] Tripp maintains that societies have increased divisions {{between men and women}} partly to satisfy needs inherent in sexual psychology. He suggests that there are often elements of truth to traditional accusations made against women, such as deviousness, and that derogatory descriptions of women serve to increase divisions between the sexes, create tension between them, and make relations between men and women more exciting. Tripp proposes that social bonds between men are not prone to becoming sexual because the similarity and camaraderie between <b>men</b> <b>make</b> them too close to each other for homosexual activities to have any interest. Tripp maintains that heterosexuality and homosexuality generally develop in parallel ways, but that since homosexuality, unlike heterosexuality, is not encouraged and institutionalized by society, its origins are more [...] "scattered and diverse." [...] He reviewed anthropological evidence on homosexuality.|$|E
