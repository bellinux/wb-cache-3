The first <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> to Auschwitz concentration camp, which included Catholic prisoners, suspected members of the resistance, and 20 Jews, arrived from the prison in Tarnów, Poland, on 14 June 1940.

25|$|As {{pointed out}} by Michael E.

25|$|Stokes' second {{definition}} of wave celerity {{is for a}} frame of reference where the mean horizontal <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> of the wave motion equal to zero.

This wave-induced <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> is caused by the positive correlation between surface elevation and horizontal velocity. In the reference frame for Stokes' second definition, the wave-induced <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> is compensated by an opposing undertow (so ŪE<nbsp&0 for waves propagating in the positive x-direction). This is the logical definition for waves generated in a wave flume in the laboratory, or waves moving perpendicular towards a beach.|$|E

40|$|Modem space {{geodetic}} {{measurement of}} Earth rotation variations, particularly {{by means of}} the VLBI technique, has over the years allowed studies of Earth rotation dynamics to advance in ever-increasing precision, accuracy, and temporal resolution. A review will be presented on our understanding of the geophysical and climatic causes, or "excitations", for length-of-day change, polar motion, and nutations. These excitations sources come from <b>mass</b> <b>transports</b> that constantly take place in the Earth system comprised of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, mantle, and the cores. In this sense, together with other space geodetic measurements of time-variable gravity and geocenter motion, Earth rotation variations become a remote-sensing tool for the integral of all <b>mass</b> <b>transports,</b> providing valuable information about the latter {{on a wide range of}} spatial and temporal scales.

40|$|We propose {{here the}} {{hypothesis}} that all of United Kingdom (UK) {{is likely to be}} affected by Ganoderma sp. spores, an important plant pathogen. We suggest that the main sources of this pathogen, which acts as a bioaerosol, are the widely scattered woodlands in the country, although remote sources must not be neglected. The hypothesis is based on related studies on bioaerosols and supported by new observations from a non-forest site and model calculations to support our hypothesis. Hourly concentrations of Ganoderma sp. spores were measured from 2006 to 2010 using a 7 -day volumetric spore trap at the city of Worcester. The concentrations peak during the night and early in the morning. This suggests that the main spore sources are located a few hours away with respect to air <b>masses</b> <b>transport</b> and reach urban areas thanks to air <b>masses</b> <b>transport.</b> The back-trajectory analysis was applied to determine the location of Ganoderma sp. spore sources.

In the mean horizontal-momentum equation, d(x) is the still water depth, i.e. the bed underneath the fluid layer is located at z=–d. Note that the mean-flow velocity in the mass and momentum equations is the <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> velocity , including the splash-zone effects of the waves on horizontal <b>mass</b> <b>transport,</b> and not the mean Eulerian velocity (e.g. as measured with a fixed flow meter).|$|E
25|$|Promising {{alternatives}} to Pt-based catalysts are Metal/Nitrogen/ Carbon-catalysts (M/N/C-catalysts). To achieve high power density, or output of power over {{surface area of}} the cell, a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of Pt-based catalysts must be met, along with good <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> properties. While M/N/C-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than Pt-based catalysts, the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate. However, increasing the loading of M/N/C-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker, impairing its <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> properties. In other words, H2, O2, protons, and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer, decreasing the voltage output of the cell. While high microporosity of the M/N/C catalytic network results in high volumetric activity, improved <b>mass</b> <b>transport</b> properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network. These M/N/C materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal, nitrogen, and carbon.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{nonlinear}} thermal instability problem of double-diffusive convection in a porous medium subjected to temperature/gravity modulation. Three types of imposed time-periodic boundary temperature (ITBT) are considered. The effect of imposed time-periodic gravity modulation (ITGM) is also studied in this problem. In {{the case of}} ITBT, the temperature gradient between {{the walls of the}} fluid layer consists of a steady part and a time-dependent periodic part. The temperature of both walls is modulated in this case. In the problem involving ITGM, the gravity field has two parts: a constant part and an externally imposed time-periodic part. Using power series expansion in terms of the amplitude of modulation, which is assumed to be small, the problem has been studied using the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation. The individual effects of temperature and gravity modulation on heat and <b>mass</b> <b>transports</b> have been investigated in terms of Nusselt number and Sherwood number, respectively. Further the effects of various parameters on heat and <b>mass</b> <b>transports</b> have been analyzed and depicted graphically. Â© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|R

30|$|Pop and Na [24] studied natural {{convection}} {{due to a}} frustum of a wavy cone in a porous medium and discussed the effects of geometry of a wavy cone on the heat transfer. Cheng [25] studied the {{natural convection}} heat and mass transfer near a wavy cone with constant wall temperature and concentration in a porous medium. Using a cubic spline method of solution, he showed that the buoyancy ratio leads to higher heat and <b>mass</b> <b>transports</b> while the diffusivity ratio (Lewis number) reduces heat while increasing <b>mass</b> <b>transports.</b> Cheng [26] obtained nonsimilar solutions for double diffusive convection near a frustum of a wavy cone in porous media and showed that the average Nusselt and Sherwood numbers for the wavy cone are smaller than the corresponding smooth cone. Double-diffusive natural convection along a vertical truncated wavy cone in non-Newtonian fluid saturated porous media with thermal and mass stratification has been investigated by Cheng [27]. In this study, he showed that the power-law index leads to smaller fluctuations in the local Nusselt and Sherwood numbers and increasing the thermal and concentration stratification parameters reduce the heat and mass transfer rates.|$|R

Enhanced heat transfer inside the microchannels reactor allows for optimal temperature control, which maximizes catalyst activity and life. While no smaller scale plant is currently in commercial operation, indications show capital costs, operating costs and size could all be reduced relative to conventional FT facilities.|$|E
