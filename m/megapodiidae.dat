Two {{peculiar}} genera of kingfishers--Monachalcyon and Cittura--seem allied, the former to the widespread Todiramphus and to the Caridonax of Lombok, the latter to the Australian Melidora. Another kingfisher, Ceycopsis, combines the characters of the Malayan Ceyx and the African Ispidina, and thus forms an example of an ancient generalised form analogous to what occurs among the mammalia. Streptocitta is a peculiar form allied to the magpies; while Basilornis (found also in Ceram), Enodes, and Scissirostrum, are very peculiar starlings, the latter altogether unlike any other bird, and perhaps forming a distinct sub-family. Meropogon is a peculiar bee-eater, allied to the Malayan Nyctiornis; Rhamphococyx is a modification of Phænicophaes, a Malayan genus of cuckoos; Prioniturus (found also in the Philippines) is a genus of parrots distinguished by raquet-formed tail feathers, altogether unique in the order; while Megacephalon is a remarkable and very isolated form of the Australian <b>Megapodiidæ,</b> or mound-builders.|$|E

50|$|Galliform {{young are}} very {{precocious}} and roam {{with their mothers}} - or both parents in monogamous species - mere hours after hatching. The most extreme case are the <b>Megapodiidae,</b> where the adults do not brood, but leave incubation to mounds of rotting vegetation, volcanic ash, or hot sand.

Emus (Dromaius novaehollandiae) will eat immature Lycoperdon and Bovista fungi if presented to them as will brush turkeys (Alectura lathami) if offered Mycena, suggesting that species of <b>Megapodiidae</b> may feed opportunistically on mushrooms.|$|E
50|$|This order {{contains}} five families: Phasianidae (including chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl and grouse), Odontophoridae (New World quails), Numididae (guineafowl), Cracidae (including chachalacas and curassows), and <b>Megapodiidae</b> (incubator birds like mallee fowl and brush-turkeys). They {{are important}} as seed dispersers and predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, {{and are often}} reared as game birds by humans for their meat and eggs and for recreational hunting. Many gallinaceous species are skilled runners and escape predators by running rather than flying. Males of most species are more colorful than the females. Males often have elaborate courtship behaviors that include strutting, fluffing of tail or head feathers, and vocal sounds. They are mainly nonmigratory.|$|E
5000|$|The Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes {{together}} {{make up the}} Galloanserae. They are basal {{among the}} living neognathous birds, and normally follow the Paleognathae (ratites and tinamous) in modern bird classification systems. This was first proposed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy and has been the one major change of that proposed scheme that was almost universally adopted. However, the Galliformes as they were traditionally delimited are called Gallomorphae in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, which splits the Cracidae and <b>Megapodiidae</b> as an order [...] "Craciformes". This is not a natural group, however, but rather an erroneous result of the now-obsolete phenetic methodology employed in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy. Phenetic studies do not distinguish between plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters, which leads to basal lineages appearing as monophyletic groups.|$|E
5000|$|The megapodes, {{also known}} as {{incubator}} birds or mound-builders, are stocky, medium-large chicken-like birds with small heads and large feet in the family <b>Megapodiidae.</b> Their name literally means [...] "large foot" [...] (Greek: mega = large, poda = foot), and is {{a reference to the}} heavy legs and feet typical of these terrestrial birds. All are browsers, and all but the malleefowl occupy wooded habitats. Most are brown or black colored. Megapodes are superprecocial, hatching from their eggs in the most mature condition of any birds. They hatch with open eyes, bodily coordination and strength, full wing feathers and downy body feathers, and are able to run, pursue prey, and, in some species, fly on the same day they hatch.|$|E
40|$|<b>Megapodiidae</b> (megapodes, brush-turkeys, scrubfowl, and relatives) form a {{peculiar}} family within the Galliformes. They show an unusual incubation strategy which shows resemblance to that practiced by reptilians {{but which is}} unknown for other bird families: eggs are laid in burrows or in mounds of leaves or other organic debris gathered by the birds, and heat generated by decaying leaves or, in case of burrownesting, heat from geothermal activity or from sunradiation results in hatching of the chicks, providing that a temperature of c. 33 °C and a moderate humidity are maintained (Dekker & Jones 1992). Once hatched, the chick struggles {{to the surface and}} leaves the hatching-area on the foot or on the wing without its parents paying attention to them. This breeding behaviour has fascinated naturalists and scientist for over a century (e. g., from Wallace 1869, to Booth & Seymour 1984, Immelmann & Böhner 1984, Kloska & Nicolai 1988, and Dekker & Jones 1992). Much of the present-day knowledge of megapodes is gathered in a forthcoming book, The Megapodes (<b>Megapodiidae)</b> (Jones, Dekker, & Roselaar, in press), to be published by the Oxford University Press. While working on this book, we soon became aware that the systematics of various taxa of <b>Megapodiidae</b> were outdated. The last major revisions of the family were those of Gray (1861), Oustalet (1879 - 1880, 1880, 1881), and Ogilvie-Grant (1893), with partial surveys of some taxa or of some regions by Salvadori (1882), Mayr (1938), and White & Bruce (1986), and a mere listing of all forms by Peters (1934). New research on specimens of <b>Megapodiidae</b> in various zoological collections resulted in conclusions about species and subspecies limits which were in part at variance with those in the earlier literature.

40|$|Inter- and intrafamilial {{relationships}} among the <b>Megapodiidae</b> are presented and discussed based on their host-specific chewing louse fauna, in particular the Goniodidae (Ischnocera). Use is made of both empirical evidence and statistical methods. So far, 53 species of chewing lice have been described which are found only on megapodes, a number which is still growing. The {{relationships among}} the Goniodidae genera on megapodes have been analysed using Wagner parsimony analysis rooted by character polarity (51 morphological features). Based on their chewing lice, the <b>Megapodiidae</b> {{seem to be more}} closely related to the Phasianidae than to the Cracidae. Megapodes share no Ischnocera with the cracids, while they share a single genus Goniocotes Burmeister, 1838 (one species only, on Macrocephalon maleo S. Müller, 1846) with the Phasianidae. The distribution of 18 Ischnocera genera support the following intrafamilial division: Alectura Latham, 1824, and Aepypodius Oustalet, 1880, {{on the one hand and}} Megapodius Gaimard, 1823, and Eulipoa Ogilvie-Grant, 1893, on the other form respective sister groups.

40|$|Using 454 {{pyrosequencing}} and genomic enrichment techniques {{we developed}} 12 polymorphic markers for the endangered megapode, the malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata). Pyrosequencing on a 454 instrument resulted in 65 536 reads, with 3469 containing microsatellite repeats. Of these, 232 contained unique flanking sequences {{and had more}} than 8 repeat motifs. Wechose 13 loci based on reliability of amplification and, from these, 12 unlinked loci were selected for genotyping.

40|$|Infection is an {{important}} source of mortality for avian embryos but parental behaviors and eggs themselves can provide a network of antimicrobial defenses. Mound builders (Aves: <b>Megapodiidae)</b> are unique among birds in that they produce heat for developing embryos not by sitting on eggs but by burying them in carefully tended mounds of soil and microbially decomposing vegetation. The low infection rate of eggs of one species in particular, the Australian brush-turkey (Alectura lathami), suggests that they possess strong defensive mechanisms. To identify some of these mechanisms, we first quantified antimicrobial albumen proteins and characterized eggshell structure, finding that albumen was not unusually antimicrobial, but that eggshell cuticle was composed of nanometer-sized calcite spheres. Experimental tests revealed that these modified eggshells were significantly more hydrophobic and better at preventing bacterial attachment and penetration into the egg contents than chicken eggs. Our results suggest that these mechanisms may contribute to the antimicrobial defense system of these eggs, and may provide inspiration for new biomimetic anti-fouling surfaces. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|A new fossil species {{assigned}} to the galliform genus Paraortygoides Mayr is described from the Lower Eocene (Ypresian Stage) London Clay Formation of the United Kingdom. Paraortygoides radagasti, n. sp., is referred to the genus {{on the basis of}} comparisons with other specimens from the Middle Eocene deposit of Messel (Hessen, Germany). Because of the three-dimensional preservation of this fossil material, P. radagasti contributes new information pertaining to the morphology of the genus Paraortygoides, in particular with regard to the thoracic vertebrae, tarsometatarsus, and toes. This genus, for example, is distinguished from other currently known fossil and extant galliform birds by the presence of deep pneumatic excavations in the lateral sides of the thoracic vertebrae. The results of a preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggest that Paraortygoides is basal within Galliformes (as already proposed by Mayr [2000]); monophyly of the order is supported with <b>Megapodiidae</b> as the basal sister taxon with respect to the Cracidae and Phasianidae.

40|$|Environmental {{heterogeneity}} during embryonic development generates {{an important}} source of variation in offspring phenotypes and can influence the evolution of life histories. The effects of incubation temperature on offspring phenotypes in reptiles has been well documented but remains relatively unexplored in birds as their embryos typically develop over a narrow range of temperatures. Megapode birds (Order Galliformes; Family <b>Megapodiidae)</b> are unique in that their embryos tolerate and develop over a wide range of incubation temperatures, yet little is known of the effect that temperature has on hatchling morphology and composition. Australian Brush-turkey eggs collected on the day of laying were incubated in the laboratory under constant temperatures of 32, 34 and 36 °C until hatching {{in order to determine the}} influence of temperature on hatchling mass, size and composition. The dry mass of the yolk-free body and residual yolk of hatchlings were temperature dependent, such that higher temperatures produced chicks of lesser yolk-free body mass and greater residual yolk mass than chicks incubated at lower temperatures. However the overall size (linear dimensions) and lipid, protein and ash content of chicks were independent of temperature...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{investment}} is typically considered {{in terms of}} size and number of propagules produced. Compared with {{a thorough understanding of}} the overall patterns and ecological correlates of avian clutch size, egg size has received less attention and the total effort in-vested in laying a clutch of eggs is rarely considered. We used clutch volume as an alterna-tive estimate of reproductive investment and present the first class-level analysis of clutch volume in birds using 1, 364 randomly-selected species in 204 families. The relationship be-tween body mass and egg volume was very strong (r 2 = 0. 946), validating previous studies identifying four families (Apterygidae, Pelecanoidiididae, Sternidae and Dromadidiae) with disproportionately large eggs. Clutch volume was also closely related to body mass (r 2 = 0. 909) and {{all but one of the}} taxa with disproportionately large eggs conformed to the overall relationship, their greater egg dimensions compensated by diminished clutch size. The only family which departed significantly from the relationship between body mass and clutch volume was the mound builders (<b>Megapodiidae)</b> —the only group of birds that do not rely on body heat for incubation. Although previously known for laying large clutches o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Galliformes is a {{well-known}} and widely distributed Order in Aves. The phylogenetic relationships of galliform birds, especially the turkeys, grouse, chickens, quails, and pheasants, have been studied intensively, likely because of their close association with humans. Despite extensive studies, convergent morphological evolution and rapid radiation have resulted in conflicting hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships. Many internal nodes have remained ambiguous. Results We analyzed the complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes from 34 galliform species, including 14 new mt genomes and 20 published mt genomes, and obtained a single, robust tree. Most of the internal branches were relatively short and the terminal branches long suggesting an ancient, rapid radiation. The <b>Megapodiidae</b> formed the sister group to all other galliforms, followed in sequence by the Cracidae, Odontophoridae and Numididae. The remaining clade included the Phasianidae, Tetraonidae and Meleagrididae. The genus Arborophila was the sister group of the remaining taxa followed by Polyplectron. This was followed by two major clades: ((((Gallus, Bambusicola) Francolinus) (Coturnix, Alectoris)) Pavo) and (((((((Chrysolophus, Phasianus) Lophura) Syrmaticus) Perdix) Pucrasia) (Meleagris, Bonasa)) ((Lophophorus, Tetraophasis) Tragopan))). Conclusions The traditional hypothesis of monophyletic lineages of pheasants, partridges, peafowls and tragopans was not supported in this study. Mitogenomic analyses recovered robust phylogenetic relationships and suggested that the Galliformes formed a model group {{for the study of}} morphological and behavioral evolution. </p...|$|E
40|$|Of the basal clades of extant birds (Neornithes) the ‘landfowl’ or galliforms (Aves, Galliformes) are {{the most}} speciose. Cladistic {{analysis}} of more than 100 morphological characters coded at the generic level for most putative galliform genera confirms that the megapodes (‘mound builders’; <b>Megapodiidae)</b> {{are the most}} basal clade within the order. They are followed successively by the curassows, guans and chachalacas (Cracidae), which comprise the sister-group to all other extant Galliformes (i. e. Phasianoidea). Within this large ‘phasianoid’ clade, analyses suggest that the guineafowl (Numididae) are the most basal taxon, although monophyly of this ‘family’ is not strictly supported {{on the basis of}} the morphological characters employed. An additional major clade within the phasianoid Galliformes is recovered by this analysis, comprising the traditional groupings of New World quails (Odontophoridae) and Old World quails (‘Perdicini’), yet only monophyly of the former is supported unambiguously by morphological characters. Relationships within the remainder of the phasianoid taxa, including the grouse (Tetraonidae), turkeys (i. e. Meleagris/Agriocharus spp.) as well as other ‘pavonine’ galliforms (i. e. peafowl; Pavo, Afropavo, Rheinardia, Argusianus and Polyplectron spp.) remain largely unresolved on the basis of morphological characters, yet monophyly of the major subdivisions is supported here. Although there are a number of important differences, especially with regard to relationships within the nonquail phasianoids, the results of this morphological phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis are broadly congruent both with traditional classifications and existing molecular hypotheses of galliform phylogenetic relationship...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{differentiation}} across taxa {{may be due}} {{to genetic}} sex determination (GSD) and/or temperature sex determination (TSD). In many mammals, males are heterogametic (XY); whereas females are homogametic (XX). In most birds, the opposite is the case with females being heterogametic (ZW) and males the homogametic sex (ZZ). Many reptile species lack sex chromosomes, and instead, sexual differentiation is influenced by temperature with specific temperatures promoting males or females varying across species possessing this form of sexual differentiation, although TSD has recently been shown to override GSD in Australian central beaded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). There has been speculation that Australian Brush-turkeys (Alectura lathami) exhibit TSD alone and/or in combination with GSD. Thus, we sought to determine if this species possesses sex chromosomes. Blood was collected from one sexually mature female and two sexually mature males residing at Sylvan Heights Bird Park (SHBP) and shipped for karyotype analysis. Karyotype analysis revealed that contrary to speculation, Australian Brush-turkeys possess the classic avian ZW/ZZ sex chromosomes. It remains a possibility that a biased primary sex ratio of Australian Brush-turkeys might be influenced by maternal condition prior to ovulation that result in her laying predominantly Z- or W-bearing eggs and/or sex-biased mortality due to higher sensitivity of one sex in environmental conditions. A better understanding of how maternal and extrinsic factors might differentially modulate ovulation of Z- or W-bearing eggs and hatching of developing chicks possessing ZW or ZZ sex chromosomes could be essential in conservation strategies used to save endangered members of <b>Megapodiidae...</b>|$|E

Not only are these papers evidence of the breadth of interest in the group, but their publication in this form is indicative of the level of organization that currently exists among what is admittedly {{a relatively small number of}} workers. Although the megapodes have fascinated naturalists and scientists for centuries, this interest has become truly international and multidisciplinary mainly during the last decade. For the most part, however, the workers involved in these studies laboured largely independently and with little contact. The initiative of bringing together the people engaged or interested in the megapodes clearly belongs to the late Prof Dr Klaus Immelmann, Professor of Ethology at the University of Bielefeld in Germany. It was during the 19 th IOC in Ottawa, June 1986, that Klaus, despite his duties as President of the IOC, became aware of a num...|$|E
40|$|The giant flightless bird Sylviornis neocaledoniae (Aves: Sylviornithidae) {{existed on}} La Grande Terre and Ile des Pins, New Caledonia, {{until the late}} Holocene when it went extinct shortly after human arrival on these islands. The species was {{generally}} considered to be a megapode (<b>Megapodiidae)</b> until the family Sylviornithidae was erected for it in 2005 to reflect multiple cranial autapomorphies. However, despite thousands of bones having been reported for this unique and enigmatic taxon, the postcranial anatomy has remained largely unknown. We rectify this deficiency and describe the postcranial skeleton of S. neocaledoniae based on ~ 600 fossils and use data from this and its cranial anatomy to make a comprehensive assessment of its phylogenetic affinities. Sylviornis neocaledoniae is found to be a stem galliform, distant from megapodiids, and the sister taxon to the extinct flightless Megavitiornis altirostris from Fiji, which we transfer to the family Sylviornithidae. These two species form the sister group to extant crown-group galliforms. Several other fossil galloanseres also included in the phylogenetic analysis reveal novel hypotheses of their relationships as follows: Dromornis planei (Dromornithidae) is recovered as a stem galliform rather than a stem anseriform; Presbyornis pervetus (Presbyornithidae) is the sister group to Anseranatidae, not to Anatidae; Vegavis iaai is a crown anseriform but remains unresolved relative to Presbyornis pervetus, Anseranatidae and Anatidae. Sylviornis neocaledoniae was reconstructed herein to be 0. 8 m tall in a resting stance and weigh 27 - 34 kg. The postcranial anatomy of S. neocaledoniae shows no indication of the specialised adaptation to digging seen in megapodiids, with for example, its ungual morphology differing little from that of chicken Gallus gallus. These observations and its phylogenetic placement as stem galliforms makes it improbable that this species employed ectothermic incubation or was a mound-builder. Sylviornis neocaledoniae can therefore be excluded as the constructor of tumuli in New Caledonia...|$|E
