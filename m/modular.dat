5|$|Palace Cinema (set number 10232) was {{released}} in March 2013, and is the eighth set in the <b>Modular</b> Building line and the third corner building. The set contains 2194 pieces and has two floors. Palace Cinema is the first <b>Modular</b> Building set to be released with the LEGO Creator Expert branding on its box and so far {{is the only one}} to include stickers. Also, Palace Cinema is the second <b>Modular</b> Building set to have only two floors, instead of the usual 3, and include a vehicle, a black car styled loosely on a Buick.|$|E
5|$|Carroll {{argues that}} many animals have a <b>modular</b> design with {{repeated}} parts, as in trilobites with repeated segments, or the repeated fingers {{of a human}} hand.|$|E
5|$|Dworsky {{was awarded}} a $3.5 million grant by the California Board of Corrections in 1982 to study {{the idea of the}} <b>modular</b> jail.|$|E
5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the <b>Modular</b> Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is {{recommended}} for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. One of the reasons this set was smaller than the others {{was to provide a}} lower cost entry point into the <b>Modular</b> Houses series.|$|E
5|$|Python {{has been}} used in {{artificial}} intelligence tasks. As a scripting language with <b>modular</b> architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.|$|E
5|$|Studies on the endocast of Allkaruen {{show that}} brain {{evolution}} in pterodactyloids was a <b>modular</b> process.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Brigade Combat Team is a {{subordinate}} {{unit of the}} 10th Mountain Division, however its <b>modular</b> nature means {{it is capable of}} operating independently of the division's Headquarters and Headquarters Company.|$|E
5|$|The 45th Infantry Brigade Combat Team ("Thunderbird") is a <b>modular</b> {{infantry}} brigade combat {{team of the}} United States Army {{headquartered in}} Norman, Oklahoma. It {{is a part of}} the Oklahoma Army National Guard.|$|E
5|$|The Nord Stage {{includes}} a spring-mounted wooden pitch stick, and a ceramic mod wheel, {{similar to the}} Nord Lead and Nord <b>Modular</b> synthesizers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} bomb bay used four bomb racks, {{in later}} versions eight <b>modular</b> standard bomb racks designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) bomb or four SC 50kg (110lb) bombs each in nose up orientation. These <b>modular</b> standard bomb racks were a common feature {{on the first}} generation of Luftwaffe bombers, but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to bombs of only two sizes. These racks were abandoned in later designs.|$|E
5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} <b>modular</b> pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The <b>modular</b> pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant <b>modular</b> form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of <b>modular</b> forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|Fire Brigade (set number 10197), {{released}} in September 2009, {{was the fourth}} set in the <b>Modular</b> Buildings series. The set contains 2231 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first <b>Modular</b> House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.|$|E
5|$|If the broach {{is large}} enough the costs can be reduced by using a {{built-up}} or <b>modular</b> construction. This involves producing the broach in pieces and assembling it. If any portion wears out only that section has to be replaced, instead of the entire broach.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Hyperspace by Michio Kaku, Ramanujan's {{contributions}} to Superstring theory {{and a brief}} synopsis of his life are given in Part II Unification in Ten Dimensions in the chapter Superstrings under the sections Mystery of <b>Modular</b> Functions and Reinventing 100 Years of Mathematics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Modular</b> broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is cheaper to build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{thermal power}} plants can {{generally}} {{be built in}} a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with <b>modular,</b> readily available materials. In contrast, many types of conventional power projects, especially coal and nuclear plants, require long lead times.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade is <b>modular</b> in nature, {{allowing}} it to take on additional units when deployed. Normally the Brigade only deploys with its Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC); organic battalions and companies normally don't deploy with the HHC.|$|E
5|$|The Iore {{class was}} a cold-adapted and heavy-haul {{derivation}} from Adtranz's Octeon <b>modular</b> electric locomotive platform, which {{was launched in}} 1998 {{on the basis of}} Adtranz's latest models for Deutsche Bahn at the time. Adtranz and later Bombardier Transportation conducted the final assembly of the locomotives at Kassel, Germany. When Bombardier Transportation introduced the brand name TRAXX for its updated <b>modular</b> locomotive platform, the type designation TRAXX H80AC was applicable to the Iore class, however, it was excluded from the TRAXX family {{by the time of the}} second batch order in 2007. The manufacturer has also referred to the locomotive type as the Bombardier Kiruna.|$|E
5|$|The <b>modular</b> {{construction}} principle even {{extended to}} the restrooms of the tower: they arrived on the building site as completely enclosed modules, ready to be fixed into position on each floor and have external services connected.|$|E
25|$|A <b>modular</b> unit is a <b>modular</b> {{function}} whose {{poles and}} zeroes {{are confined to}} the cusps.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{concept of}} traditional build <b>modular</b> car parks {{is made by}} the <b>modular</b> assembling method of vertical and horizontal elements (such as columns and beams) with a ceiling made of concrete and tarmac: more <b>modular</b> units can build a parking in different sizes and shape.|$|E
25|$|In China, {{armies and}} {{provisions}} were counted using <b>modular</b> tallies of prime numbers. Unique numbers of troops {{and measures of}} rice appear as unique combinations of these tallies. A great convenience of <b>modular</b> arithmetic {{is that it is}} easy to multiply, though quite difficult to add. This makes use of <b>modular</b> arithmetic for provisions especially attractive. Conventional tallies are quite difficult to multiply and divide. In modern times <b>modular</b> arithmetic is sometimes used in digital signal processing.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a <b>modular</b> form is a (complex) {{analytic}} function {{on the upper}} half-plane satisfying {{a certain kind of}} functional equation with respect to the group action of the <b>modular</b> group, and also satisfying a growth condition. The theory of <b>modular</b> forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. <b>Modular</b> forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} important discrete subgroup of the Möbius {{group is the}} <b>modular</b> group; it {{is central to the}} theory of many fractals, <b>modular</b> forms, elliptic curves and Pellian equations.|$|E
25|$|Around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama {{observed}} a possible link between two apparently completely distinct branches of mathematics, elliptic curves and <b>modular</b> forms. The resulting modularity theorem (at the time {{known as the}} Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that every elliptic curve is <b>modular,</b> meaning {{that it can be}} associated with a unique <b>modular</b> form.|$|E
25|$|Jacobi {{forms are}} {{a mixture of}} <b>modular</b> forms and {{elliptic}} functions. Examples of such functions are very classical - the Jacobi theta functions and the Fourier coefficients of Siegel <b>modular</b> forms of genus two - {{but it is a}} relatively recent observation that the Jacobi forms have an arithmetic theory very analogous to the usual theory of <b>modular</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|The {{second and}} third {{examples}} give some hint {{of the connection between}} <b>modular</b> forms and classical questions in number theory, such as representation of integers by quadratic forms and the partition function. The crucial conceptual link between <b>modular</b> forms and number theory is furnished by the theory of Hecke operators, which also gives the link between the theory of <b>modular</b> forms and representation theory.|$|E
25|$|Below {{are three}} {{reasonably}} fast C functions, two for performing <b>modular</b> multiplication {{and one for}} <b>modular</b> exponentiation on unsigned integers not larger than 63 bits, without overflow of the transient operations.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert <b>modular</b> {{forms are}} {{functions}} in n variables, each a complex {{number in the}} upper half-plane, satisfying a <b>modular</b> relation for 22 matrices with entries in a totally real number field.|$|E
25|$|Every median graph is a <b>modular</b> graph. The <b>modular</b> graphs are a {{class of}} graphs in which every triple of {{vertices}} has a median but the medians {{are not required to}} be unique.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{is a third}} {{generation}} <b>modular</b> space station. <b>Modular</b> stations can allow the mission to be changed over time and new modules can be added or removed from the existing structure, allowing greater flexibility.|$|E
25|$|If f is meromorphic but not {{holomorphic}} at the cusp, it {{is called}} a non-entire <b>modular</b> form. For example, the j-invariant is a non-entire <b>modular</b> form of weight 0, and has a simple pole ati∞.|$|E
25|$|The <b>modular</b> {{functions}} {{constitute the}} field of functions of the Riemann surface, and hence form a field of transcendence degree one (over C). If a <b>modular</b> function f is not identically 0, then it can be shown {{that the number of}} zeroes of f is equal to the number of poles of f in the closure of the fundamental region RΓ.It can be shown that {{the field of}} <b>modular</b> function of level N (N ≥ 1) is generated by the functions j(z) and j(Nz).|$|E
