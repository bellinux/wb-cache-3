Satellite 5 is a space station that broadcasts news across the entire human empire. However, the Doctor notices that the station is suspicious: there are no aliens, {{and those who are}} promoted to Floor 500 seem to disappear. The Doctor and Rose discover that the Editor (Simon Pegg) and an alien are controlling the rest of humanity by way of the press. Meanwhile, Adam <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> that forces the Doctor and Rose to take him home.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E

When Hibiki <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake,</b> Misaki lectures her and informs her how {{a member of the}} faculty should act, even when it may not entirely be her fault. Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal. She had been adopted by a man that constantly abused her and the only thing that could cheer her up was a book from a magic user. She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E
5|$|The Sands the Prince {{collects}} from {{enemies and}} the environment are tied to his magical abilities, themselves connected with the Dagger. The most basic power is Rewind, the ability for the Prince to rewind time by up to ten seconds if he <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> in platforming or dies. In combat, the Prince can also slow time immediately around him, freeze time for a single enemy, and freeze time completely so the Prince can attack his enemies at great speed while {{they are unable to}} move. Each use of power uses up one Sand Tank, and when empty, all powers become inaccessible until more Sand is collected. More powerful abilities, such as freezing time, are powered by Power Tanks. Increasing their number unlocks new Sand-based powers. Starting out {{with a small amount of}} Sand available to him, its capacity can be increased by collecting Sand from enemies, along with Sand Clouds scattered around the palace. Large columns of Sand within the Palace grant visions of future areas and act as save points.|$|E
5|$|The game follows {{an unnamed}} Prince whose father sacks a Maharaja's {{city at the}} {{instigation}} of its treacherous Vizier. During the attack, the Prince obtains an artifact called the Dagger of Time, while his army captures an hourglass containing the Sands of Time. Visiting Azad to present the Sands {{as a gift to}} the city's ruler, the Vizier tricks the Prince into releasing the Sands, transforming the city's population into savage monsters. Together with the Maharaja's daughter Farah, the Prince works to correct his mistake and return the Sands to the hourglass. The gameplay revolves around the Prince's platforming abilities, broken up by fights with the creatures created by the Sands. A key mechanic in the game is using the Dagger to rewind time if the Prince <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>mistake</b> platforming, and using it to kill and freeze enemies.|$|E

Back in Minnesota, Yang is annoyed by the peppy attitudes of her superiors at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Craig Thomas (William Daniels) and Dr. Parker (Steven Culp), so she decides to take a trip to Seattle for Sloan's death. However, her PTSD hinders her from boarding the plane, and she ultimately remains in Minnesota. Meanwhile, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), now a plastic surgical fellow, sits by Sloan's bedside and talks of medical cases to him. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) enters Sloan's hospital room and removes him from life support. Unable to cope with Sloan's death, Meredith Grey boards a plane to visit Yang, but panics before it takes off. Shortly thereafter, Meredith Grey finds Karev at the airport bar, where he reveals {{that he will be}} staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital. The next morning, Hunt visits Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) at her family's farm, and asks her to begin working in Seattle again. At the conclusion of the episode, Torres returns home to Robbins, who is revealed to have had her lower left leg amputated {{as a result of the}} crash.|$|E

25|$|The race {{begins with}} a warm-up lap, after which the cars {{assemble}} on the starting grid in the order they qualified.

The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.|$|E

Many felt his old school discipline, attitude and the rapidly changing venue of the Union cavalry was beyond him. Remarkably he held his tongue while fuming in outrage but soldiered on.

However, former champion Mario Andretti said that the accident was a [...] "freakish" [...] one-off incident and that facilities at the circuit were adequate for racing. While he admitted surprise that more drivers were not seriously injured, he also cautioned against what he called [...] "knee-jerk reactions" [...] to the accident, calling for any changes to the sport to be carefully considered before being introduced, rather than being rushed into action.
