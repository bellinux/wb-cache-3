25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and so}} on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and <b>my</b> <b>mistake.</b> He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
500|$|Webber {{said he was}} {{at fault}} for causing the {{accident}} between himself and Rosberg on lap nineteen; [...] "I thought I'd managed to catch it but I lost the car and made contact with the wall. Then Nico hit me, which wrecked his race as well. It was <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> and it wasn't my day." [...] Rosberg was puzzled over the incident; he said, [...] "I don't understand why Webber didn't hit the brakes. It was crazy to roll back across the track like that." [...] Gerhard Berger, who raced in Formula One for thirteen years, courted controversy when he accused Webber of causing the incident deliberately and claimed Webber planned to take out either Alonso or Hamilton. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner defended Webber {{in an interview with}} The Daily Telegraph, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] that Webber attempted to take out another competitor and stated the car suffered heavy damage with the collision with the wall. Webber later went to Rosberg and apologised for the crash on the Friday before the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|Nevermind was {{mastered}} on {{the afternoon}} of August 2 at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called [...] "Endless, Nameless" [...] intended to appear at the end of [...] "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, [...] "In the beginning, {{it was kind of a}} verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there." [...] When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of [...] "Something in the Way" [...] and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the music}} Tippett {{composed}} following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer Arcangelo Corelli's [...] birth. The Fantasia would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though The Timess critic lamented the [...] "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing... {{there was so much}} going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a [...] "difficult" [...] composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The Piano Concerto (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, Julius Katchen, who had to be replaced before the première by Louis Kentner. The Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble, for whom Tippett had written the Sonata for Four Horns (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be transposed down. When the Second Symphony was premièred by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: [...] "Entirely <b>my</b> <b>mistake,</b> ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in The Times, writing that it [...] "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.|$|E

2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. As I told Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I realized <b>my</b> <b>mistake.</b> That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E

When I discovered <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> I explained the matter to General S. He said that my explanation was perfectly satisfactory and asked me to make it in writing in order that he might forward it to Gen. Lee. I did so and just before Lee rec'd the explanation he ordered S. to arrest me and prefer charges. So here I am in arrest." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 2013, Applewhite {{admitted}} he was disciplined by the University of Texas for [...] "having an inappropriate {{relationship with a}} student at the 2009 Fiesta Bowl." [...] The student was employed by the football team as an athletic trainer. [...] Texas A.D. DeLoss Dodds reprimanded Applewhite by freezing his salary and requiring him to undergo counseling. [...] In a public statement Applewhite commented on the affair: [...] "Several years ago, I made a regretful decision resulting in behavior that was totally inappropriate. It was a one-time occurrence and was a personal matter. ... Through counsel I have worked with my wife and the incident is behind us. I am regretful for <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> and humbled by this experience. I am deeply sorry for the embarrassment it has caused my friends, family, and the University."

2500|$|In 1999, {{while working}} as a {{commentator}} in South Africa, Roebuck met three cricketers, all aged 19, and offered to coach them, inviting them to live at his home in England. He warned them beforehand that he would use corporal punishment if they failed to obey his [...] "house rules". He caned all three men on their (clothed) buttocks at different times for misbehaviour and in 2001 was given a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of common assault. He told the court, [...] "Obviously I misjudged the mood and that was <b>my</b> <b>mistake</b> and my responsibility and I accept that." [...] Henk Lindeque, one of Roebuck's victims, said, [...] "The problem was not so much that he caned us but wanted to examine the marks. That's when I decided to get out of his house." [...] Lindeque stated that he held no ill will toward Roebuck and was saddened to hear of his death.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the drama lessons for {{preschool}} children.
