40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{addition}} of V 2 O 5 on the structure, sintering and dielectric properties of M-phase (Li 1 +x-yNb 1 -x- 3 yTix+ 4 y) O 3 ceramics has been investigated. Homogeneous substitution of V 5 + for Nb 5 + was obtained in LiNb 0. 6 (1 -x) V 0. 6 xTi 0. 5 O 3 for x ≤ 0. 02. The addition of V 2 O 5 led to a large reduction in the sintering temperature and samples with x = 0. 02 could be fully densified at 900 oC. The substitution of vanadia had a relatively minor adverse effect on the microwave dielectric properties of the <b>M-phase</b> <b>system</b> and the x = 0. 02 ceramics had εr = 66, Q x f = 3800 at 5. 6 GHz, and τf = 11 ppm/oC. Preliminary investigations suggest that silver metallization does not diffuse into the V 2 O 5 -doped M-phase ceramics at 900 oC, making these materials potential candidates for low-temperature cofired ceramic (LTCC) applications...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} reduction-consistent and {{thermodynamically}} consistent formulation and an associated numerical algorithm for simulating {{the dynamics of}} an isothermal mixture consisting of N (N≥ 2) immiscible incompressible fluids with different physical properties (densities, viscosities, and pair-wise surface tensions). By reduction consistency we refer to the property that if only a set of M (1 ≤ M≤ N- 1) fluids {{are present in the}} system then the N-phase governing equations and boundary conditions will exactly reduce to those for the corresponding <b>M-phase</b> <b>system.</b> By theromdynamic consistency we refer to the property that the formulation honors the thermodynamic principles. Our N-phase formulation is developed based on a more general method that allows for the systematic construction of reduction-consistent formulations, and the method suggests the existence of many possible forms of reduction-consistent and thermodynamically consistent N-phase formulations. Extensive numerical experiments have been presented for flow problems involving multiple fluid components and large density ratios and large viscosity ratios, and the simulation results are compared with the physical theories or the available physical solutions. The comparisons demonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results for this class of problems. Comment: 51 pages, 15 figures, 8 table...|$|E
