In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that Anthony Mackie would appear in the film as Sam Wilson / Falcon. Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier, respectively. Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of Civil War. Also in the month, Reed revealed that the quantum realm in the film was the MCU's version of the microverse, which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the California Institute of Technology, to [...] "inject elements of modern physics into the script". Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, [...] "...But then for a couple reasons, it felt like <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> leave those particles out there."

2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E

An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot."
