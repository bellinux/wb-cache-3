5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation. There are now grave concerns for the long-term survival of wild Murray cod populations.|$|E
25|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels are {{biocompatible}} and {{proven to}} be tolerated in many tissue types, including the CNS. Mahoney and Anseth formed PEG hydrogels by photopolymerizing methacrylate groups covalently linked to degradable PEG macromers. Hydrogel degradation was monitored over time by measuring mechanical strength (compressive modulus) and average <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> from swelling ratio data. Initially, the polymer chains were highly cross-linked, but as degradation proceeded, ester bonds were hydrolyzed, allowing the gel to swell; the compressive modulus decreased as the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> increased until the hydrogel was completely dissolved. It was demonstrated that neural precursor cells were able to be photoencapsulated and cultured on the PEG gels with minimal cell death. Because the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> is initially small, the hydrogel blocks inflammatory and other inhibitory signals from surrounding tissue. As the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> increases, the hydrogel is able {{to serve as a}} scaffold for axon regeneration.|$|E

Nonetheless, the production is insensitive to the change of <b>meshing</b> <b>size</b> and the Langmuir pressure.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> were {{historically}} {{given in}} the number of holes per inch; due to the width of the wires in the mesh, mesh numbers did not correspond directly to fractional inch sizes, and several different systems standardized with slightly different <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> for the same mesh numbers.|$|R

25|$|A {{minimum size}} for catch led to {{fishermen}} dumping dead fish {{that were too}} small to land legally, so a minimum <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> was introduced, which let small fish escape to replenish stocks. Choice of mesh is complicated, because mature fish of different species are naturally different sizes and require different nets.|$|E
25|$|Gillnets are so {{effective}} that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and enforcement agencies. <b>Mesh</b> <b>size,</b> twine strength, {{as well as}} net length and depth are all closely regulated to reduce bycatch of non-target species. Gillnets have {{a high degree of}} size selectivity. Most salmon fisheries in particular have an extremely low incidence of catching non-target species.|$|E
25|$|The {{surveillance}} ships {{carried out}} inspections during the fishing season and regularly caught foreign vessels using too small <b>mesh</b> <b>size.</b> However, few vessels were controlled {{due to the}} fleet's lack of suitability for the task. The issue was discussed in Parliament in 1973. After negotiations with the neighboring countries, a series of trawler-free zones were established. Norway continued to work towards international agreements to secure an EEZ, led by Jens Evensen.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA facile {{one-step}} {{oxygen plasma}} irradiation in {{reactive ion etching}} (RIE) configuration is employed to Nylon fabrics with different <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> to achieve surface nanostructures and improved wettability for textile and filtration applications. To observe the effects of power and irradiation time on the samples, the experiments were performed using constant irradiation time in varying power and using constant power in varying irradiation times. Results showed improved wettability after the plasma treatment. The FTIR spectra of all the treated samples exhibited decreased transmittance of the amide and carboxylic acid groups due to surface etching. The changes in the surface chemistry are supported by the SEM data wherein etching and surface nanostructures were observed for the plasma-treated samples. The etching of the surfaces is enhanced for higher power plasma treatments. The thermal analysis showed that the plasma treatment resulted in decreased crystallinity. Surface chemistry showed {{that the effects of}} the plasma treatment on the samples have no significant difference for all the <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes.</b> However, surface morphology showed that the sizes of the surface cracks are the same for all the <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> but samples with larger <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> exhibited enhanced etching as compared to the samples with smaller <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes.</b> Higher power induced higher negative DC self-bias voltage on the samples that favored anisotropic and aggressive etching...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powders, such as cordite, {{in the late}} 19th century created {{the need for a}} spark-sensitive priming charge, such as gunpowder. However, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with Cordite Mk I and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. They typically contain 70.5 parts of saltpeter and 29.5 parts of charcoal. Like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. In the United Kingdom, the finest grain was known as sulfur-free mealed powder (SMP). Coarser grains were numbered as sulfur-free gunpowder (SFG n): 'SFG 12', 'SFG 20', 'SFG 40' and 'SFG 90', for example; where the number represents the smallest BSS sieve <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> which retained no grains.|$|E
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of species that are not targeted, such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres. However, there are still serious concerns with ongoing violations.|$|E
25|$|The tangle net, or tooth net, {{originated}} in British Columbia, Canada, as a gear specifically developed for selective fisheries. Tangle nets have smaller mesh sizes than standard gillnets. They {{are designed to}} catch fish by their nose or jaw, enabling bycatch to be resuscitated and released unharmed. Tangle nets as adapted to the mark-selective fishery for spring Chinook salmon on the lower Columbia River have a standard <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> of 4-1/4inches (10.8cm.). Short net lengths and soak times are used {{in an effort to}} land fish in good condition. Tangle nets are typically used in situations where the release of certain (usually wild) fish unharmed is desirable. In a typical situation calling for the use of a tangle net, for instance, all fish retaining their adipose fins (usually wild) must be returned to the water. Tangle nets are used in conjunction with a live recovery box, which acts as a resuscitation chamber for unmarked fish that appear lethargic or stressed before their release into the water.|$|E

25|$|TEM {{specimen}} stage designs include airlocks {{to allow for}} insertion of the specimen holder into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum {{in other areas of}} the microscope. The specimen holders hold a standard size of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05mm diameter, with a thickness and <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> ranging from a few to 100μm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the {{specimen stage}}. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05mm grids, 2.3mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.|$|E
500|$|A {{cylinder}} net is a tubular net {{which is}} stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom. The {{function is to}} protect the paintwork from scratching, and on booted cylinders it also helps drain the surface between the boot and cylinder, which reduces corrosion problems under the boot. <b>Mesh</b> <b>size</b> is usually about [...] Some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an entrapment hazard in some environments such as caves and the interior of wrecks.

2500|$|Granular {{activated}} carbon has a relatively larger particle size compared to powdered {{activated carbon}} and consequently, presents a smaller external surface. Diffusion of the adsorbate is thus an important factor. These carbons {{are suitable for}} adsorption of gases and vapors, because they diffuse rapidly. Granulated carbons are used for water treatment, deodorization and separation of components of flow system and is also used in rapid mix basins. GAC can be either in granular or extruded form. GAC is designated by sizes such as 8×20, 20×40, or 8×30 for liquid phase applications and 4×6, 4×8 or 4×10 for vapor phase applications. A 20×40 carbon is made of particles that will pass through a U.S. Standard <b>Mesh</b> <b>Size</b> No. 20 sieve (0.84mm) (generally specified as 85% passing) but be retained on a U.S. Standard <b>Mesh</b> <b>Size</b> No. 40 sieve (0.42mm) (generally specified as 95% retained).

2500|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{manufacturing}} focused on standard grades of black powder from Fg used in large bore rifles and shotguns, through FFg (medium and small-bore arms such as muskets and fusils), FFFg (small-bore rifles and pistols), and FFFFg (extreme small bore, short pistols and most commonly for priming flintlocks). [...] A coarser grade {{for use in}} military artillery blanks was designated A-1. These grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, A-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, Fg retained on 14, FFg on 24, FFFg on 46, and FFFFg on 60. Fines designated FFFFFg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. [...] In the United Kingdom, the main service gunpowders were classified RFG (rifle grained fine) with diameter {{of one or two}} millimeters and RLG (rifle grained large) for grain diameters between two and six millimeters. [...] Gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the BSS sieve <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> being the smallest <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> which retains no grains. Recognized grain sizes are Gunpowder G 7, G 20, G 40, and G 90.|$|E
30|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of fibre {{diameter}} and corresponding <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> of electrospun PCL scaffolds on viability, growth and osteogenic activity of MG 63 osteoblast cell line were studied. By the adjustment of the polymer solution composition and spinning conditions, two PCL scaffolds were prepared that can be designated as microfibrous scaffolds (18 %, 16 %) with <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> from 20 to 100  μm. By contrast, the two other scaffolds had a nanofibrous character (16 %[*]+[*]PBS, 18 %[*]+[*]F 68) with <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes</b> below 20  μm (see also Table  2). As a general conclusion, one can state that nanofibrous scaffolds restricted the growth of cells predominantly to the surface, while microfibrous scaffolds allowed growth in deeper regions. The latter seemed also to enhance the osteogenic activity with regard to alkaline phosphatase activity, but this was also accompanied by a reduced metabolic activity of cells in one case (16 % scaffold).|$|R
