500|$|... "After a while I {{got sick}} of wearing tons of jewelry—I wanted to clean myself off. I see my new look as very {{innocent}} and feminine and unadorned. It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> Growing up, I admired {{the kind of}} beautiful glamorous woman—from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly—who doesn't seem to be around much anymore. I think it's time {{for that kind of}} glamor to come back. In pop music generally, people have one image. You get pigeonholed. I'm lucky {{enough to be able to}} change and still be accepted. If you think about it, that's what they do in the movies; play a part, change characters, looks and attitudes. I guess I do it to entertain myself." ...|$|E
500|$|Adrien Niyonshuti, {{who at the}} age of 25 {{was taking}} part in his first Olympic Games, was Rwanda's sole {{representative}} in the men's cross-country cycling event, and was notable for carrying his nation's flag at the opening and closing ceremonies. He qualified for the Games based on his performance at the 2011 African Continental Mountain Bike Championship. Niyonshuti said that he was putting his focus towards the event and wanted to impress his family, [...] "To have everyone say they are behind me <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> When people congratulate me for getting to the Olympics, it gives me a confidence and it tells me that yeah, I did well. I just want to go there and compete and finish the race. To know that so many people are behind me makes me not want to disappoint them." [...] He took part in the 12 August race, finishing 39th out of 40 cyclists, with a time of one hour, 42 minutes and 46 seconds. Niyonshuti ranked behind Russia's Evgeniy Pechenin (one hour, 41 minutes and 40 seconds) Chan Chun Hing of Hong Kong (one hour, 41 minutes and 59 seconds) but in front of last place finisher Marios Athanasiadis from Cyprus (one hour, 43 minutes and 25 seconds). He was 13 minutes and 39 seconds behind the race winner Jaroslav Kulhavý of the Czech Republic (one hour, 29 minutes and seven seconds).|$|E

500|$|... "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was lauded by {{television}} critics. Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald {{called it an}} [...] "incredible episode"; [...] "Walking Dead again proves {{it is one of}} the best dramas on TV and almost <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about paying my cable bill." [...] Writing for the San Antonio Express-News, Rene Guzman opined that it [...] "delivers all that messy drama in spades with a true gut-wrenching end to one of the series’ core characters". Wetpaint's Molly Friedman stated that in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner", the audience [...] "finally had a reason to shed some tears and remember just how much we care about the original gang of apocalyptic misfits". Kevin Yeoman of The Christian Science Monitor and E! Online journalist Tierney Bricker concluded that the episode managed to effectively surprise the audience, while Cyriaque Lamar of io9 declared that [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] was inferior to its predecessor by writing that it [...] "served up a bunch of quasi-entertaining scenes of people arguing and capped them off with one of the most accidentally funny closers ever committed to basic cable". In his B+ review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club said that the episode continued the series' path of a more focused and central direction. Josh Jackson of Paste was intrigued with the series' exploration of morality during an apocalyptic event in [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner". Eric Goldman of IGN was much more pessimistic about the episode than the general consensus. In his 6.5 out of 10 rating review, he called it [...] "especially dull" [...] when compared to the previous installment.|$|E

Describing his interest in such things, Lynch stated that [...] "It <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> to see giant machinery, you know, working: dealing with molten metal. And I like fire and smoke. And the sounds are so powerful. It's just big stuff. It means that things are being made, and I really like that." ...|$|E
60|$|With my {{surgical}} instruments it is different. While I {{have not yet}} had serious use for them, I do not regret the space they occupy. The thought of them <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> They are so much life insurance, only, fairer than that last grim game, one {{is not supposed to}} die in order to win. Of course, I don't know how to use them, and what I don't know about surgery would set up a dozen quacks in prosperous practice. But needs must when the devil drives, and we of the Snark have no warning when the devil may take it into his head to drive, ay, even a thousand miles from land and twenty days from the nearest port.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, a storyline saw Janine {{using drugs}} and prostituting {{to fund the}} habit. She was shown about to snort cocaine in a scene that sparked viewer {{complaints}} to the BBC. Brooks has said about Janine's behavior: [...] "Sleeping with her pusher is very sad and desperate. But she feels {{she has to do}} it to get more drugs. Janine has such low self-esteem that she's deliberately reckless. She thinks, 'Why not take drugs if they <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about myself for a while?' I think she knows she's on a slippery slope but she believes she can get out of it like she's always done before." [...] Brooks left the show in 2004 but returned in 2008, originally for a three-episode guest stint. In June 2009 she signed a three-year contract.|$|R

After Jessie provided guest vocals on Guetta's track [...] "Repeat", he offered to return the favour, and as such, the pair wrote [...] "LaserLight" [...] for the platinum edition of Jessie's debut studio album, [...] "Who You Are". Jessie describes [...] "LaserLight" [...] as an upbeat, shimmering Eurodance and house song, that features the lyrics, [...] "You <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good,</b> you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> safe, you <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> like I could live another day."

5000|$|Snyder’s theory uses hope as a {{mechanism}} that is most often seen in psychotherapy. In these instances, the therapist helps their client overcome barriers that have prevented them from achieving goals. The therapist would then help the client set realistic and relevant personal goals (i.e. [...] "I am going to find something I am passionate about and that <b>makes</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good</b> about myself"), and would help them remain hopeful {{of their ability to}} achieve these goals, and suggest the correct pathways to do so.|$|E

5000|$|In 1995, Bowie spoke more {{at length}} about how he felt his {{creativity}} and music had suffered after the success of Let's Dance: great public esteem at that time meant absolutely nothing to <b>me.</b> It didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> <b>good.</b> I felt dissatisfied with everything I was doing, and eventually it started showing in my work. Let's Dance was an excellent album in a certain genre, but the next two albums after that and Never Let Me Down showed that my {{lack of interest in}} my own work was really becoming transparent. My nadir was Never Let Me Down. It was such an awful album. I've gotten to a place now where I'm not very judgmental about myself. I put out what I do, whether it's in visual arts or in music, because I know that everything I do is really heartfelt. Even if it's a failure artistically, it doesn't bother me {{in the same way that}} Never Let Me Down bothers me. I really shouldn't have even bothered going into the studio to record it. laughs In fact, when I play it, I wonder if I did sometimes.|$|R

5000|$|Years later, Mason {{commented on}} the show and {{reactions}} to it: [...] "It must have had the longest preview run in Broadway history -- ninety-seven performances. After every performance, I came out and asked for opinions from the audience. They loved that. It made them feel like philosophers. I also promoted the play on every TV show I did. All this convinced me I had a big hit. The show opened and closed in one day. The critics said it was the worst crap they ever saw. Where does this schlemiel get the idea he's an actor and a playwright? He should go into a different business. And so on. It didn't <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> too <b>good.</b> But I told myself that life is too short, that you have to keep moving, that you're lucky to be on earth in the position you're in." ...|$|R

When I wrote something well, he would <b>make</b> <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> really <b>good.</b> When I wrote something bad, he made <b>me</b> <b>feel</b> terrible.
