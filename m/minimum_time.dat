40|$|For {{the basic}} problem of non-preemptively {{scheduling}} n independent jobs on m identical parallel machines so that the minimum (or earliest) machine completion time is maximized, we compare the performance relationship between two well-known longest-first heuristics - the LPT- (longest processing time) and the RLPT-heuristic (restricted LPT). We provide insights into the solution structure of these two sequencing heuristics and prove that the <b>minimum</b> completion <b>time</b> of the LPT-schedule {{is at least as}} long as the <b>minimum</b> completion <b>time</b> of the RLPT-schedule. Furthermore, we show that the <b>minimum</b> completion <b>time</b> of the RLPT-heuristic always remains within a factor of 1 /m of the optimal <b>minimum</b> completion <b>time.</b> The paper finishes with a comprehensive experimental study of the probabilistic behavior of RLPT-schedules compared to LPT-schedules in the two-machine case.

40|$|For the {{eclipsing binary}} system CM Draconis, eclipse <b>minimum</b> <b>times</b> have been {{monitored}} with high precision between 1994 and 1999. Periodic deviations of <b>minimum</b> <b>times</b> from a linear ephemeris may {{indicate the presence}} of an orbiting third body. Individual measurements of 41 eclipse <b>minimum</b> <b>times</b> result in a standard deviation from linear ephemeris of 5. 74 seconds. A power spectral analysis of the residuals reveals only one periodicity with more then 2 seconds amplitude. This feature, with a periodicity between 750 and 1050 days has an amplitude of 2. 8 +- 0. 5 seconds, and is also present if the power spectral analysis is performed independently for primary and secondary eclipses. It would be compatible with a planet of 1. 5 - 3 Jupiter masses at an orbital distance of 1. 1 - 1. 45 AU to the binary barycenter. The assignation of a planet to the CM Dra system can however only be upheld if this periodicity can be followed in future observations for several years. For low-mass eclipsing binary stars, the method of eclipse minimum timing allows one to reach mass limits for the detection of third bodies well below that feasible by radial velocity measurements...|$|R

Even though these methods deal with false paths, they ignore the sequential and periodic nature of <b>minimum</b> cycle <b>times,</b> and hence may give pessimistic results. In this paper, we first prove {{conditions under which}} combinational delays are correct upper bounds on <b>minimum</b> cycle <b>times.</b> Then, we present a sequential approach to compute the <b>minimum</b> cycle <b>times</b> of finite state machines, {{taking into account the}} effects of gate delay variations, reachable state space, initial states, unrealizable transitions, multiple cycle false paths, and periodicity of the present state vector sequences.
