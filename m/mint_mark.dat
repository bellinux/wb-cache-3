5|$|The first Susan B. Anthony dollars {{were struck}} at the Philadelphia Mint on December 13, 1978. First strikes at the Denver and San Francisco Mints {{followed}} on January 9, 1979 and January 29, respectively. Mint officials {{feared that the}} coins would be hoarded upon release, so they ordered {{the creation of a}} stockpile consisting of 500 million coins prior to the release date in July 1979. The dollars all bore a <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> denoting their place of origin: 'P' for the Philadelphia Mint, 'D' for the Denver Mint and 'S' for the San Francisco Mint. The Anthony dollar was the first coin to bear a 'P' <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> since the Jefferson nickel issued during World War II; other coins struck there were left without a mintmark to note their place of origin. In 1980, the 'P' <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> was added to all other circulating coins, except the cent, struck in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' <b>mint</b> <b>mark,</b> while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing them to have a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E

5000|$|A {{reform of}} Diocletian made <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> a regular feature of ancient Roman coinage. These <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> were {{placed at the}} bottom of the reverse of the coin and {{contained}} three parts. The first part indicates that this was a coin with either SM for Sacra Moneta, M for Moneta, or P for Pecurnia. The second part was an abbreviation of the name of the mint such as ROM for Rome or LON for London. The final part indicated the workshop within the mint. [...] The reform of Anastasius, which is the traditional dividing point between the coinage of the Roman and the Later Roman (a.k.a. Byzantine) empires, replaced the <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> on gold coins by the inscription CONOB, meaning the pure standard of Constantinople, which was used by a variety of <b>mints.</b> <b>Mint</b> <b>marks</b> continued on copper coinage until the second half of the seventh century, however.|$|R

5|$|The dollars were {{produced}} every year between 1878 and 1904 {{at a total}} of 4 different mints. Each mint, {{with the exception of}} Philadelphia, has its own <b>mint</b> <b>mark.</b> In 1921 production was resumed for one year only, with this year being the only one where the Denver mint was used.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the <b>mint</b> <b>mark,</b> inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above face value. However, some date and <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue.|$|E

50|$|From 1965 to 1967 all U.S. coins {{were struck}} without <b>mint</b> <b>marks.</b> As {{it was clear}} from Gresham's law that the rising cost of silver (and the ensuing removal of most silver from coinage in 1965) led to {{hoarding}} or even melting of silver-based pre-1965 coins, overzealous collection of specific <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> of those years by numismatists almost certainly would have exacerbated those shortages.|$|R

5|$|Although {{usually more}} coins were struck at Philadelphia {{than at the}} other mints during the years the coin was struck in silver, only 12,450,181 were struck there in 1955, fewer than at the Denver Mint or at San Francisco. This was due to a sagging economy and a lackluster demand for coins that caused the Mint to {{announce}} in January that the San Francisco Mint would be shuttered {{at the end of}} the year. The 1955 dimes from the three facilities are the lowest mintages by date and <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> among circulating coins in the series, but are not rare, as collectors stored them away in rolls of 50.|$|E
5|$|One proof Bicentennial coin {{in silver}} clad and lacking a <b>mint</b> <b>mark,</b> {{similar to the}} dollar in the {{prototype}} set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the Woodward & Lothrop department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for Coin World, spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and lost to the numismatic community. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The Roosevelt dime {{was first}} struck on January 19, 1946, at the Philadelphia Mint. It was {{released}} into circulation on January 30, {{which would have}} been President Roosevelt's 64th birthday. The planned release date had been February 5; it was moved up to coincide with the anniversary. With its debut, Sinnock became the first chief engraver to be credited with the design of a new circulating U.S. coin since those designed by Charles E. Barber were first issued in 1892. The release of the coins was a newsworthy event, and demand for the new design remained strong, although many of Roosevelt's opponents, particularly Republicans, were outraged. There were reports of the new dime being rejected in vending machines, but no changes to the coin were made. The dime's design has not changed much in its over seventy years of production, the most significant alterations being minor changes to Roosevelt's hair and the shifting of the <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> from reverse to obverse in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Melish {{had been}} fielding {{inquiries}} from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received back only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was {{the peak of}} the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist Q. David Bowers stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit. Nevertheless, when the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.|$|E
25|$|Greece did {{not enter}} the Eurozone until 2001 and {{was not able to}} start minting coins as early as the other eleven member states, so a number of coins {{circulated}} in 2002 were not minted in Athens but in Finland (€1 and €2 – <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> S), France (1c, 2c, 5c, 10c and 50c – <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> F) and Spain (20c – <b>mint</b> <b>mark</b> E). The coins minted in Athens for the euro introduction in 2002, as well as all the subsequent Greek euro coins, carry only the Greek <b>mint</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|At the CNA Convention in July 2006, the RCM {{unveiled}} its new <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark</b> {{to be used}} on all {{circulation and}} numismatic coinage. The agenda behind the implementation of this new <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark</b> was to help increase the RCM’s image as a brand. The aim of the logo is to educate coin users and coin collectors, respectively, that the RCM is minting Canada’s coins. The first Circulation Coin to have this new <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark</b> is the 10th Anniversary Two-Dollar coin. The first Numismatic Coin to have this new <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark</b> is the Snowbirds Coin and Stamp Set.|$|E

5000|$|In total {{there had}} been more than 50 local mints {{established}} that each bore their own unique <b>mint</b> <b>marks,</b> however several of these mints operated only for a brief time before discontinuing their casting of cash coins, <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> on Qing dynasty coinage can be categorised into 7 main categories based on the scripts on the reverse sides of the coins: 1) only have Manchu script mint marks; 2) Only have <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> in Chinese script with the weight of the coin in lí; 3) have both Manchu, and Chinese script mint marks; 4) only have a single Chinese character indicating the mint {{on the top of the}} reverse side; 5) Only contain the character [...] "一" [...] (1) on the reserve 6) have both Manchu, and Chinese scripts together on the right and left sides of the coin, plus the denomination of the denomination on the top and bottom, and 7) have Chinese, Manchu, and Arabic script together on the reverse side of the coin.|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to build the brand, the Royal Canadian Mint {{implemented}} a policy in which all its circulation and collector coins would bear a new <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark.</b> Unveiled at the Canadian Numismatic Association convention in Niagara Falls, Ontario in July 2006, the <b>Mint</b> <b>Mark</b> was a reproduction of the Royal Canadian Mint logo.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of the euro, the current eurozone members issued their own individual national coinage, most of which featured <b>mint</b> <b>marks,</b> privy <b>marks</b> and/or <b>mint</b> master <b>marks.</b> These marks have been continued {{as a part of the}} national designs of the euro coins, as well. This article serves to list the information about the various types of identifying marks on euro coins, including engraver and designer initials and the unique edge inscriptions found on the €2 coins.|$|R
5|$|In 1966, a {{small change}} {{was made to}} the design to add the {{initials}} of the designer (FS) to the obverse, underneath Jefferson's portrait. In commemoration of that change, two specimen 1966 nickels with the initials were struck and presented to him. Coins struck at any mint between 1965 and 1967 lack <b>mint</b> <b>marks,</b> which were omitted as the Mint replaced the silver circulating coins with copper-nickel. Beginning in 1968, <b>mint</b> <b>marks</b> were again used, and on the nickel were moved to {{the lower part of}} the obverse, to the right of Jefferson's bust. From 1971, no nickels were struck for circulation in San Francisco—the 1971-S was the first nickel struck in proof only since 1878.|$|R
