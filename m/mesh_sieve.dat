25|$|PAC {{material}} is finer material. PAC {{is made up}} of crushed or ground carbon particles, 95–100% of which will pass through a designated <b>mesh</b> <b>sieve.</b> The ASTM classifies particles passing through an 80-mesh sieve (0.177mm) and smaller as PAC. It is not common to use PAC in a dedicated vessel, due to the high head loss that would occur. Instead, PAC is generally added directly to other process units, such as raw water intakes, rapid mix basins, clarifiers, and gravity filters.|$|E

50|$|In {{northern}} Mexico and in American Tex-Mex cuisine, refried {{beans are}} usually prepared with pinto beans, {{but many other}} varieties of bean are used {{in other parts of}} Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red (kidney) beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine <b>mesh</b> <b>sieve</b> (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter and seasoned {{to taste with salt and}} spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.|$|E
5000|$|A Tullgren funnel, {{also known}} as Berlese funnel or Berlese trap, is an {{apparatus}} used to extract living organisms, particularly arthropods, from samples of soil. The Tullgren funnel works by creating a temperature gradient over the sample such that mobile organisms will {{move away from the}} higher temperatures and fall into a collecting vessel, where they perish and are preserved for examination. The illustration shows how it works: a funnel (E) contains the soil or litter (D), and a heat source (F) such as an electric lamp (G) heats the litter. Animals escaping from the desiccation of the litter descend through a filter (C) into a preservative liquid (A) in a receptacle (B). This illustration is merely a schematic, since usually the soil sample will not be crumbled and poured into the funnel (this would inevitably lead to a high amount of soil particles in the preservation fluid requiring laborious work to sort out the soil organisms). In fact, the soil sample is placed on a <b>mesh</b> <b>sieve</b> that will allow the soil animals to pass but should retain most of the soil particles.|$|E

40|$|Ukrainian {{patent on}} {{invention}} No. 87369 The invention relates to a material separation method, substantially {{by means of}} screens, {{and can be used}} in the coal, metal mining, building ant other industries. The inventive method for resonance excitation of the screen <b>sieving</b> <b>mesh</b> involves statically tensioning the <b>sieving</b> <b>mesh</b> and exposing it to frequency vibration action. The static tension of the <b>sieving</b> <b>mesh</b> is stabilised in relation to the opposite displacements of the sides thereof and the vibration action is substantially performed in the plane of the <b>sieving</b> <b>mesh</b> transversally to the above-mentioned sides thereof. The inventive resonance screen comprises a bed connected to a frame, to which the <b>sieving</b> <b>mesh</b> is attached with the longitudinal sides thereof, and at least one vibrator.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} effects of a concentrate consisting of two types of corn: flint and dent, with three different grinding degrees (1, 3 and 5 mm), as a function of intake, performance and digestibility of three crossbred dairy suckling heifers. A randomized block design involving 54 crossbred heifers in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement was used to assess intake and performance patterns. In order to assess digestibility, the experimental design was completely randomized, consisting of 24 crossbred heifers. Weighting and measurements of height at withers and thoracic perimeter were performed. There was no significant interaction between grinding degree and corn type for any of the studied variables. The daily intake of concentrate dry matter was higher for flint corn (243 g/day) as compared with dent corn (160 g/day). The grinding degree caused difference in the dry matter, crude protein and ether extract intake, with higher intake when 3 and 5 mm sieves were used in the process. There was no difference regarding average daily gain and increased withers, croup and thoracic perimeter. Likewise, feed conversion did not differ. Regarding dry matter digestibility, there was an effect resulting from the hardness of corn (78. 9 % for dent, and 84. 3 % and for flint corn). As for the grinding degree, the highest value of dry matter digestibility was found when using 5 mm sieves (84. 2 %), whereas the percentage values found for 1 mm and 3 mm <b>mesh</b> <b>sieves</b> were 79. 1 % and 78. 1 %, respectively.
