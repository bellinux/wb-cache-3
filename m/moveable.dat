5|$|The last carucage {{was imposed}} in 1224, after {{which most of}} the medieval government's revenue was raised by levying taxes on <b>moveable</b> or {{personal}} property, instead of on land; taxes on <b>moveable</b> property were first assessed in 1207. A probable reason for the abandonment of land taxes was the greater revenues raised by taxes on property and income.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, while {{staying in}} Paris, he was {{reminded}} of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, {{when he returned to}} Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A <b>Moveable</b> Feast. By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A <b>Moveable</b> Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A <b>Moveable</b> Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Manchester Ship Canal provided many local residents with jobs; 1,888people were employed on {{the section of the}} new canal at Barton. A stone aqueduct over the River Iwell dating from 1761 and designed by James Brindley was demolished and replaced by a new <b>moveable</b> aqueduct: the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E

40|$|Delivery, {{formerly}} a general requirement in {{the transfer of}} ownership of corporeal <b>moveables,</b> is nowadays of much more limited application. Since the coming into force of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 (now the Sale of Goods Act 1979), transfer of ownership of corporeal <b>moveables</b> {{in the case of}} sale has been governed by the parties' intentions. Nonetheless, delivery still has a role in the law. It is still necessary in cases other than sale, and is also necessary {{for the creation of a}} real right of pledge. In addition, the Sale of Goods Acts have preserved a minor role for delivery in sales of goods...|$|R
5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have <b>moveable</b> eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{sought to}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of the}} Pondicherry climate and oriented the Golconde dormitory (as it became known), so that its main facades faced north and south {{to make use of the}} prevailing breeze. A combination of <b>moveable</b> louvres on the exterior skin and woven teak sliding doors permitted ventilation without compromising on privacy. The building is still in use as an ashram today. It was the first modernist building in India.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival {{season has}} {{expanded}} throughout the late fall and winter: {{balls in the}} city may be scheduled as early as November, with the parades beginning after January 5 and the Twelfth Day of Christmas or Epiphany on January 6. Carnival celebrations end at midnight on Mardi Gras, a <b>moveable</b> feast related to the timing of Lent and Easter. The next day is Ash Wednesday {{and the beginning of}} Lent, the 40-day penitential season before Easter.|$|E

40|$|On January 1, 1994, the Civil Code of Quebec {{came into}} force. The {{study and the}} {{construction}} of the Code will certainly bring up a great number of discussions and litigations in the coming years, the new regime of the sale of <b>moveables</b> certainly being a part of these numerous debates. This thesis not only attempts to systematize and to understand the different recourses of the seller of <b>moveables,</b> but also to identify the different problems which will be faced in the years to come. In this thesis, the author also takes the opportunity to express his opinion on numerous issues which he brought up on this regime of the Civil Code of Quebec...|$|R

5|$|As {{with its}} spiritual predecessor, the {{environment}} of the game {{takes the form of a}} series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as <b>moveable</b> platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.|$|E

The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of <b>moveable</b> spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E

50|$|Sweden {{was forced}} to pay 150,000 riksdaler for the ransom of Älvsborg Castle (Älvsborgs lösen; Elfsborgs løsen). To pay this {{extraordinarily}} high amount of money, Sweden heavily taxed all <b>moveables</b> in the country, resulting in further impoverishment of the war-torn population. Unburned towns had to pay one twelfth, peasants one tenth, burned down towns one eighteenth of their properties' value.|$|R
5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight verbs {{are heavily}} inflected, being marked for tense, aspect, mode, voice, person, and polarity. Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, <b>moveable</b> affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, tense, aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts of {{machines}} both for the protection of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of <b>moveable</b> barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

5|$|<b>Moveable</b> sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E
5|$|The first {{border between}} Wales and England was zonal, apart {{from around the}} River Wye, {{which was the first}} {{accepted}} boundary. Offa's Dyke was supposed to form an early distinct line but this was thwarted by Gruffudd ap Llewellyn, who reclaimed swathes of land beyond the dyke. The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching {{from the mouth of the}} Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and <b>moveable</b> until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a <b>moveable</b> bath located in the kitchen.|$|E

The Dahlström brothers took immediate actions to restart the operations in Turku, {{in order to secure}} their property. Therefore, only such property was sold that was not necessary for production. New company, Aktiebolaget Crichton, was founded in June 1914 under leadership of the Dahlström brothers.|$|R

What were these rules like, is sadly unknown - any medieval Tallinn’s remained act does not describe such a procedure. It is possible, that some more universal civil right was used.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} is baroquized, the main altar has a valuable baldachin structure. The statue of Saint Charles Borromeo, a {{patron of the}} seminary, is on its cupola. Almost all the altars, the pulpit and other <b>moveables</b> are from years 1760-1770. Its preserved Gothic elements document a plaster Gothic decoration. The reliefs above the entrance, stone seats close to the altar and vaults above the sanctuary and former chancel (dedicated to Saint Nicholas) are original.|$|R
5|$|The Festivals are Nativity, Epiphany, the Baptism of our Lord, the Transfiguration, the Annunciation, Palm Sunday, Easter, the Ascension, Pentecost, Holy Trinity, All Saints, and Christ the King. Most {{of these}} festivals {{are tied to}} the <b>moveable</b> feast of Easter. Festivals take {{precedence}} over all other days, including Sundays, have their own collects and Eucharistic proper prefaces. Of the festivals, Christmas is considered to be twelve days in length (from December 25 until January 5) and Easter is fifty days in length (from Easter Sunday up to and inclusive of Pentecost). For Easter, Sundays are considered to be another part of the festival. For the Ascension which, falling on fortieth day of Easter, will always be on a Thursday, the festival is sometimes transferred to the Seventh Sunday of Easter in addition to or in place of the normal part of the Easter festival for that day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the eighteenth}} century many poorer girls were being taught in dame schools, informally set up by a widow or {{spinster}} to teach reading, sewing and cooking. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women. Women formed {{an important part of}} the workforce. Many unmarried women worked away from their families as farm servants, and married women worked with their husbands around the farm, taking part in all major agricultural tasks. They had a particular role as shearers in the harvest, forming most of the reaping team of the bandwin. Women also played an important part in the expanding textile industries, spinning and setting up warps for men to weave. There is evidence of single women engaging in independent economic activity, particularly for widows, who can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, such as Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh Wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she amassed a <b>moveable</b> estate of £22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. Lower down the social scale, the rolls of poor relief indicate that large numbers of widows with children endured a marginal existence.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle {{became the}} scene {{of one of the}} most desperate sieges during the English Civil War in the 1640s, which saw the rival factions of Parliament and the king vie for power across England. In the years before the war, there had been a {{resurgence}} of building at the castle. Richard Tyler, a local lawyer, became the tenant and constable of the castle, and during the early 1630s there had been considerable renovation work. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Earl of Stamford, with support from Tyler, garrisoned the castle for Parliament until December 1643, when increasing Royalist pressure in the region forced his withdrawal to Gloucester. The castle was then occupied by a garrison led by the Royalist Sir Henry Lingen. The occupation was not peaceful, with Royalist troops burning surrounding farm buildingsTyler himself was imprisoned by Lingen, although not before he had begun to sell off his livestock and other <b>moveable</b> property. Some references to Goodrich Castle during this period refer to it as Guthridge Castle, a variant on the name Goodrich.|$|E
