5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and hardy breed. The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the <b>mutated</b> <b>gene,</b> as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the <b>mutated</b> <b>gene.</b> All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the <b>mutated</b> <b>gene</b> may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the <b>mutated</b> <b>gene</b> has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E

When a female carries a <b>mutated</b> <b>gene</b> {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|In {{isolated}} {{areas with}} small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties {{to contribute to}} the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit Pingelap Atoll, and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia. This is due to one of the survivors of the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a <b>mutated</b> <b>gene,</b> which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E

5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the <b>mutated</b> <b>gene</b> through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during neurogenesis. HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E

30|$|The RNAi HTS {{approach}} {{is still at}} an early stage compared to many classical genetic screens, but it has already been used in a large number of studies that show some significant impact {{in a wide variety of}} fields, especially in cancer biology. Cancer cells acquire a set of <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> during carcinogenesis, and a vast amount of information about these <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> has been accumulated from whole exome sequencing and next generation sequencing (Berger et al., 2011; Banerji et al., 2012; Barbieri et al., 2012). However, that does not mean that all of these <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> prompt cancer development, rather than only a limited <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> causing the cancer (Ashworth et al., 2011). It is crucial to distinguish which <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> are a key driver for survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Moreover, developing potent and specific inhibitors targeting these key <b>mutated</b> <b>genes</b> represents a hot field in targeted cancer therapy, which has become an important part of many cancer treatment methods due to its precision in killing cancer cells with relatively few side effects as compared to traditional chemotherapies. However, precision often also means narrowness, which is an intrinsic drawback of targeted cancer therapy. Thus, these inhibitors often display less effective and limited activity in killing cancer cells and also allow cancer cells to develop drug resistance, one of the primary reasons for treatment failure (Guo and Wang, 2012). The major challenge and key step for cancer therapy is to identify the target that is essential for the survival and proliferation of the cancer cells, as well as biomarkers that are able to predict what types of cancers are sensitive or resistant to specific inhibitors. Therefore, RNAi HTS will be helpful in target selection and selective cancer patient treatment. Moreover, phenotypic assays to detect cell number and viability are well established. Thus, it is not surprising that RNAi HTS was applied to uncover mutant gene function or therapeutic target identification in neoplastic phenotypes in the earliest studies.|$|R
