40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four chapters. Chapter one contains an introductory part including scope and {{the objectives of the}} research. Since the present research is divided in to three major parts, chapter two, three and four are arranged accordingly. Each chapter includes an introduction discussing the relevant literature, the experimental work, results and discussions and finally, the conclusions drawn. The contents of this thesis can be best summarized as follows. Preparation and characterization of composite materials containing LDPE and untreated rice-straw powder A senes of Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) /straw composites containing different amount of straw (as wt %) were prepared using rice-straw powder having. three different particle sizes (50 urn, 90 urn and 250 urn). Mixing was done by meltmixing technique, where LDPE and straw powder were mixed in a Brabender plasti-corder, which was operating at 170 °C temperature and 60 rpm. The composites were studied by using Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). The failure modes, tensile properties, water absorption, biodegradation and weatherability were investigated {{as a function of the}} weight percentage as well as particle size of straw filler in the composite. It was found that the incorporation of straw into LDPE matrix has reduced the ductility of the composite. The mechanical properties of the composites, especially the tensile strength and elongation at break were significantly low compared to those of neat LDPE. A significant improvement in modulus was shown by the composites. It was found that the tensile properties were depended on the amount and particle size of the straw in a composite. Biodegradability of cellulose component in the rice-straw and LDPE-straw composites, after exposure to cellulase enzyme solution, was assessed by weight loss measurements. It was found that rice-straw sample is readily biodegradable but degradability of the composite samples was not significantly affected by the cellulase enzyme. The extent of degradation after the weathering process was assessed by the loss of tensile strength measurements of the composites after incubation of the samples in a weather meter, which was at 70 ° C and continuous UV and moisture cycles for five days. It was found that the degradability of the composite samples depends on the amount of the rice-straw in a sample. Preparation and characterization of maleic anhydride grafted LDPE and composite materials with maleic anhydride grafted LDPE and untreated rice straw A series of maleic anhydride grafted LDPE samples with different wt%' s of maleic anhydride and dicumyl peroxide were prepared and studied. The maleic grafted LDPE samples were prepared by melt free radical grafting method, where the grafting reaction of LDPE was carried out with the free radical initiator (Dicumyl peroxide) in a Bra-bender PL 2000 plasti-corder operating at 170 0 C. Fourier. transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the grafting of maleic anhydride on LDPE backbone. Melt viscosity measurements and tensile measurements of grafted LDPE samples confirmed the unwanted cross- link formation during the grafting reaction. A series of composites with maleic grafted LDPE and different composition of untreated rice-straw were prepared using simultaneous grafting and mixing technique. In this regard LDPE, maleic anhydride, dicumyl peroxide and rice-straw were fed in to the hot plasti-corder operating at 1700 C, where melt free radical grafting reaction as well as melt mixing of straw filler with LDPE were occurred. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation of new interface interaction (ester bond) between the rice-straw and maleic grafted LDPE. The failure modes, mechanical properties, rheological properties, water absorption, biodegradation and weatherability were investigated with respect to the weight percentage of the straw as well as particle size of the straw in the composite sample. Improved mechanical properties, especially tensile strength and modulus were also evidenced the compatibility and interface interaction in the <b>maleated</b> LDPE-straw composites. It was found that the tensile and modulus values of <b>maleated</b> LDPEstraw composites having smaller particle size and higher filling level of rice-straw to be higher due to the formation of more interactions at the interface. According to the melt viscosity and shear rate analysis, higher melt viscosity was shown by the <b>maleated</b> LDPE-straw composites due to the undesirable cross-links formed in the maleation process. Compared to the LDPE-straw composites, the corresponding <b>maleated</b> LDPE-straw composites have shown higher water absorption. As in the case of LDPE-straw composite these composites also have not shown any weight loss after the digestion with cellulase enzyme but have shown a considerable degradability after the weathering process. Preparation and characterization of composite materials with <b>maleated</b> LDPE and treated rice-straw Using simultaneous grafting and mixing technique, another series of composites were prepared with <b>maleated</b> LDPE and treated rice-straw powder. In order to remove lignin and other waxy substances, rice-straw was subjected to steam explosion and hot alkyl treatments. By the chemical analysis results it was found 'that most of the lignin and other waxy substances have removed from the straw surface. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic results also confirmed the removal of lignin and thereby increase of wt% of cellulose in rice-straw. Further FTIR analysis of the composite sample more clearly showed the formation of interface ester linkages between the treated straw and <b>maleated</b> LDPE. Similar to the chapter three, different property analysis such as mechanical, water absorption, enzymatic digestion and weatherability were carried out with respect to the weight percentage and particle size of the straw filler. Compared to the LDPE straw composites and <b>maleated</b> LDPE-untreated straw composites, significant improvement in the mechanical properties were resulted in the <b>maleated</b> LDPE treated straw composites. It was also evidenced that the removal of lignin by the treatment processes has enhanced the interface interaction of <b>maleated</b> LDPE-straw system. Further it was found that filler properties such as the amount of straw filler in the composite and the particle size of straw also govern the mechanical properties of the composites. Providing more surface area and more OH groups to form ester bonds, composites having smaller size and higher amount of straw have shown higher tensile and modulus values. Also in this series the percentage elongation properties were significantly reduced with the introduction of the treated straw in to LDPE but the reduction is significantly lower than the composites with <b>maleated</b> LDPE-untreated straw. The extent of the biodegradability of the composites with cellulase enzyme was also analyzed by the weight loss measurements. As in the above two composite series maleated-treated composites also have not shown significant digestion with the cellulase enzyme...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{concentration}} of a <b>maleated</b> polypropylene additive (0 to 5 percent by weight) and of extrusion blending temperature (190 °C to 250 °C) on the mechanical properties of extruded and injection-molded polypropylene-wood flour composites were investigated. The effects of <b>maleated</b> polypropylene additive on similarly processed polypropylene-wood flour and high density polyethylene-wood flour composites were also compared. Both the additive and the high extrusion temperature led to some wood degradation and to a less polar wood surface. The additive led to greater reinforcement of the composites, as indicated by moderate but useful increases in heat deflection temperature. strength. and modulus. The major portion of those improvements was achieved by adding 1 to 2 percent additive. However. both the additive and the high extrusion temperature decreased impact resistance. presumably {{as a consequence of}} increased reinforcement by the filler particles and wood degradation. Heat deflection temperature. strength, and modulus of the polypropylene-wood flour system were marginally better than that of the high density polyethylene-wood flour system; impact resistance was marginally poorer. 17...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{diglycidyl ether}} of {{bisphenol}} A (DEGBA) type epoxy resin has been modified with <b>maleated</b> depolymerised natural rubber (MDPR). MDPR was prepared by grafting maleic anhydride onto depolymerised natural rubber. MDPR {{has been characterized}} by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. MDPR was blended with epoxy resin at three different ratios (97 / 3, 98 / 2 and 99 / 1), by keeping the epoxy resin component as the major phase and <b>maleated</b> depolymerised natural rubber component as the minor phase. The reaction between the two blend components took place between the acid/anhydride group in the MDPR and the epoxide group of the epoxy resin. The proposed reaction schemes were supported by the FT-IR spectrum of the uncured Epoxy/MDPR blends. The neat epoxy resin and Epoxy/MDPR blends were cured by methylene dianiline (DDM) at 100 °C for three hours. Thermal, morphological and mechanical properties of the neat epoxy and the blends were investigated. Free volume studies of the cured, neat epoxy and Epoxy/MDPR blends were correlated with the morphological and mechanical properties of the same systems using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Studies...|$|E
40|$|The water {{absorption}} behavior {{of different types}} of orga-nophilic montmorillonite (OMMT) -filled polyamide 6 /poly-propylene nanocomposites with and without compatibil-izers (<b>maleated</b> PP or PP-g-MA and <b>maleated</b> styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene or SEBS-g-MA) was evaluated. Four different types of OMMT, i. e., dodecylamine-modified MMT (D-MMT), 12 aminolauric acid-modified MMT (A-MMT), stearylamine-modified MMT (S-MMT), and commercial organo-MMT (C-MMT) were used as rein-forcement. The {{water absorption}} response of the nano-composites was studied and analyzed by tensile test and morphology assessment by scanning electron micros-copy (SEM). The kinetics of water absorption of the nano-composites conforms to Fick’s law. The Mm and D are dependent on the types of OMMT and compatibilizers. The equilibrium water content and diffusivity of PA 6 /PP blend were increased by the addition of OMMT but decreased in the presence of compatibilizers. On water absorption, both strength and stiffness of the nanocom-posites were drastically decreased, but the ductility was remarkably increased. Both PP-g-MA and SEBS-g-MA played an effective role as compatibilizers for the nano-composites. This was manifested by their higher retention ability in strength and stiffness (in the wet and re-dried states), reduced the equilibrium water content, and diffu-sivity of the nanocomposites. POLYM.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a <b>maleated</b> polypropylene (MAPP) as a coupling agent in wood fibre/polypropylene fibre composites made by non-woven web technology has been evaluated. The composite panels were made with 70 or 85 % wood fibre, with the MAPP being incorporated in the panels {{at a level of}} 1 or 3 % by spraying an emulsified form on the wood fibres. Both levels of MAPP significantly increased bending and tensile strength and moduli and dynamic modulus. At the 70 % wood fibre level, impact energy was increased significantly in panels with 3 % MAPP. At the 85 % wood fibre level, both 1 % and 3 % MAPP significantly increased impact energy. The MAPP also led to small improvements in water resistance for composites containing 85 % wood fibre. The {{effectiveness of}} MAPP {{is believed to be the}} result of efficient incorporation at the wood/polypropylene interface, thus providing effective coupling of the polar wood component to the non-polar polymer matrix.

40|$|Abstract. The blends of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) with <b>maleated</b> styrene-butylene-co-ethylene-styrene {{copolymer}} (SEBS-g-MA) {{were prepared}} by melt blending. Their morphologies and crystallization behavior were investigated. Morphology observation shows the well-dispersed phase of SEBS-g-MA in PTT matrix and the partical size of SEBS-g-MA increased as {{the content of}} SEBS-g-MA increasing. Differential scanning colorimetry(DSC) experiments showed that the melting point of pure PTT and their blends was almost constant. Addition of 5 - 30 wt % SEBS-g-MA in blends increased crystallization points of PTT phase and the crystallinity of the blends were {{higher than that of}} PTT...|$|E

40|$|Nanocomposites with {{expandable}} smectites such as montmorillonite {{layered silicates}} (MLS) in polymer matrices have attracted extensive application interest. Numerous MLS concentrations {{have been used}} with no particular justification. Here, we investigate the effects of MLS dispersion within the matrix and on mechanical performance. The latter is resolved through a three-prong investigation on rate dependent tensile results, time dependent creep results {{and the influence of}} a sharp notch in polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. A fixed concentration of <b>maleated</b> polypropylene (mPP) was utilized as a compatibilizer between the MLS and non-polar PP. Analysis of transmission electron micrographs and X-ray diffraction patterns on the surface and below the surface of our samples revealed a unique skin-core effect induced by the presence of clay. Differential scanning calorimetric and polarized optical microscopic examination of spherulites sizes showed changes in nucleation and growth resulting from both the <b>maleated</b> PP compatibilizer and the MLS. These structural changes resulted in a tough nanocomposite, a concept not reported before in the PP literature. Nonlinear creep analysis of the materials showed two concentrations 3 and 5 % wt of PP, which reduced the compliance in the base PP. The use of thermal wave imaging allowed the identification of ductile failure among materials, but more important, aided the mapping of the elastic and plastic contributions. These are essential concepts in fracture analysis...|$|E
40|$|Combined {{effects of}} clay {{treatment}} and compatibilizer polymers {{on the structure}} and properties of polypropylene/clay nanocomposites were studied. Dynamic mechanical {{analysis was used to}} analyze comparatively the dynamic mechanical response of different nanocomposites prepared from polypropylene and montmorilloniterich bentonite, and to relate such response with the material microstructure. Two different bentonites were used: a purified Spanish natural bentonite was organophillized by means of 11 -undecyl-ammonium ion and a commercial bentonite organophillized with dimethyl dehydrogenated tallow ammonium ion. Three different polar copolymers were employed as compatibilizer agents in some of the formulations: maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene, maleic anhydride-grafted poly(styrene-co-ethylenebutyleneco- styrene), and poly(ethylene terephthalate-co-isophthalate) (PET). To ascertain the microstructure characteristics in the nanocomposites, wide angle X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry techniques were used. The nanocomposites containing both bentonite organophillized with 11 -undecylammonium ion and PET, and <b>maleated</b> PP as compatibilizer system, were found to have the highest storage modulus and the smallest loss factor values, which was mainly due to the better clay platelets dispersion. The dynamic mechanical response of nanocomposites prepared with bentonite organophillized with dimethyl dehydrogenated tallow ammonium ion and <b>maleated</b> SEBS was strongly affected by the presence of this compatibilizer. The temperature of PP and a, b, and g relaxations strongly depended on the interactions between the different phases in the nanocomposites. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
