This thesis has {{the aim of}} {{analysing}} the metamorphosis of piracy {{into its}} present day status as a menace and how it has impacted most especially on the marine insurance industry. The marine insurance industry is basically comprised {{of the relationship between}} the assured (shipowner/cargo owner) and the insurer, and the nexus which creates the relationship between these parties lies in the <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> which is taken out by the assured and underwritten by the insurer...|$|E

Similar associations were later formed within the United Kingdom, in Scandinavia, Japan and the United States.|$|R

The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group.In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors.

40|$|Insurance {{business}} was introduced into Ethiopia based on mutual assistances and its modern form traces back to 1905, when bank of Abyssinia began to underwrite fire and <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> {{as an agent}} to foreign insurance company. The general objective {{of the study was}} to analysis the insurance services in the Nile Insurance Company by giving special attention focusing on life insurance. Primary data were collected using a structured questionnaire. In addition, secondary data were extracted from relevant sources to supplement the data obtained from the survey. The result of this study reveals that gross written premium and net written premium showed on increasing trend. But there is an ups and down of the percentage change because of unhealthy completion between non private and other private insurance companies. Secondly even if there are new classes of life insurance that was sold in Nile Insurance Company, the structure of life insurance in terms of diversification of the source of revenues is limited to small classes of the business. The amount of the premium collected and claims paid in these classes of the insurance is not proportionally distributed. The end result of the data also shows that there is a direct correlation between premium collections and the claim payments i. e. the classes of life insurance which contributes the large amount also incur higher claims (cost) ...|$|E
40|$|From e-navigation to Marine Autonomous Systems, leading-edge {{technologies}} in the shipping industry are developing {{at a fast}} pace, and the trend is likely to continue. Owing to new opportunities opened up by artificial intelligence, the unmanned marine ships or vehicles (“UMVs”) are now within our sights. UMVs {{are no longer a}} remote possibility, as they have already been turned into a credible belief shared by many scholars, shipping companies, shipowners and other stakeholders. UMVs are the consequences of current technologies development applied to the shipping industry. This type of vessels are so cutting-edge that they face actually organizational restrictions rather than technical ones. UMVs have not been specifically addressed by any international rules or regulations so far. The main objective of this thesis is to identify gaps between existing terms of <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> the legal framework, and the advent of UMVs. After case studies and legal analysis, recommendations will be put forward on what amendments should be imposed on the existing insurance policies and the legal regimes to keep up to date with this dynamic development of marine technology. The main question that this policy-oriented thesis going to answer is: Whether existing marine insurance policies can in principle still be effective, what amendment or expansion current marine insurance articles require and further, what new policies may need to be developed under the advent of UMVs. Moreover, this thesis plans to answer some minor questions relating to the major one. Furthermore, this thesis will look into the legal issues concerning UMVs in the marine insurance section. Insurance provides a solid foundation for the growth of shipping industry by dispersing risks. Therefore, examining the advent of unmanned ships under the law of marine insurance is of great significance. In this thesis, efforts have been made to current law to the traits that the UMVs may have, and to explore whether the maritime law would still be in principle capable with UMVs. This has been achieved by either demonstrating that the UMV would be analogous to a manned vessel in which there would be no need for marine insurance to change, or by putting forward an interpretation of the insurance policies capable of embracing the unmanned situation. On the other hand, if it is unlikely, the analysis then indicates that amendments to current maritime law would be needed in order to legally use UMVs. This thesis is based on comprehensive analysis of international legal regimes relating to marine insurance. In addition, cases taken from international legal regimes are raised, like the carriage of goods by the sea. This thesis will end with conclusions of this study, recommendations for UMVs management under marine insurance, limitations and potential future study areas. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{empirical}} {{investigation into the}} relationship between fund mobilization by insurance companies and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in Nigeria and specifically how the latter responds to stimuli emanating from the insurance companies. A five variable-predictor multivariate regression model was estimated and analyzed. The short run results reveal that four explanatory variables namely: premium from fire, accidents, motor vehicles and employee liabilities <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> positively and insignificantly correlate with Gross Fixed Capital Formation while the relationship between premium from <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> and GFCF is both negative and insignificant. In the long run, the fund mobilization variables by insurance companies positively and significantly impact on the growth of gross fixed capital formation. In addition, the Granger causality test provides no evidence of causality among the variables. The paper therefore recommends the formulation and implementation of policy measures that will increase insurance penetration, improve insurance fund mobilization and enlarge the insurance market in Nigeria...|$|R

40|$|Delay {{in marine}} {{adventure}} {{is an important}} and frequent phenomenon of maritime transport and it affects various parties and their interests under several types of <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>policies,</b> including {{but not limited to}} hull and machinery, cargo, freight and loss of hire. Losses arising from delay are almost always excluded under the standard forms of these policies and under the <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act 1906 (MIA). This thesis traces back the common law origins of the exclusion, identifies the motivations behind the exclusion and submits that the risk of delay and some types of losses arising therefrom were not always excluded under the common law. By introducing distinctions among the types of delay, the work argues that the judgments in favour of the exclusion of delay losses shall be interpreted according to the type of delay and shall not be authority for all types of delay. The findings of the work accordingly clarify and considerably restrict the scope of the exclusion. The thesis also tackles the MIA provisions pertaining to the impact of delay on voyage policies. It argues that the relevant provisions are not clear and do not entirely reflect their common law background. On the ground that they have not been litigated since the enactment of the MIA, the research assesses whether they are obsolete and proposes that the provisions should be retained subject to reforms...|$|R

40|$|Analysis and {{presentation}} of this thesis {{is supported by}} studies of many relevant cases where the major arguments are set around the exclusion clauses concerning the ‘all risks cover’ policy as found in Institute Cargo Clauses. Two cases are especially emphasized, namely Mayban General Assurance BHD v. Alstom Power Plants Ltd. and Global Process Systems Inc v. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, {{mainly because of the}} special nature of the subject matter insured in these cases. The legal issues arising from claims of loss during sea transportation of large technical equipments turn out to be complicated and might lead to different application of the law due to the special nature of the subject-matter insured. All risks <b>insurance</b> <b>policies</b> have many exclusion clauses expressly listed, however, most arguments about liabilities for damage to large equipments arise from application of these two clauses, namely inherent vice and improper or insufficient packaging. Inherent vice as well as insufficiency or improper packing are both exclusion clauses for insurer's liability under an all risk <b>insurance</b> <b>policy.</b> Different interpretation of the terms themselves might lead to different judgements regarding liability. Thus identifying the sources of such terms in different legislative works becomes very important. More often than not, the causes of such types of loss are complicated and involve mutual interaction between causes, and so it is necessary to discuss how the exclusion clauses are applied as well as their interactions. In practice, damage from inherent vice can and often will develop with the assistance of a fortuitous external circumstance such as harsh weather conditions which, if qualified as a peril of the sea and considered the sole proximate cause of the loss, could guarantee the insurance cover, even if inherent vice is an excluded clause in the all risks cover policy. It is very important to discuss the causational link between perils and losses, to identify the proximate causes to the loss and to discuss the insurance cover under situations where concurrent proximate causes of similar efficiency contribute to a loss. The purpose of this thesis is to make a presentation of these two exclusion clauses for ‘all risks’ insurance cover under British <b>marine</b> cargo <b>insurance</b> <b>policy</b> and discuss their application in previous cases. Frequent reference to the <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act 1906 and the Institute Cargo Clauses will be found in this thesis. There will also be found a discussion from perspectives of British maritime legislation, Norwegian maritime legislation, as well as Chinese Maritime legislation. At the end of this thesis, I’d like to enclose a simple legislative comparison between British <b>marine</b> cargo <b>insurance</b> and Chinese PICC <b>insurance</b> <b>policy,</b> through which a better understanding of different approaches for solutions under different jurisdiction will be gained...|$|R

40|$|The present licentiate thesis {{analyses}} {{developments in}} Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> during the interwar period, including both direct <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> and <b>marine</b> reinsurance. This {{is done in}} order to provide insights on how companies of a highly internationalised and vulnerable line of insurance were affected by and responded to new risks during a period of far-reaching international financial and economic crises. Finally, the consequences of new risks and strategies are assessed. This thesis argues that during the interwar period Swedish maritime trade and Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> greatly depended on each other for <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> cover and <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> premium incomes. The business results in Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> partly depended on the development of Swedish trade. These business results were also vulnerable to currency risks. Swedish marine insurers faced no similar trade or currency risks during the two decades preceding World War I, and accordingly the returns on Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> were lower during the interwar period than during the last two pre-war decades. These factors probably bore their most severe consequences during the early 1920 s when Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> on average induced losses to insurers. The remaining years of the period constituted a long-run recovery, and the Great Depression of the early 1930 s caused no difficulties of the same order. This thesis also indicates that interwar Swedish marine insurers responded to new risks by increasing the level of cession to reinsurers. Another response was to increase the level of differentiation among insurance lines. This thesis describes the consequences of new risks and strategies in interwar Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> focusing {{on the development of the}} Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market structure and on the business results of Swedish marine insurers. Though this market shrunk and grew excessively, the relative importance of stock and mutual insurers showed only minor fluctuations. The importance of specialised marine reinsurance companies, however, fluctuated greatly. Also, cooperation between interwar marine insurers and the formation of insurance groups set new trends of concentration for the future. Finally, even though Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> during some years induced losses the Swedish marine insurers never experienced true losses on their total businesses...|$|R
