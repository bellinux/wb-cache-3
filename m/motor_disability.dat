25|$|Irritability is {{most often}} noticed along with {{the first signs of}} nervous system impairment. Within {{the first few years of}} life, {{extrapyramidal}} involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The <b>motor</b> <b>disability</b> is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users.|$|E
25|$|Affected people, {{who were}} born without a {{functioning}} thyroid, have both small bodies and reduced brain size but their mental retardation and <b>motor</b> <b>disability</b> is not as severe as with neurological endemic cretins. According to {{the authors of the}} study, the critical environment could have been present on Flores approximately 18,000 years ago, the period to which the LB fossils are dated. They wrote that various features found on the fossils, such as enlarged pituitary fossa, unusually straight and untwisted tops of the upper arm bone and relatively thick limbs, are signs of this diagnosis. The double rooted lower premolar and primitive wrist morphology can be explained in this way as well. The oral stories about strange human-like creatures may also be a record of cretinism.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{problems}} are commonly reported in youth with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> using questionnaires developed {{for a general}} population (e. g., CBCL). We examined the prevalence of behavioural problems in youth with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> using the Developmental Behaviour Checklist (DBC), a questionnaire developed for children with an intellectual disability. Further we investigated the associations with maladaptive personality traits and marital stress and conflict. Participants were parents and daily caretakers of 101 Flemish children and adolescents with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> (Mean age = 14 years 6 months). We found prevalence rates of 17. 8 % and 7. 9 % based on parent reports and daily caretaker reports. More {{than a quarter of}} youth with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> exhibited anxiety problems according to parents. Prevalence rates of behavioural problems were not related to sex. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis revealed that younger children showed less behavioural problems. Furthermore, higher scores on Disagreeableness and Emotional Instability and lower scores on Compulsivity were related to more behavioural problems. In addition, higher levels of stress and conflict in the marital relationship were related to more behavioural problems. This study is of theoretical and clinical interest because it provides evidence for maladaptive personality traits and marital stress and conflict as important determinants of behavioural problems...|$|R

2500|$|Depression Depression is well {{recognized}} in PD, having {{been identified as}} [...] "melancholia" [...] by James Parkinson in his original report of the disease in 1817. Estimated prevalence rates of depression vary widely according to the population sampled and methodology used, although depressive symptoms, irrespective of classically defined DSM criteria for depression, are present in 35% of patients There is an increased risk for any individual with depression {{to go on to}} develop Parkinson's disease at a later date. It is increasingly thought to be a consequence of the disease rather than an emotional reaction to disability, although [...] ample evidence shows that the relationship between depression and PD is bidirectional. General risk factors for depression are actually stronger markers for depression in PD patients than PD specific factors. Since Parkinson's affects many areas of the brain that control mood (specifically the frontal lobe as well as those areas that produce serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine), depression may result. [...] Depression {{is one of the most}} common neuropsychiatric conditions found in patients who have PD, and it is associated with more rapid progression of physical symptoms and a greater decline in cognitive skills. Depression in patients with PD was found to be more predictive of overall disability than was the <b>motor</b> <b>disability</b> from the PD. An interesting finding is that although a high rate of depression is seen in patients with PD, the incidence of suicide is lower in this group of patients. Many of the symptoms of PD may overlap with those of depression, making diagnosis a difficult issue.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we present results and {{conclusions}} of an initial study, intended {{to inform the}} design of a system to automatically reconstruct full sentences from abbreviated typed text. Such a system will reduce the number of keystrokes that cognitively-unimpaired users with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> need to input in order to communicate in full, rich language. A number of techniques for abbreviating messages have been identified, based on empirical studies of users. These include vowel deletion, phonetic replacement, and word truncation. How such techniques might be used to support users with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> is considered and further empirical work proposed. ...|$|R

40|$|Mobile devices provide {{people with}} disabilities new {{opportunities}} to act independently in the world. However, these empowering devices have their own accessibility challenges. We present a formative study that examines how people with visual and <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> select, adapt, and use mobile devices in their daily lives. We interviewed 20 participants with visual and <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> and asked about their current use of mobile devices, including how they select them, how they use them while away from home, and how they adapt to accessibility challenges when on the go. Following the interviews, 19 participants completed a diary study in which they recorded their experiences using mobile devices for one week. Our results show that people with visual and <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> {{use a variety of}} strategies to adapt inaccessible mobile devices and successfully use them to perform everyday tasks and navigate independently.

40|$|Being able to {{play games}} in early years is very {{important}} for the development of children. Even though, children with physical disabilities encounter several obstacles that exclude them from engaging in many popular games. In particular, children with severe <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> that rely on one-switch interfaces for accessing electronic devices find dynamic video games completely unplayable. In this paper we present the development and evaluation of GNomon: a framework, based on the NOMON interaction modality, that enables the creation of dynamic one-switch games for children with severe <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The framework was designed following a series of guidelines elicited in close collaboration with a team of speech therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists from one of the Local Health Agencies in Turin, Italy. Likewise, three mini games were developed for testing the playability of GNomon-based games. Finally, we conducted a series of trials with 8 children with severe <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> assisted by the health agency, in which we found that all of them enjoyed playing the GNomon- based mini games and that 7 of them were able to interact and play autonomously...|$|R
40|$|The authorsThis article {{investigates the}} ways that {{children}} with different <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> move in an improvisational context. We developed and implemented a one-year long movement improvisation program in which 12 children with different <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> participated in weekly sessions under the practical leadership of two dance teachers and the researchers. The project's theoretical perspective and research approach {{are based on a}} phenomenological perspective that emphasizes movement as a personal, relational, and expressive phenomenon. The empirical material was developed and created through close observation and consists of the researchers' kinaesthetically lived experiences, video observations, and logbooks from the weekly movement improvisation sessions. In the article, we present and reflect upon five episodes from one activity regularly performed during the year. The article shows that movement improvisation can, over a period of time, offer children with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> an opportunity to explore their personal ways of moving together with others. The analysis explores how and why the children gradually felt secure enough to throw themselves into exploring their own movement possibilities and how improvisation promoted their desire to keep on moving...|$|R

40|$|To provide {{recommendations}} {{based on}} the best scientific evidence available about "best practices," the New York State Department of Health Early Intervention Program sponsored {{the development of an}} evidence-based clinical practice guideline for assessment and intervention for young children with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The author served on the multidisciplinary consensus panel convened to develop the guideline, holding a position as a parent of a child with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities,</b> and in addition utilizing data from her qualitative anthropological research on mothers of young children newly diagnosed with disabilities. This article describes the state panel's process for developing the guideline, focusing on recommendations about physical therapy interventions for cerebral palsy. Although evidence-based practice privileges randomized clinical trials, few studies of physical therapy techniques for young children with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities</b> meet such criteria for evidence. The panel's recommendations, in the absence of such scientific evidence, are analyzed in comparison with competing theories of motor development in physical therapy research and practice, and with interpretations of physical therapy held by mothers of young children with disabilities who were interviewed in the study. The article explores questions of what constitutes evidence in three arenas: (1) clinical practice guidelines, (2) physical therapy research, and (3) the lives of families of young children with <b>motor</b> <b>disabilities.</b> It has broader implications for understanding how information, variously derived, is transformed into evidence. While to some extent authority and power affect the range of knowledge that can be transformed into evidence, the more significant constraints may be the rules of evidence we value and the particular paradigm of our science.
