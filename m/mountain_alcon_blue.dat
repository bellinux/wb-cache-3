50|$|The Dutch <b>Alcon</b> <b>blue</b> (Phengaris <b>alcon</b> arenaria) was a {{subspecies}} of the <b>Alcon</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly (Phengaris <b>alcon).</b> There is {{not much}} known about this subspecies, but {{it has always been}} very rare. It was endemic to the Netherlands, where two populations were known. One in Meijendel (dunes north of The Hague), and in the Meije (in the neighbourhood of the Nieuwkoopse Plassen). The population in the Meije disappeared in 1975 and in Meijendel this subspecies disappeared in 1979.|$|R
5000|$|There are 21 {{species of}} fish, from 8 families. They live in river Kupa, Kupčina, and other rivers and creeks in the area. Some {{of them are}} Eudontomyzon vladykovi, Squalius cephalus and Cobitis elongata.Brown Trouts are common {{inhabitants}} in the Park because of suitable ecological conditions (water temperature, quantity of oxygen and creeks' speed).Austropotamobius torrentium, also called the stone crayfish, {{can be found in}} creeks, although very rare.

40|$|Relationship {{between the}} {{endangered}} herbaceous plant Gentiana cruciata and its specialist herbivore, the endangered butterfly <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue,</b> Phengaris rebeli, was studied in Lithuanian population {{which is the}} northernmost one over the whole known species range in Europe. The size of P.  rebeli population was estimated bas-ing on eggshell counts on the larval host plant. Oviposition behaviour of P.  rebeli was investigated during summer season of 2011 on a grassland area in Neris Re-gional Park, Lithuania. Potential host plants were checked and eggshells of P.  re-beli were counted. A total of 619 eggshells were counted on 248 out of 536 G.  cru-ciata stems checked. Selective choice of both host plants and site for oviposition on host plant was revealed. Approximately 89 % eggs were laid on the organs of the uppermost whorl.

40|$|The {{study of}} the <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> in central Slovenia and its {{habitats}} was conducted with the purpose to determine its current status and to provide guidelines for conservation in central Slovenia and in all similar habitats across Europe. We have closely examined the area around town Vrhnika. We discovered two populations in the area north of Vrhnika and detected no migration between them. This is however not conclusive evidence {{for the absence of}} the migrations between those two populations, as rare migrants are difficult to detect with the method we used. Lack of migrations despite proximity of both habitat patches can be attributed to thich hedges which are in some places 10 metres high. Estimated number of adults per patch was 94 for the larger and 64 for the smaller. Iinterstingly the density of eggs per plant was however twice higher in the smaller patch, whcih coincides with smaller number of host plants available. The females clearly prefered plants closer to the centre of the patch. We have discovered that density of eggs per plant is bigger on smaller habitat patches but the number of adult butterflies was lower on smaller habitat patch. The main conservation concerne in the study area is early mowing of majority of grasslands. Most of them were mowed at the end of june, which removed most of the flowering host plants in the area. Mowing is probably the main reason for higher density of eggs on smaller habitat patch, because butterflies are forced to lay eggs only on plants that were not cut down. To protect <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> on the area around Vrhnika, we must preserve the occupied habitats in its current state and lower the usage of fertilizers and pesticides in the neighbouring areas. In order to inprove the habitats and allow <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> to spread the simplest measure would be to perofrm mowing at the end of august, which would enable caterpillars to finalize their cycle at the host plants and move into the ant nests. With this simple measure we would increase the population size of the remaining populations and enable the formation of new populations nearby. ...|$|R
5000|$|Phengaris {{nowadays}} {{includes the}} genus Maculinea. The type {{species of the}} latter was the <b>Alcon</b> <b>blue</b> ("M." [...] <b>alcon),</b> which is less closely related {{to most of the}} other supposed members of Maculinea than the old Phengaris species are, and hence the two genera are merged to form a monophyletic group. Alternatively, Maculinea could be restricted to the one or two species of [...] "Alcon" [...] blues, {{and the rest of it}} be separated as a new genus. But this would mean to maintain two very small genera, which is generally avoided by modern taxonomists. As Phengaris is the older name, it thus replaces Maculinea.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, Lycaenidae species {{which have}} a {{myrmecophilous}} relationship with the ant genus Myrmica are locked to primary host specificity. The <b>Alcon</b> <b>blue</b> is unusual in this regard in that it uses different host species in different locations throughout Europe, and often uses multiple host species even within the same location and population. Though it may be adopted into the nests of multiple Myrmica species within a given site, there is typically one [...] "primary" [...] species with which the locally adapted larvae can best socially integrate, leading to drastically higher survival rates. Across Europe, Alcons are known to use Myrmica scabrinodis, Myrmica ruginodis, Myrmica rubra, Myrmica sabuleti, Myrmica scabrinodis, Myrmica schencki, and rarely Myrmica lonae, and Myrmica specioides.|$|R
40|$|To {{organize}} and prioritise species-specific conservation efforts, we delineate `functional conservation units' for the threatened <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> butterfly Maculinea <b>alcon</b> in Belgium. We used detailed distribution {{data on the}} butterfly, its host plant and its habitat, present-day population sizes and its mobility and colonization capacity to determine functional conservation units (FCUs) on different spatial scales: FCU- 1, i. e., the 12 presently occupied habitat patches plus the area within a range of 500 m surrounding them (the maximum local movement distance, based on mark-release-recapture data), FCU- 2, i. e., the areas within a range of 2 km around the occupied habitat patches (the maximum observed colonization capacity) and FCU- 3, i. e., potential re-introduction sites (sites where M. alcon went extinct recently). We suggest different management and planning measures {{for each type of}} functional conservation unit and discuss translocation and re-introduction as `intensive care' conservation measures for this threatened and sedentary species...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{expected}} consequences {{of climate change}} are shifts in species’ ranges. Most of current methods to predict such shifts in species distributions consider changes in suitability of climatic conditions for existence. With these models, {{it is possible to}} indicate the potential distribution of species that would arise under spatial conditions that cause unlimited landscape accessibility and habitat suitability. At the regional scale, however, detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance are pivotal for conservation planning. This study aims to predict species occurrences at the regional scale, incorporating demographic processes and dispersal to assess habitat accessibility and suitability in detail. We investigated a system with trophic dependence: the <b>Alcon</b> <b>blue</b> butter¿y (Phengaris <b>alcon)</b> is fully dependent on the occurrence of its host plant species marsh gentian (Gentiana pneumonanthe). We applied a model chain, consisting of a soil and biomass model, a plant species occurrence and dispersal model and a butter¿y metapopulation model. We investigated the effect of future climate change, both under affected and unaffected habitat conditions as determined by host plant occurrence. Our modelled results show that the butter¿ies perform best when habitat conditions remain unaffected by climate change. However, when climate change does affect the occurrence of its host plant species, butter¿y distribution and performance will be deteriorated. This implies that detailed predictions of changes in species distributions and performance should incorporate dispersal, demographic processes and biotic interactions explicitly. Our approach allows for the identi¿cation of locations that are potentially suitable for the measures increasing network robustness for P. alcon...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I {{have studied the}} {{distribution}} of the myrmecophilous butterfly <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> (Maculinea <b>alcon)</b> in Slovenia, its endangerment and means of reducing its endangerment. M. alcon has a very complex life cycle, in which it is dependent on the specific host-plant and the specific species of host-ant. If any of the two hosts disappear from its habitat, the species will become extinct. The reason for the loss of the host-plants and partly for the absence of the host-ant, is usually connected to the negative human impact. In some European countries extinction or endangerment of M. alcon has risen due to changes in farming practices (abandoning, intensification). In Slovenia it is classified as a protected species and it is listed on the Slovenian Red list as endangered (E). I have compared the distribution in three different time periods (1999), using the extent of occurrence and area of occupancy approach. Results were surprising, indicating the increase of distribution of M. alcon in Slovenia. In contradiction, the field studies of M. alcon indicate increasing endangerment in whole Europe. The reason for the mismatching results is most certainly uneven sampling as the systematic surveys of species distribution in Slovenia were carried out only after the year 1999. The endangerment of M. alcon could be reduced with postponed mowing (in September), when the caterpillars are already safely in the anthills. M. alcon is a very interesting indicator species that strongly contributes to ecological stability in habitats where other threatened plant or animal species co-occur and I believe that is a good enough reason to make an effort to maintain its existence...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{whether a}} single species (i. e., the threatened <b>Alcon</b> <b>Blue</b> butterfly Maculinea <b>alcon)</b> was a useful indicator for the quality and area of wet heathlands in Belgium. During a survey of 18 wet Erica tetralix heathlands, we identified 624 species from 20 different taxonomic groups. Sites with the single indicator species M. alcon were significantly richer in typical wet heathland species and in Red List species but did not show significant differences in biotope quality (i. e., the number of different typical wet heath-land biotope attributes) than sites without. In addition, we used a multispecies indicator approach including a group of nine species from five different taxonomic groups (two birds, two dragonflies, two butterflies, two vascular plants and one grasshopper). High quality sites (5 – 9 species from the multispecies indicator group present) tended to have more Red list species than low quality sites (0 – 4 species from the multispecies indicator group present) but did not expose differences in overall species richness, typical wet heathland species or in biotope quality. The number of species in this umbrella group, however, {{was positively correlated with}} both the diversity of typical wet heathland species and with biotope quality. Furthermore, the complementary information of the species in the multispecies indicator group usefully signalled distinctions in biotope area and configuration, vulnerability to fragmentation, eutrophication, desiccation and contained species of different trophic levels; {{this was not the case}} for M. alcon as a single indicator species. We discuss the use of a single indicator and of a multispecies group as conservation umbrella and advocate a much wider use of combined knowledge from different taxonomic groups in conservation planning and evaluation...|$|R
