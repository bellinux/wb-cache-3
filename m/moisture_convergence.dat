50|$|The South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ): The SACZ {{controls}} rainfall in {{the southern}} subtropics and extends southeastward from the large continental convective zone of tropical South America. It is generated by <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> between the South Atlantic high pressure zone and the continental thermal low pressure zone. The location of the SACZ {{is influenced by the}} topography in central-east Brazil Vera et al. (2006). The intensity of the SACZ is highest in austral summer, in phase with intensifying continental heating and convection. Weak SACZ is accompanied by enhanced rainfall over northern Argentina and southern Brazil. These positive rainfall anomalies are supported by a strong southward moisture flux at about 35°S-60°W that shifts eastward to about 40°W for the opposite phase of the seesaw, in accordance with an eastward displacement of the Atlantic high. An intensified SACZ is associated with enhanced streamflows to the north and diminished flows to the south. This north-south separation is probably related to the anomalously warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the tropical and subtropical South Atlantic that strengthens the low-level meridional temperature gradient, intensifying the South Atlantic High and consequently the trade-winds.|$|E

It indicates that wet surfaces may be conducive to enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> compared with dry surfaces only for very high values of both the cross-frontal relative wind component and the frontal background vertical velocity. With increased background specific humidity in the warm sector, decreased cross-frontal relative wind speed, and a less stable early morning temperature lapse rate, dry surface conditions are significantly more conducive to enhanced frontal <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence.</b> When the daytime boundary layer thermal destabilization effects on the frontal updraft are considered, generally insignificant modifications of the above patterns of frontal <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> are indicated.

Surface water and energy fluxes are estimated from an ensemble of land surface model simulations forced with elaborate precipitation and radiation products derived from satellite observations, while precipitable water tendencies are estimated from numerical weather prediction analyses. Vertically integrated atmospheric <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> is estimated as a residual. This approach provides an advanced, comprehensive atmospheric water budget, including evapotranspiration, rainfall, and atmospheric <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence,</b> together with other surface fluxes such as runoff and net radiation. The annual mean and the seasonal cycle of the atmospheric water budget are presented and the couplings between budget terms are discussed for three climatologically distinct latitudinal bands between 6 °N and 20 °N. West Africa is shown to be alternatively a net source and sink region of atmospheric moisture, depending on the season (a source during the dry season and a sink during the wet season). Several limiting and controlling factors of the regional water cycle are highlighted, suggesting strong sensitivity to atmospheric dynamics and surface radiation. Some insight is also given into the underlying smaller-scale processes. The relationship between evapotranspiration and precipitation is shown to be very different between the Sahel and the regions more to the south and partly controlled by net surface radiation. Strong correlations are found between precipitation and <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> over the whole region from daily to interannual time scales.

40|$|The southwesterly {{low-level}} jet (LLJ) located to {{the east}} of the Tibetan Plateau in southern China {{plays an important role in}} summertime convective initiation over north China. This study adopts a novel perspective and uses hindcast experiments in order to investigate the role of moisture in LLJ and associated heavy rainfall formation, employing a global atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM). In the sensitivity experiments, an increase of humidity in the inflow region leads to a weaker LLJ but stronger diurnal wind oscillations. The weaker LLJ is due to a decreased lower-tropospheric east–west pressure gradient resulting from a low pressure anomaly over southeastern China induced by deep convection and related condensational heating. On the other hand, the stronger diurnal variation of the LLJ originates from stronger day-and-night thermal differences over the sloping terrain, which is related to drier conditions over the mountain range. Moreover, the increased humidity and decreased LLJ counteract one another to impact precipitation in the outflow region. The change of precipitation is mainly determined by the altered moisture flux divergence. If the increase in humidity dominates, then the <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> is enhanced and favors more precipitation over north China. Otherwise, if the decreased LLJ dominates, then the <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> is reduced, which constrains precipitation.

The historical runs show that, like the CMIP 3 models, the CMIP 5 models produce slightly smaller precipitation. A moisture budget analysis illustrates that this precipitation deficit is due to an underestimation in evaporation and ensuing moisture flux convergence. Of the two components of the moisture flux convergence (i. e., <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> and horizontal moist advection), <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> associated with mass convergence is underestimated to a greater degree. Precipitation is anticipated to increase by 10 %- 15 % {{toward the end of}} the twenty-first century over the major monsoonal front region. A statistically significant increase is predicted to occur mostly over the Baiu region and to the north and northeast of the Korean Peninsula. This increase is attributed to an increase in evaporation and moist flux convergence (with enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> contributing the most) induced by the northwestward strengthening of the North Pacific subtropical high (NPSH), a characteristic feature of the future EASM that occurred in CMIP 5 simulations. Along the northern and northwestern flank of the strengthened NPSH, intensified southerly or southwesterly winds lead to the increase in moist convergence, enhancing precipitation over these areas. However, future precipitation over the East China Sea is projected to decrease. In the EASM domain, a local mechanism prevails, with increased moisture and <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> leading to a greater increase in moist static energy in the lower troposphere than in the upper troposphere, reducing tropospheric stability. open 6...|$|E

Moisture budget analyses of the MCSs evolution associated with this heavy rain event was carried out by utilizing high-resolution numerical simulation results from the atmospheric part of the triply nested, nonhydrostatic Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction Systems (COAMPS). The control (CTRL) run experiment successfully simulated the synoptic environment, although it did not reproduce well the magnitude of the low-level horizontal <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> and the precipitation distribution along the Meiyu front over the Taiwan Strait presumably due to insufficient data over the ocean. As QuikSCAT oceanic winds were taken into the assimilation cycles (QUIK run), the experiment reproduced better precipitation in terms of both amount and spatial distribution especially the precipitation over the ocean, and received higher equitable threat score for precipitation forecast. The MCSs evolution was also better simulated as compared to that of the CTRL run. Moisture budget analyses in the subcloud layer revealed that the grid-scale horizontal <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> and upward vertical moisture flux divergence represented the major contribution for moisture transport in all stages of MCS evolution, and their values increased substantially during the convection development. The value of subgrid-scale vertical <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> in the 5 -km grid (mainly turbulence) was more than double that for convection developed over land than over the ocean.

The circulation during BFA (BNFA) cases helps (prevents) accumulation of absorbing aerosols over central India (CI) resulting in almost three times larger Aerosol Index (AI) over CI, during BFA cases compared to BNFA cases. A seminal {{role played by the}} absorbing aerosols in the transition from break to active spells is unraveled through modification of the north–south temperature gradient at lower levels. The meridional gradient of temperature at low level (DT) between aerosol-rich CI and pristine equatorial Indian Ocean is large ([6 C) and sustains for long time ([10 days) during BFA leading to significant <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> to CI. The stability effect arising from surface cooling by the aerosols is overcome by the enhanced <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> creating a moist static unstable atmosphere conducive for the large-scale organized con-vection over the CI region leading to the resurgence of active spells. The <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> induced by DT was also able to overcome possible aerosol indirect effect (Twomey effect) and initiate deep convection and transition to active condition. During BNFA cases, however the maximum DT, which was weaker than the BFA cases by more than 1. 5 C, could not sustain required <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence</b> and failed to lead to a sustained active spell. Using data from MODIS (MODerate resolu-tion Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard Terra and several other input parameters from various satellites for the period 2000 – 2009, the aerosol induced radiative forcing repre-sentative of two regions—the CI to the north and the pristine ocean to the south—were estimated and support the differences in observed DT during the two cases.

The results indicated that land degradation led to reduced net radiation by inducing more upward shortwave and longwave radiation, which were associated with increasing surface albedo and temperature, respectively. The KRD also resulted in changed surface energy partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes. The latent heat flux at land surface was reduced substantially due to the higher surface albedo and stomatal resistance, the lower Leaf Area Index (LAI) and roughness length in the degradation experiment, while the sensible heat flux increased, {{mainly because of the}} higher surface temperature.

Plots of evaporation, precipitation, and atmosphere-column <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence,</b> binned by l C SST intervals show that except for the tropics, the precipitation is more strongly constrained by large-scale dynamics as opposed to local SST.

However, the plots revealed: i) evaporation, vertical velocity, and precipitation are very robust and remarkably similar for each of the two simulations and even for the data from 1987 -ENSO-year simulation; ii) while the evaporation increased monotonically with SST up to about 27 C, the precipitation did not; iii) precipitation correlated much better with the column vertical velocity as opposed to SST suggesting that the influence of dynamical circulation including non-local SSTs is stronger than local-SSTs.

Additionally, increases in <b>moisture</b> <b>convergence,</b> specific humidity, and wind speeds and decreases in transient moisture transport are seen over the North Pacific during El Niño events compared to La Niña events...|$|E

We also {{describe a}} large-scale surface hydrology/climatology of a residual soil moisture, streamflow divergence, or runoff, {{as well as}} precipitation and evaporation.

40|$|A synoptic–dynamic {{climatology}} {{was constructed}} using all 24 -h 2 -in. (50. 8 mm) or greater rainfall events in nine states affected by heavy rains and flooding from June through September 1993 using 6 - or 12 -h gridded analyses from the Regional Data Assimilation System and geostationary satellite imagery. Each of the 85 events {{was assigned a}} category (0 – 4) based on the areal coverage of the 3 -in. (76. 2 mm) or greater observed precipitation isohyet. A variety of meteorological fields and rules of thumb used by forecasters at the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center are investigated that may help identify the most likely location and scale of a convective precipitation event. The heaviest rain usually fell to the north (downwind) of the axis of highest 850 -mb winds and moisture flux {{in an area of}} 850 -mb warm temperature and equivalent potential temperature advection. The rainfall maximum also usually occurred to the north or northeast of the axis of highest 850 -mb equivalent potential temperature. The scale and intensity of the rainfall appeared to be related to 1) the magnitude of the warm advection, 2) the 1000 – 500 -mb mean relative humidity, 3) the breadth of the axis of stronger values of moisture transport feeding northward into a surface boundary, 4) the strength of low-level <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence,</b> and 5) the length of the low-level <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> that was aligned along the mean flow upstream from the location of the rainfall maximum. The latter finding suggests that propagation {{plays an important role in}} modulating the scale and intensity of rainfall events. 1...|$|R
40|$|Newly {{obtained}} observational discharge data {{reveal the}} cause of a significant negative correlation between Amur River discharge and Okhotsk Sea ice at multiyear timescales. The annually integrated Arctic Oscillation (AO) influences both summer discharge and winter ice. Summer discharge is larger and winter ice is reduced during positive AO years. The annual AO also influences the annual horizontal <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> in the river basin. When the annual AO is positive, the annual mean air temperatures are warm over Eurasia, particularly over the Amur River basin and the Okhotsk Sea. Consequently, autumn sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are warmer in the Okhotsk Sea. The warmer autumn SSTs suppress ice formation during the following winter. Freshwater from the river is not the main control of multiyear ice variability. Consideration of the annual AO provides a new look at climate system persistence at the multi-seasonal scale...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{previous}} studies have provided insight into {{the influence of the}} Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) on North American precipitation. However, these studies focused on large-scale processes, and additional studies are needed to gain understanding of local and regional processes that develop in different phases of the AMO and substantiate its influences on precipitation. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional model is used to examine AMO-forced local and regional processes and how they have affected summertime precipitation variation in the central United States. While <b>moisture</b> transport and <b>convergence</b> by the Great Plains low-level jet have been recognized as necessary conditions for summer precipitation, model simulations show similar low-level <b>moisture</b> flux <b>convergence</b> in the central United States between the cold and warm phases of the AMO. However, there was a strong moistening in the lower troposphere during the AMO cold phase, making the atmosphere more unstable for convection and precipitation. The source of the moisture was found to be a strong positive surface evaporation–precipitation feedback initiated and sustained by increased relative vorticity along a frontal zone. Along the frontal zone, isentropic stretching of the upper-level atmosphere and cyclonic circulation anomalies increased the relative vorticity during theAMOcold phase, providing the dynamic support needed to release the low-level moist instability and produce the increased precipitation. These results indicate that the dynamics of the circulation in the AMO cold phase played key roles to organize regional vorticity processes that further sustained a coupling of precipitation and the surface evaporation and perpetuated the precipitation...|$|R
