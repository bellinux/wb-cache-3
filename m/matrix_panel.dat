50|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} improvement {{in terms of}} ergonomics offered by the responsiveness, sharpness, and uniformity of its active <b>matrix</b> <b>panel,</b> one of the drawbacks of the Portable was poor readability in low light situations. Consequently, in February 1991, Apple introduced a backlit Macintosh Portable (model M5126). Along with the new screen, Apple changed the SRAM memory to less expensive and more power-hungry pseudo-SRAM (which reduced the total RAM expansion to 8 MB) and lowered the price. The backlight feature was a welcomed improvement, but unfortunately it reduced the battery life by about half. An upgrade kit was also offered for the earlier model as well, which plugged into the ROM expansion slot. The Portable was discontinued in October 1991.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the earlier}} studies of poverty in Kenya have {{basically}} been static in nature. They have attempted to measure household welfare [...] incidence, gap and severity [...] {{at a point in}} time. Such studies are undeniably vital. However, they do not necessarily provide a good indication of welfare stability over time. This study makes an empirical contribution to poverty analysis in Kenya by incorporating poverty dynamics dimension. We first examine poverty dynamics using economic transition matrices. Next, we decompose total poverty into transient and chronic poverty components using transient poverty as censored fluctuation and equally-distributed equivalent poverty gaps approaches for comparison. The latter approach introduces inequality into poverty decomposition. Finally, we establish important correlates of poverty components using quantile-censored and non-parametric regressions. Given the high rural household poverty incidences and the country's limited resources, this study has critical implications for economic policy in Kenya.

40|$|Spatial {{econometrics}} {{has been}} criticized by some economists because some model specifications have been driven by data-analytic considerations rather than having a firm foundation in economic theory. In particular this applies to the so-called W matrix, which is integral {{to the structure of}} endogenous and exogenous spatial lags, and to spatial error processes, and which are almost {{the sine qua non of}} spatial econometrics. Moreover it has been suggested that the significance of a spatially lagged dependent variable involving W may be misleading, since it may be simply picking up the e¤ects of omitted spatially dependent variables, incorrectly suggesting the existence of a spillover mechanism. In this paper we review the theoretical and empirical rationale for network dependence and spatial externalities as embodied in spatially lagged variables, arguing that failing to acknowledge their presence at least leads to biased inference, can be a cause of inconsistent estimation, and leads to an incorrect understanding of true causal processes.

40|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} {{to measure how}} poverty changes over time, if only to monitor and evaluate the effects of specific shocks, policies, or projects on poverty. Changes in poverty rates are typically based on comparisons of cross-sectional data. In some cases, however, {{it is possible to}} collect panel data for which the same household (or person) is surveyed at two or more points in time. Panel surveys have some important advantages. Only with panel data can one measure who moves in to and out of poverty over time. The persistently poor and the chronically poor (who are poor on average, but occasionally escape poverty for a while) need help to raise their income or consumption levels; the transient poor, who sometimes outnumber the chronically poor, may have a greater need for help with smoothing their consumption profiles. The substantial movement of people in to and out of poverty can be captured {{in the form of a}} transition <b>matrix.</b> <b>Panel</b> data allow a more accurate measurement of whether poverty has changed over time, because paired tests become possible. They also have econometric advan-tages, often allowing one to avoid bias due to unobservable factors and to avoid the problems of endogenous program placement and selective migration in evaluating the impact of government programs. Panel surveys have drawbacks, too. They are subject to attrition bias, as respon-dents gradually drop out of the panel; they may become less representative over time of the population they are supposed to reflect; and they require considerable managerial skills and expense. Nor is there any entirely satisfactory way to track households as they divide and re-form over time...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{addresses}} the processing parameters, methodology, {{and limitations of}} {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM) of carbon fabric-reinforced thermoplastic polyamide 6 (PA 6) <b>matrix</b> <b>panels</b> on the laboratory scale. VARTM is a mature technology for producing large-scale thermoset composite parts/structures but has not been used for thermoplastic composites, which are manufactured primarily by compression molding, extrusion, and/or injection molding. In general, liquid molding of thermoplastics has limitations, such as high resin viscosity, high temperature processing requirements, and a short processing window. The materials used in this study are casting grade PA 6, "-caprolactam with a sodium-based catalyst, and an initiator. This system allows the resin to maintain a very low viscosity (< 1 Pa s) for a reasonable period of time, at relatively low temperatures (100 C). The carbon fabric preform is infused using VARTM after which the resin is fully polymerized in situ. The process developed for using VARTM to produce carbon fabric-reinforced PA 6 matrix composites is explained in detail. Microscopic studies are presented to evaluate wet-out of th...|$|R

While matrix-product is well-understood for homogeneous 2 D-arrays of processors (e. g., Cannon algorithm and ScaLAPACK outer product algorithm), there are two key hypotheses that render our work original and innovative:- Centralized data. We assume that all matrix files originate from, and must be returned to, the master. The master distributes both data and computations to the workers (while in ScaLAPACK, input and output matrices are initially distributed among participating resources). Typically, our approach is useful {{in the context of}} speeding up MATLAB or SCILAB clients running on a server (which acts as the master and initial repository of files). - Limited memory. Because we investigate the parallelization of large problems, we cannot assume that full <b>matrix</b> <b>panels</b> can be stored in the worker memories and re-used for subsequent updates (as in ScaLAPACK). The amount of memory available in each worker is expressed as a given number of buffers, where a buffer can store a square block of matrix elements. These square blocks are chosen so as to harness the power of Level 3 BLAS routines; they are of size 80 or 100 on most platforms.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters Technology in Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyDifferent LED dot matrix driving topologies and concurrent data transfer methods were investigated in this dissertation. The LED dot matrix driving topologies was first implemented and then tested. The designs tested were: the constant voltage, constant current, bi-polar and use of an existing LED dot matrix display driving integrated circuit (IC). All four driving topologies were evaluated to determine the brightest design. It {{was found that the}} constant current design performed the best, while the existing driving IC did not function at all. The bi-polar was a very close second while the constant voltage design performed the worst. The improvements in the bi-polar design with respect to the refresh rate were not enough to warrant the use of the bi-polar design in future permutations of the hardware. It was decided to improve the constant current driving topology and use this as the backbone for the LED dot matrix displays. Since the size of LED dot matrix displays are increasing, a smarter driving algorithm in conjunction with hardware needed to be developed. It was therefore decided to subdivide a large LED dot matrix display into smaller sections called panels. These panels can be connected in a horizontal, vertical, or {{a combination of the two}} to suit the user requirements. The panels were connected to adjacent panels to aid in determining the display size and configuration. Display graphics data was then sent to all the panels concurrently even though each panel still updated serially. This improved the brightness and refresh rate of the entire LED dot matrix display. Controlling this display required the use of a powerful processor as the algorithm had to subdivide graphics and distribute these to the panels to be displayed. Making use of pseudo-addressing, each panel connected to the system was assigned a temporary address. A Raspberry Pi computer was used to implement and execute the display algorithm. For connecting the Raspberry Pi computer to the LED dot <b>matrix</b> display <b>panels,</b> an interface card was developed. This interface card was only activated once the Raspberry Pi was connected. The on-board microcontroller on the interface card controlled the LED dot matrix display brightness.
