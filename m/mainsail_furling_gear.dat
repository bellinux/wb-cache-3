50|$|<b>Mainsail</b> <b>furling</b> {{systems have}} become {{increasingly}} popular on cruising yachts, {{as they can be}} operated shorthanded and from the cockpit, in most cases. However, the sail can become jammed in the mast or boom slot if not operated correctly. <b>Mainsail</b> <b>furling</b> is almost never used while racing because it results in a less efficient sail profile. The classical slab-reefing method is the most widely used. <b>Mainsail</b> <b>furling</b> has an additional disadvantage in that its complicated gear may somewhat increase weight aloft. However, as the size of the boat increases, the benefits of <b>mainsail</b> roller <b>furling</b> increase dramatically.|$|R
60|$|The chain {{flew out}} with startling rapidity {{and brought the}} Dazzler to rest. 'Frisco Kid went for'ard to help, and {{together}} they lowered the <b>mainsail,</b> <b>furled</b> it in shipshape manner and made all fast with the gaskets, and put the crutches under the main-boom.|$|R
50|$|Roller reefing rolls or wraps {{the sail}} around a wire, foil, or spar {{to reduce its}} {{exposure}} to the wind. In <b>mainsail</b> <b>furling</b> systems the sail is either wrapped around the boom by a mechanism in the gooseneck or hardware inside the boom winds it around a rotating foil.|$|R
50|$|The halyards {{and sheets}} lead {{back to the}} {{companionway}} for central control including <b>mainsail</b> <b>furling,</b> two winches located on the cabin top and two on the side decks handle all tasks. The mast design chosen avoids the need for running backstays, as these are definitely a hindrance and safety problem when cruising short handed.|$|R
50|$|Furling headsail -a jib {{or other}} headsail that {{automatically}} rolls around a semi rigid forestay when a line is pulled. The lower {{section of the}} <b>furling</b> <b>gear</b> has a spring-loaded retrieval system that rolls up the headsail. These are often used in cruising boats or when a yacht is sailed short-handed. The operating lines are operated {{from the safety of}} the cockpit avoiding crew working on the exposed foredeck. On very large yachts the <b>furling</b> <b>gear</b> is attached to an electric motor for ease of use.|$|R
5000|$|A jib is a headsail {{that flies}} {{in front of}} the {{foremost}} vertical mast and attaches to a stay or roller <b>furling</b> <b>gear,</b> whether that be the mainmast or a somewhat shorter foremast.|$|R
5000|$|The Buzz is a {{sailing dinghy}} {{designed}} in 1994 by Ian Howlett and manufactured by Reg White Limited of Brightlingsea {{as part of}} the [...] "White Formula" [...] range of boats originally marketed by Topper International Ltd but since 2013 by Vantage Sailing. The Buzz is a double handed racing boat, with a single trapeze for the crewman. The boat has a fully battened <b>mainsail,</b> <b>furling</b> jib and an asymmetric spinnaker. There have been around 500 boats built. The Buzz is designed to be an easy to sail boat, {{but it can also be}} raced competitively.|$|R

5000|$|The Class {{association}} has added some modifications since the initial {{implementation of the}} boat's design. Fiberglass hulls first began appearing in 1960, followed by aluminum spars in 1962. The addition of self-rescue or [...] "tanked" [...] boats (so called for the built-in flotation tanks) occurred in 1965. None of these additions particularly affected {{the speed of the}} boat, but in 1970, the Class Association approved the use of a spinnaker in the Nationals, as well as a mid-boom traveler and <b>furling</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Who's that Chinese mandarin?" [...] {{cried the}} mate, {{who had made}} voyages to Canton. [...] "Look you, my fine fellow, douse that <b>mainsail</b> now, and <b>furl</b> it in a trice." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{ship had}} passed the island of St. Pauls, and we were impatiently waiting for her {{entrance}} into the Straits of Sunda, when an accident occurred that {{put a stop to}} the contemplated mutiny, and changed the whole current, as I devoutly hope, of all my subsequent life. At the calling of the middle watch, one stormy night, the ship being under close-reefed topsails at the time, with the <b>mainsail</b> <b>furled,</b> I went on deck as usual, to my duty. In stepping across the deck, between the launch and the galley, I had to cross some spars that were lashed there. While on the pile of spars, the ship lurched suddenly, and I lost my balance, falling my whole length on deck, upon my left side. Nothing broke the fall, my arms being raised to seize a hold above my head, and I came down upon deck with my entire weight, the hip taking the principal force of the fall. The anguish I suffered was acute, and it was some time before I would allow my shipmates even to touch me.|$|R
25|$|In 1945 the Sou’wester {{sailboat}} was created. 62 original Sou’Westers were built, {{making it}} the largest fleet of single design cruising boats of its time. During the 1950s, Hinckley began experimenting {{with the use of}} fiberglass to construct his yachts’ hulls. His first fiberglass boat, the Bermuda 40 sailing ship, was released in 1959. The last Hinckley-built wooden boat was the 1960 “Osprey.” Throughout the 1960s the company provided navigation systems along with auto-pilot and electric-powered <b>furling</b> <b>mainsails.</b>|$|R
60|$|When Jimmy went on deck {{the next}} morning, fog hung heavily about {{the land and}} the slate-green sea ran with a {{sluggish}} heave out of belts of vapor. The air felt unusually sharp and the <b>furled</b> <b>mainsail</b> glistened with rime. This was disturbing, because they must finish their work, or abandon it, before winter set in; but Jimmy reflected that it was some weeks too soon for a severe cold snap. While he watched the smoke from the stove funnel rise straight up in a faint blue line, he heard a splash of oars and Bethune appeared in the dory.|$|R
50|$|Boom <b>furling</b> <b>mainsails</b> {{also must}} {{deal with the issue}} of the leading edge. Most sails attach to the mast with sliders or a rope {{supported}} edge that rides in a track in the mast, and this adds bulk to {{the leading edge of the}} sail as it rolls. This is also an issue when unfurling, as the edge of the sail must be fed smoothly into the mast's track when unfurling. The weight of the sail and furling equipment also increases the boom's mass, which can increase the danger of injury to a crewmember if they are hit by the swinging boom.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a ship {{carrying}} more than one mast, to give it more speed under sail and to improve its sailing qualities, evolved in northern Mediterranean waters: The earliest foremast has been identified on an Etruscan pyxis from Caere, Italy, dating to the mid-7th century BC: a warship with a <b>furled</b> <b>mainsail</b> is engaging an enemy vessel, deploying a foresail. A two-masted merchant vessel with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan tomb painting from 475-450 BC. An artemon (Greek for foresail) almost {{the same size as}} the galley's mainsail can be found on a Corinthian krater as early as the late 6th century BC; apart from that Greek longships are uniformly shown without it until the 4th century BC.|$|R
50|$|Foresails set on foremasts between midships and bow {{were the}} first type of sail to appear after the {{mainsail}} which had been the sole standard rig on sailing vessels for millennia, down to classical antiquity. The earliest foresail, or two-masted ship, has been identified on an Etruscan pyxis from Caere, Italy, dating to the mid-7th century BC: a warship with a <b>furled</b> <b>mainsail</b> is engaging an enemy vessel, deploying a foresail. A two-masted merchant vessel with a sizable foresail rigged on a slightly inclined foremast is depicted in an Etruscan tomb painting from 475-450 BC. An artemon (Greek for foresail) almost {{the same size as}} the galley's mainsail can be found on a Corinthian krater as early as the late 6th century BC, but apart from that Greek longships of the 8th-5th century BC are uniformly shown without it.|$|R
50|$|The {{other common}} type of furling system is for the mainsail. The <b>mainsail</b> may be <b>furled</b> into the mast or the boom, with boom furling systems being simpler and more common. The {{simplest}} boom furling system consists of a boom that can rotate along its axis, with a latch to lock it in place. Provision {{must be made to}} allow the mainsail to wrap around the boom without interfering with the mainsheet, such as end-boom sheeting or a bridle. To <b>furl</b> the <b>mainsail,</b> the boom is unlocked, and then rotated to take up the desired amount of mainsail, and then locked in place. More advanced boom furling systems will wrap the furling mechanism in a slotted cover, so the sail furls inside the cover; this also makes sheeting easier, since the sheet may be attached to the outer portion of the boom. These systems use either a line, a hand operated crank, or a hydraulic or electric powered furler.|$|R
