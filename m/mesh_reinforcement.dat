The present authors have previously demonstrated that <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of stapled left pancreatectomy results in fewer pancreatic leaks. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate whether <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforcement</b> also results in cost benefits for the health care system. MethodsA cost benefit model was developed to estimate net cost savings from the payer's perspective. The model is {{based on the results of}} a randomized, single-blinded trial of mesh versus no <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforcement</b> of the pancreatic remnant after left pancreatectomy. A two-way sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the cost of mesh and the effectiveness of the mesh in reducing clinically significant leaks. ResultsAverage total costs for an episode of care were US$ 13337 and US$ 15505 for patients who did and did not receive mesh, respectively, which indicates savings of US$ 2168. Two-way sensitivity analysis showed that, given a probability of 1. 9 % for developing a clinically significant leak in patients in whom <b>mesh</b> <b>reinforcement</b> was used, the strategy would continue to save costs if mesh were priced at ≤US$ 1804.

40|$|Composite steel-concrete floor slabs are {{a type of}} {{flooring}} {{that consists}} of a steel profiled deck, cast in-place concrete and steel <b>reinforcement</b> <b>meshes</b> in the concrete and steel reinforcement bars in the profiled ribs of the steel deck. Composite floors can roughly be separated into two types, those that use: shallow steel decks and deep steel decks. The deep profiled deck ComFlor 210 is installed by hand and is then used as a work floor and as permanent form work for the casting of the concrete. The use of deep composite steel-concrete floor slabs is advantageous if aspects such as low self-weight, construction speed and floor height are important. The ComFlor 210 composite floor is constructed by default with one <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh,</b> but if a large concentrated force is expected in the design than a second <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh</b> is added. However the effect that this added mesh has {{on the distribution of}} that concentrated force is not exactly known. The design of deep composite slabs also falls outside of the scope of Eurocode 4, design of composite structure, which leads to conservative assumptions and inefficient usage of materials. These factors lead to a need for more insight into the behaviour of composite slabs loaded by a concentrated load and in what manner this is effected by the addition of a second <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh.</b> An analytical was created in order to predict the horizontal distribution. In the analytical model it was chosen to only model a two dimensional strip over the width of the composite slab. Any three dimensional aspects occurring in the slabwere then incorporated into the two dimensional model. This was achieved by assuming the ribs of the composite slab as zero dimensional points which were supported by translation springs. The translation springs were modelling the ribs deflection and stiffness behaviour. The top part of the composite slab was modelled as a continuous beam spanning the entire width of the model. In order to incorporate the rotation resistance of the ribs, rotation springs were used to connect the ribs to the translation springs. For the analytical model accuracy, ease of use and a basis in mechanical behaviour were the aims. A finite elementmodel was also created in order to validate the analytical model and to analyse the behaviour of the composite slabs. Only a quarter of the slab was modelled by making use of the symmetry and only the areas of the steel deck effective in bending were included in the model. Finally laboratory experiments were also performed on life-sized test specimens. Three test specimens: one with two <b>reinforcement</b> <b>meshes,</b> one with one mesh and one without a mesh were tested. A concentrated load was applied in a non-destructive test at a quarter of the span length and a destructive test was performed at half the span length. The results of these tests were compared with the analytical and finite element model. The result of the comparison was that the accuracy goal of the analytical model could not be reached. This was because the translation springs in the model included both the distribution at the point of loading and the redistribution between that point and the supports. Therefore the distribution cannot be accurately estimated without further research and experimentation. The analytical model should therefore be revised in order to more easily assess its parameters. The stiffness of the supports is another aspect that was not taken into account into the model that could be included. The finite element model also did not have sufficient accuracy in order to use as a validation method, possibly due to the use of only the effective steel profile. Adding the whole steel deck might improve the accuracy. The experiment results yielded the conclusion that the second <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh</b> increases the distribution of the load in the horizontal direction significantly while loaded at mid span. The slab without mesh also could be loaded until high loads of 100 kN, but its load was far more concentrated than in the other slabs. Although initially at 10 kN all slabs had very similar distributions and until a load 60 kN the maximum difference in the middle rib was only 10 % of the total applied load. It was also concluded that the steel deck was active in the transverse direction after the chemical steelconcrete bonding was lost, but the size of contribution depended on the number of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>meshes.</b> Suggestions for future research that were not included in this thesis include the horizontal and vertical shear capacity of the composite deck, the crack propagation in the slabs and the behaviour of the steel-concrete chemical bond.

40|$|It {{is common}} that {{buildings}} are renovated and their functional use is changed which leads tonew layouts of floor plans and that new installations {{are necessary to}} be made. These changesentails that load bearing walls are removed and new door, window and shaft openings needs tobe made in already existing load bearing walls. Reinforced concrete walls are nowadayscommon as structural members in buildings. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have knowledge ofhow cut-out openings affect their structural behavior. This is nowadays almost unexplored andthe international codes, for example Eurocode 2 (2008), treat openings in walls indirectly,through the column theory. Further research is necessary in this subject to gain knowledge onhow cracks, failure mode and the ultimate load are affected by a cut-out opening, reinforcementratio and placement and the eccentricity of the load. A parametric study was performed with the finite element method (FEM) program ATENA(Version 5. 3. 2) (2015). A benchmark process was performed against experimental tests,reported by Popescu et al. (2015 b), on three different walls: one solid wall, one wall with largedoor opening (A 0 /A= 50 %) and one wall with small door opening (A 0 /A= 25 %). The materialparameters were benchmarked according to laboratory tests. The investigated walls in FEA andin the experimental tests were two-way walls with a centric <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh.</b> The parametric study included seven different wall types, one solid wall and six walls withopenings with A 0 /A between 25 - 75 %. Each wall was investigated to four load eccentricities,e= 0 mm, e= 10 mm, e= 15 mm, e= 30 mm. The influence of the reinforcement was investigatedby an analysis of an unreinforced wall and a wall with a centric placed <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh.</b> The influence of placement of the reinforcement was investigated by an analysis of a wall witha centric <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh</b> and a wall with two <b>reinforcement</b> <b>meshes,</b> one at each face ofthe wall. In both cases the reinforcement ratio was kept constant. The effect of the reinforcementratio was also investigated by increase the reinforcement ratio of a centrically placedreinforcement mesh by 4 times. The parametric study showed that the investigated door opening sizes gave a reduction of theultimate load with up to 74 % compared to the solid wall. It was noted that the opening sizeaffects the crack pattern of the wall but the influence of the door opening size decreases withan increased eccentricity. The parametric study also showed that the investigated loadeccentricities gave a reduction of the ultimate load with up to 82 % compared to when the loadact centrically on the wall. The influence of eccentricity decrease with increased door openingsize. It was also proved that reinforcement always increases the ultimate load. Anotherconclusion was that an increased reinforcement ratio by 4 times increases the ultimate load upto 11. 2 %. A placement of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>mesh</b> in two layers, one at each face of the wall,instead of one centric increases the ultimate load up to 10. 2 %. Ultimate loads calculated in the finite element analysis (FEA) were compared to Eurocode 2 (2008) and a design equation according to Doh and Fragomeni (2006). The most accurate wasDoh and Fragomeni (2006) compared to the FEA. But both Eurocode 2 (2008) and Doh andFragomeni (2006) showed ultimate loads with large deviations for some wall types.
