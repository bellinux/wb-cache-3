40|$|Tracking of cell {{populations in}} vitro in time lapse mi-croscopy images enables {{automatic}} high throughput spa-tiotemporal measurements {{of a range}} of cell cycle mechanics and dynamics. Both in clinical and academic environments, large scale cellular data analysis using such methods stands to facilitate a paradigm shift in approaches to understanding cell biology. In this paper, we present a novel approach to cell population tracking and segmentation. We employ the CONDENSATION algorithm in tandemwith Fast Levels Sets and Exclusion Zones for robust tracking and pixel-accurate segmentation. The algorithm feeds its output to a lineage fil-ter. The complete approach is validated in terms of its ability to track and identify nuclei, and by its success in detecting abnormalities in the length of <b>mitosis.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Spatiotemporal, Bayesian, Cells, Analy-sis. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} (ZnO NPs) on the root growth, root apical meristem mitosis and mitotic aberrations of garlic (Allium sativum L.) were investigated. ZnO NPs caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of root length. When treated with 50 mg/L ZnO NPs for 24 h, the root growth of garlic was completely blocked. The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) {{was estimated to}} be 15 mg/L. The <b>mitosis</b> <b>index</b> was also decreased in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. ZnONPs also induced several kinds of mitotic aberrations, mainly consisted of chromosome stickiness, bridges, breakages and laggings. The total percentage of abnormal cells increased with the increase of ZnONPs concentration and the prolongation of treatment time. The investigation provided new information for the possible genotoxic effects of ZnO NPs on plants...|$|E
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} gastrointestinal motility during 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) -induced intestinal mucositis. Materials {{and methods}} Wistar rats received 5 -FU (150 mg kg(- 1), i. p.) or saline. After the 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th, 15 th and 30 th day, sections of duodenum, jejunum and ileum were removed for assessment of epithelial damage, apoptotic and mitotic indexes, MPO activity and GSH concentration. In order to study gastrointestinal motility, on the 3 rd or 15 th day after 5 -FU treatment, gastric emptying in vivo {{was measured by}} scintilographic method, and stomach or duodenal smooth muscle contractions induced by CCh were evaluated in vitro. Results On {{the third day of}} treatment, 5 -FU induced a significant villi shortening, an increase in crypt depth and intestinal MPO activity and a decrease in villus/crypt ratio and GSH concentration. On the first day after 5 -FU there was an increase in the apoptosis index and a decrease in the <b>mitosis</b> <b>index</b> in all intestinal segments. After the 15 th day of 5 -FU treatment, a complete reversion of all these parameters was observed. There was a delay in gastric emptying in vivo and a significant increase in gastric fundus and duodenum smooth muscle contraction, after both the 3 rd and 15 th day. Conclusions 5 -FU-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility outlasts intestinal mucositis. CNPq (Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Zhiqiang Jiang, Jian Zhang, Zhi Li, Yingjun Liu, Daohai Wang, Guangsen Han Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People’s Republic of China Abstract: Numerous {{types of}} KIT {{mutations}} {{have been reported}} in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs); however, controversy still exists regarding their clinicopathological significance. In this study, we reviewed the publicly available literature to assess the data by a meta-analysis to characterize KIT mutations and different types of KIT mutations in prognostic prediction in patients with GISTs. Twenty-eight studies that included 4, 449 patients were identified and analyzed. We found that KIT mutation status was closely correlated with size of tumors and different <b>mitosis</b> <b>indexes,</b> but not with tumor location. KIT mutation was also observed to be significantly correlated with tumor recurrence, metastasis, as well as the overall survival of patients. Interestingly, there was higher risk of progression in KIT exon 9 -mutated patients than in exon 11 -mutated patients. Five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was significantly higher in KIT exon 11 -deleted patients than in those with other types of KIT exon 11 mutations. In addition, RFS for 5  years was significantly worse in patients bearing KIT codon 557 – 558 deletions than in those bearing other KIT exon 11 deletions. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that KIT mutation status is another evaluable factor for prognosis prediction in GISTs. Keywords: KIT, meta-analysis, prognosis, marker, therap...|$|R
40|$|Neodymium {{magnetic}} fields action on plant organisms {{it is of}} interest to specialists because of their influence on the activity of DNA from the cell nucleus, especially on the conformational aspects of the genome. Due to the application of neodymium {{magnetic fields}} treatments were obtained valuable varieties of plants (particularly food such as cereals) with superior productive features, adequate to human needs. The aim of our research has been highlighting the impact of magnetic fields on cellular and genome dynamics in irradiated meristems. Our investigations establish the inhibitory effects of neodymium treatments on <b>mitosis</b> (mitotic <b>index</b> values compared to the control) and also detect disturbances in the mitosis process, and at the chromosomal level, disturbances that typically occur after treatment with various chemical agents. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 5 -hydroxyuracil (5 -HU) (isobarbituric acid) upon cell elongation, mitosis, and DNA {{synthesis}} were studied in Vicia faba roots. 5 -HU had no consistent effect upon root elongation. It blocked DNA synthesis (analyzed by photometric measurements of Feulgen dye in nuclei) {{during the first}} 6 hours of treatment; the block spontaneously disappeared by the 12 th hour of treatment. Uracil and thymine had no effect upon this block of synthesis. Both thymidine and uridine reversed the block in 6 and 9 hours respectively. In all cases blockage of DNA synthesis was followed by inhibition of mitosis (determined by changes {{in the percentage of}} cells in mitosis) and resumption of DNA synthesis was followed by resumption of <b>mitosis.</b> Inhibition <b>indices</b> calculated from the mitotic data indicated a competitive relationship between 5 -HU and thymidine and 5 -HU and uridine. 5 -HU is considered to block DNA synthesis by competing with thymidine for sites on enzymes involved in the synthesis. It is suggested that uridine reverses the block in synthesis by undergoing a conversion to thymidine...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the immunohistochemical expression of p 16, Ki- 67, p 53 and Bcl- 2 proteins in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST); {{to assess the}} possible association between these variables and clinical and histopathological factors of cancer; and to check for prognostic value of these variables (survival and recurrence). METHODS: A sample of 55 patients treated surgically for GIST in three hospitals was studied. The surgically excised tumors were confirmed as GIST by KIT, vimentin, desmin S 100 protein, CD 117, 1 A 4 and CD 34 assessment in paraffin blocks. RESULTS: Only 9 (16 %) cases of GIST were positive for p 53, p 16 was positive among 43. 6 %; 80 % of GISTs showed staining for Bcl- 2. The proliferative index (expressed as the proportion of positive cells) assessed by immunohistochemical expression of Ki- 67 was high in 49 % of cases. Elevated Ki- 67 scores were associated to high histological grade (p= 0. 0026) and <b>mitosis</b> <b>index,</b> MI (p= 0. 0001). High Ki- 67 index was associated to death. Expression of p 53, p 16 and Bcl- 2 did not correlate to morphological or clinical variables. CONCLUSIONS: Ki- 67 immunohistochemical evaluation {{should be included in}} preoperative evaluation of GIST biopsies or surgical specimens as a prognostic tool for clinical staging; and all other proteins studied (Bcl- 2, p 53 and p 16) did not play a role in GIST metabolic or carcinogenic process, remaining without prognostic value...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and aimThe liver shows {{remarkable}} regeneration ability after {{damage or}} resection. The main stimulant for hepatic regeneration is resection. Erythropoietin (EPO), which was initially used for anemia therapy, is today {{known as a}} general tissue protector owing to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenic properties. This study aims to investigate the effect of systemically administered EPO on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. MethodsForty-eight male Wistar albino rats were randomly split in two groups A and B consisting of 24 rats each. Standard 70 % hepatectomy {{was performed on the}} rats in group A. The same surgical procedure was performed on the rats in group B, and they were additionally administered 3000  U/kg/subcutaneous EPO. The rats were sacrificed 24, 48, and 72  h after resection. The groups were compared in terms of biochemical, morphological, and histopathological parameters. ResultsThe biochemical results showed that the administration of EPO decreased aspartate aminotransferase levels significantly (p <  0. 05) at 24  h after hepatectomy. A comparison of the groups in terms of relative liver weight showed that EPO-treated groups exhibited a statistically significant increase (p <  0. 05) for all three time periods. Histopathology results showed that in the EPO-treated groups, the <b>mitosis</b> <b>index</b> at 48 and 72  h, double nuclei cell number at 72  h, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen ratio at 48  h showed a significant increase (p <  0. 05). ConclusionOur study showed that systemically administering high-dose EPO increases regeneration by affecting the biochemical, morphological, and histopathological parameters after liver resection...|$|E
40|$|Effects of rhGH and rhIGF- 1 on renal {{growth and}} morphology. It {{is known that}} in rodents {{recombinant}} human growth hormone (rhGH) and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor (rhIGF- 1) increase renal mass. It is uncertain, however, whether renal mass increases in proportion to body growth, or whether renal growth is stimulated selectively. In 120 to 150 g female Sprague-Dawley rats, we measured the effects of rhGH and rhIGF- 1 and their combination by the following parameters: kidney weight/body weight ratio, DNA/protein ratio, mRNA of GH receptor and of IGF- 1, <b>mitosis</b> <b>index</b> and PCNA (by immunohistology), zonal architecture and glomerular diameter by micromorphometry. Both rhGH and rhIGF- 1 dose-dependently increased renal weight and body weight over vehicle treated controls. With rhGH, liver dry weight/body weight ratio increased, but kidney dry weight/body weight ratio remained unchanged (0. 99 ± 0. 06 × 10 - 3 vs. 1. 02 ± 0. 07 in vehicle controls). In contrast, a significant increase of kidney dry weight/body weight ratio was seen in rats treated with rhIGF- 1 (1. 3 ± 0. 21 × 10 - 3). Addition of high doses of rhGH to high doses of rhIGF- 1 caused no further increase of the ratio despite a significant further increase of body weight. rhGH increased the abundance of renal GH receptor mRNA (0. 46 ± 0. 32 amol/μg DNA vs. 0. 08 ± 0. 07 in controls) and of IGF- 1 mRNA (1. 35 ± 0. 5 pg//μg DNA vs. 0. 35 ± 0. 17), whereas no change was seen with IGF- 1 treatment. rhGH and rhIGF- 1 increased kidney DNA/protein ratio, mitoses and PCNA expression in various renal structures. Further stimulation of mitoses by rhGH was seen even after subtotal nephrectomy, which was associated with markedly stimulated baseline proliferation of renal cells. The results document that rhGH increases renal weight in proportion to body weight while rhIGF- 1 increases it {{out of proportion to}} body weight. Both peptides increase renal glomerular and tubular cell proliferation and renal DNA/protein ratio. This observation points to a major role of hyperplasia in renal weight gain of young female animals treated with the peptides. The size of glomeruli increased, but the increment was in proportion to body weight. Glomerulosclerosis was not detected even after 60 days of treatment with rhGH or with rhIGF- 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{histology}} and mitotic {{indices of}} rat laryngeal epithelia were investigated. Five distinct types of epithelia were found: stratified squamous, squamoid (low squamous), respiratory and two cuboidal forms. Squamous epithelium was present {{mainly in the}} cranial portion of the larynx, whereas the respiratory type was mostly located in caudal regions. One type of cuboidal epithelium often formed intermediate zones between squamous and respiratory areas. Another form of cuboidal epithelium lined the ventral pouch, and the vocal folds were covered by a low squamous or squamoid type. The mitotic index {{for each type of}} epithelium was calculated using colchicine and was expressed as the percentage of total epithelial cells of that kind in <b>mitosis.</b> Mitotic <b>indices</b> for laryngeal epithelial types were: 5. 6 % in squamous epithelium; 2. 4 % in the squamoid epithelium of the vocal folds; 2. 2 % in the cuboidal epithelium in the ventrolateral region; 1. 5 % in the cuboidal epithelium of the ventral pouch, and 0. 6 % in respiratory epithelium, although in isolated ciliated areas in the lower epiglottis it was considerably higher (2. 6 %). There {{were no significant differences between}} rats examined on different occasions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Surgery is {{the first}} line {{treatment}} for low-grade neuroblastomas. In stage I tumors, the presence of MYCN amplification is rarely detected and the Shimada histology is not always taken into consideration when deciding on the treatment. This study concerns {{the significance of these}} two factors in the evolution of children with low-grade neuroblastomas. METHODS: We analyzed the assessment and follow-up of children with low-grade neuroblastomas (stages I and II) with or without MYCN amplification, with either a favorable or unfavorable histology and with or without tumor cell diploidy. Favorable histology was defined as stroma-poor tumors with more than 5 % differentiating neuroblasts and a <b>mitosis</b> karyorrhexis <b>index</b> (MKI) of less than 100 / 5000 cells. RESULTS: From 1995 to 2006, out of 114 neuroblastomas, nine (7. 9 %) were stage I and 21 (18. 4 %) stage II. Of these 30 patients, 27 underwent surgery alone and three received chemotherapy after surgery. The combination of MYCN amplification, unfavorable histology and diploidy was noted in one patient who developed metastases within two months. MYCN amplification alone was noted in two cases who are still tumor-free after two years. Unfavorable histology alone was noted in four patients, of whom one suffered a recurrence of the tumor (previously stage I) and three are tumor-free after six years. Tumor cell diploidy alone was present in 11 patients whose evolution is satisfactory. CONCLUSION: Because MYCN amplification and unfavorable histology are rare in early stage neuroblastomas, these tumors may be misclassified if they are not investigated further. It seems that no single clinical or biological feature can be considered a significant factor in establishing a prognosis or determining whether additional treatment is required...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar os efeitos do omeprazol e do pantoprazol sobre a regeneração hepática após hepatectomia parcial. MÉTODOS: Cinqüenta e oito ratos Wistar machos foram divididos em 4 grupos: Grupo SHAM, Grupo HP, Grupo PANTO e Grupo OMEP. Eles foram submetidos a hepatectomia parcial de 67 % (Grupos HP, PANTO e OMEP) ou laparotomia (Grupo SHAM). Os fígados foram removidos 32 e 56 horas após a operação. Depois, os animais foram sacrificados. Em todos os grupos, as substâncias (solução salina, omeprazol e pantoprazol) foram aplicadas diariamente a partir do momento em que foram operados até o sacrifício. RESULTADOS: O índice de mitose no Grupo SHAM não foi significativo. Trinta e duas horas após a hepatectomia, a contagem de mitoses foi de 1, 2 ± 1, 09 para o Grupo HP, 1, 2 ± 1, 6 para o Grupo OMEP e 2, 6 ± 3, 2 para o Grupo PANTO. Na análise após 56 horas, os valores foram 1, 6 ± 0, 89 para o HP, 2 ± 1, 8 para o OMEP e 2, 6 ± 0, 54 para o PANTO. Esses resultados não foram estatisticamente significativos. CONCLUSÃO: O omeprazol e o pantoprazol, agentes inibidores da bomba de prótons (H+, K+-ATPase), não interferem na regeneração hepática 32 e 56 horas após hepatectomia parcial a 67 % em ratos. PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} effects of {{omeprazole}} and pantoprazole on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. METHODS: Fifty eight male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: SHAM, HP, PANTO and OMEP Groups. They were submitted to 67 % partial hepatectomy (HP, PANTO and OMEP Groups) or laparotomy (SHAM Group). Their livers were removed 32 and 56 hours after the operation. Then, the animals were sacrificed. In all groups, the substances (saline solution, omeprazole and pantoprazole) were injected once daily {{from the moment they}} were operated on until the time of sacrifice. RESULTS: In SHAM Group the mitotic index was not significant. Thirty two hours after hepatectomy, the <b>mitosis</b> <b>index</b> was 1. 2 ± 1. 09 in HP Group, 1. 2 ± 1. 6 in OMEP Group and 2. 6 ± 3. 2 in PANTO Group. Concerning the 56 -hour analysis, the values were 1. 6 ± 0. 89 in HP Group, 2 ± 1. 8 in OMEP Group and 2. 6 ± 0. 54 in PANTO Group. These results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole and pantoprazole, proton pump inhibitors (H+, K+-ATPase), do not cause any change on liver regeneration 32 and 56 hours after 67 % partial hepatectomy in rats...|$|E
