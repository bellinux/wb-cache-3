5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E. Myers of Springfield, Illinois, {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named Tuebor, which <b>means</b> <b>I</b> will defend. Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the United States Capitol in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of Colorado and Texas, {{as well as the}} former territorial capitol building of Idaho, the most by any architect. The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated {{at the same time as}} the inauguration of Governor Charles Croswell January 1, 1879.|$|E
25|$|I don't {{know what}} Color Field {{painting}} <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> {{think it was}} probably invented by some critic, which is okay, but I don't think the phrase means anything. Color Field painting? I mean, what is color? Painting {{has to do with}} a lot of things. Color is among the things it has to do with. It has to do with surface. It has to do with shape, It has to do with feelings which are more difficult to get at.|$|E
25|$|Do {{you know}} how offhand that comment was and how many times I’ve had to face it since? I did say that. It was kind of true, {{but it was also}} a bit tongue-in-cheek. We were kind of told that might be the reason. It’s a six-minute song, which {{requires}} maturity for listening. What they specifically said, apparently, was that the voice was too mature. I don’t know if that <b>means</b> <b>I</b> sound old or I sound intelligent. I’m going to hope that it’s the latter.|$|E

25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it <b>means</b> <b>I</b> don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

500|$|Asked by Idol {{about how}} he could become further {{involved}} in cyberculture, Branwyn and Mark Frauenfelder advised him to investigate The WELL, {{one of the oldest}} online communities. Idol did so, discussing the album project online with WELL users, and creating a personal e-mail account which he released on printed advertisements for the upcoming album, so that fans could communicate with him. Idol also made occasional postings to alt.cyberpunk, a Usenet newsgroup. Later in an interview for MTV News promoting the album, Idol expressed excitement over the medium.

500|$|The Field Spaniel was {{originally}} {{developed for the}} show ring by competitors who were attempting to develop an all-black Spaniel.

500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision <b>means</b> <b>I</b> may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency is not my life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|Languages differ {{widely in}} how much they rely on {{morphological}} processes of word formation. In some languages, for example, Chinese, there are no morphological processes, and all grammatical information is encoded syntactically by forming strings of single words. This type of morpho-syntax is often called isolating, or analytic, because there is almost a full correspondence between a single word and a single aspect of meaning. Most languages have words consisting of several morphemes, but they vary in {{the degree to which}} morphemes are discrete units. In many languages, notably in most Indo-European languages, single morphemes may have several distinct meanings that cannot be analyzed into smaller segments. For example, in Latin, the word bonus, or [...] "good", consists of the root bon-, meaning [...] "good", and the suffix -us, which indicates masculine gender, singular number, and nominative case. These languages are called fusional languages, because several meanings may be fused into a single morpheme. The opposite of fusional languages are agglutinative languages which construct words by stringing morphemes together in chains, but with each morpheme as a discrete semantic unit. An example of such a language is Turkish, where for example, the word evlerinizden, or [...] "from your houses", consists of the morphemes, ev-ler-iniz-den with the meanings house-plural-your-from. The languages that rely on morphology to the greatest extent are traditionally called polysynthetic languages. They may express the equivalent of an entire English sentence in a single word. For example, in Persian the single word nafahmidamesh <b>means</b> <b>I</b> didn't understand it consisting of morphemes na-fahm-id-am-esh with the meanings, [...] "negation.understand.past.I.it". As another example with more complexity, in the Yupik word tuntussuqatarniksatengqiggtuq, which means [...] "He had not yet said again {{that he was going to}} hunt reindeer", the word consists of the morphemes tuntu-ssur-qatar-ni-ksaite-ngqiggte-uq with the meanings, [...] "reindeer-hunt-future-say-negation-again-third.person.singular.indicative", and except for the morpheme tuntu ("reindeer") none of the other morphemes can appear in isolation.|$|E
