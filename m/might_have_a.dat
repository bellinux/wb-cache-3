5|$|In 1989, {{the death}} of Emperor Hirohito once again raised moral issues about the {{national}} flag. Conservatives felt that if the flag could be used during the ceremonies without reopening old wounds, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to propose that the Hinomaru become the national flag without being challenged about its meaning. During an official six-day mourning period, flags were flown at half staff or draped in black bunting all across Japan. Despite reports of protesters vandalizing the Hinomaru {{on the day of}} the Emperor's funeral, schools' right to fly the Japanese flag at half-staff without reservations brought success to the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{electrons}} {{moving in}} vacuum are termed free electrons. Electrons in metals also behave {{as if they}} were free. In reality the particles that are commonly termed electrons in metals and other solids are quasi-electrons—quasiparticles, which have the same electrical charge, spin, and magnetic moment as real electrons but <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different mass. When free electrons—both in vacuum and metals—move, they produce a net flow of charge called an electric current, which generates a magnetic field. Likewise a current can be created by a changing magnetic field. These interactions are described mathematically by Maxwell's equations.|$|E

5|$|Some {{palladium}} is emitted {{with the}} exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food {{is estimated to}} be less than 2µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium {{is estimated to be}} less than 15µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle's affinities {{beyond the}} Sanford's sea eagle {{are a little}} less clear; {{molecular}} data indicate that {{it is one of}} four species of tropical sea eagle (along with the African fish eagle and the Madagascar fish eagle), while allozyme data indicate it <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> closer relationship with the sea eagles of the northern hemisphere. A further molecular study published in 2005 showed the white-bellied and Sanford's sea eagles to be basal to the four fish eagles (the two mentioned above plus the two hitherto untested species of the genus Ichthyophaga).|$|E

5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops suspicions that Denise <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|Family Guy {{had been}} {{canceled}} in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on Adult Swim became the cable network's most watched program, {{and more than}} three million DVDs of the show were sold. Much of the plot and many of the technical aspects of the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie North by Northwest; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29shows that were canceled by Fox after Family Guy was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance at returning.|$|E
5|$|NHL {{broadcaster}} Darren Eliot {{attributes the}} {{apparent lack of}} playoff success to the different style of competition compared to the regular season: instead of playing different teams every night, {{the goal is to}} advance through four best-of-seven playoff series. The Presidents' Trophy winner may have to go through other playoff clubs who <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hotter goaltender, a better defensive team or other players that pose match-up problems. If the regular-season champion's primary success was merely outscoring others, they may be out of luck facing goaltenders that can shut them out. The lack of playoff experience may have been to blame in the examples of the 1999–2000 St. Louis Blues and 2008–09 San Jose Sharks, as neither team had advanced past the second round for five or more seasons. Teams have often given up pursuit of finishing first in the League in order to avoid injuries and rest key players for the postseason.|$|E

So too a bona fide {{possessor}} <b>might</b> <b>have</b> it, and, if the man was really free, both <b>might</b> <b>have</b> it.|$|R
5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear he <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to osmium, it should also occur along with osmium in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E

5|$|Sir Alex Ferguson {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the starting line-up for Paul Scholes, after the midfielder had missed the 1999 final through suspension. Ferguson made one change from the team that had beaten Wigan Athletic to secure the league title 10 days earlier, with Owen Hargreaves starting {{on the right side of}} midfield in a 4–4–2 formation in place of Park Ji-sung, who did not even make the substitutes bench despite starting both legs of the semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo started on the left wing, where he was pitted against makeshift Chelsea right-back Michael Essien. This went against the prediction of The Guardians David Pleat, who thought a duel between Ronaldo and Ashley Cole would be key to the final. Ferguson hoped his substitutes <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> big impact on the match, just as Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær did in 1999, when the pair came off the bench to help Manchester United come from behind and beat Bayern Munich. A week before the game, Ryan Giggs was philosophical about his chances of being included in the starting line-up; he was eventually named as one of seven allowed substitutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} {{crystals}} {{could be used}} as a diffraction grating for X-rays arose in 1912 in a conversation between Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue in the English Garden in Munich. Ewald had proposed a resonator model of crystals for his thesis, but this model could not be validated using visible light, since the wavelength was much larger than the spacing between the resonators. Von Laue realized that electromagnetic radiation of a shorter wavelength was needed to observe such small spacings, and suggested that X-rays <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wavelength comparable to the unit-cell spacing in crystals. Von Laue worked with two technicians, Walter Friedrich and his assistant Paul Knipping, to shine a beam of X-rays through a copper sulfate crystal and record its diffraction on a photographic plate. After being developed, the plate showed a large number of well-defined spots arranged in a pattern of intersecting circles around the spot produced by the central beam. Von Laue developed a law that connects the scattering angles and the size and orientation of the unit-cell spacings in the crystal, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914.|$|E
