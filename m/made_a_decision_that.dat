25|$|Peter Minuit became Director of the New Netherland in 1626 and <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> greatly {{affected}} the new colony. Originally, {{the capital of}} the province was to be located on the South River, but it was soon realized that the location was susceptible to mosquito infestation in the summer and the freezing of its waterways in the winter. He chose instead the island of Manhattan {{at the mouth of the}} river explored by Hudson, at that time called the North River.|$|E
25|$|According to Minister Hwang, the Prosecutor's Office <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> Lee Seok-ki and his followers' {{crime is}} a clear danger and {{defiance}} to the free democratic basic order of the Republic of Korea, after a close analysis of the evidence. Prosecutors also said there are enough grounds for imprisonment of Lee Seok-ki and his accomplices, considering the following facts. The members of RO, a rebellion group, abided {{by the rules of}} organizational security. Under the rules they planned and executed detailed security principles and guidelines, such as destroying evidences. It was highly possible for the criminals to obstruct the investigators' activities of identifying {{the true nature of the}} RO.|$|E
25|$|The {{exploration}} of this theme in Oedipus Rex is paralleled by {{the examination of}} the conflict between the individual and the state in Antigone. The dilemma that Oedipus faces here {{is similar to that of}} the tyrannical Creon: each man has, as king, <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> his subjects question or disobey; each king also misconstrues both his own role as a sovereign and the role of the rebel. When informed by the blind prophet Tiresias that religious forces are against him, each king claims that the priest has been corrupted. It is here, however, that their similarities come to an end: while Creon, seeing the havoc he has wreaked, tries to amend his mistakes, Oedipus refuses to listen to anyone.|$|E

500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream because you could talk about a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{battle over}} the Pryor Mountain herd moved to the {{national}} level on July 11, 1968, when ABC broadcast a special on the horses on the evening news. The public reacted with outrage, and the BLM responded that [...] "no decision had yet been made regarding the horses." [...] However, {{by the end of}} August, a trap to collect the horses had been completed. At the same time, the BLM was unresponsive to efforts by members of the public, senators and officials from the Humane Society of the United States to ascertain final plans regarding the horses. Because of this, court proceedings were begun, and on August 27, 1968, a US District Court judge <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> had the result of barring the BLM from removing the horses from the range. On September 9, 1968, the Secretary of the Interior, Stewart L. Udall, declared the area inhabited by the Pryor Mountain Mustangs as the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Refuge (PMWHR), in a decision later noted in the Congressional Record. After the creation of the refuge the BLM appointed a committee to study the area and make recommendations regarding appropriate herd numbers. The committee, which met in late 1968 and early 1969, was made up of range and wildlife experts, local citizens interested in the herds and representatives from several federal, state and private organizations. A boundary adjustment was made to the refuge, adding some land in Wyoming. The final report of the committee, submitted in June 1969, was that the horses were not in danger of starvation, that overgrazing was likely due to domestic sheep who utilized the land decades earlier, and that horses were the most likely of any species to be able to survive and thrive in the Pryor Mountain environment. On December 18, 1971, the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA) was signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon. The Act made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use. [...] The Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service were jointly charged with responsibility for administrating the Act. The National Park Service was also involved in the management of the land. These federal agencies were limited to managing horses only on public lands where [...] "wild horses were documented as being 'presently found' {{at the time of the}} passage of the Act in 1971." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his memoir, [...] "Against All Enemies", Clarke {{wrote that}} Condoleezza Rice <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> the {{position}} of National Coordinator for Counterterrorism should be downgraded. By demoting the office, the Administration sent a signal through the national security bureaucracy about the salience they assigned to terrorism. No longer would Clarke's memos go to the President; instead they had to pass through a chain of command of National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and her deputy Stephen Hadley, who bounced {{every one of them}} back.|$|E

2500|$|Lodge was {{instructed}} to maintain a strategy of [...] "cool correctness {{in order to make}} Diệm come to you", but to be ready to re-establish contact with Gia Long Palace if this strategy did not work. Lodge was specifically told to seek improvements in the ARVN military effort, domestic reforms by Diệm that would restore public belief in the South Vietnamese administration and its image. As a result of the mission and the preceding Krulak Mendenhall mission, the Kennedy administration <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> was described in the Pentagon Papers as [...] "a far-reaching decision on American policy toward South Vietnam". The tack of applying positive pressures against an ally to obtain compliance with American policies was taken optimistically given that it was to be led by an ambassador who was [...] "uniquely equipped by background and temperament to make it succeed".|$|E
2500|$|At {{that time}} the {{composition}} of the squad was influenced by the country's citizenship policy. There were disputes whether the national team should include players who lived in Estonia but had not acquired Estonian citizenship. Most of those players in question were of Russian origin. Approximately four months before the first official match against Slovenia, FC Flora presented the Estonian Football Association (EFA) an ultimatum signed by 25 players which stated that [...] "only those who have acquired Estonian citizenship on the basis of legal continuity {{should be included in the}} national team". In July of the same year FIFA gave the right to represent Estonia to 97 non-citizens who were according to EFA born in Estonia and were in the process of acquiring Estonian citizenship. In October the board of EFA <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> <b>that</b> after the 1 April 1993 non-citizens could no more debut in the national team.|$|E

5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial.

Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|R
