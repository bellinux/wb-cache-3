5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing <b>micro-organisms</b> from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most vegetables. Marrows, beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive <b>micro-organisms,</b> a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes. Fermentation is another method of preserving vegetables for later use. Sauerkraut is made from chopped cabbage and relies on lactic acid bacteria which produce compounds that are inhibitory to the growth of other <b>micro-organisms.</b>|$|E

However, upon returning to the normal universe, the paper with the formula on it turns into the <b>micro-organism's</b> formula. Not being able to find anyone on Red Dwarf, a vending machine (voiced by Tony Slattery) informs Rimmer that everyone crossed back into the mirror universe.

5|$|In the 1990s {{samples of}} extremophile molds {{were taken from}} Mir. Ninety species of <b>micro-organisms</b> were found in 1990, {{four years after the}} station's launch.

Moulds that develop aboard space stations can produce acids that degrade metal, glass and rubber. The moulds in Mir were found growing behind panels and inside air-conditioning equipment. The moulds also caused bad smell, which was often cited as visitors' strongest impressions.|$|E

5|$|Canning is {{a process}} during which the enzymes in {{vegetables}} are deactivated and the <b>micro-organisms</b> present killed by heat.

The can is then able to be stored at ambient temperatures for a long period.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using <b>micro-organisms</b> under moderate temperatures.

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete cellulase in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of <b>micro-organisms.</b>|$|E
5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus <b>micro-organisms</b> {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This {{suggests}} the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E

5|$|Sociobiology is {{the study}} of how social {{behaviour}} and organization have been influenced by evolution and other biological process. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in <b>micro-organisms</b> on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry <b>micro-organisms</b> including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of preserving vegetables is {{to extend their}} availability for consumption or marketing purposes. The aim is to harvest the food at its maximum state of palatability and nutritional value, and preserve these qualities for an extended period. The main causes of deterioration in vegetables after they are gathered are the actions of naturally-occurring enzymes and the spoilage caused by <b>micro-organisms.</b> Canning and freezing are {{the most commonly used}} techniques, and vegetables preserved by these methods are generally similar in nutritional value to comparable fresh products with regards to carotenoids, vitamin E, minerals. and dietary fiber.|$|E

40|$|Potential {{vegetative}} {{and reproductive}} increases in yield, {{as well as}} the biological efficacy against Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum causing ear and stem rot in maize crops of commercially-formulated <b>micro-organism</b> formulation T-Gro (Trichoderma harzianum isolate DB 103 WP) combined with Spartacus (Beauveria bassiana isolate DB 105 WP), T-Gro combined with Armenius (Bacillus subtilis isolate DB 109 WP), T-Gro combined with Maximus (Bacillus subtilis isolate DB 108 WP), T-Gro combined with Shelter (Bacillus subtilis isolate DB 101), T-Gro combined with Bismarck (Microbacterium maritypicum isolate DB 107 WP), as well as individual treatments of T-Gro, Armenius, Bismarck, Maximus and Shelter, were investigated when applied to maize seed and soil under field conditions. All the <b>micro-organism</b> treatments were compared with Thiram 750 WP (750 g/kg thiram WP) and an untreated control. The <b>micro-organism</b> treatments showed an increase in vegetative as well as reproductive yields when compared to the reference product Thiram 750 WP and the untreated control. There were no observations of adverse effects on the germination of maize seed in all the treatments that were applied. The three isolates B. subtilis, T. harzianum, and M. maritypicum, showed a significant reduction in vascular tissue discolouration of the main and ear stems, indicating a potential {{to be used in the}} reduction and control of diseases caused by Fusarium spp. Results also showed poor to very good increases of stem and foliage biomass as well as cob yield per plant produced by the <b>micro-organism</b> treatments when compared to the untreated control. The highest cob yield per plant that differed significantly from the untreated control was produced by T-Gro and Shelter. No phytotoxicity of any kind was observed with the application of the <b>micro-organism</b> formulations and they could therefore be deemed suitable to be used for the treatment of maize seed. The <b>micro-organism</b> formulations containing fungal and bacterial biological control agents have the potential to be used in commercial maize production to increase vegetative and reproductive yields and reduce the severity of ear and stem rot in maize.
