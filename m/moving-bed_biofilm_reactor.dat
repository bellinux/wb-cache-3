The Klagshamn {{wastewater treatment plant}} plans to alter the primary settler into an in-line hydrolysis basin with subsequent predenitrification to reduce the nitrate load into the overstrained <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor.</b> A reference scenario, which included annual data from the process control system, was established and calibrated with the operational findings from the plant in 2007 to form a dynamic wastewater model. A method for generating a complete annual data set based on laboratory values was established and implemented with the model. The simulated results agreed well with Klagshamn’s actual operation. In addition, the simulated results of the proposed in-line hydrolysis basin were {{used to evaluate the}} potential for predenitrification. The results with hydrolysate showed that an additional 40 t·a- 1 of nitrogen could be denitrified compared to the reference scenario...|$|E
40|$|Many {{wastewater}} treatment plant (WWTP) simulators include biofilm reactor modules, enabling a more widespread application of biofilm models in engineering practice. To increase acceptance, and promote proper and effective biofilm model use in practice, a framework for biofilm reactor model calibration and application is needed. A step-wise calibration approach for biofilm reactor models was presented at WWTmod 2012. The proposed calibration framework {{was used in this}} study to calibrate a biofilm reactor model for a full-scale tertiary nitrification <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR). Steady-state model calibration was based on monitoring data for effluent NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N and TSS concentrations, along with measured biofilm biomass averaged over five years. Three parameters, detachment rate, biofilm biomass concentration, and mass transfer boundary layer thickness, were adjusted to fit steady-state model results to measured data. Dynamic simulation with the calibrated model showed a poor representation of the timely evolution of the biofilm biomass, which did not negatively influence the prediction of nitrification rates. For dynamic calibration, however, a question needs to be addressed: How can we {{deal with the fact that}} the timely evolution of the biofilm biomass may not be described mechanistically well enough by biofilm models (as in this study) ...|$|E
40|$|Ammonium {{nitrogen}} {{concentration in}} leachate from old Italian landfills ranges from 0. 5 to {{as high as}} 3 g L- 1. In this paper biological nitrogen removal from leachate has been achieved by partial nitrification to nitrite in a pure-oxygen membrane bioreactor (PO-MBR) and by subsequent denitrification in a <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR). When ammonium is biologically oxidized to nitrite, only 75 % of the oxygen required for full nitrification is needed. Moreover, denitrification can be performed by saving 30 - 40 % of the carbon required. The process {{was carried out by}} an MBR oxidation tank of 500 L equipped with an UF ceramic membrane followed by a 540 -L post-denitrification tank filled with moving plastic support media. The best operational conditions to achieve partial nitrification were analyzed. TKN loading rate was variable from 50 to 120 g TKN (kg TSS day) (- 1) with an influent ammonia concentration between 1000 and 1500 mg L- 1. When DO concentration in the MBR was kept in the range 0. 2 - 0. 5 mg L- 1, 90 % oxidation of ammonia to nitrite was achieved, with stable inhibition of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria even at sludge retention time higher than 45 days...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the impact}} of COD/N ratio and feeding regime on the {{dynamics}} of heterotrophs and nitrifiers in <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> was addressed. Based on DGGE analysis of 16 S rRNA genes, the influent COD {{was found to be}} the main factor determining the overall bacterial diversity. The amoA-gene-based analysis suggested that the dynamic behavior of the substrate in continuous and pulse-feeding reactors influenced the selection of specific ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) strains. Furthermore, AOB diversity was directly related to the applied COD/N ratio and ammonium-nitrogen load. Maximum specific ammonium oxidation rates observed under non-substrate-limiting conditions were observed to be proportional to the fraction of nitrifiers within the bacterial community. FISH analysis revealed that Nitrosomonas genus dominated the AOB community in all reactors. Moreover, Nitrospira was found to be the only nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in the fully autotrophic system, whereas Nitrobacter represented the dominant NOB genus in the organic carbon-fed reactors...|$|R

For this research, we {{arranged}} a pilot-scale {{activated sludge plant}} with an anoxic tank (1 m(3)), an aerated tank (1 m(3)), and a settler (1 m(3)); it was fed with municipal wastewater (at a rate of 300 L/h). This plant removed only 11 % of the NH 4 -N, so the aerated tank was divided into two reactors and polyethylene carriers were placed into each reactor. The upgraded plant removed 86 % of the ammonium and 73 % of the total nitrogen. The following step was a full-scale plant. A municipal activated sludge wastewater treatment plant, originally built for 3000 p. e., received a nitrogen load corresponding to 5800 p. e. (The term "p. e. " represents the persons equivalent.) A sector of each aerated tank was transformed to a hybrid MBBR: the aeration equipment was changed and polyethylene carriers were placed in these sectors.

40|$|The next {{revolution}} in biological nutrient removal at municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTPs) is fully autotrophic nitrogen removal. Extensive pilot tests at Sjölunda WWTP in Malmö, Sweden, are ongoing for implementing Manammox (mainstream anammox) in the existing plant, which already today separates COD and nitrogen removal. The Manammox concept {{is based on a}} combined process where nitritation-anammox is operated in <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> for sludge liquor treatment and treatment of mainstream wastewater with exchange of biofilm carriers between the two systems. Almost complete ammonium oxidation and more than 80 % nitrogen reduction was reached in the sludge liquor system and up to 60 % in the main stream process. Quantitative PCR showed almost the same composition of the bacterial population with high abundance of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidising bacteria in all reactors and that the exchange of carriers did not effectively suppress the nitrite-oxidising bacteria in the system. Optimal choice of the oxygen supply for the process seems to be crucial for further increase of the nitrogen reduction in the mainstream...|$|R

Hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 6, 3, and 2 [*]h can be achieved in CASP, MBBR, and PBBR, respectively. The PBBR dealt with a particular arrangement to prevent the restriction of oxygen transfer efficiency into the thick biofilms. The laboratory scale result revealed that the overall reduction of 87 % COD, 92 % BOD 5, 82 % TSS, 79 % NH 3 -N, 43 % PO 4 -P, 95 % MPN, and 97 % TVC at a HRT of 2 [*]h was achieved in PBBR. The microflora present in the system was also estimated through the isolation, identification, and immobilization of the microorganisms with an index of COD elimination. The number of bacterial species examined on the nutrient agar medium was 22 and five bacterial species were documented to degrade the organic pollutants by reducing COD by more than 43 %. This study illustrated that the present PBBR with a specific modified internal arrangement could be an ideal practice for promoting sustainable decentralization and therefore providing a low wastage sludge biomass concentration...|$|E
40|$|In biofilms, {{microbial}} activities form gradients {{of substrates}} and electron acceptors, creating a complex landscape of microhabitats, often resulting in structured localization of the microbial populations present. To understand the dynamic interplay between and within these populations, quantitative measurements and {{statistical analysis of}} their localization patterns within the biofilms are necessary, and adequate automated tools for such analyses are needed. We have designed and applied new methods for {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) and digital image analysis of directionally dependent (anisotropic) multispecies biofilms. A sequential-FISH approach allowed multiple populations to be detected in a biofilm sample. This was combined with an automated tool for vertical-distribution analysis by generating in silico biofilm slices and the recently developed Inflate algorithm for coaggregation analysis of microbial populations in anisotropic biofilms. As a proof of principle, we show distinct stratification patterns of the ammonia oxidizers Nitrosomonas oligotropha subclusters I and II and the nitrite oxidizer Nitrospira sublineage I in three different types of wastewater biofilms, suggesting niche differentiation between the N. oligotropha subclusters, which could explain their coexistence in the same biofilms. Coaggregation analysis showed that N. oligotropha subcluster II aggregated closer to Nitrospira than did N. oligotropha subcluster I in a pilot plant nitrifying trickling filter (NTF) and a <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR), but not in a full-scale NTF, indicating important ecophysiological differences between these phylogenetically closely related subclusters.

Four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid) and two lipid-regulating agents (gemfibrozil and clofibric acid, a metabolite of clofibrate) {{were used as}} target substances at 40 mu g/L initial concentration. Three different wastewaters types originating from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{wastewater}} temperature on {{the rate of}} nitrification was studied in two pure-oxygen <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors,</b> fed on secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The first Reactor (R 1) was operated under ammonia-limiting conditions, while the second Reactor (R 2) was operated under oxygen-limiting conditions. Quite surprisingly, the former showed a negligible influence of thermal changes on nitrification rates, while the latter showed a much higher dependence. In this paper, a temperature coefficient "θ" {{has been defined as}} the actual "intrinsic" biological temperature coefficient, similar to the corresponding coefficient that is usually adopted for the design of activated-sludge processes. In addition, an "apparent" coefficient θa has been quantified independently, which was calculated according to the actual values of nitrification rates at different temperatures. The actual biological temperature coefficient "θ", ranged between 1. 086 and 1. 109 (average value 1. 098) under ammonia-limiting conditions, while under oxygen-limiting conditions was in the range 1. 023 - 1. 081 (average value 1. 058). The apparent value θa was near to unity (i. e. no temperature effect) under ammonia-limiting conditions, while only under oxygen-limiting conditions and at constant dissolved oxygen concentration "θa" coincided with "θ". An explanation was given that, under oxygen-limiting conditions, the specific biomass activity (i. e. the ratio of nitrification rate to biomass concentration) was strongly influenced by the combined effects of oxygen penetration through the biofilm and effluent temperature...|$|R
40|$|Separate {{treatment}} of supernatant with dewatering of digested sludge with application of partial nitritation/Anammox process is assessed to be a cost-effective way to remove about 10 - 15 % of influent nitrogen and, thereby, facilitate possibilities to reach required effluent requirements from the plant. The combined partial nitritation/Anammox {{process can be}} performed in two separate reactors or in one-stage. Both process options have been investigated in technical- and laboratory-scale pilot plants with <b>moving-bed</b> <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> (MBBR) filled with Kaldnes rings. Use of the two-stage process resulted in a very stable partial nitritation with a suitable nitrite to ammonium ratio (NAR) for the following Anammox step. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH value were identified as key factors for the partial nitritation process. The Anammox process could also be operated in a stable way. A high nitrite concentration, however, inhibited {{the process and the}} time for recovering the process at low nitrite concentration was about four months. Seeding of the partial nitritation reactor with Anammox bacteria (the recirculation of Anammox effluent to the nitritation reactor) {{turned out to be a}} simple and easy method to enable creation of an oxic-anoxic <b>biofilm</b> in one <b>reactor.</b> Studies have shown that such a one-stage system would be the best choice for full-scale implementation due to significantly higher nitrogen removal rates and easier operation. The partial nitritation process was found to be the rate-limiting reaction to perform the overall nitrogen removal. Measurements of conductivity and pH were suitable parameters for monitoring of the nitrogen reactions. A control and monitoring system was developed both for two-stage and one-stage technology. The system was mainly based on relationships between conductivity and inorganic nitrogen components, while in the one-stage technology measurements are used of both conductivity and pH and their relationships with inorganic nitrogen compounds. Alkalinity was an additional measured parameter suitable for process control and monitoring.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of a <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> model {{depends on the}} extent to which physical system conditions (particularly bulk-liquid hydrodynamics and their influence on biofilm dynamics) deviate from the ideal conditions upon which the model is based. It follows that an improved capacity to model a <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> does not necessarily rely on an improved biofilm model, but does rely on an improved mathematical description of the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> and its components. Existing <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> models typically include a one-dimensional biofilm model, a process (biokinetic and stoichiometric) model, and a continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CFSTR) mass balance that [when organizing CFSTRs in series] creates a pseudo two-dimensional (2 -D) model of bulk-liquid hydrodynamics approaching plug flow.

In the field of fermentation industry, they are ideal hosts for secondary metabolites and recombinant protein production.

40|$|Thesis summary In {{the last}} decade, {{numerous}} single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> of various configurations {{have been implemented}} at lab and pilot scale {{for the production of}} chemicals and biological products. Compared to their counterparts in submerged cultures, these processes benefit from the specific physiology of biofilms, i. e. high robustness of the microbial system, long-term activity, continuous implementation and low ratio size / productivity. However, the risks of biofouling and the lack of analytical tools for the control and the monitoring of biofilms are obstacles for scale-up strategies. Up to now, single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> have been mainly confined to the production of metabolites ranging from low (bulk chemicals) to medium (fine chemicals) added values. In this way, {{there is a need to}} design efficient single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> exhibiting good scalability potentials and intended for the production of high added value compounds. In this work, an experimental single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has been designed for the production of target molecules derived from metabolic pathways involved in biofilm physiology. On the basis of these criteria, three biological models having good abilities of biofilm formation and secretion performances were selected : -	the gram positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis for the production of surfactin, a surface active metabolite involved in biofilm formation. -	the filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei for the production of hydrophobin (HFBII), a surface active protein (7 kDa) involved in adhesion process of spores and mycelium on solid surface. -	the filamentous fungus Aspergillus oryaze (engineered strain) for the production of a recombinant protein (Gla::GFP) under the control of the glaB promoter specifically activated in solid-state fermentation. The proposed experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has the configuration of a trickle-bed bioreactor. The agitation axis of a stirred tank reactor has been removed and replaced by a stainless steel structured packing filling the top of the vessel. The liquid medium, located in the bottom of the vessel is continuously recirculated on the packing element thanks to a peristaltic pump. An ascending air flow is performed above the liquid phase just under the packing element. This thesis reports the screening of the three biological models in the experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor.</b> The results include the characterization of process performances in terms of biofilm formation and secretion of the target molecule under different operating conditions. An original methodology based on high energy X-ray tomography has been developed to non-invasively visualize and quantify the biofilm colonization inside the packing element. This technique has highlighted that biofilm colonization and liquid phase distribution across the packing are strongly interrelated phenomena. The biofilm of B. subtilis occurring by cell aggregation preferentially developed on solid areas wetted by the liquid. Accordingly, optimal operating conditions improving liquid phase distribution have been defined for biofilm colonization. The fungal biofilm of A. oryzae and T. reesei occuring by cell filamentation equally colonize submerged and aerial surfaces of the packing element. Consequently, another configuration of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> comprising a packing element totally immersed in the liquid medium has been investigated. The production yields of surfactin and hydrophobin in the experimental <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> are respectively 1. 25 and 2. 64 times greater than those of a submerged culture in a stirred tank reactor. This suggests that surface-active molecules involved in biofilm formation have a real interest for the design of single-species <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> Although the Gla::GFP fusion protein is greater produced in the stirred tank culture, its integrity was preserved in the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> despite the presence of proteases. This suggests that the quality and the stability of heterologous proteins produced in a fungal <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> are improved compared with a submerged culture. Finally, the implementation of the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> has led to technological progresses including low energy consumption, no foam formation, continuous processing and simplification of downstream process operations. Further experiments should deepen the understanding of structured phenotypic heterogeneity impact on secretion performances in the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor.</b> These experiments should consider development of operating conditions allowing for the growth of a thin biofilm homogeneously distributed on the whole surface provided by the packing element in order to optimize nutrients and metabolites mass transfers.

Biofouling is the most common and detrimental issue in <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> Bed fluidization and hydrogen supply limitation are convenient and effective solutions to mitigate biofouling...|$|R

We propose a new method; it is the separate use of three fish species scales: Sardinapilchardus, Diplodussargus, Umbrinaroncador as solid support of free biomass colonization in moving bed <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MBBR) used to improve the properties {{and the quality of}} clearance. The results of monitoring depollution parameters (pH, COD, SM, total nitrogen) are promising. Finally the scales quantity necessary has been optimized for economic and ecological reasons.

40|$|Diffusion of the {{electron}} acceptor is the rate controlling step in virtually all <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> employed for aerobic wastewater treatment. The membrane-aerated <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> (MABR) is a technology that can deliver oxygen at high rates and transfer efficiencies, thereby enhancing the biofilm activity. This paper provides a comparative performance rate analysis of the MABR {{in terms of its}} application for carbonaceous pollutant removal, nitrification/denitrification and xenobiotic biotreatment. We also describe the mechanisms influencing process performance in the MABR and the inter-relationships between these factors. The challenges involved in scaling-up the process are discussed with recommendations for prioritization of research needs...|$|R

M. van Loosdrecht In spite of the large range of morphologies observed for biofilms, there is strong experimental and theoretical evidence that the complex nature of biofilm structure dynamics is primarily {{a consequence of the}} effect of environmental conditions on biofilm development. It has been observed from the operation of industrial and laboratory-scale <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> that the structure of biofilms results from a balance of the detachment forces and the regimen of transport of a growth-limiting substrate. The overall performance of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> is intrinsically dependent on biofilm morphology. The spatial distribution of the diverse dissolved and particulate components through the biofilm matri...|$|R
40|$|Methane would {{potentially}} be an inexpensive, widely available electron donor for denitrification of wastewaters poor in organics. Currently, no methanotrophic microbe {{is known to}} denitrify. However, aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification (AME-D) has been observed in several laboratory studies. In the AME-D process, aerobic methanotrophs oxidise methane and release organic metabolites and lysis products, which are used by coexisting denitrifiers as electron donors for denitrification. Due {{to the presence of}} oxygen, the denitrification efficiency in terms of methane-to-nitrate consumption is usually low. To improve this efficiency the use of a membrane <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> was investigated. The denitrification efficiency of an AME-D culture in (1) a suspended growth reactor, and (2) a membrane <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> was studied. The methane-to-nitrate consumption ratio for the suspended culture was 8. 7. For the membrane-attached culture the ratio was 2. 2. The results clearly indicated that the membrane-attached biofilm was superior to the suspended culture in terms of denitrification efficiency. This study showed that for practical application of the AME-D process, focus should be placed on development of a <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor...</b>|$|R
40|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) {{has been}} used as a common {{gasoline}} additive worldwide since the late twentieth century, and it has become the most frequently detected groundwater pollutant in many countries. This study aimed to synthesize a novel microbial carrier to improve its adsorptive capacity for MTBE and biofilm formation, compared to the traditional granular activated carbon (GAC). A polypyrrole (PPy) -modified GAC composite (PPy/GAC) was synthesized, and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis. The adsorption behaviors of MTBE were well described by the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models. Furthermore, three <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> were established with PPy/GAC, PPy, and GAC as the carriers, respectively, and the degradation of MTBE under continuous flow was investigated. Compared to the <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> with PPy or GAC (which both broke after a period of operation), the PPy/GAC biofilm column produced stable effluents under variable treatment conditions with a long-term effluent MTBE concentration < 20 μg/L. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter pittii may be the predominant bacteria responsible for MTBE degradation in these <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Biofilms are compact, sessile {{microbial}} {{communities that}} attach to surfaces in aqueous environments. In wastewater treatment, they are {{especially important for}} removal of phosphorus and nitrogen, which, if released into a receiving water body, can cause severe eutrophication. Mathematical models of biofilms in wastewater are used to understand the underlying processes and to describe and analyze biofilm development. Although <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> always contain an amount of suspended biomass, this biomass is mostly neglected in mathematical models of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> This thesis is based on four papers which investigate the role of suspended biomass in <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors.</b> A one-dimensional mathematical model of biofilm and suspended biomass in a continuous stirred tank reac-tor is presented and analyzed in the first paper. The underlying model is a hybrid model of chemostat-like mass balances for the substrate and biomass in the reactor, coupled with a free boundary value problem for the substrate in the biofilm. In a single species single substrate setting, stability conditions for washout and persistence are given. It is found that biofilm and suspended biomass are either both present in the reactor or completel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract AQUASIM is a {{computer}} program for the identification and simulation of aquatic systems. The program includes a one-dimensional multisubstrate and multispecies biofilm model and represents a suitable tool for biofilm simulation. The program {{can be used to}} calculate substrate removal in <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> for any user specified microbial system. One-dimensional spatial profiles of substrates and microbial species in the biofilm can be predicted. The program also calculates the development of the biofilm thickness and of the substrates and microbial species in the biofilm and in the bulk fluid over time. Detachment and attachment of microbial cells at the biofilm surface and in the biofilm interior can be considered, and simulations of sloughing events can be performed. Furthermore, AQUASIM allows pseudo two-dimensional modeling of plug flow <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactors</b> by a series of <b>biofilm</b> <b>reactor</b> compartments. The most significant limitation of the model is that it only considers spatial gradients of substrates and microbial species in the biofilm in the direction perpendicular to the substratum.
