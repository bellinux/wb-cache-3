5|$|Potter's weariness with {{depicting}} rabbits {{is reflected}} in the book's pictures. Of the twenty-six illustrations, eight depict Mr. McGregor and seventeen the garden and its structures. There are almost no close-ups of the rabbits and none with the detail found in Benjamin Bunny. When the rabbits are depicted, they are viewed in the <b>middle</b> <b>distance</b> in order to include all six as well as the garden background. They are depicted with little or no facial expression. It is likely Potter (a farm owner at the date of the book's composition) had come to view rabbits as undifferentiated pests rather than individual personalities. Several drawings for the illustrations for The Flopsy Bunnies were given to the British Museum in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited {{except for some}} use of Ordnance Survey maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 {{is accompanied by a}} pair of diagrams showing how a holloway ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks either side of a ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the <b>middle</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Purpose: {{to develop}} and to confirm {{experimentally}} {{the efficiency of the}} program of one-cycle creation of the training process of the qualified runners on <b>middle</b> <b>distances</b> in annual cycle of preparation. Materials & Methods: 40 qualified runners on <b>middle</b> <b>distances</b> took part in the research, 20 of which mainly lived in mountain conditions and 20 – mainly on the plain. The following methods were used during the research: analysis and synthesis of references, analysis of documentary materials, pedagogical observation. Results: the structure of annual macrocycle of training of runners on <b>middle</b> <b>distances</b> with the use of trainings in mountain conditions is presented. Content of mesocycles of preparation, volumes and orientation of training loads at them are directed. Conclusions: the correct and rational connection of means of training of runners on <b>middle</b> <b>distances</b> in mountain conditions and on the plain influences positively the level of preparedness and promotes the professional development of sportsmen...|$|R
